Whenever the President finds that, under the laws of any foreign country, citizens or corporations of the United States are being subjected to discriminatory or extraterritorial taxes, the President shall so proclaim and the rates of tax imposed by sections 1, 3, 11, 802, 821, 831, 852, 871, and 881 shall, for the taxable year during which such proclamation is made and for each taxable year thereafter, be doubled in the case of each citizen and corporation of such foreign country; but the tax at such doubled rate shall be considered as imposed by such sections as the case may be. In no case shall this section operate to increase the taxes imposed by such sections (computed without regard to this section) to an amount in excess of 80 percent of the taxable income of the taxpayer (computed without regard to the deductions allowable under section 151 and under part VIII of subchapter B). Whenever the President finds that the laws of any foreign country with respect to which the President has made a proclamation under the preceding provisions of this section have been modified so that discriminatory and extraterritorial taxes applicable to citizens and corporations of the United States have been removed, he shall so proclaim, and the provisions of this section providing for doubled rates of tax shall not apply to any citizen or corporation of such foreign country with respect to any taxable year beginning after such proclamation is made.

Sec. 1.892-1T  Purpose and scope of regulations (temporary regulations).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. These regulations provide guidance with respect to the taxation of income derived by foreign governments and international organizations from sources within the United States. Under section 892, certain specific types of income received by foreign governments are excluded from gross income and are exempt, unless derived from the conduct of a commercial activity or received from or by a controlled commercial entity. This section sets forth the effective date of the regulations. Section 1.892-2T defines a foreign government. In particular it describes the extent to which either an integral part of a foreign sovereign or an entity which is not an integral part of a foreign sovereign will be treated as a foreign government for purposes of section 892. Section 1.892-3T describes the types of income that generally qualify for exemption and certain limitations on the exemption. Section 1.892-4T provides rules concerning the characterization of activities as commercial activities. Section 1.892-5T defines a controlled commercial entity. Section 1.892-6T sets forth the extent to which income of international organizations from sources within the United States is excluded from gross income and is exempt from taxation. Section 1.892-7T sets forth the relationship of section 892 to other Internal Revenue Code sections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Effective date. The regulations set forth in Sec. Sec. 1.892-1T through 1.892-7T apply to income received by a foreign government on or after July 1, 1986. No amount of income shall be required to be deducted and withheld, by reason of the amendment of section 892 by section 1247 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-514, 100 Stat. 2085, 2583) from any payment made before October 22, 1986.

Sec. 1.892-2T  Foreign government defined (temporary regulations).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Foreign government--(1) Definition. The term ``foreign government'' means only the integral parts or controlled entities of a foreign sovereign.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Integral part. An ``integral part'' of a foreign sovereign is any person, body of persons, organization, agency, bureau, fund, instrumentality, or other body, however designated, that constitutes a governing authority of a foreign country. The net earnings of the governing authority must be credited

to its own account or to other accounts of the foreign sovereign, with no portion inuring to the benefit of any private person. An integral part does not include any individual who is a sovereign, official, or administrator acting in a private or personal capacity. Consideration of all the facts and circumstances will determine whether an individual is acting in a private or personal capacity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Controlled entity. The term ``controlled entity'' means an entity that is separate in form from a foreign sovereign or otherwise constitute a separate juridical entity if it satisfies the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> It is wholly owned and controlled by a foreign sovereign directly or indirectly through one or more controlled entities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> It is organized under the laws of the foreign sovereign by which owned;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Its net earnings are credited to its own account or to other accounts of the foreign sovereign, with no portion of its income inuring to the benefit of any private person; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Its assets vest in the foreign sovereign upon dissolution.

A controlled entity does not include partnerships or any other entity owned and controlled by more than one foreign sovereign. Thus, a foreign financial organization organized and wholly owned and controlled by several foreign sovereigns to foster economic, financial, and technical cooperation between various foreign nations is not a controlled entity for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Inurement to the benefit of private persons. For purposes of this section, income will be presumed not to inure to the benefit of private persons if such persons (within the meaning of section 7701(a)(1)) are the intended beneficiaries of a governmental program which is carried on by the foreign sovereign and the activities of which constitute governmental functions (within the meaning of Sec. 1.892-4T(c)(4)). Income will be considered to inure to the benefit of private persons if such income benefits:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Private persons through the use of a governmental entity as a conduit for personal investment; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Private persons who divert such income from its intended use by the exertion of influence or control through means explicitly or implicitly approved of by the foreign sovereign.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Pension trusts--(1) In general. A controlled entity includes a separately organized pension trust if it meets the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The trust is established exclusively for the benefit of (A) employees or former employees of a foreign government or (B) employees or former employees of a foreign government and non-governmental employees or former employees that perform or performed governmental or social services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The funds that comprise the trust are managed by trustees who are employees of, or persons appointed by, the foreign government;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The trust forming a part of the pension plan provides for retirement, disability, or death benefits in consideration for prior services rendered; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Income of the trust satisfies the obligations of the foreign government to participants under the plan, rather than inuring to the benefit of a private person.

Income of a pension trust is subject to the rules of Sec. 1.892-5T(b)(3) regarding the application of the rules for controlled commercial entities to pension trusts. Income of a superannuation or similar pension fund of an integral part or controlled entity (which is not a separate pension trust as defined in this paragraph (c)(1)) is subject to the rules that generally apply to a foreign sovereign. Such a pension fund may also benefit non-governmental employees or former employees that perform or performed governmental or social services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Illustrations. The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (c)(1).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. The Ministry of Welfare (MW), an integral part of foreign sovereign FC, instituted a retirement plan for FC's employees and former employees. Retirement benefits under the plan are based on a percentage of the final year's salary paid to an individual, times the number of years of government service. Pursuant to the plan, contributions are made by MW to a pension trust managed by persons appointed by MW to the extent actuarially necessary to fund accrued pension liabilities. The pension trust

in turn invests such contributions partially in United States Treasury obligations. The income of the trust is credited to the trust's account and subsequently used to satisfy the pension plan's obligations to retired employees. Under these circumstances, the income of the trust is not deemed to inure to the benefit of private persons. Accordingly, the trust is considered a controlled entity of FC.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the retirement plan also benefits employees performing governmental or social services for the following non-government institutions: (i) A university in a local jurisdiction; (ii) a harbor commission; and (iii) a library system. The retirement benefits under the plan are based on the total amounts credited to an individual's account over the term of his or her employment. MW makes annual contributions to each covered employee's account equal to a percentage of annual compensation. In addition, the income derived from investment of the annual contributions is credited annually to individual accounts. The annual contributions do not exceed an amount that is determined to be actuarially necessary to provide the employee with reasonable retirement benefits. Notwithstanding that retirement benefits vary depending upon the investment experience of the trust, no portion of the income of the trust is deemed to inure to the benefit of private persons. Accordingly, the trust is considered a controlled entity of FC.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that employees are allowed to make unlimited contributions to the trust, and such contributions are credited to the employee's account as well as interest accrued on such contributions. Retirement benefits will reflect the amounts credited to the individual accounts in addition to the usual annuity computation based on the final year's salary and years of service. A pension plan established under these rules is in part acting as an investment conduit. As a result, the income of the trust is deemed to inure to the benefit of private persons. Accordingly, the trust is not considered a controlled entity of FC.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. (a) The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that MW establishes a pension fund rather than a separate pension trust. A pension fund is merely assets of an integral part or controlled entity allocated to a separate account and held and invested for purposes of providing retirement benefits. Under these circumstances, the income of the pension fund is not deemed to inure to the benefit of private persons. Accordingly, income earned from the United States Treasury obligations by the pension fund is considered to be received by a foreign government and is exempt from taxation under section 892.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 4(a), except that MW is a controlled entity of foreign sovereign FC. The result is the same as in Example 4(a). However, should MW engage in commercial activities (whether within or outside the United States), the income from the Treasury obligations earned by the pension fund will not be exempt from taxation under section 892 since MW will be considered a controlled commercial entity within the meaning of Sec. 1.892-5T(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Political subdivision and transnational entity. The rules that apply to a foreign sovereign apply to political subdivisions of a foreign country and to transnational entities. A transnational entity is an organization created by more than one foreign sovereign that has broad powers over external and domestic affairs of all participating foreign countries stretching beyond economic subjects to those concerning legal relations and transcending state or political boundaries.

Sec. 1.892-3T  Income of foreign governments (temporary regulations).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Types of income exempt--(1) In general. Subject to the exceptions contained in Sec. Sec. 1.892-4T and 1.892-5T for income derived from the conduct of a commercial activity or received from or by a controlled commercial entity, the following types of income derived by a foreign government (as defined in Sec. 1.892-2T) are not included in gross income and are exempt:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Income from investments in the United States in stocks, bonds, or other securities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Income from investments in the United States in financial instruments held in the execution of governmental financial or monetary policy; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Interest on deposits in banks in the United States of moneys belonging to such foreign government.

Income derived from sources other than described in this paragraph (such as income earned from a U.S. real property interest described in section 897(c)(1)(A)(i)) is not exempt from taxation under section 892. Furthermore, any gain derived from the disposition a U.S. real property interest defined in section 897(c)(1)(A)(i) shall in no event qualify for exemption under section 892.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Income from investments. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, income from investments in stocks, bonds or other securities includes gain from their disposition and income earned from engaging in section 1058 securities lending transactions. Gain on the disposition of an interest in a partnership or a trust is not exempt from taxation under section 892.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Securities. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the term ``other securities'' includes any note or other evidence of indebtedness. Thus, an annuity contract, a mortgage, a banker's acceptance or a loan are securities for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0">However, the term ``other securities'' does not include partnership interests (with the exception of publicly traded partnerships within the meaning of section 7704) or trust interests. The term also does not include commodity forward or futures contracts and commodity options unless they constitute securities for purposes of section 864(b)(2)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Financial instrument. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the term ``financial instrument'' includes any forward, futures, options contract, swap agreement or similar instrument in a functional or nonfunctional currency (see section 985(b) for the definition of functional currency) or in precious metals when held by a foreign government or central bank of issue (as defined in Sec. 1.895-1(b)). Nonfunctional currency or gold shall be considered a ``financial instrument'' also when physically held by a central bank of issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Execution of financial or monetary policy--(i) Rule. A financial instrument shall be deemed held in the execution of governmental financial or monetary policy if the primary purpose for holding the instrument is to implement or effectuate such policy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Illustration. The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (a)(5).</p><p class="depth0">Example. In order to ensure sufficient currency reserves, the monetary authority of foreign country FC issues short-term government obligations. The amount received from the obligations is invested in U.S. financial instruments. Since the primary purpose for obtaining the U.S. financial instruments is to implement FC's monetary policy, the income received from the financial instruments is exempt from taxation under section 892.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Illustrations. The principles of paragraph (a) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. X, a foreign corporation not engaged in commercial activity anywhere in the world, is a controlled entity of a foreign sovereign within the meaning of Sec. 1.892-2T(a)(3). X is not a Central bank of issue as defined in Sec. 1.895-1(b). In 1987, X received the following items of income from investments in the United States: (i) Dividends from a portfolio of publicly traded stocks in U.S. corporations in which X owns less than 50 percent of the stock; (ii) dividends from BTB Corporation, an automobile manufacturer, in which X owns 50 percent of the stock; (iii) interest from bonds issued by noncontrolled entities and from interest-bearing bank deposits in noncontrolled entities; (iv) rents from a net lease on real property; (v) gains from silver futures contracts; (vi) gains from wheat futures contracts; (vii) gains from spot sales of nonfunctional foreign currency in X's possession; (viii) gains from the disposition of a publicly traded partnership interest, and (ix) gains from the disposition of the stock of Z Corporation, a United States real property holding company as defined in section 897, of which X owns 12 percent of the stock. Only income derived from sources described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is treated as income of a foreign government eligible for exemption from taxation. Accordingly, only income received by X from items (i), (iii), (v) provided that the silver futures contracts are held in the execution of governmental financial or monetary policy,

and (ix) is exempt from taxation under section 892.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that X is also a central bank of issue within the meaning of section 895. Since physical possession of nonfunctional foreign currency when held by a central bank of issue is considered a financial instrument, the item (vii) gains from spot sales of nonfunctional foreign currency are exempt from taxation under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if physical possession of the currency was an essential part of X's reserve policy in the execution of its governmental financial or monetary policy.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. State Concert Bureau, an integral part of a foreign sovereign within the meaning of Sec. 1.892-2T(a)(2), entered into an agreement with a U.S. corporation engaged in the business of promoting international cultural programs. Under the agreement the State Concert Bureau agreed to send a ballet troupe on tour for 5 weeks in the United States. The Bureau received approximately $60,000 from the performances. Regardless of whether the performances themselves constitute commercial activities under Sec. 1.892-4T, the income received by the Bureau is not exempt from taxation under section 892 since the income is from sources other than described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
[T.D. 8211, 53 FR 24062, June 27, 1988]


Sec. 1.892-4T  Commercial activities (temporary regulations).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The exemption generally applicable to a foreign government (as defined in Sec. 1.892-2T) for income described in Sec. 1.892-3T does not apply to income derived from the conduct of a commercial activity or income received by a controlled commercial entity or received (directly or indirectly) from a controlled commercial entity. This section provides rules for determining whether income is derived from the conduct of a commercial activity. These rules also apply in determining under Sec. 1.892-5T whether an entity is a controlled commercial entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, all activities (whether conducted within or outside the United States) which are ordinarily conducted by the taxpayer or by other persons with a view towards the current or future production of income or gain are commercial activities. An activity may be considered a commercial activity even if such activity does not constitute the conduct of a trade or business in the United States under section 864(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Activities that are not commercial--(1) Investments--(i) In general. Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph (c)(1), the following are not commercial activities: Investments in stocks, bonds, and other securities; loans; investments in financial instruments held in the execution of governmental financial or monetary policy; the holding of net leases on real property or land which is not producing income (other than on its sale or from an investment in net leases on real property); and the holding of bank deposits in banks. Transferring securities under a loan agreement which meets the requirements of section 1058 is an investment for purposes of this paragraph (c)(1)(i). An activity will not cease to be an investment solely because of the volume of transactions of that activity or because of other unrelated activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Trading. Effecting transactions in stocks, securities, or commodities for a foreign government's own account does not constitute a commercial activity regardless of whether such activities constitute a trade or business for purposes of section 162 or a U.S. trade or business for purposes of section 864. Such transactions are not commercial activities regardless of whether they are effected by the foreign government through its employees or through a broker, commission agent, custodian, or other independent agent and regardless of whether or not any such employee or agent has discretionary authority to make decisions in effecting the transactions. An activity undertaken as a dealer, however, as defined in Sec. 1.864-2(c)(2)(iv)(a) will not be an investment for purposes of this paragraph (c)(1)(i). For purposes of this paragraph (c)(1)(ii), the term ``commodities'' means commodities of a kind customarily dealt in on an organized commodity exchange but only if the transaction is of a kind customarily consummated at such place.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Banking, financing, etc. Investments (including loans) made by a banking, financing, or similar business constitute commercial activities, even if the income derived from such investments is not considered to be income

effectively connected to the active conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business in the U.S. by reason of the application of Sec. 1.864-4(c)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cultural events. Performances and exhibitions within or outside the United States of amateur athletic events and events devoted to the promotion of the arts by cultural organizations are not commercial activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Non-profit activities. Activities that are not customarily attributable to or carried on by private enterprise for profit are not commercial activities. The fact that in some instances Federal, State, or local governments of the United States also are engaged in the same or similar activity does not mean necessarily that it is a non-profit activity. For example, even though the United States Government may be engaged in the activity of operating a railroad, operating a railroad is not a non-profit activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Governmental functions. Governmental functions are not commercial activities. The term ``governmental functions'' shall be determined under U.S. standards. In general, activities performed for the general public with respect to the common welfare or which relate to the administration of some phase of government will be considered governmental functions. For example, the operation of libraries, toll bridges, or local transportation services and activities substantially equivalent to the Federal Aviation Authority, Interstate Commerce Commission, or United States Postal Service will all be considered governmental functions for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Purchasing. The mere purchasing of goods for the use of a foreign government is not a commercial activity.

Sec. 1.892-5T  Controlled commercial entity (temporary regulations).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. The exemption generally applicable to a foreign government (as defined in Sec. 1.892-2T) for income described in Sec. 1.892-3T does not apply to income received by a controlled commercial entity or received (directly or indirectly) from a controlled commercial entity. The term ``controlled commercial entity'' means any entity engaged in commercial activities as defined in Sec. 1.892-4T (whether conducted within or outside the United States) if the government--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Holds (directly or indirectly) any interest in such entity which (by value or voting power) is 50 percent or more of the total of such interests in such entity, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Holds (directly or indirectly) a sufficient interest (by value or voting power) or any other interest in such entity which provides the foreign government with effective practical control of such entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> [Reserved]. For further information, see Sec. 1.892-5(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Entities treated as engaged in commercial activity--(1) U.S. real property holding corporations. A United States real property holding corporation, as defined in section 897(c)(2) or a foreign corporation that would be a United States real property holding corporation if it was a United States corporation, shall be treated as engaged in commercial activity and, therefore, is a controlled commercial entity if the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Central banks. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a central bank of issue (as defined in Sec. 1.895-1(b)) shall be treated as a controlled commercial entity only if it engages in commercial activities within the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Pension trusts. A pension trust, described in Sec. 1.892-2T(c), which engages in commercial activities within or outside the United States, shall be treated

as a controlled commercial entity. Income derived by such a pension trust is not income of a foreign government for purposes of the exemption from taxation provided in section 892. A pension trust described in Sec. 1.892-2T(c) shall not be treated as a controlled commercial entity if such trust solely earns income which would not be unrelated business taxable income (as defined in section 512(a)(1)) if the trust were a qualified trust described in section 401(a). However, only income derived by a pension trust that is described in Sec. 1.892-3T and which is not from commercial activities as defined in Sec. 1.892-4T is exempt from taxation under section 892.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Control--(1) Attribution--(i) Rule. In determining for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section the interest held by a foreign government, any interest in an entity (whether or not engaged in commercial activity) owned directly or indirectly by an integral part or controlled entity of a foreign sovereign shall be treated as actually owned by such foreign sovereign.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Illustration. The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example. FX, a controlled entity of foreign sovereign FC, owns 20 percent of the stock of Corp 1. Neither FX nor Corp 1 is engaged in commercial activity anywhere in the world. Corp 1 owns 60 percent of the stock of Corp 2, which is engaged in commercial activity. The remaining 40 percent of Corp 2's stock is owned by Bureau, an integral part of foreign sovereign FC. For purposes of determining whether Corp 2 is a controlled commercial entity of FC, Bureau will be treated as actually owning the 12 percent of Corp 2's stock indirectly owned by FX. Therefore, since Bureau directly and indirectly owns 52 percent of the stock of Corp 2, Corp 2 is a controlled commercial entity of FC within the meaning of paragraph (a) of this section. Accordingly, dividends or other income received, directly or indirectly, from Corp 2 by either Bureau or FX will not be exempt from taxation under section 892. Furthermore, dividends from Corp 1 to the extent attributable to dividends from Corp 2 will not be exempt from taxation. Thus, a distribution from Corp 1 to FX shall be exempt only to the extent such distribution exceeds Corp 1's earnings and profits attributable to the Corp 2 dividend amount received by Corp 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effective practical control. An entity engaged in commercial activity may be treated as a controlled commercial entity if a foreign government holds sufficient interests in such entity to give it ``effective practical control'' over the entity. Effective practical control may be achieved through a minority interest which is sufficiently large to achieve effective control, or through creditor, contractual, or regulatory relationships which, together with ownership interests held by the foreign government, achieve effective control. For example, an entity engaged in commercial activity may be treated as a controlled commercial entity if a foreign government, in addition to holding a small minority interest (by value or voting power), is also a substantial creditor of the entity or controls a strategic natural resource which such entity uses in the conduct of its trade or business, giving the foreign government effective practical control over the entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Related controlled entities--(1) Brother/sister entities. Commercial activities of a controlled entity are not attributed to such entity's other brother/sister related entities. Thus, investment income described in Sec. 1.892-2T that is derived by a controlled entity that is not itself engaged in commercial activity within or outside the United States is exempt from taxation notwithstanding the fact that such entity's brother/sister related entity is a controlled commercial entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Parent/subsidiary entities--(i) Subsidiary to parent attribution. Commercial activities of a subsidiary controlled entity are not attributed to its parent. Thus, investment income described in Sec. 1.892-3T that is derived by a parent controlled entity that is not itself engaged in commercial activity within or outside the United States is exempt from taxation notwithstanding the fact that its subsidiary is a controlled commercial entity. Dividends or other payments of income received by the parent controlled entity from the subsidiary are not exempt under section 892, because it constitutes income received from a controlled commercial entity. Furthermore, dividends paid by the parent are not exempt to the extent attributable to the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiary. Thus, a distribution by the

parent shall be exempt only to the extent such distribution exceeds earnings and profits attributable to the dividend received from its subsidiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Parent to subsidiary attribution. Commercial activities of a parent controlled entity are attributed to its subsidiary. Thus, investment income described in Sec. 1.892-3T that is derived by a subsidiary controlled entity (not engaged in commercial activity within or outside the United States) is not exempt from taxation under section 892 if its parent is a controlled commercial entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Partnerships. Except for partners of publicly traded partnerships, commercial activities of a partnership are attributable to its general and limited partners for purposes of section 892. For example, where a controlled entity is a general partner in a partnership engaged in commercial activities, the controlled entity's distributive share of partnership income (including income described in Sec. 1.892-3T) will not be exempt from taxation under section 892.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Illustrations. The principles of this section may be illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. (a) The Ministry of Industry and Development is an integral part of a foreign sovereign under Sec. 1.892-2T(a)(2). The Ministry is engaged in commercial activity within the United States. In addition, the Ministry receives income from various publicly traded stocks and bonds, soybean futures contracts and net leases on U.S. real property. Since the Ministry is an integral part, and not a controlled entity, of a foreign sovereign, it is not a controlled commercial entity within the meaning of paragraph (a) of this section. Therefore, income described in Sec. 1.892-3T is ineligible for exemption under section 892 only to the extent derived from the conduct of commercial activities. Accordingly, the Ministry's income from the stocks and bonds is exempt from U.S. tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The facts are the same as in Example (1)(a), except that the Ministry also owns 75 percent of the stock of R, a U.S. holding company that owns all the stock of S, a U.S. operating company engaged in commercial activity. Ministry's dividend income from R is income received indirectly from a controlled commercial entity. The Ministry's income from the stocks and bonds, with the exception of dividend income from R, is exempt from U.S. tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The facts are the same as in Example (1)(a), except that the Ministry is a controlled entity of a foreign sovereign. Since the Ministry is a controlled entity and is engaged in commercial activity, it is a controlled commercial entity within the meaning of paragraph (a) of this section, and none of its income is eligible for exemption.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. (a) Z, a controlled entity of a foreign sovereign, has established a pension trust as part of a pension plan for the benefit of its employees and former employees. The pension trust (T), which meets the requirements of Sec. 1.892-2T(c), has investments in the U.S. in various stocks, bonds, annuity contracts, and a shopping center which is leased and managed by an independent real estate management firm. T also makes securities loans in transactions that qualify under section 1058. T's investment in the shopping center is not considered an unrelated trade or business within the meaning of section 513(b). Accordingly, T will not be treated as engaged in commercial activity. Since T is not a controlled commercial entity, its investment income described in Sec. 1.892-3T, with the exception of income received from the operations of the shopping center, is exempt from taxation under section 892.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The facts are the same as Example (2)(a), except that T has an interest in a limited partnership which owns the shopping center. The shopping center is leased and managed by the partnership rather than by an independent management firm. Managing a shopping center, directly or indirectly through a partnership of which a trust is a member, would be considered an unrelated trade or business within the meaning of section 513(b) giving rise to unrelated business taxable income. Since the commercial activities of a partnership are attributable to its partners, T will be treated as engaged in commercial activity and thus will be considered a controlled commercial entity. Accordingly, none of T's income will be exempt from taxation under section 892.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The facts are the same as Example (2)(a), except that Z is a controlled commercial entity. The result is the same as in Example (2)(a).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. (a) The Department of Interior, an integral part of foreign sovereign FC, wholly owns corporations G and H. G, in turn, wholly owns S. G, H and S are each controlled entities. G, which is not engaged in commercial activity anywhere in the world, receives interest income from deposits in banks in the United States. Both H and S do not have any investments in the U.S. but are both engaged in commercial activities. However, only S is engaged in commercial activities within the United States. Because neither the commercial activities of H nor the commercial activities of S are attributable to the Department of Interior or G, G's interest income is exempt from taxation under section 892.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The facts are the same as Example (3)(a), except that G rather than S is engaged

in commercial activities and S rather than G receives the interest income from the United States. Since the commercial activities of G are attributable to S, S's interest income is not exempt from taxation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. (a) K, a controlled entity of a foreign sovereign, is a general partner in the Daj partnership. The Daj partnership has investments in the U.S. in various stocks and bonds and also owns and manages an office building in New York. K will be deemed to be engaged in commercial activity by being a general partner in Daj even if K does not actually make management decisions with regard to the partnership's commercial activity, the operation of the office building. Accordingly K's distributive share of partnership income (including income derived from stocks and bonds) will not be exempt from taxation under section 892.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The facts are the same as in Example (4)(a), except that the Daj partnership has hired a real estate management firm to lease offices and manage the building. Notwithstanding the fact that an independent contractor is performing the activities, the partnership shall still be deemed to be engaged in commercial activity. Accordingly, K's distributive share of partnership income (including income derived from stocks and bonds) will not be exempt from taxation under section 892.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The facts are the same as in Example (4)(a), except that K is a partner whose partnership interest is considered a publicly traded partnership interest within the meaning of section 7704. Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the partnership's commercial activity will not be attributed to K. Since K will not be deemed to be engaged in commercial activity, K's distributive share of partnership income derived from stocks and bonds will be exempt from taxation under section 892.

Sec. 1.893-1  Compensation of employees of foreign governments or international organizations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Employees of foreign governments--(1) Exempt from tax. Except to the extent that the exemption is limited by the execution and filing of the waiver provided for in section 247(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1257(b)), all employees of a foreign government (including consular or other officers, or nondiplomatic representatives) who are not citizens of the United States, or are citizens of the Republic of the Philippines (whether or not citizens of the United States), are exempt from Federal income tax with respect to wages, fees, or salaries received by them as compensation for official services rendered to such foreign government, provided (i) the services are of a character similar to those performed by employees of the Government of the United States in that foreign country and (ii) the foreign government whose employees are claiming exemption grants an equivalent exemption to employees of the Government of the United States performing similar services in that foreign country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Certificate by Secretary of State. Section 893(b) provides that the Secretary of State shall certify to the Secretary of the Treasury the names of the foreign countries which grant an equivalent exemption to the employees of the Government of the United States performing services in such foreign countries, and the character of the services performed by employees of the Government of the United States in foreign countries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Items not exempt. The income received by employees of foreign governments from sources other than their salaries, fees, or wages, referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, is subject to Federal income tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Immigration and Nationality Act. Section 247(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act provides as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Sec. 247. Adjustment of status of certain resident aliens.* * *</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The adjustment of status required by subsection (a) [of section 247 of the Immigration and Nationality Act] shall not be applicable in the case of any alien who requests that he be permitted to retain his status as an immigrant and who, in such form as the Attorney General may require, executes and files with the Attorney General a written waiver of all rights, privileges, exemptions, and immunities under any law or any executive order which would otherwise accrue to him because of the acquisition of an occupational status entitling him to a nonimmigrant status under paragraph (15)(A), (15)(E), or (15)(G) of section 101(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Effect of waiver. An employee of a foreign government who executes and files with the Attorney General the waiver provided for in section 247(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act thereby waives the exemption conferred by section 893 of the Code. As a consequence, that exemption does not apply to income received by that alien after the date of filing of the waiver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Citizens of the United States. The compensation of citizens of the United States (other than those who are also citizens of the Republic of the Philippines) who are officers or employees of a foreign government is not exempt from income tax pursuant to this paragraph.

Except to the extent that the exemption is limited by the execution and filing of the waiver provided for in section 247(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act and subject to the provisions of sections 1, 8, and 9 of the International Organizations Immunities Act (22 U.S.C. 288, 288e, 288f), wages, fees, or salary of any officer or employee of an international organization (as defined in section 7701(a)(18)) received as compensation for official services to that international organization is exempt from Federal income tax, if that officer or employee (i) is not a citizen of the United States or (ii) is a citizen of the Republic of the Philippines (whether or not a citizen of the United States).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Income earned prior to executive action. An individual of the prescribed class who receives wages, fees, or salary as compensation for official services to an organization designated by

The President shall be authorized, in the light of the functions performed by any such international organization, by appropriate Executive order to withhold or withdraw from any such organization or its officers or employees any of the privileges, exemptions, and immunities provided for in this title (including the amendments made by this title) or to condition or limit the enjoyment by any such organization or its officers or employees of any such privilege, exemption, or immunity. The President shall be authorized, if in his judgment such action should be justified by reason of the abuse by an international organization or its officers and employees of the privileges, exemptions, and immunities herein provided or for any other reason, at any time to revoke the designation of any international organization under this section, whereupon the international organization in question shall cease to be classed as an international organization for the purposes of this title.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">Sec. 8.

An officer or employee of an international organization who executes and files with the Attorney General the waiver provided for in section 247(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1257(b)) thereby waives the exemption conferred by

section 893 of the Code. As a consequence, that exemption does not apply to income received by that individual after the date of filing of the waiver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Citizens of the United States. The compensation of citizens of the United States (other than those who are also citizens of the Republic of the Philippines) who are officers or employees of an international organization is not exempt from income tax pursuant to this paragraph. But see section 911 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Tax conventions, consular conventions, and international agreements--(1) Exemption dependent upon internal revenue laws. A tax convention or consular convention between the United States and a foreign country, which provides that the United States may include in the tax base of its residents all income taxable under the internal revenue laws, and which makes no specific exception for the income of the employees of that foreign government, does not provide any exemption (with respect to residents of the United States) beyond that which is provided by the internal revenue laws. Accordingly, the effect of the execution and filing of a waiver under section 247(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act by an employee of a foreign government which is a party to such a convention is to subject the employee to tax to the same extent as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section with respect to the waiver of exemption under section 893.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exemption not dependent upon internal revenue laws. If a tax convention, consular convention, or international agreement provides that compensation paid by the foreign government or international organization to its employees is exempt from Federal income tax, and the application of this exemption is not dependent upon the provisions of the internal revenue laws, the exemption so conferred is not affected by the execution and filing of a waiver under section 247(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. For examples of exemptions which are not affected by the Immigration and Nationality Act, see article X of the income tax convention between the United States and the United Kingdom (60 Stat. 1383); article IX, section 9(b), of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (60 Stat. 1414); and article VII, section 9(b), of the Articles of Agreement of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (60 Stat. 1458).


Sec. 1.894-1  Income affected by treaty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Income exempt under treaty. Income of any kind is not included in gross income and is exempt from tax under Subtitle A (relating to income taxes), to the extent required by any income tax convention to which the United States is a party. However, unless otherwise provided by an income tax convention, the exclusion from gross income under section 894(a) and this paragraph does not apply in determining the accumulated taxable income of a foreign corporation under section 535 and the regulations thereunder or the undistributed personal holding company income of a foreign corporation under section 545 and the regulations thereunder. Moreover, the distributable net income of a foreign trust is determined without regard to section 894 and this paragraph, to the extent provided by section 643(a)(6)(B). Further, the compensating tax adjustment required by section 819(a)(3) in the case of a foreign life insurance company is to be determined without regard to section 894 and this paragraph, to the extent required by section 819(a)(3)(A). See Sec. 1.871-12 for the manner of determining the tax liability of a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation whose gross income includes income on which the tax is reduced under a tax convention.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Taxpayer treated as having no permanent establishment in the United States--(1) In general. A nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation, that is engaged in trade or business in the United States through a permanent establishment located therein at any time during a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1966, shall be deemed not to have a permanent establishment in the United States at any time during that year for purposes of applying any exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, any tax under Subtitle A of the Code which is provided by any income tax convention with respect to income which is

not effectively connected for that year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by the taxpayer. This paragraph applies to all treaties or conventions entered into by the United States, whether entered into before, on, or after November 13, 1966, the date of enactment of the Foreign Investors Tax Act of 1966 (80 Stat. 1539). This paragraph is not considered to be contrary to any obligation of the United States under an income tax convention to which it is a party. The benefit granted under section 894(b) and this paragraph applies only to those items of income derived from sources within the United States which are subject to the tax imposed by section 871(a) or 881(a), and section 1441, 1442, or 1451, on the noneffectively connected income received from sources within the United States by a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation. The benefit does not apply to any income from real property in respect of which an election is in effect for the taxable year under Sec. 1.871-10 or in determining under section 877(b) the tax of a nonresident alien individual who has lost United States citizenship at any time after March 8, 1965. The benefit granted by section 894(b) and this paragraph is not elective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Illustrations. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. M, a corporation organized in foreign country X, uses the calendar year as the taxable year. The United States and country X are parties to an income tax convention which provides in part that dividends received from sources within the United States by a corporation of country X not having a permanent establishment in the United States are subject to tax under Chapter 1 of the Code at a rate not to exceed 15 percent. During 1967, M is engaged in business in the United States through a permanent establishment located therein and receives $100,000 in dividends from domestic corporation B, which under section 861(a)(2)(A) constitute income from sources within the United States. Under section 864(c)(2) and Sec. 1.864-4(c), the dividends received from B are not effectively connected for 1967 with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by M. Although M has a permanent establishment in the United States during 1967, it is deemed, under section 894(b) and this paragraph, not to have a permanent establishment in the United States during that year with respect to the dividends. Accordingly, in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of Sec. 1.871-12 the tax on the dividends is $15,000, that is, 15 percent of $100,000, determined without the allowance of any deductions.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. T, a corporation organized in foreign country X, uses the calendar year as the taxable year. The United States and country X are parties to an income tax convention which provides in part that an enterprise of country X is not subject to tax under chapter 1 of the Code in respect of its industrial or commercial profits unless it is engaged in trade or business in the United States during the taxable year through a permanent establishment located therein and that, if it is so engaged, the tax may be imposed upon the entire income of that enterprise from sources within the United States. The convention also provides that the tax imposed by Chapter 1 of the Code on dividends received from sources within the United States by a corporation of X which is not engaged in trade or business in the United States through a permanent establishment located therein shall not exceed 15 percent of the dividend. During 1967, T is engaged in a business (business A) in the United States which is carried on through a permanent establishment in the United States; in addition, T is engaged in a business (business B) in the United States which is not carried on through a permanent establishment. During 1967, T receives from sources within the United States $60,000 in service fees through the operation of business A and $10,000 in dividends through the operation of business B, both of which amounts are, under section 864(c)(2)(B) and Sec. 1.864-4(c)(3), effectively connected for that year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that corporation. The service fees are considered to be industrial or commercial profits under the tax convention with country X. Since T has no income for 1967 which is not effectively connected for that year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that corporation, section 894(b), this paragraph, and Sec. 1.871-12 do not apply. Accordingly, for 1967 T's entire income of $70,000 from sources within the United States is subject to tax, after allowance of deductions, in accordance with section 882(a)(1) and paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 1.882-1.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. S, a corporation organized in foreign country W, uses the calendar year as the taxable year.

imposed upon the entire income of that corporation from sources within the United States. The convention also provides that the tax imposed by Chapter 1 of the Code on dividends received from sources within the United States by a corporation of country W which is not engaged in trade or business in the United States through a permanent establishment located therein shall not exceed 15 percent of the dividend. During 1967, S is engaged in business in the United States through a permanent establishment located therein and derives from sources within the United States $100,000 in service fees which, under section 864(c)(2)(B) and Sec. 1.864-4(c)(3), are effectively connected for that year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by S and which are considered to be industrial or commercial profits under the tax convention with country W. During 1967, S also derives from sources within the United States, through another business it carries on in foreign country X, $10,000 in sales income which, under section 864(c)(3) and Sec. 1.864-4(b), is effectively connected for that year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by S and $5,000 in dividends which, under section 864(c)(2)(A) and Sec. 1.864-4(c)(2), are not effectively connected for that year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by S. The sales income is considered to be industrial or commercial profits under the tax convention with country W. Although S is engaged in a trade or business in the United States during 1967 through a permanent establishment located therein, it is deemed, under section 894(b) and this paragraph, not to have a permanent establishment therein with respect to the $5,000 in dividends. Accordingly, in accordance with paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.871-12, for 1967 S is subject to a tax of $750 on the dividends ($5,000 x .15) and a tax, determined under section 882(a) and Sec. 1.882-1, on its $110,000 industrial or commercial profits.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4.

The tax convention also provides that if a corporation of country Z is engaged in industrial or commercial activity in the United States through a permanent establishment in the United States, income tax may be imposed by the United States on so much of the industrial or commercial profits of such corporation as are attributable to the permanent establishment in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> During 1967, N is engaged in a business (business A) in the United States which is not carried on through a permanent establishment in the United States. In addition, N has a permanent establishment in the United States through which it carries on another business (business B) in the United States. During 1967, N holds shares of stock in domestic corporation D which are not effectively connected with N's permanent establishment in the United States. During 1967, N receives $100,000 in dividends from D which, pursuant to section 864(c)(2)(A) and Sec. 1.864-4(c)(2), are effectively connected for that year with the conduct of business A. Under section 861(a)(2)(A) these dividends are treated as income from sources within the United States. In addition, during 1967, N receives from sources within the United States $150,000 in sales income which, pursuant to section 864(c)(3) and Sec. 1.864-4(b), is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and which is considered to be industrial or commercial profits under the tax convention with country Z. Of these total profits, $70,000 is from business A and $80,000 is from business B. Only the $80,000 of industrial or commercial profits is attributable to N's permanent establishment in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Since N has no income for 1967 which is not effectively connected for that year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that corporation, section 894(b) and this paragraph do not apply. However, N is entitled to the reduced rate of tax under the tax convention with country Z with respect to the dividends because the shares of stock are not effectively connected with N's permanent establishment in the United States. Accordingly, assuming that there are no deductions connected with N's industrial or commercial profits, the tax for 1967, determined as provided in paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.871-12, is $46,900 as follows:

M, a corporation organized in foreign country Z, uses the calendar year as the taxable year. The United States and country Z are parties to an income tax convention which provides in part that a corporation of country Z is not subject to tax under Chapter 1 of the Code in respect of its commercial and industrial profits except such profits as are allocable to its permanent

establishment in the United States. The regulations in this chapter under the tax convention with country Z provide that a corporation of country Z having a permanent establishment in the United States is subject to U.S. tax upon its industrial and commercial profits from sources within the United States and that its industrial and commercial profits from such sources are deemed to be allocable to the permanent establishment in the United States. During 1967, M is engaged in a business (business A) in the United States which is carried on through a permanent establishment in the United States; in addition, M is engaged in a business (business B) in foreign country X and none of such business is carried on in the United States. During 1967, M receives from sources within the United States $40,000 in sales income through the operation of business A and $10,000 in sales income through the operation of business B, both of which amounts are, under section 864(c)(3) and Sec. 1.864-4(b), effectively connected for that year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that corporation. The sales income is considered to be industrial and commercial profits under the tax convention with country Z. Since M has no income for 1967 which is not effectively connected for that year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that corporation, section 894(b) and this paragraph do not apply. Accordingly, for 1967 M's entire income of $50,000 from sources within the United States is subject to tax, after allowance of deductions, in accordance with section 882(a)(1) and paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 1.882-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(1)</em> Substitute interest and dividend payments.

The tax imposed by sections 871(a), 881(a), 1443, 1461, and 4948(a) on an item of income received by an entity, wherever organized, that is fiscally transparent under the laws of the United States and/or any other jurisdiction with respect to an item of income shall be eligible for reduction under the terms of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party only if the item of income is derived by a resident of the applicable treaty jurisdiction. For this purpose, an item of income may be derived by either the entity receiving the item of income or by the interest holders in the entity or, in certain circumstances, both. An item of income paid to an entity shall be considered to be derived by the entity only if the entity is not fiscally transparent under the laws of the entity's jurisdiction, as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, with respect to the item of income. An item of income paid to an entity shall be considered to be derived by the interest holder in the entity only if the interest holder is not fiscally transparent in its jurisdiction with respect to the item of income and if the entity is considered to be fiscally transparent under the laws of the interest holder's jurisdiction with respect to the item of income, as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section.

An income tax treaty may not apply to reduce the amount of federal income tax on U.S. source payments received by a domestic reverse hybrid entity. Further, notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the foreign interest holders of a domestic reverse hybrid entity are not entitled to the benefits of a reduction of U.S. income tax under an income tax treaty on items of income received from U.S. sources by such entity. A domestic reverse hybrid entity is a domestic entity that is treated as not fiscally transparent for U.S. tax purposes and as fiscally transparent under the laws of the interest holder's jurisdiction, with respect to the item of income received by the domestic entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Payments by domestic reverse hybrid entities--(A) General rule.

In determining whether the interest holder is fiscally transparent with respect to the item of income under this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A), the determination under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section shall be made based on the treatment that would have resulted had the item of income been paid by an entity that is not fiscally transparent under the laws of the interest holder's jurisdiction with respect to any item of income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Payment made to related foreign interest holder--(1) General rule.

For purposes of determining whether a person is related by reason of the ownership requirements of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1), the constructive ownership rules of section 318 shall apply, and the attribution rules of section 267(c) also shall apply to the extent they attribute ownership to persons to whom section 318 does not attribute ownership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Payments to persons not described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(1)(ii)--(1) Related persons.

The rules of this paragraph (d)(2) are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Dividend paid by unrelated entity to domestic reverse hybrid entity. (i) Facts. Entity A is a domestic reverse hybrid entity, as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, with respect to the U.S. source dividends it receives from B, a domestic corporation to which A is not related within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(4) of this section. A's 85-percent shareholder, FC, is a corporation organized under the laws of Country X, which has an income tax treaty in effect with the United States. A's remaining 15-percent shareholder is an unrelated domestic corporation. Under Country X law, FC is not fiscally transparent with respect to the dividend, as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. In year 1, A receives $100 of dividend income from B. Under Country X law, FC is treated as deriving $85 of the $100 dividend payment received by A. The applicable rate of tax on dividends under the U.S.-Country X income tax treaty is 5 percent with respect to a 10-percent or more corporate shareholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, the U.S.-Country X income tax treaty does not apply to the dividend income received by A because the payment is made by B, a domestic corporation, to A, another domestic corporation. A remains fully taxable under the U.S. tax laws as a domestic corporation with regard to that item of income. Further, pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, notwithstanding the fact that A is treated as fiscally transparent with respect to the dividend income under the laws of Country X, FC may not claim a reduced rate of taxation on its share of the U.S. source dividend income received by A.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Interest paid by domestic reverse hybrid entity to related foreign interest holder where dividend is paid by unrelated entity. (i) Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 1. Both the United States and Country X characterize the payment by B in year 1 as a dividend. In addition, in year 2, A makes a payment of $25 to FC that is characterized under the Internal Revenue Code as interest on a loan from FC to A. Under the U.S.-Country X income tax treaty, the rate of tax on interest is zero. Under Country X laws, had the interest been paid by an entity that is not fiscally transparent under Country X's laws with respect to any item of income, FC would not be fiscally transparent as defined

in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section with respect to the interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The analysis is the same as in Example 1 with respect to the $100 payment from B to A. With respect to the $25 payment from A to FC, paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section will not apply because, although FC is a related foreign interest holder in A, A is not related to B, the payor of the dividend income it received. Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the $25 of interest paid by A to FC in year 2 is characterized under U.S. law as interest. Accordingly, in year 2, A is entitled to an interest deduction with respect to the $25 interest payment from A to FC, and FC is entitled to the reduced rate of withholding applicable to interest under the U.S.-Country X income tax treaty, assuming all other requirements for claiming treaty benefits are met.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Interest paid by domestic reverse hybrid entity to related foreign interest holder where dividend is paid by a related entity. (i) Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 2, except the $100 dividend income received by A in year 1 is from A's wholly-owned subsidiary, S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The analysis is the same as in Example 1 with respect to the $100 dividend payment from S to A. However, the $25 interest payment in year 2 by A to FC will be treated as a dividend for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code and the U.S.-Country X income tax treaty because $25 does not exceed FC's share of the $100 dividend payment made by S to A ($85). Since FC is not fiscally transparent with respect to the payment as determined under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, FC is entitled to the reduced rate applicable to dividends under the U.S.-Country X income tax treaty with respect to the $25 payment. Because the $25 payment in year 2 is recharacterized as a dividend for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code and the U.S.-Country X income tax treaty, A is not entitled to an interest deduction with respect to that payment and FC is not entitled to claim the reduced rate of withholding applicable to interest.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Definition of related foreign interest holder. (i) Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that A has two 50-percent shareholders, FC1 and FC2. In year 2, A makes an interest payment of $25 to both FC1 and FC2. FC1 is a corporation organized under the laws of Country X, which has an income tax treaty in effect with the United States. FC2 is a corporation organized under the laws of Country Y, which also has an income tax treaty in effect with the United States. FP owns 100-percent of both FC1 and FC2, and is organized under the laws of Country X. Under Country X law, FC1 is not fiscally transparent with respect to the dividend, as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. Under Country X law, FC1 is treated as deriving $50 of the $100 dividend payment received by A because A is fiscally transparent under the laws of Country X, as determined under paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section. The applicable rate of tax on dividends under the U.S.-Country X income tax treaty is 5-percent with respect to a 10-percent or more corporate shareholder. Under Country Y law, FC2 is not treated as deriving any of the $100 dividend payment received by A because, under the laws of Country Y, A is not a fiscally transparent entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The analysis is the same as in Example 1 with respect to the $100 dividend payment from S to A. With respect to the $25 payment in year 2 by A to FC1, the payment will be treated as a dividend for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code and the U.S.-Country X income tax treaty because FC1 is a related foreign interest holder as determined under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(4) of this section, and because $25 does not exceed FC1's share of the dividend payment made by S to A ($50). FC1 is a related foreign interest holder because FC1 is treated as owning the stock of A owned by FC2 under section 267(b)(3). Since FC1 is not fiscally transparent with respect to the payment as determined under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, FC1 is entitled to the 5-percent reduced rate applicable to dividends under the U.S.-Country X income tax treaty with respect to the $25 payment. Because the $25 payment in year 2 is recharacterized as a dividend for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code and the U.S.-Country X income tax treaty, A is not entitled to an interest deduction with respect to that payment. Even though FC2 is also a related foreign interest holder, the $25 interest payment by A to FC2 in year 2 is not recharacterized because A is not fiscally transparent under the laws of Country Y, and FC2 is not treated as deriving any of the $100 dividend payment received by A. Thus, the U.S.-Country Y income tax treaty is not implicated.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Higher treaty withholding rate on dividends. (i) Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that under the U.S.-Country X income tax treaty, the rate of tax on interest is 10-percent and the rate of tax on dividends is 5-percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The analysis is the same as in Example 1 with respect to the $100 dividend payment from S to A. The analysis is the same as in Example 3 with respect to the $25 interest payment in year 2 from A to FC.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Foreign sister corporation the income and losses of which may offset the income and losses of related foreign interest holder. (i) Facts. The facts are the same as Example 3, except that in year 2, A makes the interest payment of $25 to FS, a subsidiary of FC also organized in Country X. Under the laws of Country X, FS is not fiscally transparent with respect to the interest payment, and the income and losses of FS may be used to offset the income and losses of FC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The analysis is the same as in Example 1 with respect to the $100 dividend payment from S to A. With respect to the $25 interest payment from A to FS in year 2, FS is a person described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(1)(ii) of this section because the income and losses of FS may be used under the laws of Country X to offset the income and losses of FC, the related foreign interest holder that derived its proportionate share of the payment from S to A. Therefore, paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section applies, and the $25 interest payment in year 2 by A to FS is treated as a dividend for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code and the U.S.-Country X income tax treaty because the $25 payment does not exceed FC's share of the $100 dividend payment made by S to A ($85). Since FS is not fiscally transparent with respect to the payment as determined under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, FS is entitled to obtain the rate applicable to dividends under the U.S.-Country X income tax treaty with respect to the $25 payment. Because the $25 payment in year 2 is recharacterized as a dividend for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code and the U.S.-Country X income tax treaty, A is not entitled to an interest deduction with respect to the payment and FS is not entitled to claim the reduced rate of withholding applicable to interest under the U.S.-Country X income tax treaty.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Interest paid by domestic reverse hybrid entity to unrelated foreign bank. (i) Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that in year 2, A makes the interest payment of $25 to FB, a Country Y unrelated foreign bank, on a loan from FB to A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The analysis is the same as in Example 1 with respect to the $100 dividend payment from S to A. With respect to the payment from A to FB, paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section will not apply because, although A is related to S, the payor of the dividend income it received, A is not related to FB under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(4) of this section. Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the $25 interest payment made from A to FB in year 2 is characterized as interest under the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Interest paid by domestic reverse hybrid to an unrelated entity pursuant to a financing arrangement. (i) Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 7, except that in year 3, FB makes an interest payment of $25 to FC on a deposit made by FC with FB.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The analysis is the same as in Example 1 with respect to the $100 dividend payment from S to A. With respect to the $25 payment from A to FB in year 2, because the payment is made in connection with a transaction that consititutes a financing arrangement within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C)(2) of this section, the payment may be treated by the Commissioner as being made directly to FC. If the Commissioner disregards FB, then the analysis is the same as in Example 3 with respect to the $25 interest payment in year 2 from A to FC.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. Royalty paid by related entity to domestic reverse hybrid entity. (i) Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 3, except the $100 income received by A from S in year 1 is a royalty payment under both the laws of the United States and the laws of Country X. The royalty rate under the treaty is 10 percent and the interest rate is 0 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The analysis as to the royalty payment from S to A is the same as in Example 1 with respect to the $100 dividend payment from S to A. With respect to the $25 payment from A to FC, paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section will not apply because the payment from S to A is not treated as a dividend under the Internal Revenue Code or the laws of Country X. Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the $25 of interest paid by A to FC in year 2 is characterized as interest under the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, in year 2, FC may obtain the reduced rate of withholding applicable to interest under the U.S.-Country X income tax treaty, assuming all other requirements for claiming treaty benefits are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Definitions--(i) Entity. For purposes of this paragraph (d), the term entity shall mean any person that is treated by the United States or the applicable treaty jurisdiction as other than an individual. The term entity includes disregarded entities, including single member disregarded entities with individual owners.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Fiscally transparent under the law of the entity's jurisdiction--(A) General rule. For purposes of this paragraph (d), an entity is fiscally transparent under the laws of the entity's jurisdiction with respect to an item of income to the extent that the laws of that jurisdiction require the interest holder in the entity, wherever resident, to separately take into account on a current basis the interest holder's respective share of the item of income paid to the entity, whether or not distributed to the interest holder, and the character and source of the item in the hands of the interest holder are determined as if such item were realized directly from the source from which realized by the entity. However, the entity will be fiscally transparent with respect to the item of income even if the item of income is not separately taken into account by the interest holder, provided the item of income, if separately taken

into account by the interest holder, would not result in an income tax liability for that interest holder different from that which would result if the interest holder did not take the item into account separately, and provided the interest holder is required to take into account on a current basis the interest holder's share of all such nonseparately stated items of income paid to the entity, whether or not distributed to the interest holder. In determining whether an entity is fiscally transparent with respect to an item of income in the entity's jurisdiction, it is irrelevant that, under the laws of the entity's jurisdiction, the entity is permitted to exclude such item from gross income or that the entity is required to include such item in gross income but is entitled to a deduction for distributions to its interest holders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Special definitions. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(ii), an entity's jurisdiction is the jurisdiction where the entity is organized or incorporated or may otherwise be considered a resident under the laws of that jurisdiction. An interest holder will be treated as taking into account that person's share of income paid to an entity on a current basis even if such amount is taken into account by the interest holder in a taxable year other than the taxable year of the entity if the difference is due solely to differing taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Fiscally transparent under the law of an interest holder's jurisdiction--(A) General rule. For purposes of this paragraph (d), an entity is treated as fiscally transparent under the law of an interest holder's jurisdiction with respect to an item of income to the extent that the laws of the interest holder's jurisdiction require the interest holder resident in that jurisdiction to separately take into account on a current basis the interest holder's respective share of the item of income paid to the entity, whether or not distributed to the interest holder, and the character and source of the item in the hands of the interest holder are determined as if such item were realized directly from the source from which realized by the entity.

An entity will not be treated as fiscally transparent with respect to an item of income under the laws of the interest holder's jurisdiction, however, if, under the laws of the interest holder's jurisdiction, the interest holder in the entity is required to include in gross income a share of all or a part of the entity's income on a current basis year under any type of anti-deferral or comparable mechanism. In determining whether an entity is fiscally transparent with respect to an item of income under the laws of an interest holder's jurisdiction, it is irrelevant how the entity is treated under the laws of the entity's jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Special definitions. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(iii), an interest holder's jurisdiction is the jurisdiction where the interest holder is organized or incorporated or may otherwise be considered a resident under the laws of that jurisdiction.

The term applicable treaty jurisdiction means the jurisdiction whose income tax treaty with the United States is invoked for purposes of reducing the rate of tax imposed under sections 871(a), 881(a), 1461, and 4948(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Resident. The term resident shall have the meaning assigned to such term in the applicable income tax treaty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Application to all income tax treaties. Unless otherwise explicitly agreed

upon in the text of an income tax treaty, the rules contained in this paragraph (d) shall apply in respect of all income tax treaties to which the United States is a party. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the competent authorities may agree on a mutual basis to depart from the rules contained in this paragraph (d) in appropriate circumstances. However, a reduced rate under a tax treaty for an item of U.S. source income paid will not be available irrespective of the provisions in this paragraph (d) to the extent that the applicable treaty jurisdiction would not grant a reduced rate under the tax treaty to a U.S. resident in similar circumstances, as evidenced by a mutual agreement between the relevant competent authorities or by a public notice of the treaty jurisdiction. The Internal Revenue Service shall announce the terms of any such mutual agreement or public notice of the treaty jurisdiction. Any denial of tax treaty benefits as a consequence of such a mutual agreement or notice shall affect only payment of U.S. source items of income made after announcement of the terms of the agreement or of the notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. This paragraph (d) is illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Treatment of entity treated as partnership by U.S. and country of organization. (i) Facts. Entity A is a business organization formed under the laws of Country X that has an income tax treaty in effect with the United States. A is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A is also treated as a partnership under the laws of Country X, and therefore Country X requires the interest holders in A to separately take into account on a current basis their respective shares of the items of income paid to A, whether or not distributed to the interest holders, and the character and source of the items in the hands of the interest holders are determined as if such items were realized directly from the source from which realized by A. A receives royalty income from U.S. sources that is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. A is fiscally transparent in its jurisdiction within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section with respect to the U.S. source royalty income in Country X and, thus, A does not derive such income for purposes of the U.S.-X income tax treaty.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Treatment of interest holders in entity treated as partnership by U.S. and country of organization. (i) Facts. The facts are the same as under Example 1. A's partners are M, a corporation organized under the laws of Country Y that has an income tax treaty in effect with the United States, and T, a corporation organized under the laws of Country Z that has an income tax treaty in effect with the United States. M and T are not fiscally transparent under the laws of their respective countries of incorporation. Country Y requires M to separately take into account on a current basis M's respective share of the items of income paid to A, whether or not distributed to M, and the character and source of the items of income in M's hands are determined as if such items were realized directly from the source from which realized by A. Country Z treats A as a corporation and does not require T to take its share of A's income into account on a current basis whether or not distributed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. M is treated as deriving its share of the U.S. source royalty income for purposes of the U.S.-Y income tax treaty because A is fiscally transparent under paragraph (d)(3)(iii) with respect to that income under the laws of Country Y. Under Country Z law, however, because T is not required to take into account its share of the U.S. source royalty income received by A on a current basis whether or not distributed, A is not treated as fiscally transparent. Accordingly, T is not treated as deriving its share of the U.S. source royalty income for purposes of the U.S.-Z income tax treaty.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Dual benefits to entity and interest holder. (i) Facts. The facts are the same as under Example 2, except that A is taxable as a corporation under the laws of Country X. Article 12 of the U.S.-X income tax treaty provides for a source country reduced rate of taxation on royalties of 5-percent. Article 12 of the U.S.-Y income tax treaty provides that royalty income may only be taxed by the beneficial owner's country of residence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. A is treated as deriving the U.S. source royalty income for purposes of the U.S.-X income tax treaty because it is not fiscally transparent with respect to the item of income within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section in Country X, its country of organization. M is also treated as deriving its share of the U.S. source royalty income for purposes of the U.S.-Y income tax treaty because A is fiscally transparent under paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section with respect to that income under the laws of Country Y. T is not treated as deriving the U.S. source royalty income for purposes of the U.S.-Z income tax treaty because under Country Z law A is not fiscally transparent. Assuming all other requirements for eligibility for treaty benefits have been satisfied, A is entitled to the 5-percent treaty reduced rate on royalties under the U.S.-X income tax treaty with respect to the entire royalty payment. Assuming all other

requirements for treaty benefits have been satisfied, M is also entitled to a zero rate under the U.S.-Y income tax treaty with respect to its share of the royalty income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Treatment of grantor trust. (i) Facts. Entity A is a trust organized under the laws of Country X, which does not have an income tax treaty in effect with the United States. M, the grantor and owner of A for U.S. income tax purposes, is a resident of Country Y, which has an income tax treaty in effect with the United States. M is also treated as the grantor and owner of the trust under the laws of Country Y. Thus, Country Y requires M to take into account all items of A's income in the taxable year, whether or not distributed to M, and determines the character of each item in M's hands as if such item was realized directly from the source from which realized by A. Country X does not treat M as the owner of A and does not require M to account for A's income on a current basis whether or not distributed to M. A receives interest income from U.S. sources that is neither portfolio interest nor effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. A is not fiscally transparent under the laws of Country X within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section with respect to the U.S. source interest income, but A may not claim treaty benefits because there is no U.S.-X income tax treaty. M, however, does derive the income for purposes of the U.S.-Y income tax treaty because under the laws of Country Y, A is fiscally transparent.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Treatment of complex trust. (i) Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 4 except that M is treated as the owner of the trust only under U.S. tax law, after application of section 672(f), but not under the law of Country Y. Although the trust document governing A does not require that A distribute any of its income on a current basis, some distributions are made currently to M. There is no requirement under Country Y law that M take into account A's income on a current basis whether or not distributed to him in that year. Under the laws of Country Y, with respect to current distributions, the character of the item of income in the hands of the interest holder is determined as if such item were realized directly from the source from which realized by A. Accordingly, upon a current distribution of interest income to M, the interest income retains its source as U.S. source income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. M does not derive the U.S. source interest income because A is not fiscally transparent under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section with respect to the U.S. source interest income under the laws of Country Y. Although the character of the interest in the hands of M is determined as if realized directly from the source from which realized by A, under the laws of Country Y, M is not required to take into account his share of A's interest income on a current basis whether or not distributed. Accordingly, neither A nor M is entitled to claim treaty benefits, since A is a resident of a non-treaty jurisdiction and M does not derive the U.S. source interest income for purposes of the U.S.-Y income tax treaty.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Treatment of interest holders required to include passive income under anti-deferral regime. (i) Facts. The facts are the same as under Example 2. However, Country Z does require T, who is treated as owning 60-percent of the stock of A, to take into account its respective share of the royalty income of A under an anti-deferral regime applicable to certain passive income of controlled foreign corporations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. T is still not eligible to claim treaty benefits with respect to the royalty income. T is not treated as deriving the U.S. source royalty income for purposes of the U.S.-Z income tax treaty under paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section because T is only required to take into account its pro rata share of the U.S. source royalty income by reason of Country Z's anti-deferral regime.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Treatment of contractual arrangements operating as collective investment vehicles. (i) Facts. A is a contractual arrangement without legal personality for all purposes under the laws of Country X providing for joint ownership of securities. Country X has an income tax treaty in effect with the United States. A is a collective investment fund which is of a type known as a Common Fund under Country X law. Because of the absence of legal personality in Country X of the arrangement, A is not liable to tax as a person at the entity level in Country X and is thus not a resident within the meaning of the Residence Article of the U.S.-X income tax treaty. A is treated as a partnership for U.S. income tax purposes and receives U.S. source dividend income. Under the laws of Country X, however, investors in A only take into account their respective share of A's income upon distribution from the Common Fund. Some of A's interest holders are residents of Country X and some of Country Y. Country Y has no income tax treaty in effect with the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. A is not fiscally transparent under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section with respect to the U.S. source dividend income because the interest holders in A are not required to take into account their respective shares of such income in the taxable year whether or not distributed. Because A is an arrangement without a legal personality that is not considered a person in Country X and thus not a resident of Country X under the Residence Article of the U.S.-X income tax treaty, however, A does not derive the income as a resident of Country X for purposes of the U.S.-X income tax treaty. Further, because A is not fiscally transparent

under paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section with respect to the U.S. source dividend income, A's interest holders that are residents of Country X do not derive the income as residents of Country X for purposes of the U.S.-X income tax treaty.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Treatment of person specifically listed as resident in applicable treaty. (i) Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 7 except that A (the Common Fund) is organized in Country Z and the Residence Article of the U.S.-Z income tax treaty provides that ``the term 'resident of a Contracting State' includes, in the case of Country Z, Common Funds.* * *''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. A is treated, for purposes of the U.S.-Z income tax treaty as deriving the dividend income as a resident of Country Z under paragraph (d)(1) of this section because the item of income is paid directly to A, A is a Common Fund under the laws of Country Z, and Common Funds are specifically identified as residents of Country Z in the U.S.-Z treaty. There is no need to determine whether A meets the definition of fiscally transparent under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. Treatment of investment company when entity receives distribution deductions, and all distributions sourced by residence of entity. (i) Facts. Entity A is a business organization formed under the laws of Country X, which has an income tax treaty in effect with the United States. A is treated as a partnership for U.S. income tax purposes. Under the laws of Country X, A is an investment company taxable at the entity level and a resident of Country X. It is also entitled to a distribution deduction for amounts distributed to its interest holders on a current basis. A distributes all its net income on a current basis to its interest holders and, thus, in fact, has no income tax liability to Country X. A receives U.S. source dividend income. Under Country X law, all amounts distributed to interest holders of this type of business entity are treated as dividends from sources within Country X and Country X imposes a withholding tax on all payments by A to foreign persons. Under Country X laws, the interest holders in A do not have to separately take into account their respective shares of A's income on a current basis if such income is not, in fact, distributed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. A is not fiscally transparent under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section with respect to the U.S. source dividends because the interest holders in A do not have to take into account their respective share of the U.S. source dividends on a current basis whether or not distributed. A is also not fiscally transparent under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section because there is a change in source of the income received by A when A distributes the income to its interest holders and, thus, the character and source of the income in the hands of A's interest holder are not determined as if such income were realized directly from the source from which realized by A. Accordingly, A is treated as deriving the U.S. source dividends for purposes of the U.S.-Country X treaty.</p><p class="depth0">Example 10. Item by item determination of fiscal transparency. (i) Facts. Entity A is a business organization formed under the laws of Country X, which has an income tax treaty in effect with the United States. A is treated as a partnership for U.S. income tax purposes. Under the laws of Country X, A is an investment company taxable at the entity level and a resident of Country X. It is also entitled to a distribution deduction for amounts distributed to its interest holders on a current basis. A receives both U.S. source dividend income and interest income from U.S. sources that is neither portfolio interest nor effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. Country X law sources all distributions attributable to dividend income based on the residence of the investment company. In contrast, Country X law sources all distributions attributable to interest income based on the residence of the payor of the interest. No withholding applies with respect to distributions attributable to U.S. source interest and the character of the distributions attributable to the interest income remains the same in the hands of A's interest holders as if such items were realized directly from the source from which realized by A. However, under Country X law the interest holders in A do not have to take into account their respective share of the interest income received by A on a current basis whether or not distributed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. An item by item analysis is required under paragraph (d) of this section. The analysis is the same as Example 9 with respect to the dividend income. A is also not fiscally transparent under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section with respect to the interest income because, although the character of the distributions attributable to the interest income in the hands of A's interest holders is determined as if realized directly from the source from which realized by A, under Country X law the interest holders in A do not have to take into account their respective share of the interest income received by A on a current basis whether or not distributed. Accordingly, A derives the U.S. source interest income for purpose of the U.S.-X treaty.</p><p class="depth0">Example 11. Treatment of charitable organizations. (i) Facts. Entity A is a corporation organized under the laws of Country X that has an income tax treaty in effect with the United States. Entity A is established and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, artistic, cultural, or educational purposes. Entity A receives U.S. source dividend income from U.S. sources. A

provision of Country X law generally exempts Entity A's income from Country X tax due to the fact that Entity A is established and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, artistic, cultural, or educational purposes. But for such provision, Entity A's income would be taxed by Country X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Entity A is not fiscally transparent under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section with respect to the U.S. source dividend income because, under Country X law, the dividend income is treated as an item of income of A and no other persons are required to take into account their respective share of the item of income on a current basis, whether or not distributed. Accordingly, Entity A is treated as deriving the U.S. source dividend income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 12. Treatment of pension trusts. (i) Facts. Entity A is a trust established and operated in Country X exclusively to provide pension or other similar benefits to employees pursuant to a plan. Entity A receives U.S. source dividend income. A provision of Country X law generally exempts Entity A's income from Country X tax due to the fact that Entity A is established and operated exclusively to provide pension or other similar benefits to employees pursuant to a plan. Under the laws of Country X, the beneficiaries of the trust are not required to take into account their respective share of A's income on a current basis, whether or not distributed and the character and source of the income in the hands of A's interest holders are not determined as if realized directly from the source from which realized by A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. A is not fiscally transparent under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section with respect to the U.S. source dividend income because under the laws of Country X, the beneficiaries of A are not required to take into account their respective share of A's income on a current basis, whether or not distributed. A is also not fiscally transparent under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section with respect to the U.S. source dividend income because under the laws of Country X, the character and source of the income in the hands of A's interest holders are not determined as if realized directly from the source from which realized by A. Accordingly, A derives the U.S. source dividend income for purposes of the U.S.-X income tax treaty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Effective dates.

Sec. 1.895-1  Income derived by a foreign central bank of issue, or byBank for International Settlements, from obligations of theUnited States or from bank deposits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Income derived by a foreign central bank of issue from obligations of the United States or of any agency or instrumentality thereof, or from interest on deposits with persons carrying on the banking business, is excluded from the gross income of such bank and is exempt from income tax if the bank is the owner of the obligations or deposits and does not hold the obligations or deposits for, or use them in connection with, the conduct of a commercial banking function or other commercial activity by such bank. For purposes of this section and paragraph (i) of Sec. 1.1441-4, obligations of the United States or of any agency or instrumentality thereof include beneficial interests, participations, and other instruments issued under section 302(c) of the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act (12 U.S.C. 1717). See 24 CFR part 1600 et seq.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Foreign central bank of issue. (1) A foreign central bank of issue is a bank which is by law or government sanction the principal authority, other than the government itself, issuing instruments intended to circulate as currency. Such a bank is generally the custodian of the banking reserves of the country under whose law it is organized. See also paragraph (b)(5) of Sec. 1.861-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The exclusion granted by section 895 applies to an instrumentality that is separate from a foreign government, whether or not owned in whole or in part by a foreign government. For example, foreign banks organized along the lines of, and performing functions similar to, the Federal Reserve System qualify as foreign central banks of issue for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Bank for International Settlements shall be treated as though it were a foreign central bank of issue for purposes of obtaining the exclusion granted by section 895.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Ownership of United States obligations or bank deposits. The exclusion does not apply if the obligations or bank deposits from which the income is derived are not owned by the foreign central bank of issue. Obligations held, or deposits made, by a foreign central bank of issue as agent, custodian, trustee, or in any other fiduciary capacity, shall be considered as not owned by such bank for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Commercial banking function or other commercial activity. The exclusion applies only to obligations of the United States or of any agency or instrumentality thereof, or to bank deposits, held for, or used in connection with, the conduct of a central banking function and not to obligations or deposits held for, or used in connection with, the conduct of commercial banking functions or other commercial activities by the foreign central bank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Other exclusions. See section 861(a)(1) (A) and (E) and Sec. 1.861-2(b) (1) and (4), for special rules relating to interest paid or credited before January 1, 1977, on deposits and on similar amounts and for rules on interest derived from bankers' acceptances. For exemption from withholding under Sec. 1.1441-1 on income derived by a foreign central bank of issue, or by the Bank of International Settlements, from obligations of the United States or of any agency or instrumentality thereof, or from bank deposits, see Sec. 1.1441-4(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective date.

Sec. 1.897-1  Taxation of foreign investment in United States realproperty interests, definition of terms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general--(1) Purpose and scope of regulations. These regulations provide guidance with respect to the taxation of foreign investments in U.S. real property interests and related matters. This section defines various terms for purposes of sections 897, 1445, and 6039C and the regulations thereunder. Section 1.897-2 provides rules regarding the definition of, and consequences of, U.S. real property holding corporation status. Section 1.897-3 sets forth rules pursuant to which certain foreign corporations may elect under section 897(i) to be treated as domestic corporations for purposes of sections 897 and 6039C. Finally, Sec. 1.987-4 provides rules concerning the similar election under section 897(k) for certain foreign corporations in the process of liquidation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effective date. The regulations set forth in Sec. Sec. 1.897-1 through 1.897-4 are effective for transactions occurring after June 18, 1980. However, with respect to all transactions occurring after June 18, 1980 and before January 30, 1985, taxpayers may at their option choose to apply the Temporary Regulations under section 897 (in their entirety). The Temporary Regulations are located at 26 CFR 6a.897-1 through 6a.897-4 (Revised as of April 1, 1983), and were originally published in the Federal Register for September 21, 1982 (47 FR 41532) and amended by T.D. 7890, published in the Federal Register on April 28, 1983 (48 FR 19163).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Real property--(1) In general. The term ``real property'' includes the following three categories of property: Land and unserved natural products of the land, improvements, and personal property associated with the use of real property. The three categories of real property are defined in subparagraphs (2), (3), and (4) of this paragraph (b). Local law definitions will not be controlling for purposes of determining the meaning of the term ``real property'' as it is used in sections 897, 1445,

and 6039C and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Land and unserved natural products of the land. The term ``real property'' includes land, growing crops and timber, and mines, wells, and other natural deposits. Crops and timber cease to be real property at the time that they are served from the land. Ores, minerals, and other natural deposits cease to be real property when they are extracted from the ground. The storage of severed or extracted crops, timber, or minerals in or upon real property will not cause such property to be recharacterized as real property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Improvements--(i) In general. The term ``real property'' includes improvements on land. An improvement is a building, any other inherently permanent structure, or the structural components of either, as defined in subdivisions (ii) through (iv) of this paragraph (b)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Building. The term ``building'' generally means any structure or edifice enclosing a space within its walls, and usually covered by a roof, the purpose of which is, for example, to provide shelter or housing or to provide working, office, parking, display, or sales space. The term includes, for example, structures such as apartment houses, factory and office buildings, warehouses, barns, garages, railway or bus stations, and stores. Any structure that is classified as a building for purposes of section 48(a)(1)(B) and Sec. 1.48-1 shall be treated as such for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Inherently permanent structure--(A) In general. The term ``inherently permanent structure'' means any property not otherwise described in this paragraph (b)(3) that is affixed to real property and that will ordinarily remain affixed for an indefinite period of time. Property that is not classified as a building for purposes of section 48(a)(1)(B) and Sec. 1.48-1 may nevertheless constitute an inherently permanent structure. For purposes of this section, affixation to real property may be accomplished by weight alone.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Use of precedents under section 48. Any property not otherwise described in this paragraph (b)(3) that constitutes ``other tangible property'' under the principles of section 48(a)(1)(B) and Sec. 1.48-1 (c) and (d) shall be treated for purposes of this section as an inherently permanent structure. Thus, for example, the term includes swimming pools, paved parking areas and other pavements, special foundations for heavy equipment, wharves and docks, bridges, fences, inherently permanent advertising displays, inherently permanent outdoor lighting facilities, railroad tracks and signals, telephone poles, permanently installed telephone and television cables, broadcasting towers, oil derricks, oil and gas pipelines, oil and gas storage tanks, grain storage bins, and silos. However, property that is determined to be either property in the nature of machinery under Sec. 1.48-1(c) or property which is essentially an item of machinery or equipment under Sec. 1.48-1(e)(1)(i) shall not be treated as an inherently permanent structure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Absence of precedents under section 48. Where precedents developed under the principles of section 48 fail to provide adequate guidance with respect to the classification of particular property, the determination of whether such property constitutes an inherently permanent structure shall be made in view of all the facts and circumstances. In particular, the following factors must be taken into account:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The manner in which the property is affixed to real property;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Whether the property was designed to be easily removable or to remain in place indefinitely;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Whether the property has been moved since its initial installation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any circumstances that suggest the expected period of affixation (e.g., a lease that requires removal of the property upon its expiration);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The amount of damage that removal of the property would cause to the property itself or to the real property to which it is affixed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The extent of the effort that would be required to remove the property, in terms of time and expense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Structural components of buildings and other inherently permanent structures. Structural components of buildings and other inherently permanent structures, as defined in Sec. 1.48-1 (e)(2), themselves constitute improvements.

Structural components include walls, partitions, floors, ceilings, windows, doors, wiring, plumbing, central heating and central air conditioning systems, lighting fixtures, pipes, ducts, elevators, escalators, sprinkler systems, fire escapes and other components relating to the operation or maintenance of a building. However, the term ``structural components'' does not include machinery the sole justification for the installation of which is the fact that such machinery is required to meet temperature or humidity requirements which are essential for the operation of other machinery or the processing of materials or foodstuffs. Machinery may meet the ``sole justification'' test provided by the preceding sentence even though it incidentally provides for the comfort of employees or serves to an insubstantial degree areas where such temperature or humidity requirements are not essential.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Personal property associated with the use of the real property--(i) In general. The term ``real property'' includes movable walls, furnishings, and other personal property associated with the use of the real property. Personal property is associated with the use of real property only if it is described in one of the categories set forth in subdivisions (A) through (D) of this paragraph (b)(4)(i). ``Personal property'' for purposes of this section means any property that constitutes ``tangible personal property'' under the principles of Sec. 1.48-1(c), without regard to whether such property qualifies as section 38 property. Such property will be associated with the use of the real property only where both the personal property and the United States real property interest with which it is associated are held by the same person or by related persons within the meaning of Sec. 1.897-1(i). For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(i), property is used ``predominantly'' in a named activity if it is devoted to that activity during at least half of the time in which it is in use during a calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Property used in mining, farming, and forestry. Personal property is associated with the use of real property if it is predominantly used to exploit unsevered natural products in or upon the land. Such property includes mining equipment used to extract ores, minerals, and other natural deposits from the ground. It also includes any property used to cultivate the soil and harvest its products, such as farm machinery, draft animals, and equipment used in the growing and cutting of timber. However, personal property used to process or transport minerals, crops, or timber after they are severed from the land is not associated personal property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Property used in the improvement of real property. Personal property is associated with the use of real property if it is predominantly used to construct or otherwise carry out improvements to real property. Such property includes equipment used to alter the natural contours of the land, equipment used to clear and prepare raw land for construction, and equipment used to carry out the construction of improvements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Property used in the operation of a lodging facility. Personal property is associated with the use of real property if it is predominantly used in connection with the operation of a lodging facility. Property that is used in connection with the operation of a lodging facility includes property used in the living quarters of such facility, such as beds and other furniture, refrigerators, ranges and other equipment, as well as property used in the common areas of such facility, such as lobby furniture and laundry equipment. Such property constitutes personal property associated with the use of real property in the hands of the owner or operator of the facility, not of the tenant or guest. A lodging facility is an apartment house or apartment, hotel, motel, dormitory, residence, or any other facility (or part of a facility) predominantly used to provide, at a charge, living and/or sleeping accommodations, whether on daily, weekly, monthly, annual, or other basis. The term ``lodging facility'' does not include a personal residence occupied solely by its owner, or a facility used primarily as a means of transportation (such as an aircraft, vessel, or a railroad car) or used primarily to provide medical or convalescent services, even though sleeping accommodations are provided. Nor does

the term include temporary living quarters provided by an employer due to the unavailability of lodgings within a reasonable distance of a work-site (such as a mine or construction project). The term ``lodging facility'' does not include any portion of a facility that constitutes a nonlodging commercial facility and that is available to persons not using the lodging facility on the same basis that it is available to tenants of the lodging facility. Examples of nonlodging commercial facilities include restaurants, drug stores, and grocery stores located in a lodging facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Property used in the rental of furnished office and other work space. Personal property is associated with the use of real property if it is predominantly used by a lessor to provide furnished office or other work space to lessees. Property that is so used includes office furniture and equipment included in the rental of furnished space. Such property constitutes personal property associated with the use of real property in the hands of the lessor, not of the lessee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Dispositions of associated personal property--(A) In general. Personal property that has become associated with the use of a real property interest shall itself be treated as a real property interest upon its disposition, unless either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The personal property is disposed of more than one year before the disposition of any present right to use or occupy the real property with which it was associated (and subject to the provisions of subdivision (B) of this paragraph (b)(4)(ii));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The personal property is disposed of more than one year after the disposition of all present rights to use or occupy the real property with which it was associated (and subject to the provisions of subdivision (C) of this paragraph (b)(4)(ii)); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The personal property and the real property with which it was associated are separately sold to persons that are related neither to the transferor nor to one another (and subject to the provisions of subdivision (D) of this paragraph (b)(4)(ii)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Personalty property disposed of one year before realty. A transferor of personal property associated with the use of real property need not treat such property as a real property interest upon disposition if on the date of disposition the transferor does not expect or intend to dispose of the real property until more than one year later.

However, if the real property is in fact disposed of within the following year, the transferor must treat the personal property as having been a real property interest as of the date on which the personalty was disposed of. If the transferor had not previously filed an income tax return, a return must be filed and tax paid, together with any interest due thereon, by the later of the date on which a tax return or payment is actually due (with extensions), or the 60th day following the date of disposition. If the transferor had previously filed an income tax return, an amended return must be filed and tax paid, together with any interest due thereon, by the later of the dates specified above. Such a transferor may be liable to penalties for failure to file, for late payment of tax, or for understatement of liability, but only if the transferor knew or had reason to anticipate that the real property would be disposed of within one year of the disposition of the associated personal property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Personalty disposed of one year after realty. A disposition of real property shall be disregarded for purposes of subdivision (A)(2) of this paragraph (b) (4)(ii) if any right to use or occupy the real property is reacquired within the one-year period referred to in that subdivision. However, the disposition shall not be disregarded if such reacquisition is made in foreclosure of a mortgage or other security interest, in the exercise of a contractual remedy, or in the enforcement of a judgment. If, however, the reacquisition of the porperty is made pursuant to a plan the principal purpose of which is the avoidance of the provisions of section 897, 1445, or 6039C and the regulations thereunder, then the initial disposition shall be disregarded for purposes of subdivision (A)(2) of this paragraph (b)(4)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Separate dispositions of personalty and realty. A transferor of personal property associated with the use of real

property need not treat such property as a real property interest upon disposition if within 90 days before or after such disposition the transferor separately disposes of the real property interest to persons that are related neither to the transferor nor to the purchaser of the personal property. A transferor may rely upon this rule unless the transferor knows or has reason to know that the purchasers of the real property and the personal property--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Are related persons; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Intend to reassociate the personal property with the use of the real property within one year of the date of disposition of the personal property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Status of property in hands of transferee. Personal property that has been associated with the use of real property and that is sold to an unrelated party will be treated as real property in the hands of the transferee only if the personal property becomes associated with the use of real property held or acquired by the transferee, in the manner described in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Determination dates. The determination of whether personal property is personal property associated with the use of real property as defined in this paragraph (b)(4) is to be made on the date the personal property is disposed of and on each applicable determination date. See Sec. 1.897-2(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> United States real property interest--(1) In general. The term ``United States real property interest'' means any interest, other than an interest solely as a creditor, in either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Real property located in the United States or the Virgin Islands, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A domestic corporation unless it is established that the corporation was not a U.S. real property holding corporation within the period described in section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">In addition, for the limited purpose of determining whether any corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation, the term ``United States real property interest'' means an interest, other than an interest solely as a creditor, in a foreign corporation unless it is established that the foreign corporation is not a U.S. real property holding corporation within the period prescribed in section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii). See Sec. 1.897-2 for rules regarding the manner of establishing that a corporation is not a United States real property holding corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions and special rules--(i) Domestically-controlled REIT. An interest in a domestically-controlled real estate investment trust (REIT) is not a U.S. real property interest. A domestically-controlled REIT is one in which less than 50 percent of the fair market value of the outstanding stock was directly or indirectly held by foreign persons during the five-year period ending on the applicable determination date (or the period since June 18, 1980, if shorter). For purposes of this determination the actual owners of stock, as determined under Sec. 1.857-8, must be taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Corporation that has disposed of all U.S. real property interests. The term ``United States real property interest'' does not include an interest in a corporation which has disposed of all its U.S. real property interests in transactions in which the full amount of gain, if any, was recognized, as provided by section 897(c)(1)(B). See Sec. 1.897-2(f) for rules regarding the requirements of section 897(c)(1)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Publicly-traded corporations. If, at any time during the calendar year, any class of stock of a domestic corporation is regularly traded on an established securities market, an interest in such corporation shall be treated as a U.S. real property interest only in the case of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A regularly traded interest owned by a person who beneficially owned more than 5 percent of the total fair market value of that class of interests at any time during the five-year period ending either on the date of disposition of such interest or other applicable determination date (or the period since June 18, 1980, in shorter), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> [Reserved]

Separate non-regularly traded interests that were acquired in transactions more than three years apart shall not be cumulated pursuant to this rule. In determining whether a shareholder holds 5 percent of a class of stock in a corporation (or any other interest of an equivalent fair market value), section 318(a) shall apply (except that sections 318(a) (2)(C) and (3)(C) are applied by

substituting the phrase ``5 percent'' for ``50 percent'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Publicly traded partnerships and trusts. If any class of interests in a partnership or trust is, within the meaning of Sec. 1.897-1(m) and (n), regularly traded on an established securities market, then for purposes of sections 897(g) and 1445 and Sec. 1.897-2 (d) and (e) an interest in the entity shall not be treated as an interest in a partnership or trust. Instead, such an interest shall be subject to the rules applicable to interests in publicly traded corporations pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. Such interests can be real property interests in the hands of a person that holds a greater than 5 percent interest. Therefore, solely for purposes of determining whether greater than 5 percent interests in such an entity constitute U.S. real property interests the disposition of which is subject to tax, the entity is required to determine pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 1.897-2 whether the assets it holds would cause it to be classified as a U.S. real property holding corporation if it were a corporation. The treatment of dispositions of U.S. real property interests by publicly traded partnerships and trusts is not affected by the rules of this paragraph (c)(2)(iv); by reason of the operation of section 897(a), foreign partners or beneficiaries are subject to tax upon their distributive share of any gain recognized upon such dispositions by the partnership or trust. The rules of this paragraph (c)(2)(iv) are illustrated by the following example.</p><p class="depth0">Example. PTP is a partnership one class of interests in which is regularly traded on an established securities market. A is a nonresident alien individual who owns 1 percent of a class of limited partnership interests in PTP. B is a nonresident alien individual who owns 10 percent of the same class of limited partnership interests in PTP. On July 1, 1986, A and B sell their interests in PTP. Pursuant to the rules of this paragraph (c)(2)(iv), neither disposition is treated as the disposition of a partnership interest subject to the provisions of section 897(g). Instead, A and B are treated as having disposed of interests in a publicly traded corporation. Therefore, pursuant to the rule of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, A's disposition of a 1 percent interest has no consequences under section 897. However, B's disposition of a 10 percent interest will constitute the disposition of a U.S. real property interest subject to tax by reason of the operation of section 897 unless it is established pursuant to the rules of Sec. 1.897-2 that the interest is not a U.S. real property interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Interest other than an interest solely as a creditor--(1) In general. This paragraph defines an interest other than an interest solely as a creditor, with respect to real property, and with respect to corporations, partnerships, trusts, and estates. An interest solely as a creditor either in real property or in a domestic corporation does not constitute a United States real property interest. Similarly, where one corporation holds an interest solely as a creditor in a second corporation or in a partnership, trust, or estate, that interest will be disregarded for purposes of determining whether the first corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation (except to the extent that such interest constitutes an asset used or held for use in a trade or business, in accordance with rules of Sec. 1.897-1(f)). In addition, the disposition of an interest solely as a creditor in a parnership, trust, or estate is not subject to sections 897, 1445, and 6039C. Whether an interest is considered debt under any provisions of the Code is not determinative of whether it constitutes an interest solely as a creditor for purpose of sections 897, 1445, and 6039C and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interests in real property other than solely as creditor--(i) In general. An interest in real property other than an interest solely as a creditor includes a fee ownership, co-ownership, or leasehold interest in real property, a time sharing interest in real property, and a life estate, remainder, or reversionary interest in such property. The term also includes any direct or indirect right to share in the appreciation in the value, or in the gross or net proceeds or profits generated by, the real property.</p><p class="depth0">A loan to an individual or entity under the terms of which a holder of the indebtedness has any direct or indirect right to share in the appreciation in value of, or the gross or net proceeds or profits generated by, an interest in

real property of the debtor or of a related person is, in its entirety, an interest in real property other than solely as a creditor. An interest in production payments described in section 636 does not generally constitute an interest in real property other than solely as a creditor. However, a right to production payments shall constitute an interest in real property other than solely as a creditor if it conveys a right to share in the appreciation in value of the mineral property. A production payment that is limited to a quantum of mineral (including a percentage of recoverable reserves produced) or a period of time will be considered to convey a right to share in the appreciation in value of the mineral property. The rules of this paragraph (d)(2)(i) are illustrated by the following example.</p><p class="depth0">Example. A, a U.S. citizen, purchases a condominium unit located in the United States for $500,000. A makes a $100,000 down payment and borrows $400,000 from B, a foreign person, to pay the balance of the purchase price. Under the terms of the loan. A is to pay B 13 percent annual interest each year for 10 years and 35 percent of the appreciation in the fair market value of the condominum at the end of the 10-year period. Because B has a right to share in the appreciation in value of the condominium, B has an interest other than solely as a creditor in the condominium. B's entire interest in the obligation from A, therefore, is a United States real property interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule--(A) Installment obligations. A right to installment or other deferred payments from the disposition of an interest in real property will constitute an interest solely as a creditor if the transferor elects not to have the installment method of section 453(a) apply, any gain or loss is recognized in the year of disposition, and all tax due is timely paid. See section 1445 and regulations thereunder for further guidance concerning the availability of installment sale treatment under section 453. If an agreement for the payment of tax with respect to an installment sale is entered into with the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to section 1445, that agreement may specify whether or not the installment obligation will constitute an interest solely as a creditor. If an installment obligation constitutes an interest other than solely as a creditor then the receipt of each payment shall be treated as the disposition of an interest in real property that is subject to section 897(a) to the extent of any gain required to be taken into account pursuant to section 453.</p><p class="depth0">If the original holder of an installment obligation that constitutes an interest other than solely as a creditor subsequently disposes of the obligation to an unrelated party and recognizes gain or loss pursuant to section 453B, the obligation will constitute an interest in real property solely as a creditor in the hands of the subsequent holder. However, if the obligation is disposed of to a related person and the full amount of gain realized upon the disposition of the real property has not been recognized upon such disposition of the installment obligation, then the obligation shall continue to be an interest in real property other than solely as a creditor in the hands of the subsequent holder subject to the rules of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A).</p><p class="depth0">In addition, if the obligation is disposed of to any person for a principal purpose of avoiding the provisions of sections 897, 1445, or 6039C, then the obligation shall continue to be an interest in real property other than solely as a creditor in the hands of the subsequent holder subject to the rules of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A). However, rights to payments arising from dispositions that took place before June 19, 1980, shall in no event constitute interests in real property other than solely as a creditor, even if such payments are received after June 18, 1980. In addition, rights to payments arising from dispositions to unrelated parties that took place before January 1, 1985, and that were not subject to U.S. tax pursuant to the provisions of a U.S. income tax treaty, shall not constitute interests in real property other than solely as a creditor, even if such payments are received after December 31, 1984.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Options. An option, a contract or a right of first refusal to acquire any interest in real property (other than an interest solely as a creditor) will itself constitute an interest in real property other than solely as a creditor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Security interests. A right to repossess or foreclose on real property under

a mortgage, security agreement, financing statement, or other collateral instrument securing a debt will not be considered a reversionary interest in, or a right to share in the appreciation in value of or gross or net proceeds or profits generated by, an interest in real property. Thus, no such right of repossession or foreclosure will of itself cause an interest in real property which is otherwise an interest solely as a creditor to become an interest other than solely as a creditor. In addition, a person acting as mortgagee in possession shall not be considered to hold an interest in real property other than solely as a creditor, if the mortgagee's interest in the property otherwise constitutes an interest solely as a creditor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Indexed interest rates. An interest will not constitute a right to share in the appreciation in the value of, or gross or net proceeds or profits generated by, real property solely because it bears a rate of interest that is tied to an index of any kind that is intended to reflect general inflation or deflation of prices and interest rates (e.g., the Consumer Price Index). However, where an interest in real property bears a rate of interest that is tied to an index the principal purpose of which is to reflect changes in real property values, the real property interest will be considered an indirect right to share in the appreciation in value of, or gross or net proceeds or profits generated by, real property. Such an indirect right constitutes an interest in real property other than solely as a creditor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Commissions. A right to payment of a commission, brokerage fee, or similar charge for professional services rendered in connection with the arrangement or financing of a purchase, sale, or lease of real property does not constitute a right to share in the appreciation in value of, or gross or net proceeds or profits of, real property solely because it is based upon a percentage of the purchase price or rent. Thus, a right to a commission earned by a real estate agent based on a percentage of the sales price does not constitute an interest in real property other than solely as a creditor.</p><p class="depth0">However, a right to a commission, brokerage fee, or similar charge will constitute an interest other than solely as a creditor if the total amount of the payment is contingent upon appreciation, proceeds, or profits of the real property occurring or arising after the date of the transaction with respect to which the professional services were rendered. For example, a commission earned in connection with the purchase of a real property interest that is contingent upon the amount of gain ultimately realized by the purchaser will constitute an interest in real property other than solely as a creditor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Trustees' fees, etc. A right to payment of reasonable compensation for services rendered as a trustee, as an administrator of an estate, or in a similar capacity does not constitute a right to share in the appreciation in the value of, or gross or net proceeds or profits of, real property solely because the assets of the trust or estate include U.S. real property interests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Interest in an entity other than solely as a creditor--(i) In general. For purposes of sections 897, 1445, and 6039C, an interest in an entity other than an interest solely as a creditor is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Stock of a corporation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An interest in a partnership as a partner within the meaning of section 761(b) and the regulations thereunder;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> An interest in a trust or estate as a beneficiary within the meaning of section 643(c) and the regulations thereunder or an ownership interest in any portion of a trust as provided in sections 671 through 679 and the regulations thereunder;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> An interest which is, in whole or in part, a direct or indirect right to share in the appreciation in value of an interest in an entity described in subdivision (A), (B), or (C) of this paragraph (d)(3)(i) or a direct or indirect right to share in the appreciation in value of assets of, or gross or net proceeds or profits derived by, the entity; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> A right (whether or not presently exercisable) directly or indirectly to acquire, by purchase, conversion, exchange, or in any other manner, an interest described in subdivision (A), (B), (C), or (D) of this paragraph (d)(3) (i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rules--(A) Installment obligations. A right to installment or other deferred payments from the disposition

of an interest in an entity will constitute an interest solely as a creditor if the transferor elects not to have the installment method of section 453(a) apply, any gain or loss is recognized in the year of disposition, and tax due is timely paid. See section 1445 and regulations thereunder for further guidance concerning the availability of installment sale treatment under section 453. If an agreement for the payment of tax with respect to an installment sale is entered into with the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to section 1445, that agreement may specify whether or not the installment obligation will constitute an interest solely as a creditor. If an installment obligation constitutes an interest other than solely as a creditor then the receipt of each payment shall be treated as the disposition of such an interest and shall be subject to section 897(a) to the extent that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> It constitutes the disposition of a U.S. real property interest and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Gain or loss is required to be taken into account pursuant to section 453. Such treatment shall apply to payments arising from dispositions of interests in a corporation any class of the stock of which is regularly traded on an established securities market, but only in the case of a disposition of any portion of an interest described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section. If the original holder of an installment obligation that constitutes an interest other than solely as a creditor subsequently disposes of the obligation to an unrelated party and recognizes gain or loss pursuant to section 453B, the obligation will constitute an interest in the entity solely as a creditor in the hands of the subsequent holder. However, if the obligation is disposed of to a related person and the full amount of gain realized upon the disposition of the interest in the entity has not been recognized upon such disposition of the installment obligation, then the obligation shall continue to be an interest in the entity other than solely as a creditor in the hands of the subsequent holder subject to the rules of this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A). In addition, if the obligation is disposed of to any person for a principal purpose of avoiding the provisions of section 897, 1445, or 6039C, then the obligation shall continue to be an interest in the entity other than solely as a creditor in the hands of the subsequent holder subject to the rules of this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A). However, rights to payments arising from dispositions that took place before June 19, 1980, shall in no event constitute interests in an entity other than solely as a creditor, even if such payments are received after June 18, 1980. In addition, such treatment shall not apply to payments arising from dispositions to unrelated parties that took place before January 1, 1985, and that were not subject to U.S. tax pursuant to the provisions of a U.S. income tax treaty, regardless of when such payments are received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Contingent interests. The interests described in subdivision (D) of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section include any right to a payment from an entity the amount of which is contingent on the appreciation in value of an interest described in subdivision (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section or which is contingent on the appreciation in value of assets of, or the general gross or net proceeds or profits derived by, such entity. The right to such a payment is itself an interest in the entity other than solely as a creditor, regardless of whether the holder of such right actually holds an interest in the entity described in subdivision (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. For example, a stock appreciation right constitutes an interest in a corporation other than solely as a creditor even if the holder of such right actually holds no stock in the corporation. However, the interests described in subdivision (D) of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section do not include any right to a payment that is (1) exclusively contingent upon and exclusively paid out of revenues from sales of personal property (whether tangible or intangible) or from services, or (2) exclusively contingent upon the resolution of a claim asserted against the entity by a person related neither to the entity nor to the holder of the interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Security interests. A right to repossess or foreclose on an interest in an entity under a mortgage, security agreement, financing statement, or other collateral instrument securing a

debt will not of itself cause an interest in an entity which is otherwise an interest solely as a creditor to become an interest other than solely as a creditor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Royalties. The interests described in subdivision (D) of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section do not include rights to payments representing royalties, license fees, or similar charges for the use of patents, inventions, formulas, copyrights, literary, musical or artistic compositions, trademarks, trade names, franchises, licenses, or similar intangible property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Commissions. The interests described in subdivision (D) of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section do not include a right to a commission, brokerage fee or similar charge for professional services rendered in connection with the purchase or sale of an interest in an entity. However, a right to such a payment will constitute an interest other than solely as a creditor if the total amount of the payment is contingent upon appreciation in value of assets of, or proceeds or profits derived by, the entity after the date of the transaction with respect to which the payment was earned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Trustee's fees. The interests described in subdivision (D) of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section do not include a right to payment representing reasonable compensation for services rendered as a trustee, as an administrator of an estate, or in a similar capacity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Aggregation of interests. If a person holds both interests solely as a creditor and interests other than solely as a creditor in real property or in an entity, those interests will generally be treated as separate and distinct interests. However, such interests shall be aggregated and treated as interests other than solely as a creditor in their entirety if the interest solely as a creditor has been separated from, or acquired separately from, the interest other than solely as a creditor, for a principal purpose of avoiding the provisions of section 897, 1445, or 6039C by causing one or more of such interests to be an interest solely as a creditor. The existence of such a purpose will be determined with reference to all the facts and circumstances. Where an interest solely as a creditor has arm's-length interest and repayment terms it shall in no event be aggregated with and treated as an interest other than solely as a creditor. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(4), an interest rate that does not exceed 120 percent of the applicable Federal rate (as defined in section 1274(d)) shall be presumed to be an arm's-length interest rate. For purposes of applying the rules of this paragraph (d)(4), a person shall be treated as holding any interests held by a related person within the meaning of Sec. 1.897-1(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> ``Interest'' means ``interest other than solely as a creditor.'' Unless otherwise stated, the term ``interest'' as used with regard to real property or with regard to an entity hereafter in the regulations under sections 897, 1445, and 6039C, means an interest in such real property or entity other than an interest solely as a creditor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Proportionate share of assets held by an entity--(1) In general. A person that holds an interest in an entity is for certain purposes treated as holding a proportionate or pro rata share of the assets held by the entity. Such proportionate share must be calculated, in accordance with the rules of this paragraph, for the following purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In determining whether a corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A person holding an interest in a partnership, trust, or estate is treated as holding a proportionate share of the assets held by the partnership, trust, or estate (see section 897-2(e)(2)), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A corporation that holds a controlling interest in a second corporation is treated as holding a proportionate share of the assets held by the second corporation (see Sec. 1.897-2(e)(3)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In determining reporting obligations that may be imposed under section 6039C, the holder of an interest in a partnership, trust, or estate is treated as owning a proportionate share of the U.S. real property interests held by the partnership, trust, or estate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Proportionate share of assets held by a corporation or partnership--(i) In general. A person's proportionate or pro rata share of assets held by a corporation or partnership is determined by multiplying--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The person's percentage ownership interest in the entity, by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The fair market value of the assets held by the entity (or the book value of such assets, in the case of a determination pursuant to Sec. 1.897-2(b)(2)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Percentage ownership interest. A person's percentage ownership interest in a corporation or partnership is the percentage equal to the ratio of (A) the sum of the liquidation values of all interests in the entity held by the person to (B) the sum of the liquidation values of all outstanding interest in the entity. The liquidation value of an interest in an entity is the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property that would be distributed with respect to such interest upon the liquidation of the entity after satisfaction of liabilities to persons having interests in the entity solely as creditors. With respect to an entity that has interests outstanding that grant a presently-exercisable option to acquire or right to convert into or otherwise acquire an interest in the entity other than solely as a creditor, the liquidation value of all interests in such entity shall be calculated as though such option or right had been exercised, giving effect both to the payment of any consideration required to exercise the option or right and to the issuance of the additional interest.

The fair market value of the assets of the entity, the amount of cash held by the entity, and the amount of liabilities to persons having interests solely as creditors if determined for this purpose on the date with respect to which the percentage ownership interest is determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The rules of this paragraph (e)(2) are illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Corporation K's only assets are stock and securities with a fair market value as of the applicable determination date of $20,000,000 K's assets are subject to liabilities of $10,000,000. Among K's liabilities are a $1,000,000 loan from L, under the terms of which L is entitled, upon payment of the loan principal, to a profit share equal to 10 percent of the excess of the fair market value of K's assets over $18,000,000, but only if all other corporate liabilities have been paid. K has two classes of stock, common and preferred. PS1 and PS2 each own 100 of the 200 outstanding shares of preferred stock. CS1 and CS2 each own 500 of the 1,000 outstanding shares of common stock. Each preferred shareholder is entitled to $10,000 per share of preferred stock upon liquidation, subject to payment of all corporate liabilities and to any amount owed to L, but before any common shareholder is paid. The liquidation value of L's interest in K, which constitutes an interest other than an interest solely as a creditor, is $1,200 ($1,000,000 principal of the loan to K plus $200,000 (10 percent of the excess of $20,000,000 over $18,000,000). The liquidation value of each of PS1's and PS2's blocks of preferred stock is $1,000,000 ($10,000 times 100 shares each). The liquidation value of each of CS1's and CS2's blocks of common stock is $3,900,000 [$20,000,000 (the total fair market value of K's assets)--$9,000,000 (liabilities to creditors other than L)--$1,200,000 (L's liquidation value)--$2,000,000 (PS1's and PS2's liquidation value)) times 50 percent (the percentage of common stock owned by each)]. The sum of the liquidation values of all of the outstanding interests in K (i.e., interests other than solely as a creditor) is $11,000,000 [$1,200,000 (L's liquidation value) + $2,000,000 (PS1's and PS2's liquidation values) + $7,800,000 (CS1's and CS2's liquidation values)]. Each of CS1's and CS2's percentage ownership interests in K is 35.5 percent ($3,900,000 divided by $11,000,000). Each of PS1's and PS2's percentage ownership interests in K is 9 percent ($1,000,000 divided by $11,000,000). L's percentage ownership interest in K is 11 percent ($1,200,000 divided by $11,000,000).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. A, a U.S. person, and B, a foreign person are partners in a partnership the only asset of which is a parcel of undeveloped land located in the United States that was purchased by the partnership in 1980 for $300,000. The partnership has no liabilities, and its capital is $300,000. A's and B's interests in the capital of the partnership are 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, and A and B each has a 50 percent profit interest in the partnership. The partnership agreement provides that upon liquidation any unrealized gain will be distributed in accordance with the partners' profit interest. In 1984 the partnership has no items of income or deduction, and the fair market value of its parcel of undeveloped land is $500,000. In 1984 the percentage ownership interest of A in the partnership is 35 percent [the ratio of $100,000 (the liquidation value of A's profit interest in 1984) plus $75,000 (the liquidation value of A's 25 percent interest in the partnership's $300,000 capital) to $500,000 (the sum of the liquidation values of all outstanding interests in the partnership)]. The percentage ownership interest of B in the partnership in 1984 is 65 percent [the ratio of $325,000 (B's $100,000 profit interest plus his $225,000 capital interest) to $500,000]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Proportionate share of assets held by trusts and estates--(i) In general. A person's proportionate or pro rata share of assets held by a trust or estate is determined by multiplying--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The person's percentage ownership interest in the trust or estate, by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The fair market value of the assets held by the trust or estate (or the book value of such assets, in the case of a determination pursuant to Sec. 1.897-2(b)(2)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Percentage ownership interest--(A) General rule. A person's percentage ownership interest in a trust or an estate--is the percentage equal to the ratio of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The sum of the actuarial values of such person's interests in the cash and other assets held by the trust or estate after satisfaction of the liabilities of the trust or estate to persons holding interests in the trust or estate solely as creditors, to (2) the entire amount of such cash and other assets after satisfaction of liabilities to persons holding interests in the trust or estate solely as creditors. For purposes of calculating this ratio, the fair market value of the trust's or estate's assets, the amount of cash held by the trust or estate, and the amount of the liabilities to persons having interests solely as creditors is determined on the date with respect to which the percentage ownership interest is determined. With respect to a trust or estate that has interests outstanding that grant a presently-exercisable option to acquire or right to convert into or otherwise acquire an interest in the trust or estate other than solely as a creditor, the liquidation value of all interests in such entity shall be calculated as though such option or right had been exercised, giving effect both to the payment of any consideration required to exercise the option or right and to the issuance of the additional interest. With respect to a trust or estate that has interests outstanding that entitle any person to a distribution of U.S. real property interests upon liquidation that is disproportionate to such person's interest in the total assets of the trust or estate, such disproportionate right shall be disregarded in the calculation of the interest-holders' proportionate share of the U.S. real property interests held by the entity. For purposes of determining his own percentage ownership interest in a trust, a grantor or other person will be treated as owning any portion of the trust's cash and other assets which such person is treated as owning under sections 671 through 679.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Discretionary trusts and estates. In determining percentage ownership interest in a trust or an estate, the sum of the definitely ascertainable actuarial values of interests in the cash and the other assets of the trust or estate held by persons in existence on the date with respect to which such determination is made must equal the amount in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A)(2) of this section. If the amount in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A)(2) of this section exceeds the sum of the definitely ascertainable actuarial values of the interests held by persons in existence on the determination date, the excess will be considered to be owned in total by each beneficiary who is in existence on such date, whose interest in the excess is not definitely ascertainable and who is potentially entitled to such excess. However, such excess shall not be considered to be owned in total by each beneficiary if the discretionary terms of the trust or estate were included for a principal purpose of avoiding the provisions of section 897, 1445, or 6039C by causing assets other than U.S. real property interests to be attributed in total to each beneficiary. The rules of this paragraph (e)(3) are illustrated by the following example.</p><p class="depth0">Example. A, a U.S. person, established a trust on December 31, 1984, and contributed real property with a fair market value of $10,000 to the trust. The terms of that trust provided that the trustee, a bank that is unrelated to A, at its discretion may retain trust income or may distribute it to X, a foreign person, or to the head of state of any country other than the United States. The remainder upon the death of X is to go in equal shares to such of Y and Z, both foreign persons, as survive X. On December 31, 1984, the total value of the trust's assets is $10,000. On the same date, the actuarial values of the remainder interests of Y and Z in the corpus of the trust are definitely ascertainable. They are $1,000 and $500, respectively. Neither the income interest of X nor of the head of state of any country other than the United States has a definitely ascertainable

actuarial value on December 31, 1984. The interests of Y and Z in the income portion of the trust similarly have no definitely ascertainable actuarial values on such date since the income may be distributed rather than retained by the trust. Since the sum of the actuarial values of definitely ascertainable interests of persons in existence ($1,500) is less than $10,000, the difference ($8,500) is treated as owned by each beneficiary who is in existence on December 31, 1984, and who is potentially entitled to such excess. Therefore, X, Y, Z, and the head of state of any country other than the United States are each considered as owning the entire $8,500 income interest in the trust. On December 31, 1984, the total actuarial value of X's interest is $8,500, and his percentage ownership interest is 85 percent. The total actuarial value of Y's interest in the trust is $9,500 ($1,000 plus $8,500), and his percentage ownership interest is 95 percent. The total actuarial value of Z's interest is $9,000 ($500 plus $8,500), and his percentage ownership interest is 90 percent. The actuarial value of the interest of the head of state of each country other than the United States is $8,500, and his percentage ownership interest is 85 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Dates with respect to which percentage ownership interests are determined. The dates with respect to which percentage ownership interests are determined are the applicable determination dates outlined in Sec. 1.897-2 or in regulations under section 6039C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Asset used or held for use in a trade or business--(1) In general. The term ``asset used or held for use in a trade or business'' means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Property, other than a U.S. real property interest, that is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Stock in trade of an entity or other property of a kind which would properly be included in the inventory of the entity if on hand at the close of the taxable year, or property held by the entity primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its trade or business, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Depreciable property used or held for use in the trade or business, as described in section 1231(b)(1) but without regard to the holding period limitations of section 1231(b), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Livestock, including poultry, used or held for use in a trade or business for draft, breeding, dairy, or sporting purposes, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Goodwill and going concern value, patents, inventions, formulas copyrights, literary, musical, or artistic compositions, trademarks, trade names, franchises, licenses, customer lists, and similar intangible property, but only to the extent that such property is used or held for use in the entity's trade or business and subject to the valuation rules of Sec. 1.897-1(o)(4), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Cash, stock, securities, receivables of all kinds, options or contracts to acquire any of the foregoing, and options or contracts to acquire commodities, but only to the extent that such assets are used or held for use in the corporation's trade or business and do not constitute U.S. real property interests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Used or held for use in a trade or business. An asset is used or held for use in an entity's trade or business if it is, under the principles of Sec. 1.864-4(c)(2)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Held for the principal purpose of promoting the present conduct of the trade or business,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Acquired and held in the ordinary course of the trade or business, as, for example, in the case of an account or note receivable arising from that trade or business (including the performance of services), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Otherwise held in a direct relationship to the trade or business.

In determining whether an asset is held in a direct relationship to the trade or business, consideration shall be given to whether the asset is needed in that trade or business. An asset shall be considered to be needed in a trade or business only if the asset is held to meet the present needs of that trade or business and not its anticipated future needs. An asset shall be considered as needed in the trade or business if, for example, the asset is held to meet the operating expenses of that trade or business. Conversely, an asset shall be considered as not needed in the trade or business if, for example, the asset is held for the purpose of providing for future diversification into a new trade or business, future expansion of trade or business activities, future plant replacement, or future business contingencies. An asset that is held to meet reserve or capitalization requirements imposed by applicable law shall be presumed to be held in a direct relationship to the trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special rules concerning liquid assets--(i) Safe harbor amount. Assets described in paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section shall be presumed to be used or held for use in a trade or business, in an amount up to 5 percent of the fair market value of other assets used or held for use in the trade or business. However, the rule of this paragraph (f)(3)(i) shall not apply with respect to any assets described in paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section that are held or acquired for the principal purpose of avoiding the provisions of section 897 or 1445.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Investment companies. Assets described in paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section shall be presumed to be used or held for use in an entity's trade or business if the principal business of the entity is trading or investing in such assets for its own account. An entity's principal business shall be presumed to be trading or investing in assets described in paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section if the fair market value of such assets held by the entity equals or exceeds 90 percent of the sum of the fair market values of the entity's U.S. real property interests, interests in real property located outside the United States, assets otherwise used or held for use in trade or business, and assets described in paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The application of this paragraph (f) may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. M, a domestic corporation engaged in industrial manufacturing, is required to hold a large current cash balance for the purposes of purchasing materials and meeting its payroll. The amount of the cash balance so required varies because of the fluctuating seasonal nature of the corporation's business. In months when large cash balances are not required, the corpration invests the surplus amount in U.S. Treasury bills. Since both the cash and the Treasury bills are held to meet the present needs of the business, they are held in a direct relationship to that business, and, therefore, constitute assets used or held for use in the trade or business.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. R, a domestic corporation engaged in the manufacture of goods, engages a stock brockerage firm to manage securities which were purchased with funds from R's general surplus reserves. The funds invested in these securities are intended to provide for the future expansion of R into a new trade or business. Thus, the funds are not necessary for the present needs of the business; they are accordingly not held in a direct relationshp to the business and do not constitute assets used or held for use in the trade or business.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. B, a federally chartered and regulated bank, is required by law to hold substantial reserves of cash, stock, and securities. Pursuant to the rule of paragraph (f)(2) of this section, such assets are presumed to be held in a direct relationship to B's business, and thus constitute assets used or held for use in the trade or business. In addition, B holds substantial loan receivables which are acquired and held in the ordinary course of its banking business. Pursuant to the rule of paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, such receivables constitute assets used or held for use in the trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Disposition. For purposes of sections 897, 1445, and 6039C, the term ``disposition'' means any transfer that would constitute a disposition by the transferor for any purpose of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder. The severance of crops or timber and the extracion of minerals do not alone constitute the disposition of a U.S. real property interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Gain or loss. The amount of gain or loss arising from the disposition of the U.S. real property interest shall be determined as provided in section 1001 (a) and (b). Such gain or loss shall be subject to the provisions of section 897 (a) and (b), unless a nonrecognition provision is applicable pursuant to section 897 (d) or (e) and regulations thereunder. Amounts otherwise treated for Federal income tax purposes as principal and interest payments on debt obligations of all kinds (including obligations that are interests other than solely as a creditor) do not give rise to gain or loss that is subject to section 897(a). However, principal payments on installment obligations described in Sec. Sec. 1.897-1(d)(2)(ii)(A) and 1.897-1(d)(3)(ii)(A) do give rise to gain or loss that is subject to section 897(a), to the extent such gain or loss is required to be recognized pursuant to section 453. The rules of paragraphs (g) and (h) are illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Foreign individual C has an undivided fee interest in a parcel of real property located in the United States. The fair market value of C's interest is $70,000, and C's basis in such interest is $50,000. The only liability to which the real property is subject

is the liability of $65,000 secured by a mortgage in the same amount. C transfers his fee interest in the property subject to the mortgage by gift to D. C realizes $15,000 of gain upon such transfer. As a transfer by gift constitutes a disposition for purposes of the Code, and as gain is realized upon that transfer, the gift is a disposition for purposes of sections 897, 1445, and 6039C and is subject to section 897(a) to the extent of the gain realized. However, section 897(a) would not be applicable to the transfer if the mortgage on the U.S. real property were equal to or less than C's $50,000 basis, since the transfer then would not give rise to the realization of gain or loss under the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Foreign corporation Y makes a loan of $1 million to domestic individual Z, secured by a mortgage on residential real property purchased with the loan proceeds. The loan agreement provides that Y is entitled to receive fixed monthly payments from Z, constituting repayment of principal plus interest at a fixed rate. In addition, the agreement provides that Y is entitled to receive a percentage of the appreciation value of the real property as of the time that the loan is retired. The obligation in its entirety is considered debt for Federal income tax purposes. However, because of Y's right to share in the appreciation in value of the real property, the debt obligation gives Y an interest in the real property other than solely as a creditor. Nevertheless, as principal and interest payments do not constitute gain under section 1001 and paragraph (h) of this section, and both the monthly and final payments received by Y are considered to consist solely of principal and interest for Federal income tax purposes, section 897(a) shall not apply to Y's receipt of such payments. However, Y's sale of the debt obligation to foreign corporation A would give rise to gain that is subject to section 897(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Related person. For purposes of sections 897, 1445, and 6039C, persons are considered to be related if they are partners or partnerships described in section 707(b)(1) of the Code or if they are related within the meaning of section 267 (b) and (c) of the Code (except that section 267(f) shall apply without regard to section 1563(b)(2)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Domestic corporation. The term ``domestic corporation'' has the same meaning as set forth in section 7701(a) (3) and (4) and Sec. 301.7701-5. For purposes of sections 897 and 6039C, it also includes a foreign corporation with respect to which an election under section 897(i) and Sec. 1.897-3 or section 897(k) and Sec. 1.897-4 to be treated as domestic corporation is in effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Foreign corporation. The term ``foreign corporation'' has the meaning ascribed to such term in section 7701(a) (3) and (5) and Sec. 301.7701-5. For purposes of sections 897 and 6039C, however, the term does not include a foreign corporation with respect to which there is in effect an election under section 897(i) and Sec. 1.897-3 or section 897(k) and Sec. 1.897-4 to be treated as a domestic corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Established securities market. For purposes of sections 897, 1445, and 6039C, the term ``established securities market'' means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A national securities exchange which is registered under section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78f),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A foreign national securities exchange which is officially recognized, sanctioned, or supervised by governmental authority, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any over-the-counter market. An over-the-counter market is any market reflected by the existence of an interdealer quotation system. An interdealer quotation system is any system of general circulation to brokers and dealers which regularly disseminates quotations of stocks and securities by identified brokers or dealers, other than by quotation sheets which are prepared and distributed by a broker or dealer in the regular course of business and which contain only quotations of such broker or dealer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Fair market value--(1) In general. For purposes of sections 897, 1445, and 6039C only, the term ``fair market value'' means the value of the property determined in accordance with the rules, contained in this paragraph (o). The definition of fair market value provided herein is not to be used in the calculation of gain or loss from the disposition of a U.S. real property interest pursuant to section 1001. An independent professional appraisal of the value of property must be submitted only if such an appraisal is specifically requested in connection with the negotiation of a security agreement pursuant to section 1445.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Method of calculating fair market value--(i) In general. The fair market value of property is its gross value (as defined in paragraph (o)(2)(ii) of this

section) reduced by the outstanding balance of any debts secured by the property which are described in paragraph (o)(2)(iii) of this section. See Sec. 1.897-2(b) for the alternative use of book values in certain limited circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Gross value. Gross value is the price at which the property would change hands between an unrelated willing buyer and willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell and both having reasonable knowledge of all relevant facts. Generally, with respect to trade or business assets, going concern value should be used as it will provide the most accurate reflection of such a price. However, taxpayers may use other methods of valuation if they can establish that such method will provide a more accurate determination of gross value and if they consistently apply such method to all assets to be valued. See subdivisions (3) and (4) of this paragraph (o) for special rules with respect to the valuation of leases and of intangible assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Debts secured by the property. The gross value of property shall be reduced by the outstanding balance of debts that are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Secured by a mortgage or other security interest in the property that is valid and enforceable under the law of the jurisdiction in which the property is located, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Either (1) Incurred to acquire the property (including long-term financing obtained in replacement of construction loans or other short-term debt within one year of the acquisition or completion of the property), or (2) otherwise incurred in direct connection with the property, such as property tax liens upon real property or debts incurred to maintain or improve property.

In addition, if any debt described in this paragraph (o)(2)(iii) is refinanced for a valid business purpose (such as obtaining a more favorable rate of interest), the principal amount of the replacement debt does not exceed the outstanding balance of the original debt, and the replacement debt is secured by the property, then the gross value of the property shall be reduced by the replacement debt. Obligations to related persons shall not be taken into account for purposes of this paragraph (o)(2)(iii) unless such obligations constitute interests solely as a creditor pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (d)(4) of this section and unless the related person has made similar loans to unrelated persons on similar terms and conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Anti-abuse rule. The gross value of real property located outside the United States and of assets used or held for use in a trade or business shall be reduced by the outstanding balance of any debt that was entered into for the principal purpose of avoiding the provisions of section 897, 1445, or 6039C by enabling the corporation to acquire such assets. The existence of such a purpose shall be determined with reference to all the facts and circumstances. Debts that a particular corporation routinely enters into in the ordinary course of its acquisition of assets used or held for use in its trade or business will not be considered to be entered into for the principal purpose of avoiding the provisions of section 897, 1445, or 6039C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fair market value of leases and options. For purposes of sections 897, 1445, and 6039C, the fair market value of a leasehold interest in real property is the price at which the lease could be assigned or the property sublet, neither party to such transaction being under any compulsion to enter into the transaction and both having reasonable knowledge of all relevant facts. Thus, the value of a leasehold interest will generally consist of the present value, over the period of the lease remaining, of the difference between the rental provided for in the lease and the current rental value of the real property. A leasehold interest bearing restrictions on its assignment or sublease has a fair market value of zero, but only if those restrictions in practical effect preclude (rather than merely condition) the lessee's ability to transfer, at a gain, the benefits of a favorable lease. The normal commercial practice of lessors may be used to determine whether restrictions in a lease have the practical effect of precluding transfer at a gain. The fair market value of an option to purchase any property is, similarly, the price at which the option

could be sold, consisting generally of the difference between the option price and the fair market value of the property, taking proper account of any restrictions upon the transfer of the option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Fair market value of intangible assets. For purposes of determining whether a corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation, the fair market value of intangible assets described in Sec. 1.897-1(f)(1)(ii) may be determined in accordance with the following rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Purchase price. Intangible assets described in Sec. 1.897-1(f)(1)(ii) that were acquired by purchase from a person not related to the purchaser within the meaning of Sec. 1.897-1(i) may be valued at their purchase price. However, such purchase price must be adjusted to reflect any amortization required by generally accepted accounting principles applied in the United States. Intangible assets acquired by purchase shall include any amounts allocated to goodwill or going concern valued pursuant to section 338(b)(3) and regulations thereunder. Intangible assets acquired by purchase shall not include assets that were acquired indirectly through an acquisition of stock to which section 338 does not apply.

Sec. 1.897-2  United States real property holding corporations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose and scope. This section provides rules regarding the definition and consequences of U.S. real property holding corporation status. U.S. real property holding corporation status is important for determining whether gain from the disposition by a foreign person of an interest in a domestic corporation is taxable. Such status is also important for purposes of the withholding and reporting requirements of sections 1445 and 6039C. For example, a person that buys stock of a U.S. real property holding corporation from a foreign person is required to withhold under section 1445. In addition, for purposes of determining whether another corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation, an interest in a foreign corporation is a U.S. real property interest unless it is established that the foreign corporation is not a U.S. real property holding corporation. The general definition of a U.S. real property holding corporation is provided in paragraph (b) of this section. Paragraph (c) provides rules regarding the dates on which U.S. real property

holding corporation status must be determined. The assets that must be included in making the determination of a corporation's status are set forth in paragraph (d), while paragraph (e) provides special rules regarding the treatment of interests held by a corporation in partnerships, trusts, estates, and other corporations. Rules regarding the termination of U.S. real property holding corporation status are set forth in paragraph (f). Paragraph (g) explains the manner in which an interest-holder can establish that a corporation is not a U.S. real property holding corporation, and paragraph (h) provides rules regarding certain notification requirements applicable to corporations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> U.S. real property holding corporation--(1) In general. A corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation if the fair market value of the U.S. real property interests held by the corporation on any applicable determination date equals or exceeds 50 percent of the sum of the fair market values of its--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> U.S. real property interests;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Interests in real property located outside the United States; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Assets other than those described in subdivision (i) or (ii) of this paragraph (b)(1) that are used or held for use in its trade or business.

See paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section for rules regarding the directly and indirectly held assets that must be included in the determination of whether a corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation. The term ``interest in real property located outside the United States'' means an interest other than solely as a creditor (as defined in Sec. 1.897-1(d)) in real property (as defined in Sec. 1.897-(b)) that is located outside the United States or the Virgin Islands. If a corporation qualifies as a U.S. real property holding corporation on any applicable determination date after June 18, 1980, any interest in it shall be treated as a U.S. real property interest for a period of five years from that date, unless the provisions of paragraph (f)(2) of this section are applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Alternative test--(i) In general. The fair market value of a corporation's U.S. real property interests shall be presumed to be less than 50 percent of the fair market value of the aggregate of its assets described in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section if on an applicable determination date the total book value of the U.S. real property interests held by the corporation is 25 percent or less of the book value of the aggregate of the corporation's assets described in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Definition of book value. For purposes of this section and Sec. 1.897-1(e) the term ``book value'' shall be defined as follows. In the case of assets that are held directly by the corporation, the term means the value at which an item is carried on the financial accounting records of the corporation, if such value is determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied in the United States. In the case of assets of which a corporation is treated as holding a pro rata share pursuant to paragraphs (e) (2) and (3) of this section and Sec. 1.897-1(e), the term ``book value'' means the corporation's share of the value at which the asset is carried on the financial accounting records of the entity that directly holds the asset, if such value is determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied in the United States. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii), an entity need not keep all of its books in accordance with U.S. accounting principles, so long as the value of the relevant assets is determined in accordance therewith.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Denial of presumption. If the Internal Revenue Service determines, on the basis of information as to the fair market values of a corporation's assets, that the presumption allowed by this paragraph (b)(2) may not accurately reflect the status of the corporation, the Service will notify the corporation that it may not rely upon the presumption. The Service will provide a written notice to the corporation that sets forth the general grounds for the Service's conclusion that the presumption may be inaccurate. By the 90th day following the date on which the corporation receives the Service's notification, the corporation must determine whether on its most recent determination date it was a U.S. real property holding corporation pursuant

to the general rule set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and must notify the Service of its determination. If the corporation determines that it was not a U.S. real property holding corporation pursuant to the general rule, then the corporation may upon future determination dates rely upon the presumption allowed by this paragraph (b)(2), unless on the basis of additional information the Service again requests that the determination be made pursuant to the general rule. If the corporation determines that it was a U.S. real property holding corporation on its most recent determination date, then by the 180th day following the date on which the corporation received the Service's notification the corporation (if a domestic corporation) must notify each holder of an interest in it that contrary to any prior representations it was a U.S. real property holding corporation as of its most recent determination date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Applicability of penalties. A corporation that had previously relied upon the presumption allowed by this paragraph (b)(2) but that is determined to be a U.S. real property holding corporation shall not be subject to penalties for any incorrect notice previously given pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section, if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The corporation in fact carried out the necessary calculations enabling it to rely upon the presumption allowed by this paragraph (b)(2); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The corporation complies with the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section. However, a corporation shall remain subject to any applicable penalties if at the time of its reliance on the presumption allowed by this paragraph (b)(2) the corporation knew that the book value of relevant assets was substantially higher or lower than the fair market value of those assets and therefore had reason to believe that under the general test of paragraph (b)(1) of this section the corporation would probably be a U.S. real property holding corporation. Information with respect to the fair market value of its assets is known by a corporation if such information is included on any books and records of the corporation or its agent, is known by its directors or officers, or is known by employees who in the course of their employment have reason to know such information. A corporation relying upon the presumption allowed by this paragraph (b)(2) has no affirmative duty to determine the fair market values of assets if such values are not otherwise known to it in accordance with the preceding sentence. The rules of this paragraph (b)(2)(iv) may be illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. DC is a domestic corporation engaged in light manufacturing that knows that it has foreign shareholders. On its December 31, 1985 determination date DC held assets used in its trade or business, consisting largely of recently-purchased equipment, with a book value of $500,000. DC's only real property interest was a factory that it had occupied for over 50 years, which had a book value of $200,000. The factory was located in a deteriorated downtown area, and DC had no knowledge of any facts indicating that the fair market value of the property was substantially higher than its book value. Therefore, DC was entitled to rely upon the presumption allowed by Sec. 1.897-2(b)(2) and any incorrect statement pursuant to Sec. 1.897-2(h) that arose out of such reliance would not give rise to penalties.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except as follows. By the time of DC's December 31, 1989 determination date, the downtown area in which DC's factory was located had become the subject of an extensive urban renewal program. On December 1, 1989, the president of DC was offered $750,000 for the factory by a developer who planned to convert the property into condominiums. Because DC thus had knowledge of the fair market value of its assets which made it clear that the corporation would probably be a U.S. real property holding corporation under the general rule of Sec. 1.897-2(b)(1), DC was not entitled to rely upon the presumption allowed by Sec. 1.897-2(b)(2) after December 1, 1989, and any false statements arising out of such reliance thereafter would give rise to penalties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Effect on interest-holders and related persons. For the effect on interest holders and related persons of reliance on a statement issued by a corporation that made a determination as to whether it was a U.S. real property holding corporation under the provisions of Sec. 1.897-2(b), see Sec. Sec. 1.897-2(g)(1)(ii)(A) and 1.897-2(g)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Determination dates for applying U.S. real property holding corporation

test--(1) In general. Whether a corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation is to be determined as of the following dates:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The last day of the corporation's taxable year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The date on which the corporation acquires any U.S. real property interest;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The date on which the corporation disposes of an interest in real property located outside the United States or disposes of other assets used or held for use in a trade or business during the calendar year, subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of a corporation that is treated pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) or (5) of this section as owning a portion of the assets held by an entity in which the corporation directly or indirectly holds an interest, the date on which that entity either (A) acquires a U.S. real property interest, (B) disposes of an interest in real property located outside the United States or (C) disposes of other assets used or held for use in a trade or business during the calendar year, subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. A determination that is triggered by a transaction described in subdivision (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this paragraph (c)(1) must take such transaction into account. However, the first determination of a corporation's status need not be made until the 120th day after the later of the date of incorporation or of the date on which the corporation first acquires a shareholder. In addition, no determination of a corporation's status need be made during the 12-month period beginning on the date on which a corporation adopts a plan of complete liquidation, provided that all the assets of the corporation (other than assets retained to meet claims) are distributed within such period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transactions not requiring a determination--(i) Transactions by corporation. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a determination of U.S. real property holding corporation status need not be made on the date of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A corporation's disposition of inventory or livestock (as described in Sec. 1.897-1(f)(1)(i) (A) and (C));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The satisfaction of accounts receivable arising from the disposition of inventory or livestock or from the performance of services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The disbursement of cash to meet the regular operating needs of the business (e.g., to acquire inventory or to pay wages and salaries);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A corporation's disposition of assets used or held for use in a trade or business (other than inventory or livestock) not in excess of a limitation amount determined in accordance with the rules of subdivision (iii) of this paragraph (c)(2); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> A corporation's acquisition of U.S. real property interests not in excess of a limitation amount determined in accordance with the rules of subdivision (iii) of this paragraph (c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Transactions by entity other than corporation. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(iv) or (c)(2)(v) of this section, in the case of a corporation that is treated as owning a portion of the assets held by an entity in which the corporation directly or indirectly holds an interest, a determination of U.S. real property holding corporation status need not be made on the date of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The entity's disposition of inventory or livestock (as described in Sec. 1.897-1(f)(1)(i) (A) and (C));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The satisfaction of accounts receivable arising from the entity's disposition of inventory or livestock or from the performance of personal services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The entity's disbursement of cash to meet the regular operating needs of its business (e.g. to acquire inventory or to pay wages and salaries);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The entity's disposition of assets used or held for use in a trade or business (other than inventory or livestock) not in excess of a limitation amount determined in accordance with the rules of subdivision (iii) of this paragraph (c)(2); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The entity's acquisition of U.S. real property interests not in excess of a limitation amount determined in accordance with the rules of subdivision (iii) of this paragraph (c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Calculation of limitation amount. The amount of assets used or held for use in a trade or business that may be disposed of, and the amount of U.S.

real property interests that may be acquired, by a corporation or other entity without triggering a determination date shall be calculated in accordance with the following rules:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If, in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, a corporation on its most recent determination date was considered to hold U.S. real property interests having a fair market value that was less than 25 percent of the aggregate fair market value of all the assets it was considered to hold, then the applicable limitation amount shall be 10 percent of the fair market value of all trade or business assets or all U.S. real property interests (as applicable) held directly by the corporation or by another entity described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section on that determination date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If, in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, a corporation on its most recent determination date was considered to hold U.S. real property interests having a fair market value that was equal to or greater than 25 and less than 35 percent of the aggregate fair market value of all the assets it was considered to hold, then the applicable limitation amount shall be 5 percent of the fair market value of all trade or bussiness assets or all U.S. real property interests (as applicable) held directly by the corporation or by another entity described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section on that determination date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If, in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, a corporation on its most recent determination date was considered to hold U.S. real property interests having a fair market value that

was equal to or greater than 35 percent of the aggregate fair market value of all the assets it was considered to hold, then the applicable limitation amount shall be 2 percent of the fair market value of all trade or business assets or all U.S. real property interests (as applicable) held directly by the corporation or by another entity described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section on that determination date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If a corporation is not a U.S. real property holding corporation under the alternative test of paragraph (b)(2) of this section (relating to the book value of the corporation's assets), then the applicable limitation shall be 10 percent of the book value of all trade or business assets or all U.S. real property interests (as applicable) held directly by the corporation or by another entity described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section on the most recent determination date.</p><p class="depth0">Dispositions or acquisitions by the corporation or other entity of assets having a value less than the applicable limitation amount must be cumulated by the corporation or entity making such dispositions or acquisitions, and a determination must be made on the date of a transaction that causes the total of either type to exceed the applicable limitation. Once a determination is triggered by a transaction that causes the applicable limitation to be exceeded, the computation of the amount of trade or business assets disposed of or real property interests acquired after that date shall begin again at zero.</p><p class="depth0">The rules of this paragraph (c)(2) may be illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. DC is a domestic corporation, no class of stock of which is regularly traded on an established securities market, that knows that it has several foreign shareholders. As of December 31, 1984, DC holds U.S. real property interests with a fair market value of $500,000, no real property interests located outside the U.S. and other assets used in its trade or business with a fair market value of $1,600,000. Thus, the fair market value of DC's U.S. real property interests ($500,000) is less than 25% ($525,000) of the total ($2,100,000) of DC's U.S. real property interests ($500,000), interests in real property located outside the United States (zero), and assets used or held for use in a trade or business ($1,600,000). DC is not a U.S. real property holding corporation, and under the rule of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section it may dispose of trade or business assets with a fair market value equal to 10 percent ($160,000) of the total fair market value ($1,600,000) of such assets held by it on its most recent determination date (December 31, 1984), without triggering a determination of its U.S. real property holding corporation status. Therefore, when DC disposes of $60,000 worth of trade or business assets (other than inventory or livestock) on March 1, 1985, and again on April 1, 1985, no determination of its status is required on either date. However, when

DC disposes of a further $60,000 worth of such trade or business assets on May 1, its total dispositions of such assets ($180,000) exceeds its applicable limitation amount, and DC is therefore required to determine its U.S. real property holding corporation status. On May 1, 1985, the fair market value of DC's U.S. real property interests ($500,000) is greater than 25 percent ($480,000) and less than 35 percent ($672,000) of the total ($1,920,000) of DC's U.S. real property interests ($500,000), interests in real property located outside the United States (zero), and assets used or held for use in a trade or business ($1,420,000). DC is still not a U.S. real property holding corporation, but must now compute its applicable limitation amount as of the May 1 determination date. Under the rule of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section. DC could now dispose of trade or business assets other than inventory or livestock with a total fair market value equal to 5 percent of the fair market value of all trade or business assets held by DC on the May 1 determination date. Therefore, disposition of such trade or business assets with a fair market value of more than $71,000 (5 percent of $1,420,000) will trigger a further determination date for DC.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. DC is a domestic corporation, no class of stock of which is regularly traded on an established securities market, that knows that it has several foreign shareholders. As of December 31, 1986, DC's only assets are a U.S. real property interest with a fair market value of $300,000 other assets used or held for use in its trade or business with a fair market value of $600,000, and a 50 percent partnership interest in domestic partnership DP. DC's interest in DP constitutes a percentage ownership interest in the partnership of 50 percent, and pursuant to the rules of paragraph (e)(2) of this section DC is treated as owning a portion of the assets of DP determined by multiplying that percentage by the fair market value of DP's assets. As of December 31, 1986, DP's only assets are U.S. real property interests with a fair market value of $120,000 and other assets used in its trade or business with a fair market value of $380,000. As of its December 31, 1986, determination date, the fair market value ($360,000) of the U.S. real property interests DC holds ($300,000) and is treated as holding ($80,000 [The fair market value of DP's U.S. real property interest ($120,000) multiplied by DC's percentage ownership interest in DP (50 percent)]), is equal to 31 percent of the sum of the fair market values ($1,150,000) of the U.S. real property interests DC holds and is treated as holding ($360,000) DC's interest in real property located outside the United States (zero), and assets used or held for use in a trade or business that DC holds or is treated as holding ($790,000 [$600,000 (held directly) plus $190,000 (DC's 50 percent share of assets used or held for use in a trade or business by DP)]). Thus, under the rules of paragraph (c)(2) (i) and (iii)(B) of this section DC may dispose of assets used or held for use in its trade or business with a fair market value equal to 5 percent ($30,000) of the total fair market value ($600,000) of such assets held directly by it on its most recent determination date (December 31, 1986), without triggering a determination of its U.S. real property holding corporation status. In addition, under the rules of paragraph (c)(2) (ii) and (iii)(A) of this section, a determination date for DC would not be triggered by DP's disposition of trade or business assets (other than inventory or livestock) with a fair market value equal to 5 percent ($19,000) of the total fair market value ($380,000) of such assets held by it as of DC's most recent determination date (December 31, 1986). However, any disposition of such assets by DP exceeding that limitation would trigger a determination of DC's U.S. real property holding corporation status. In addition under the rule of paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, any disposition of a U.S. real property interest by DP would trigger a determination date for DC, while under the rule of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section no disposition of inventory or livestock by DP would trigger a determination for DC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Alternative monthly determination dates--(i) In general. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section, a corporation may choose to determine its U.S. real property holding corporation status in accordance with the rules of this paragraph (c)(3). In the case of a corporation that has determined that it is not a U.S. real property holding corporation pursuant to the alternative test of paragraph (b)(2) of this section (relating to the book value of the corporation's assets), the rules of this paragraph (c)(3) may be applied by using book values rather than fair market values in all relevant calculations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Monthly determinations. A corporation that determines its U.S. real property holding corporation status in accordance with the rules of this paragraph (c)(3) must make a determination at the end of each calendar month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Transactional determinations. A corporation that determines its U.S. real property holding corporation status in accordance with the rules of this paragraph (c)(3) must make a determination as of the date on which, pursuant to a single transaction (consisting of one or more transfers):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> U.S. real property interests are acquired, and/or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Interests in real property located outside the U.S. and/or assets used or held for use in a trade or business are disposed of,

if the total fair market value of the assets acquired and/or disposed of exceeds 5 percent of the sum of the fair market values of the U.S. real property interests, interests in real property located outside the U.S., and assets used or held for use in a trade or business held by the corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Exceptions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph (c)(3), the first determination of a corporation's status need not be made until the 120th day after the later of the date of incorporation or the date on which the corporation first acquires a shareholder. In addition, no determination of a corporation's status need be made during the 12-month period beginning on the date on which a corporation adopts a plan of complete liquidation, if all the assets of the corporation (other than assets retained to meet claims) are distributed within such period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Valuation date methods--(i) In general. For purposes of determining whether a corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation on any applicable determination date, the fair market value of the assets held by the corporation (in accordance with Sec. 1.897-2(d)) as of that determination date must be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Alternative valuation date method for determination dates other than the last day of the taxable year. For purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, if an applicable determination date under paragraph (c) (1), (2), or (3) of this section is other than the last day of the taxable year, property may be valued as of the later of the last day of the previous taxable year or the date such property was acquired. For purposes of the determination date that falls on the last day of the taxable year, fair market value as of that date must always be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Consistent methods. The valuation date method selected under this paragraph (c)(4) for the first determination date in a taxable year must be used for all subsequent determination dates for such year. In addition, the valuation date method selected must be used for all property with respect to which the determination is made. The use of one method for one taxable year does not preclude the use of the other method for any other taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Illustrations. The rules of this paragraph (c) are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Nonresident alien individual C purchased 100 shares of stock of domestic corporation K on July 26, 1985. Although K has additional shares of common stock outstanding, its stock has never been traded on an established securities market. At all times during calendar year 1985, K's only assets were a parcel of U.S. real estate (parcel A) and a parcel of country Z real estate (parcel B). On December 31, 1985, the fair market value of parcel A was $1,000,000 and the fair market value of parcel B was $2,000,000. For purposes of determining whether K was a U.S. real property holding corporation during 1985, the only applicable determination date was December 31, 1985, because K did not make any acquisitions or dispositions described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section during the year. The test of paragraph (b) of this section is applied using the fair market value of the property held on that date. K was not a U.S. real property holding corporation during 1985 because as of December 31, 1985, the fair market value ($1,000,000) of the U.S. real property interests held by K did not equal or exceed 50 percent ($1,500,000) of the sum ($3,000,000) of the fair market value of K's U.S. real property interest ($1,000,000), the interests in real property located outside the United States ($2,000,000), plus other assets used or held for use by K in a trade or business (zero).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1, except that on April 7, 1986, K purchased another parcel of U.S. real estate for $2,000,000. K's purchase of real property on April 7 triggered a determination on that date. As provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, K chooses to use the value of parcels A and B as of the previous December 31, while newly acquired parcel C must be valued as of its acquisition on April 7, 1986. On that date, K qualifies as a U.S. real property holding corporation, since the fair market value of its U.S. real property interests ($3,000,000) exceeds 50 percent ($2,500,000) of the sum ($5,000,000) of the fair market value of K's U.S. real property interests ($3,000,000), its interests in real property located outside the U.S. ($2,000,000), and its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business (zero).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Assets held by a corporation. The assets that must be included in the determination of whether a corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation are the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> U.S. real property interests that are held directly by the corporation (including directly-held interests in foreign corporations that are treated as U.S. real property interests pursuant to the rules of paragraph (e)(1) of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interests in real property located outside the United States that are held directly by the corporation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Assets used or held for use in a trade or business that are held directly by the corporation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A proportionate share of assets held through a partnership, trust, or estate pursuant to the rules of paragraph (e)(2) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A proportionate share of assets held through a domestic or foreign corporation in which a corporation holds a controlling interest, pursuant to the rules of paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Special rules regarding assets held by a corporation--(1) Interests in foreign corporations. For purposes only of determining whether any corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation, an interest in a foreign corporation shall be treated as a U.S. real property interest unless it is established that the interest was not a U.S. real property interest under the rules of this section on the applicable determination date. The rules of paragraph (g)(2) of this section must be complied with to establish that the interest is not a U.S. real property interest. However, regardless of whether an interest in a foreign corporation is treated as a U.S. real property interest for this purpose, gain or loss from the disposition of an interest in such corporation will not be treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business by reason of section 897(a). The rules of this paragraph (e)(1) are illustrated by the following examples. In each example, fair market value is determined as of the applicable determination dates under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Nonresident alien individual F holds all of the stock of domestic corporation DC. DC's only assets are 40 percent of the stock of foreign corporation FC, with a fair market value of $500,000, and a parcel of country W real estate, with a fair market value of $400,000. Foreign corporation FP, unrelated to DC, holds the other 60 percent of the stock of FC. FC's only asset is a parcel of U.S. real estate with a fair market value of $1,250,000. FC is a U.S. real property holding corporation because the fair market value of its U.S. real property interests ($1,250,000) exceeds 50 percent ($625,000) of the sum of the fair market values of its U.S. real property interests ($1,250,000), its interests in real property located outside the United States (zero), plus its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business (zero). Consequently DC's interest in FC is treated as a U.S. real property interest under the rules of this paragraph (e)(1). DC is a U.S. real property holding corporation because the fair market value ($500,000) of its U.S. real property interest (the stock of FC) exceeds 50 percent ($450,000) of the sum ($900,000) of the fair market value of its U.S. real property interests ($500,000), its interests in real property located outside the United States ($400,000), plus its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business (zero). If F disposes of her stock within 5 years of the current determination date, her gain or loss on the disposition of her stock in DC will be treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business under section 897(a). However, FP's gain on the disposition of its FC stock would not be subject to the provisions of section 897(a) because the stock of FC is a U.S. real property interest only for purposes of determining whether DC is a U.S. real property holding corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Nonresident alien individual B holds all of the stock of domestic corporation US. US's only assets are 40 percent of the stock of foreign corporation FC1. Nonresident alien individual N, unrelated to US, holds the other 60 percent of FC1's stock. FC1's only assets are 40 percent of the stock of foreign corporation FC2. The remaining 60 percent of the stock of FC2 is owned by nonresident alien individual X, who is unrelated to FC1. FC2's only asset is a parcel of U.S. real estate with fair market value of $1,000,000. FC2, therefore, is a U.S. real property holding corporation, and the stock of FC2 held by FC1 is a U.S. real property interest for purposes of determining whether FC1 is a U.S. real property holding corporation (but not for purposes of treating FC1's gain from the disposition of FC2 stock as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business under section 897(a)). As all of FC1's assets are U.S. real property interests, the stock of FC1 held by US is a U.S. real property interest for purposes of determining whether US is a U.S. real property holding corporation (but not for purposes of subjecting N's gain on the disposition of FC1 stock to the provisions of section 897(a)). As US is a domestic corporation and as all of its assets are U.S. real property interests, US is a U.S. real property holding corporation, and the stock of US held by B is a U.S. real property interest for purposes of section 897(a)).

Therefore, B's gain or loss upon the disposition of the stock of US within 5 years of the most recent determination date is subject to the provisions of section 897(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Proportionate ownership of assets held by partnerships, trusts, and estates. For purposes of determining whether a corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation, a holder of an interest in a partnership, a trust, or an estate (whether domestic or foreign) shall be treated pursuant to section 897(c)(4)(B) as holding a proportionate share of the assets held by the entity.

However, a holder of an interest shall not be treated as holding a proportionate share of assets that in the hands of the entity are subject to the rule of Sec. 1.897-1(f)(3)(ii) (concerning the trade or business assets of investment companies). Such proportionate share is to be determined in acordance with the rules of Sec. 1.897-1(e) on each applicable determination date. The interest in the entity shall itself be disregarded when a proportionate share of the entity's assets is attributed to the interest-holder pursuant to the rule of this paragraph (e)(2). Any asset treated as held by a holder of an interest by reason of this paragraph (e)(2) which is used or held for use in a trade or business by the partnership, trust, or estate shall be treated as so used or held for use by the holder of the interest. The proportionate ownership rule of this paragraph (e)(2) applies successively upward through a chain of ownership. The proportionate ownership rule of this paragraph (e)(2) is illustrated by the following examples. In each example fair market value is determined as of the applicable determination date under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Nonresident alien individual F holds all of the stock of domestic corporation DC. DC is a partner in foreign partnership FP, and DC's percentage ownership interest in FP is 50 percent. DC's other assets are a parcel of country F real estate with a fair market value of $500,000 and other assets which it uses in its business with a fair market value of $100,000, FP's assets are a parcel of country Z real estate with a fair market value of $300,000 and a parcel of U.S. real estate with a fair market value of $2,000,000. For purposes of determining whether DC is a U.S. real property holding corporation, DC is treated as holding its pro rata share of the assets held by FP. DC's pro rata share of the U.S. real estate held by FP is $1,000,000, determined by multiplying the fair market value ($2,000,000) of the U.S. real property interests held by FP by DC's percentage ownership interest in FP (50 percent). DC's pro rata share of the country Z real estate held by FP is $150,000, determined in the same manner. DC is a U.S. real property holding corporation because the fair market value ($1,000,000) of its U.S. real property interests (the U.S. real estate it is treated as holding proportionately) exceeds 50 percent ($875,000) of the sum ($1,750,000) of the fair market value of its U.S. real property interests ($1,000,000), its interests in real property located outside the United States [($650,000) (its country F real estate and its pro rata share of the country Z real estate)], plus its other assets which are used or held for use in a trade or business ($100,000). Because DC is a domestic U.S. real property holding corporation, the stock of DC is a U.S. real property interest and F's gain or loss on the disposition of this DC stock within 5 years of the current determination date will be treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business under section 897(a).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Nonresident alien individual B holds all of the stock of domestic corporation US. US is a beneficiary of foreign trust FT. US's percentage ownership interest in FT is 90 percent. US has no other assets. FT is a partner in domestic partnership DP. FT's percentage ownership interest in DP is 30 percent. FT has no other assets. DP's only asset is a parcel of U.S. real estate with a fair market value of $1,000,000. FT is treated as holding U.S. real estate with a fair market value of $300,000 (30 percent of the U.S. real estate held by DP with a fair market value of $1,000,000). For purposes of determining whether US is a U.S. real property holding corporation, the proportionate ownership rule is applied successively upward through the chain of ownership. Thus, US is treated as holding 90 percent of FT's $300,000 pro rata share of the U.S. real estate held by DP. US is a U.S. real property holding corporation because the fair market value ($270,000) of its U.S. real property interests (its pro rata share of the U.S. real estate held by DP) exceeds 50 percent ($135,000) of the sum of the fair market values of its U.S. real property interests ($270,000), its interests in real property located outside the United States (zero), plus its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business (zero). Because US is a domestic U.S. real property holding corporation, the stock of US is a U.S. real property interest, and B's gain or loss from the disposition of US stock within 5 years of the current determination date will be treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business under section 807(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Controlling interests in corporations. For purposes only of determining whether a corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation, if the corporation (the ``first corporation'') holds a controlling interest in a second corporation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The first corporation is treated as holding a proportionate share of each asset (i.e., U.S. real property interests, interests in real property located outside the United States, and assets used or held for use in a trade or business) held by the second corporation, determined in accordance with the rules of Sec. 1.897-1(e);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any asset so treated as held proportionately by the first corporation which is used or held for use by the second corporation in a trade or business shall be treated as so used or held for use by the first corporation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Interests in the second corporation held by the first corporation are not themselves taken into account as U.S. real property interests (regardless of whether the second corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation) or as trade or business assets. However, the first corporation shall not be treated as holding a proportionate share of assets that in the hands of the second corporation are subject to the rules of Sec. 1.897-1(f)(3)(ii) (concerning the trade or business assets of investment companies). A determination of what portion of the assets of the second corporation are considered to be held by the first corporation shall be made as of the applicable dates for determining whether the first corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation.

A ``controlling interest'' means 50 percent or more of the fair market value of all classes of stock of the corporation, determined as of the applicable determination date. In determining whether a corporation holds a controlling interest in another corporation, section 318(a) shall apply (except that sections 318(a)(2)(C) and (3)(C) are applied by substituting the phrase ``5 percent'' for ``50 percent''). However, a corporation that does not directly hold any interest in a second corporation shall not be treated as holding a controlling interest in the second corporation by reason of the application of section 318(a)(3)(C). The rules of this paragraph (e)(3) apply successively upward through a chain of ownership. For example, if the second corporation owns a controlling interest in a third corporation, the rules of this paragraph shall be applied first to determine the portion of the assets of the third corporation that is considered to be held by the second corporation and then to determine the portion of the assets held and considered to be held by the second corporation that is considered to be held by the first corporation. The controlling interest rules of this paragraph (e)(3) apply, regardless of whether a corporation is domestic or foreign, whenever it is necessary to determine whether a corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation. The rules of this paragraph (e)(3) are illustrated by the following examples. In each example fair market value is determined as of the applicable determination date under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section and no corporation holds constructively any interest not specified in the example.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Nonresident alien individual N owns all of the stock of domestic corporation DC. DC's only assets are 60 percent of the fair market value of all classes of stock of foreign corporation FS and 60 percent of the fair market value of all classes of stock of domestic corporation DS. The percentage ownership interest of DC in each of FS and DS is 60 percent. The balance of the stock in FS and DS is held by nonresident alien individual B, who is unrelated to DC. FS's only asset is a parcel of country F real estate with a fair market value of $1,000,000. DS's only asset is a parcel of U.S. real estate with a fair market value of $2,000,000. The value of DC stock in FS and DS is not taken into account for purposes of determining whether DC is a U.S. real property holding corporation. Rather, because DC holds a controlling interest (60 percent) in each of FS and DS, DC is treated as holding a portion of each asset held by FS and DS. DC's portion of the country F real estate held by FS is $600,000, determined by multiplying the fair market value ($1,000,000) of the country F real estate by DC's percentage ownership interest (60 percent). Similarly, DC's portion of the U.S. real estate held by DS is $1,200,000 (60 percent of $2,000,000). DC is a U.S. real property holding corporation, because the fair market value ($1,200,000) of its U.S. real property interests (its portion of the U.S. real estate) exceeds 50 percent ($900,000) of the sum ($1,800,000) of the fair market values of its U.S. real property interests ($1,200,000), its interests in real property located outside the

United States (the $600,000 portion of country F real estate), plus its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business (zero). Because DC is a domestic U.S. real property holding corporation, the stock of DC is a U.S. real property interest, and N's gain or loss on the disposition of DC stock within 5 years of the current determination date would be treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business under section 897(a).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. (i) Nonresident alien individual F owns all of the stock of domestic corporation US1. US1's only asset is 85 percent of the fair market value of all classes of stock of domestic corporation US2. US2's only assets are 60 percent of the fair market value of all classes of stock of domestic corporation US3, with a fair market value of $600,000, and a parcel of country D real estate with a fair market value of $800,000. US3's only asset is a parcel of U.S. real estate with a fair market value of $2,000,000. The percentage ownership interest of F in US1 is 100 percent.

Although US1 owns 85 percent of the stock of US2, US1's percentage ownership interest in US2 is 75 percent, because US2 has other interests other than solely as a creditor outstanding. US2's percentage ownership interest in US3 is 60 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> US2 holds a controlling interest in US3, since it holds more than 50 percent of the fair market value of all classes of stock of US3. Consequently, the value of US2's stock in US3 is not taken into account in determining whether US2 is a U.S. real property holding corporation, even though US3 is a U.S. real property holding corporation. Instead, US2 is treated as holding a portion of the U.S. real estate held by US3. US2's portion of the U.S. real estate is $1,200,000, determined by multiplying US2's percentage ownership interest (60 percent) by the fair market value ($2,000,000) of the U.S. real estate. US1 holds a controlling interest in US2 (75 percent.). By reapplying the rules of paragraph (e)(3) of this section successively upward through the chain of ownership, US1's stock in US2 is not taken into account, and US1 is treated as holding a portion of the country D real estate held by US2 and the U.S. real estate which US2 is treated as holding proportionately. US1's portion of the country D real estate is $600,000, determined by multiplying US1's percentage ownership interest (75 percent) by the fair market value ($800,000) of the country D real estate. US1's portion of the U.S. real estate which US2 is treated as owning is $900,000, determined by multiplying US1's percentage ownership interest (75 percent) by the fair market value ($1,200,000) of US2's portion of U.S. real estate held by US3. US1 is a U.S. real property holding corporation, because the fair market value ($900,000) of its U.S. real property interests (its portion of US2's portion of U.S. real estate) is more than 50 percent ($750,000) of the sum ($1,500,000) of fair market values of its U.S. real property interests ($900,000), its interests in real property located outside the United States ($800,000), plus its other assets need or held for use in a trade or business (zero). Because US1 is a U.S. real property holding corporation and is a domestic corporation, the stock of US1 is a U.S. real property interest, and F's gain or loss on the disposition of US1 stock within 5 years of the current determination date will be treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business under section 897(a).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Nonresident alien individual B holds all of the stock of domestic corporation DC. DC's only assets are 40 percent of the fair market value of all classes of stock of foreign corporation FC and a parcel of country R real estate with a fair market value of $100,000. FC's only asset is one parcel of U.S. real estate with a fair market value of $1,000,000. The fair market value of the FC stock held by DC is $200,000. FC is a U.S. real property holding corporation. Since DC does not hold a controlling interest in FC, the controlling interest rules of paragraph (e)(3) of this section do not apply to treat DC as holding a portion of the U.S. real estate held by FC. However, because FC is a U.S. real property holding corporation, the stock of FC is a U.S. real property interest for purposes of determining whether DC is a U.S. real property holding corporation. DC is a U.S. real property holding corporation because the fair market value ($200,000) of its U.S. real property interest (the stock of FC) exceeds 50 percent ($150,000) of the sum ($300,000) of the fair market values of its U.S. real property interest ($200,000), its interests in real property located outside the United States ($100,000), plus its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business (zero). Because DC is a U.S. real property holding corporation and is a domestic corporation, its stock is a U.S. real property interest, and B's gain or loss on the disposition of DC stock within 5 years of the current determination date would be subject to the provisions of section 897(a).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Nonresident alien individual C owns all of the stock of domestic corporation DC1. DC1's only assets are 25 percent of the fair market value of all classes of stock of domestic corporation DC2, and a parcel of U.S. real estate with a fair market value of $100,000. The stock of DC2 is not an asset used or held for use in DC1's trade or business. DC2's only assets are a building located in the U.S. with a fair market value of $100,000 and manufacturing equipment and inventory with a fair market value of $200,000, DC2 is not a U.S. real property holding corporation. Since DC1 does not hold a controlling interest in DC2, the rules of this paragraph (e)(3) do not apply to treat DC1 as

holding a portion of the assets held by DC2. In addition, since DC2 is not a U.S. real property corporation, its stock does not constitute a U.S. real property interest. Therefore, for purposes of determining whether DC1 is a real property holding corporation, its interest in DC2 is not taken into account. Since DC1's only other asset is a parcel of U.S. real estate, DC1 is a U.S. real property holding corporation, and C's gain or loss on the disposition of DC1 stock within 5 years of the current determination date would be subject to the provisions of section 897(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Co-application of rules of this paragraph (e). The rules of this paragraph (e) apply in conjunction with one another for purposes of determining whether a corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation. The rule of this paragraph (e)(4) is illustrated by the following example. In the example fair market value is determined as of the applicable determination date in accordance with paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example. Nonresident alien individual B holds 100 percent of the stock of domestic corporation US. US's only asset is 10 percent of the stock of foreign corporation FC1. FC1's only asset is 100 percent of the stock of foreign corporation FC2. FC2's only asset is a 50 percent interest in domestic partnership DP. FC2's percentage ownership interest in DP is 50 percent. DP's only asset is a parcel of U.S. real estate with a fair market value of $10,000,000. In determining whether US is a U.S. real property holding corporation, the rules of this paragraph (e) apply in conjunction with one another. Consequently, under paragraph (e)(2) of the section FC2 is treated as holding U.S. real estate with a fair market value of $5,000,000 (50 percent of $10,000,000, its pro rata share of real estate held by DP). Under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, FC1 is treated as holding 100 percent of the assets of FC2 (U.S. real estate with a fair market value of $5,000,000). FC1, therefore, is a U.S. real property holding corporation. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the stock of FC1 is treated as U.S. real property interest. US is a U.S. real property holding corporation because 100 percent of its assets (the stock of FC1) are U.S. real property interests. As US is a U.S. real property holding corporation and is a domestic corporation, the stock of US is a U.S. real property interest, and B's gain or loss from the disposition of stock of US within 5 years of the current determination date will be subject to the provisions of section 897(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Termination of U.S. real property holding corporation status--(1) In general. A U.S. real property holding corporation may voluntarily determine its status as of the date of any acquisition or disposition of assets. If the fair market value of its U.S. real property interests on such date no longer equals or exceeds 50 percent of the fair market value of all assets described in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, such corporation shall cease to be U.S. real property holding corporation as of such date, and on the day that is five years after such date interests in such corporation shall cease to be treated as U.S. real property interests (unless subsequent transactions within the five-year period have caused the fair market value of the corporation's U.S. real property interests to equal or exceed 50 percent of the fair market value of assets described in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section). A corporation that determines that interests in it have ceased to be U.S. real property interests pursuant to the rules of this paragraph (f) may so inform the Internal Revenue Service, as provided in paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Early termination. Interests in a U.S. real property holding corporation shall immediately cease to be U.S. real property interests as of the first date on which the following conditions are met--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The corporation does not hold any U.S. real property interests;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All of the U.S. real property interests directly or indirectly held by such corporation at any time during the previous five years (but disregarding any disposed of before June 19, 1980) either (A) were directly of indirectly disposed of in transactions in which the full amount of the gain (if any) was recognized or (B) ceased to be U.S. real property interests by reason of the application of this paragraph (f) to one or more other corporations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the disposition occurs on or after December 18, 2015, neither the corporation nor any predecessor of the corporation was a regulated investment company or a real estate investment trust at any time during the shorter of the periods described in section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii).

For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2), a corporation that disposes of all U.S. real property interests other than a lease that has a fair market value of

zero will be considered to have disposed of all of its U.S. real property interests, provided that the leased property is used in the conduct by the corporation of a trade or business in the United States. Such a lease may include an option to renew, but only if such option is for a renewal at fair market rental rates prevailing at the time of renewal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Establishing that a corporation is not a U.S. real property holding corporation--(1) Foreign persons disposing of interests--(i) In general. A foreign person disposing of an interest in a domestic corporation (other than an interest solely as a creditor) must establish that the interest was not a U.S. real property interest as of the date of disposition, either by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Obtaining a statement from the corporation pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (ii) of this paragraph (g)(1), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Obtaining a determination by the Commissioner, Small Business/Self Employed Division (SB/SE) pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (iii) of this paragraph (g)(1).

If the foreign person does not establish by either method that the interest disposed of was not a U.S. real property interest then the interest shall be presumed to have been a U.S. real property interest the disposition of which is subject to section 897(a). See paragraph (g)(3) of this section for certain exceptions to this rule. It should be noted that the rules of this section relate solely to interests in a corporation that are interests other than solely as a creditor. Therefore, a statement by a corporation or a determination by the Commissioner (under paragraphs (g) or (h) of this section) that an interest is not a U.S. real property interest depends solely upon whether or not the corporation was a U.S. real property holding corporation during the period described in section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) (subject to certain special rules). The determination of whether an interest is one solely as a creditor is made under the rules of Sec. 1.897-1(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Statement from corporation--(A) In general. A foreign person disposing of an interest in a domestic corporation may establish that the interest was not a U.S. real property interest as of the date of the disposition by requesting and obtaining from the corporation a statement that the interest was not a U.S. real property interest as of that date. However, a corporation's statement shall not be valid for purposes of this rule, and thus may not be relied upon for purposes of establishing that an interest was not a U.S. real property interest, unless the corporation complies with the notice requirements of paragraph (h) (2) or (h)(4) of this section.

A foreign person that requests and obtains such a statement is not required to forward the statement to the Internal Revenue Service and is not required to take any further action to establish that the interest disposed of was not a U.S. real property interest. To qualify under this rule, the foreign person must obtain the corporation's statement no later than the date, including any extensions, on which a tax return would otherwise be due with respect to a disposition. A foreign person that relies in good faith upon a statement from the corporation is not thereby excused from filing a return and paying any taxes and interest due thereon if the corporation's statement is later found to have been incorrect. However, such reliance shall be taken into account in determining whether the foreign person shall be subject to any penalty for the previous failure to file. However, a foreign person that knew or had reason to know that a corporation's statement was incorrect is not entitled to rely upon such statement and shall remain liable for all applicable penalties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Coordination with section 1445. Pursuant to section 1445 and regulations thereunder, withholding of tax is not required with respect to a foreign person's disposition of an interest in a domestic corporation, if the transferee is furnished with a statement by the corporation under paragraph (h) of this section that the interest is not a U.S. real property interest. A foreign person that obtains a corporation's statement for that purpose prior to the date of disposition may also rely upon the statement for purposes of this paragraph (g)(1)(ii), unless the corporation informs the foreign person (pursuant to paragraph (h)(1)(iv)(C) of this section)

that it became a U.S. real property holding corporation after the date of the notice but prior to the actual date of disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Determination by Commissioner--(A) In general. A foreign person disposing of an interest in a domestic corporation may establish that the interest was not a U.S. real property interest as of the date of disposition by requesting and obtaining a determination to that effect from the Commissioner. Such a determination may be requested pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (B) or (C) of this paragraph (g)(1)(iii). A request for a determination should be addressed to: Commissioner, Small Business/Self Employed Division (SB/SE); S C3-413 NCFB, 500 Ellin Road, Lanham, MD 20706. A foreign transferor who has requested a determination by the Commissioner pursuant to the rules of this paragraph (g)(1)(iii) is not thereby excused from filing a return and paying any tax due by the date, including any extensions, on which such return and payment would otherwise be due with respect to a disposition. If the Commissioner subsequently determines and notifies the foreign transferor that the interest was not a U.S. real property interest, the foreign transferor shall be entitled to a refund of any taxes, penalties, and interest paid by reason of the application of section 897(a) pursuant to the rules of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, together with any interest otherwise due on such refund, if a claim for refund is made within the applicable time limits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Determination based on Commissioner's information. A foreign person may request that the Commissioner make a determination based on information contained in the Commissioner's records, if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The foreign person made a request to the corporation for information as to the status of its interest no later than the 90th day before the date, including any extensions, on which a tax return would otherwise be due with respect to a disposition, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The corporation failed to respond to such request by the 30th day following the date the request was delivered to the corporation.

If the Commissioner is unable to make a determination based on information available to him, he shall inform the foreign person that the interest must be treated as a U.S. real property interest unless the person subsequently obtains either the necessary statement from the corporation or a determination pursuant to subdivision (C) of this paragraph (g)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Determination based on information supplied by foreign person. A foreign person may request that the Commissioner make a determination based on information supplied by the foreign person. Such information may be drawn, for example, from annual reports, financial statements, or records of the corporation, and must establish to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the foreign person's interest was not a U.S. real property interest as of the date of disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Determination by Commissioner on his own motion. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a foreign person shall not treat the disposition of an interest in a domestic corporation as a disposition of a U.S. real property interest if such person is notified that the Commissioner has upon his own motion determined that the interest was not a U.S. real property interest as of the date of disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Corporations determining U.S. real property holding corporation status--(i) In general. A corporation that must determine whether it is a U.S. real property holding corporation, and that holds an interest in another corporation (other than a controlling interest as defined in paragraph (e)(3) of this section), must determine whether or not that interest was a U.S. real property interest as of its own determination date, by either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Obtaining a statement from the second corporation pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (ii) of this paragraph (g)(2);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Obtaining a determination by the Commissioner pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (iii) of this paragraph (g)(2); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Making an independent determination pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (iv) of this paragraph (g)(2).

A corporation that is unable to determine by any of the above methods

whether its interest in a second corporation is a U.S. real property interest must presume that such interest is a U.S. real property interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Statement from corporation. A corporation may determine whether or not an interest in a second corporation was a U.S. real property interest as of its own determination date by obtaining from the second corporation a statement that the interest was not a U.S. real property interest as of that date. However, the second corporation's statement shall not be valid for purposes of this rule, and thus may not be relied upon for purposes of establishing that an interest was not a U.S. real property interest, unless such corporation complies with the notice requirements of paragraph (h)(2) or (h)(4) of this section.

A corporation that requests and obtains such a statement is not required to forward the statement to the Internal Revenue Service and is not required to take any further action to establish that the interest in the second corporation was not a U.S. real property interest. If the second corporation's statement is later found to have been incorrect, the first corporation shall not be subject to penalties arising out of past failures to comply with the requirements of section 897 or 1445, if such failures were attributable to reliance upon the second corporation's statement. By the 90th day following receipt of a notification from the Service or from the second corporation that a prior statement was incorrect, the first corporation must redetermine its status (as of its most recent determination date) and if appropriate notify the Internal Revenue Service that it is a U.S. real property holding corporation in accordance with paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(C) of this section. However, a corporation that knew or had reason to know that a second corporation's statement was incorrect is not entitled to rely upon such statement and shall remain liable for all applicable taxes, penalties, and interest arising out of the second corporation's status as a U.S. real property holding corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Determination by Commissioner--(A) In general. A corporation may determine whether or not an interest in a second corporation was a U.S. real property interest as of its own determination date by requesting and obtaining a determination to that effect from the Commissioner. Such a determination may be requested pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (B) or (C) of this paragraph (g)(2)(iii). A request for a determination must be addressed to: Commissioner, Small Business/Self Employed Division (SB/SE); S C3-413 NCFB, 500 Ellin Road, Lanhan, MD 20706. A corporation that has requested a determination by the Commissioner pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph is not thereby excused from taking any action required by section 897 or 1445 by the date on which such action would otherwise be due. However, the Commissioner may grant a reasonable extension of time for the satisfaction of any requirement if the Commissioner is satisfied that the corporation has not sought a determination pursuant to this paragraph (g)(2)(iii) for a principal purpose of delay.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Determination based on Commissioner's information. A corporation may request that the Commissioner make a determination based on information contained in the Commissioner's records, if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The corporation made a request to the second corporation for information as to the status of its interest no later than the fifth day following the first corporation's determination date, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The second corporation failed to respond to such request by the 30th day following the date the request was delivered to the second corporation.

Pending his resolution of such a request, the Commissioner will generally grant an extension with respect to the change-of-status notification that may otherwise be required pursuant to paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section. If the Commissioner is unable to make a determination based on information available to him, he shall inform the corporation that the interest must be treated as a U.S. real property interest unless the corporation subsequently obtains either the necessary statement from the second corporation or a determination pursuant to paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(C) or (g)(2)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Determination based on information supplied by corporation. A corporation may request that the Commissioner

make a determination based on information supplied by the corporation. Such information may be drawn, for example, from annual reports, financial statements, or records of the second corporation, and must establish to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the interest in the second corporation was not a U.S. real property interest as of the first corporation's determination date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Determination by Commissioner on his own motion. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a corporation shall not treat an interest in a second corporation as a U.S. real property interest if the corporation is notified that the Commissioner has upon his own motion determined that the interest in the second corporation is not a U.S. real property interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Independent determination by corporation. A corporation may independently determine whether or not an interest in a second corporation was a U.S. real property interest as of the first corporation's own determination date. Such determination must be based upon the best evidence available, drawn from annual reports, financial statements, records of the second corporation, or from any other source, that demonstrates to a reasonable certainty that the interest in the second corporation was not a U.S. real property interest. A corporation that makes an independent determination pursuant to this paragraph (g)(2)(iv) shall be subject to the special notification rule of paragraph (h)(1)(iii)(D) of the section. If the Commissioner subsequently determines that the corporation's independent determination was incorrect, the corporation shall be subject to penalties for any past failure to comply with the requirements of section 897 or 1445 only if the corporation's determination was unreasonable in view of facts that the corporation knew or had reason to know.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Requirements not applicable. If at any time during the calendar year any class of stock of a corporation is regularly traded on an established securities market, the requirements of this paragraph (g) shall not apply with respect to any holder of an interest in such corporation other than a person who holds an interest described in Sec. 1.897-1(c)(2)(iii) (A) or (B). For example, a corporation determining whether it is a U.S. real property holding corporation need not ascertain from a regularly traded corporation in which it neither holds, nor has held during the period described in section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii), more than a 5 percent interest whether that regularly traded corporation is itself a U.S. real property holding corporation.

In addition, the requirements of this paragraph (g) do not apply to any holder of an interest in a domestically-controlled RETT, as defined in section 897(h)(4)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Notice requirements applicable to corporations--(1) Statement to foreign interest-holder--(i) In general. A domestic corporation must, within a reasonable period after receipt of a request from a foreign person holding an interest in it, inform that person whether the interest constitutes a U.S. real property interest. No particular form is required for this statement, which need only indicate the corporation's determination. The statement must be dated and signed by a responsible corporate officer who must verify under penalties of perjury that the statement is correct to his knowledge and belief.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Required determination. For purposes of the statement required by paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, an interest in a corporation is a U.S. real property interest if the corporation was a U.S. real property holding corporation on any determination date during the 5-year period ending on the date specified in the interest-holder's request, or on the date such request was received if no date is specified (or during such shorter period ending on the date that is applicable pursuant to section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii). However, an interest in a corporation is not a U.S. real property interest if such interest is excluded under section 897(c)(1)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notice to the Internal Revenue Service. If a foreign interest holder requests that a domestic corporation provide a statement described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, then such corporation must provide a notice to the Internal Revenue Service in accordance with this paragraph (h)(2). No particular form is required for such notice, but the following must be provided:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A statement that the notice is provided pursuant to the requirements of Sec. 1.897-2(h)(2);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The name, address, and identifying number of the corporation providing the notice;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The name, address, and identifying number (if any) of the foreign interest holder that requested the statement (this information may be omitted from the notice if fully set forth in the statement to the foreign interest holder attached to the notice).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Whether the interest in question is a U.S. real property interest;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A statement signed by a responsible corporate officer verifying under penalties of perjury that the notice (including any attachments thereto) is correct to his knowledge and belief. A copy of any statement provided to the foreign interest holder must be attached to the notice. The notice must be mailed to the address specified in the Instructions for Form 8288 under the heading ``Where To File'' on or before the 30th day after the statement referred to in Sec. 1.897-2(h)(1) is mailed to the interest holder that requested it. Failure to mail such notice within the time period set forth in the preceding sentence will cause the statement provided pursuant to Sec. 1.897-2(h)(1) to become an invalid statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Requirements not applicable. The requirements of this paragraph (h) do not apply to domestically-controlled REITS, as defined in section 897(h)(4)(B). These requirements also do not apply to a corporation any class of stock in which is regularly traded on an established securities market at any time during the calendar year. However, such a corporation may voluntarily choose to comply with the requirements of paragraph (h)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Voluntary notice to Internal Revenue Service--(i) In general. A domestic corporation which determines that it is not a U.S. real property holding corporation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> On each of the applicable determination dates in a taxable year, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Pursuant to section 897(c)(1)(B), may attach to its income tax return for that year a statement informing the Internal Revenue Service of its determination. A corporation that has provided a voluntary notice described in this Sec. 1.897-2(h)(4)(i) for the immediately preceding taxable year and that does not have an event described in Sec. 1.897-2(c)(1) (ii), (iii) or (iv) prior to receiving a request from a foreign person under Sec. 1.897-2(h)(1), is exempt from the notice requirement of Sec. 1.897-2(h)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Early termination of real property holding corporation status. A corporation that determines during the course of its taxable year that interests in it have ceased to be U.S. real property interests pursuant to the rules of section 897(c)(1)(B) may, on the day of its determination or thereafter, provide a statement to the address specified in the Instructions for Form 8288 under the heading ``Where To File'', informing the Service of its determination. No particular form is required but the statement must set forth the corporation's name, address, identification number, a brief statement regarding its determination and the date such determination was made. Such statement will enable foreign interest-holders to dispose of their interests without being subject to section 897(a), as provided in paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Supplemental statements--(i) By corporations with substantial intangible assets. A corporation that is subject to the requirements of paragraph (h)(2) of this section (or that voluntarily complies with the requirements of paragraph (h)(4) of this section) must submit a supplemental statement to the Internal Revenue Service if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Such corporation values any of the intangible assets described in Sec. 1.897-1(f)(1)(ii) (other than goodwill or going concern value) by a method other than the purchase price or book value methods described in Sec. 1.897-1(o)(4); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The fair market value of such intangible assets equals or exceeds 25 percent of the total of the fair market values of the assets the corporation is considered to hold in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">The supplemental statement must inform the Internal Revenue Service that the corporation meets the criteria of subdivisions (A) and (B) of this paragraph (h)(5)(i), and must summarize the methods and calculations upon which the corporation's determination of the

A corporation that is subject to the requirements of paragraph (h)(2) of this section (or that voluntarily complies with the requirements of paragraph (h)(4) of this section) must submit a supplemental statement to the Internal Revenue Service if such corporation values goodwill or going concern value pursuant to Sec. 1.897-1(o)(4)(iii). The supplemental statement must set forth that it is made pursuant to this paragraph (h)(5)(ii), and must summarize the methods and calculations upon which the corporation's determination of the fair market value of such intangible assets is based. In addition, the supplemental statement must list any such assets that were purchased from any person that have been valued by the corporation at an amount other than their purchase price, and must provide a justification for such a departure from the purchase price.

Sec. 1.897-3  Election by foreign corporation to be treated asa domestic corporation under section 897(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose and scope. This section provides rules pursuant to which a foreign corporation may elect under section 897(i) to be treated as a domestic corporation for purposes of sections 897, 1445, and 6039C and the regulations thereunder. A foreign corporation with respect to which an election under section 897(i) is in effect is subject to all rules under sections 897 and 1445 that apply to domestic corporations. Thus, for example, if a foreign corporation that has made an election under section 897(i) is a U.S. real property holding corporation, interests in it are U.S. real property interests that are subject to withholding under section 1445, and any gain or loss from the disposition of such interests by a foreign person will be treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business under section 897(a). Similarly, if a foreign corporation makes an election under section 897(i), its distribution of a U.S. real property interest pursuant to section 301 will be subject to the carryover basis rule of section 897(f). However, an interest in an electing corporation is not a U.S. real property interest if following the election the interest is described in section 897(c)(1)(B) or Sec. 1.897-1(c)(2) (subject to the exceptions of subdivisions (i) and (ii) of that section). In addition, section 897(d) will not apply to any distribution of a U.S. real property interest by such corporation or to any sale or exchange of such interest pursuant to a plan of complete liquidation under section 337. A foreign corporation that makes an election under section 897(i) shall not be treated as a domestic corporation for purposes of any other provision of the Code or regulations, except to the extent that it is required to consent to such treatment as a condition to making the election. For further information concerning the effect of an election under section 897(i) upon the withholding requirements of section 1445, see Sec. 1.1445-7. An election under section 897(i) is the exclusive remedy of any foreign person claiming discriminatory treatment under any treaty with respect to the application of sections 897, 1445, and 6039C to a foreign corporation. Therefore, if a corporation does not make an effective election, relief under a nondiscrimination article of any treaty shall not be otherwise available with respect to the application of sections 897, 1445, and 6039C to such corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General conditions. A foreign corporation may make an election under section 897(i) only if it meets all three of the following conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Holding a U.S. real property interest. The foreign corporation must hold a U.S. real property interest at the time of the election. This condition is satisfied when a U.S. real property interest is acquired simultaneously with the effective date of an election. For example, this condition is satisfied when real property is acquired in an exchange described in section 351 that is carried out simultaneously with the effective date of the election. This condition is also satisfied by a corporation that indirectly holds a U.S. real property interest through a partnership, trust, or estate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Entitlement to nondiscriminatory treatment. The foreign corporation must be entitled to nondiscriminatory treatment with respect to its U.S. real property interest under any treaty to which the United States is a party. Where the corporation indirectly holds a U.S. real property interest through a partnership, trust, or estate, the corporation itself must be entitled to nondiscriminatory treatment with respect to such property interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Submission of election in proper form. The foreign corporation must comply with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section respecting the manner and form in which an election must be submitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Manner and form of election. An election under section 897(i) is made by filing the materials described in subparagraphs (1) through (5) of this paragraph (c) at the address specified in the Instructions for Form 8288 under the heading ``Where To File''. The required items may be incorporated in a single document.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General statement. The foreign corporation must supply a general statement indicating that an election under section 897(i) is being made. The general statement must be signed by a responsible corporate officer, who must verify under penalty of perjury that the statement and all other documents submitted pursuant to the requirements of this paragraph (c) are true and correct to his knowledge and belief. No particular form is required for the statement, which must contain all the following information--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The name, address, identifying number, and place and date of incorporation of the foreign corporation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The treaty and article under which the foreign corporation is seeking nondiscriminatory treatment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A description of the U.S. real property interests held by the corporation, either directly or through a partnership, trust, or estate, including the dates such interests were acquired, the corporation's adjusted bases in such interests, and their fair market values as of the date of the election (or book values if the corporation is not a U.S. real property holding corporation under the alternative test of Sec. 1.897-2(b)(2)); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A list of all dispositions of any interests in the foreign corporation after December 31, 1979, and before June 19, 1980, between related persons (as defined in section 453(f)(1)), giving the type and the amount of any interest transferred, the name and address of the related person to whom the interest was transferred, the transferor's basis in the interest transferred, and the amount of any nontaxed gain as defined in section 1125(d) of Pub. L. 96-499.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Waiver of treaty benefits. The foreign corporation must submit a binding waiver of the benefits of any U.S. treaty with respect to any gain or loss from the disposition of a U.S. real property interest during the period in which the election is in effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Consent to be taxed. The foreign corporation must submit a binding agreement to treat as though it were a domestic corporation any gain or loss that is recognized upon--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The disposition of any U.S. real property interest during the period in which the election is in effect, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The disposition of any property that it acquired in exchange for a U.S. real property interest in a nonrecognition transaction (as defined under section 897(e)) during the period in which the election is in effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Interest-holders' consent to election--(i) In general. The foreign corporation must submit both a signed consent to the making of the election and a waiver of U.S. treaty benefits with respect to any gain or loss from the disposition of an interest in the corporation from each person who holds an interest in the corporation on the date the election is made. In the case of a corporation any class of stock of which is regularly traded on an established securities market at any time during the calendar year, the signed consent and waiver need only be provided by a person who holds an interest described in Sec. 1.897-1(c)(2)(iii)(A) or (B) (determined after application of the constructive ownership rules of section 897(c)(6)(C). The foreign corporation must also include with the signed consents and waivers a list that identifies and describes the interest in the corporation held by each interest holder, including the type and amount of such interest and its fair market value as of the date of the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Corporation's retention of interest-holders' consents. A corporation need not file the consents and waivers of its interest-holders as required by paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, if it instead complies with the requirements of subdivisions (A) through (D) of this paragraph (c)(4)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The corporation must place a legend on each outstanding certificate for shares of its stock that reads substantially as follows: ``(Name of corporation) has made an election under section 897(i) of the United States Internal Revenue Code to be treated as a U.S. corporation for certain tax purposes,

and any purchaser of this interest may therefore be required to withhold tax at the time of the purchase.'' The corporation must certify that the foregoing requirement has been met and that it will place an equivalent legend on every stock certificate that is issued while the election under section 897(i) is in effect and the corporation retains the consents and waivers of its interest-holders under the rules of this paragraph (c)(4)(ii). However, with respect to any registered certificate issued prior to January 30, 1985, in lieu of placing a legend on the certificate the corporation may certify that it will provide the purchaser of the interest with a copy of the legend at the time the certificate is surrendered for issuance of a new certificate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The corporation must include with its election a statement that the corporation has received both a signed consent to the making of the election and a waiver of U.S. treaty benefits with respect to any gain or loss from the disposition of an interest in the corporation from each person who holds an interest in the corporation on the date the election is made. In the case of a corporation any class of stock of which is regularly traded on an established securities market at any time during the calendar year, the signed consent and waiver need only be provided by a person who holds or has held an interest described in Sec. 1.897-1(c)(2)(iii) (A) or (B) (determined after application of the constructive ownership rules of section 897(c)(6)(C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The corporation must include with its election a list that describes the interests in the corporation held by each interest-holder. The list need not identify the interest-holders by name, but must set forth the type, amount, and fair market value of the interests held by each.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The corporation must include with its election an agreement that the corporation will retain all signed consents and waivers for a period of three years from the date of the election and supply such documents to the Director within 30 days of his request for production thereof. The Director's review of the signed consents and waivers pursuant to this provision shall not constitute an examination for purposes of section 7605(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Statement regarding prior dispositions. The foreign corporation must state that no interest in the corporation was disposed of during the shortest of (A) the period from June 19, 1980, through the date of the election, (B) the period from the date on which the corporation first holds a U.S. real property interest through the date of the election or (C) the five-year period ending on the date of the election. If the corporation cannot state that no such dispositions have been made, it may make the section 897(i) election only if it states that it has complied with the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Time and duration of election--(1) In general. A foreign corporation that meets the conditions of paragraph (b) of this section may make an election under section 897(i) at any time before the first disposition of an interest in the corporation which would be subject to section 897(a) if the election had been made before that disposition, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The period to which the election applies begins on the date on which the election is made, or such earlier date as is specified in the election, but not earlier than June 19, 1980. Unless revoked, an election applies for the duration of the time for which the corporation remains in existence. An election is made on the date that the statements described in paragraph (c) of this section are delivered to the address specified in the Instructions for Form 8288 under the heading ``Where To File''. If the election is delivered by United States mail, the provisions of section 7502 and the regulations thereunder shall apply in determining the date of delivery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Election after disposition of stock. An election under section 897(i) may be made after any disposition of an interest in the corporation which would have been subject to section 897(a) if the election had been made before that disposition, but only if the requirements of either subdivision (i) or (ii) of this paragraph (d)(2) are met with respect to all dispositions of interests during the period described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> There is a payment of an amount equal to any taxes which would have been imposed by reason of the application of section 897 upon all persons who had disposed of interests in the corporation during the period described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section had the corporation made the election prior to such dispositions. Such payment must be made by the later of the date the election is made, or the date on which payment of such taxes would otherwise have been due, and must include any interest that would have accrued had tax actually been due with respect to the disposition. As an election made prior to any disposition of interests in the corporation would have been conditioned on a waiver of treaty benefits by the interest-holders, payment of an amount equal to tax and any interest with respect to such prior disposition is required as a condition to making a subsequent election under this subdivision (i) irrespective of the application of any treaty provision. For this purpose, it is not necessary that the payment be made by the person who would have owed the tax if the election under this section had been made prior to the disposition, and that person is under no obligation to supply any information to the present holders of interests in the electing corporation. The payment shall be made to the U.S. Treasury. Where the payment is made by a present holder of an interest, the basis of the person's interest in the corporation shall be increased to the extent of the amount paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Each person that acquired an interest in the electing corporation took a basis in the interest that was equal to the basis of the interest in the hands of the person from which the interest was acquired, increased by the sum of any gain recognized by the transferor of the interest and any tax paid under chapter 1 by the person that acquired the interest, if such interest was acquired after June 18, 1980.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Adequate proof of basis. For purposes of meeting the conditions of paragraph (d)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section, a corporation must establish the bases of and amount of gain realized by all persons who disposed of interests in the corporation during the period described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. See paragraph (g)(3) of this section for an exception to this rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Acknowledgement of receipt. Within 60 days after its receipt of an election udner section 897(i), the Internal Revenue Service will acknowledge receipt of the election. Such acknowledgement either will indicate that the information submitted with the election is complete or will specify any documents that remain to be submitted pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section respecting the manner and form in which an election must be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Anti-abuse rule--(1) In general. A corporation that is otherwise eligible to make an election under section 897(i) may do so only by complying with the requirements of subdivision (2) of this paragraph, if during the period described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Prior to receipt of a U.S. real property interest by the corporation seeking to make the election, stock in such corporation (or in any corporation controlled by such corporation) was acquired in a transaction in which the person acquiring such stock obtained an increase in basis in the stock over the adjusted basis of the stock in the hands of the person from whom it was acquired;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The full amount of gain realized by the person from whom the stock was acquired was not subject to U.S. tax; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The corporation seeking to make the election received the U.S. real property interest in a transaction or series of transactions to which section 897 (d)(1)(B) or (e)(1) applies to allow for nonrecognition of gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Recognition of gain. A corporation described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (e) may make an election under section 897(i) only if it pays an amount equal to the tax on the full amount of gain realized by the transferors of the stock of such corporation (or of any corporation controlled by it) in the transaction described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section. However, such amount must be paid only if the stock of the corporation seeking to make the election (or the stock of a corporation controlled by it) would have constituted a U.S. real property

interest had it (or a corporation controlled by it) made the election before that acquisition. Such amount must be paid by the later of the date of the election or the date on which such tax would otherwise be due, and must include any interest that would have accrued had tax actually been due with respect to the disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Definition of control. For purposes of this paragraph, a corporation controls a second corporation if it holds 80 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, and 80 percent or more of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of the second corporation. In a chain of corporations where each succeeding corporation is controlled within the meaning of this subparagraph (3) by the corporation immediately above it in the chain, each corporation in the chain shall be considered to be controlled by all corporations that preceded it in the chain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The rules of this paragraph (e) are illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Nonresident alien individual X owns 100 percent of the stock of foreign corporation L which was organized in 1981. L's only asset is a parcel of U.S. real property which it has held since 1981. The fair market value of the U.S. real property held by L on January 1, 1984, is $1,000,000. L's basis in the property is $200,000. X's basis in the L stock is $500,000. On June 1, 1984, M corporation, a foreign corporation owned by foreign persons who are unrelated to X, purchases the stock of L from X for $1,000,000 with title passing outside of the United States. Since the stock of L is not a U.S. real property interest, X's gain from the disposition of the L stock ($500,000) is not treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business under section 897(a). In addition, since X was neither engaged in a U.S. trade or business nor present in the U.S. at any time during 1984, such gain is not subject to U.S. tax under section 871. On January 1, 1987, M liquidates L under a plan of liquidation adopted on that same date. Under section 332 of the Code M recognizes no gain on receipt of the parcel of U.S. real property distributed by L in liquidation. Under section 334(b)(1) M takes $200,000 as its basis in the U.S. real property received from L. Under section 897(d)(1)(B) no gain would be recognized to L under section 897(d)(1)(A) on the liquidating distribution. As a consequence, no gain is recognized to L under section 336 of the Code. After its receipt of the U.S. real property from L, M seeks to make an election to be treated as a domestic corporation. Thus, M acquired the L stock in a transaction in which it obtained a basis in such stock in excess of the adjusted basis of X in the stock, U.S. tax was not paid on the full amount of the gain realized by X, and M has received the property in a distribution to which section 897(d)(1)(B) applied to provide for nonrecognition of gain to L. Therefore, M may make the election only if it pays an amount equal to the tax on the full amount of X's gain, pursuant to the rule of subparagraph (e)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Nonresident alien individual X owns 100 percent of the stock of foreign corporation A which owns 100 percent of the stock of foreign corporation B. X's basis in the A stock is $500,000. A's basis in the B stock is $500,000. B owns U.S. real property with a fair market value of $1,000,000. B's basis in the U.S. real property is $500,000. On January 1, 1985, X sells the stock of A to Y, an unrelated individual, for $1,000,000 with title passing outside of the United States. In addition, X was neither engaged in a U.S. trade or business nor present in the U.S. at any time during 1985. Since the A stock is not a U.S. real property interest, X's gain on such disposition is not treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business under section 897(a) and is therefore not subject to U.S. tax under section 871. On July 1, 1987, a plan of liquidation is adopted, and B is liquidated into A. Under sections 332, 334(b)(1), 336, and 897(d)(1)(B), there is no tax to A on receipt of U.S. real property from B and no tax to B on the distribution of the U.S. real property interest to A. After receipt of the property A seeks to make an election under section 897(i). Under the rules of paragraph (e) of this section, A may make the election only if it pays an amount equal to the tax on the full amount of X's gain. (Assuming that A is a U.S. real property holding corporation, the same result would be required by the rule of paragraph (d)(2) of this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Revocation of election--(1) In general. An election under section 897(i) may be revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner. A request for revocation shall be in writing and shall be delivered to the address specified in the Instructions for Form 8288 under the heading ``Where To File''. The request shall include the name, address, and identifying number of the corporation seeking to revoke the election, and a description of all U.S. real property interests held by the corporation on the date of the request for revocation, including the dates such interests were acquired, the corporation's adjusted bases in such interests, and their fair

market values as of the date of the request (or book value if the corporation is not a U.S. real property holding corporation under the alternative test of Sec. 1.897-2(b)(2)). The request shall be signed by a responsible officer of the corporation under penalty of perjury and shall contain a statement either that the corporation has made no distributions described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (f) or that the conditions of that subparagraph have been satisifed. A revocation will be effective as of the date the request is delivered to the address specified in the Instructions for Form 8288 under the heading ``Where To File'', unless the Commissioner provides otherwise in his consent to the revocation. If the request is delivered by United States mail, the provisions of section 7502 and the regulations thereunder shall apply in determining the date of delivery. The Commissioner will generally consent to a revocation, provided either that there have been no distributions described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (f), or that the conditions of that subparagraph have been satisfied. Within 90 days after its receipt of a request to revoke an election under section 897(i), the Internal Revenue Service will acknowledge receipt of the request. Such acknowledgement either will indicate that the information submitted with the request is complete or will specify any information that remains to be submtted pursuant to the requirements of this paragraph (f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Revocation after distribution. If there have been any distributions of U.S. real property interests by the corporation during the period to which an election made under section 897(i) applies, the Commissioner shall consent to the revocation of such election only if one of the following conditions is met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The full amount of gain realized by the corporation upon the distribution was subject to U.S. income tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> There is a payment of an amount equal to the taxes that would have been imposed upon the corporation by reason of the application of section 897 if the election had not been in effect on the date of the distribution. Such payment must be made by the later of the date of the request for revocation or the date on which payment of such tax would otherwise have been due, and must include any interest that would have accrued had tax actually been due with respect to the distribution. If under the terms of any treaty to which the United States is a party such distribution would not have been subject to U.S. income tax notwithstanding the provisions of section 897, then this condition may be satisfied by providing a statement with the request for revocation setting forth the treaty and article which would have exempted the distribution from U.S. tax had the election under section 897(i) not been in effect on the date thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> At the time of the receipt of the distributed property, the distributee would be subject to taxation under chapter 1 of the Code on a subsequent disposition of the distributed property, and the basis of the distributed property in the hands of the distributee is no greater than the adjusted basis of such property before the distribution, increased by the amount of gain (if any) recognized by the distributing corporation. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2)(i)(C), a distributee shall be considered to be subject to taxation upon a subsequent disposition of distributed property only if such distributee waives the benefits of any U.S. treaty that would otherwise render such disposition not taxable by the United States. Such waiver must be attached to the corporation's request for revocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Transitional rules--(1) In general. An election under section 897(i) that was made at any time after June 18, 1980, must be amended to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. Such amendment must be delivered in writing to the Director, Philadelphia Service Center by April 1, 1985. If the amendment is delivered by United States mail, the provisions of section 7502 and the regulations thereunder shall apply in determining the date of delivery. An election that is properly amended pursuant to the requirements of this section shall be effective as of the date of the original election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Corporations previously entitled to make election. A foreign corporation that would have been entitled under

the rules of this section to make a section 897(i) election at any time between June 19, 1980, and January 30, 1985, may retroactively make such an election pursuant to the requirements of this section. Such election must be delivered to the Director, Foreign Operations District, by March 1, 1985.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Interests in corporation disposed of prior to publication. Where interests in a corporation were disposed of before January 3, 1984, the requirement of paragraph (d)(2) of this section may be met, notwithstanding the requirement of paragraph (d)(3), by paying a tax that is based upon a reasonable estimate of the gain upon the prior dispositions. Such estimate must be based on all facts and circumstances known to, and ascertainable through the exercise of reasonable diligence by, the corporation seeking to make the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Effective date. The requirement in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section that the statement making the section 897(i) election contain the identifying number of the foreign corporation (in all cases) is applicable November 3, 2003.

Sec. 1.897-5T  Corporate distributions (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose and scope. This section provides rules concerning the recognition of gain or loss and adjustments to basis required with respect to certain corporate distributions that are subject to section 897. Paragraph (b) of this section provides rules concerning such distributions by domestic corporations, including distributions under section 301, distributions in redemption of stock, and distributions in liquidation. Paragraph (c) sets forth rules concerning distributions by foreign corporations, including distributions under sections 301 and 355, distributions in redemption of stock, and distributions in liquidation. Finally, various rules generally applicable to distributions subject to this section, as well as to transfers subject to Sec. 1.897-6T, are set forth in paragraph (d).

Under section 897(f), if any domestic corporation (distributing corporation) distributes a U.S. real property interest to a shareholder that is a foreign person (distributee) in a distribution to which section 301 applies, then the basis of the distributed U.S. real property interest in the hands of the foreign distributee shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 301(d), and shall not exceed--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The adjusted basis of the property before the distribution in the hands of the distributing corporation, increased by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any gain recognized by the distributing corporation on the distribution, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any U.S. tax paid by or on behalf of the distributee with respect to the distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Distributions by U.S. real property holding corporations which are taxable exchanges of stock under generally applicable rules. If a domestic corporation, stock in which is treated as a U.S. real property interest, distributes property with respect to such stock to a foreign shareholder, the distributee shall be treated as having disposed of a U.S. real property interest, and shall recognize gain or loss on the stock of such domestic corporation to the extent that, with respect to the distributees--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Part of all of the distribution is treated pursuant to section 301(c)(3)(A) as a sale or exchange of stock;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Part or all of the distribution is treated pursuant to section 302(a) as made in part or full payment in exchange for stock; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Part or all of the distribution is treated pursuant to section 331(a) as made in full payment in exchange for stock.

Stock in a domestic corporation shall not be considered a U.S. real property interest pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 1.897-2(f)(2) if the corporation does not hold any U.S. real property interests and has disposed of all of its U.S. real property interests owned within the previous five years in transactions in which the full amount of gain was recognized under the rules of Sec. 1.897-2(f)(2). If gain is recognized at the corporate level on either a distribution of a U.S. real property interest or a sale of a U.S. real property interest in a liquidation, such distribution or sale shall be considered a disposition for purposes of Sec. 1.897-2(f)(2).

Exchanges that are subject to section 897(e) are normally covered by Sec. 1.897-6T(a) (1), (2) and (3). This paragraph (b)(3) provides rules concerning the application of section 897(e) and the general principles of Sec. 1.897-6T(a) (1), (2) and (3) to section 332 liquidations of U.S real property holding corporations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Distribution to a foreign corporation under section 332 after June 18, 1980, and before the repeal of the General Utilities doctrine. Except for distributions under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section (relating to section 332 and former section 334(b)(2)), the rules of this paragraph (b)(3)(ii) shall apply to section 332 distributions after June 18, 1980, and before January 1, 1990, pursuant to section 336(a) as in effect prior to the effective dates of the amendments made by section 631 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. A foreign corporation that meets the stock ownership requirements of section 332(b) with respect to stock in a domestic corporation that is a U.S. real property interest shall not, after December 31, 1984, be subject to taxation by reason of section 367(a). The foreign corporation shall recognize gain pursuant to section 897(e)(1) on such stock upon the receipt of property in a section 332(a) liquidation from such domestic corporation, but only to the extent that the property received constitutes property other than a U.S. real property interest. The gain on the stock in the domestic corporation to be recognized by the foreign corporation pursuant to section 897(e)(1) shall be determined by multiplying the gain realized on the distribution by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall be the fair market value of the property other than U.S. real property interests received by the foreign corporation on the distribution, and the denominator shall be the fair market value of all property received by the foreign corporation on the distribution. The bases of the distributed U.S. real property interests in the hands of the foreign corporation shall be the same as the bases in the hands of the domestic corporation. The bases of the property other than U.S. real property interests in the hands of the foreign corporation shall be the same as the bases in the hands of the domestic corporation, plus any gain recognized by the foreign corporation on the distribution allocated among such assets in proportion to the potential gain inherent in each such asset at the time of distribution. However, the basis of each asset is limited to its fair market value. Property, other than a U.S. real property interest

that is distributed by the domestic corporation, shall not be considered to be distributed by the domestic corporation pursuant to a section 332 liquidation (that is, the foreign corporation shall not be considered to be a corporation for purposes of section 332) if the requirements of section 367(a) are not satisfied.

A foreign corporation that meets the stock ownership requirements of section 332(b) with respect to stock in a domestic corporation that is a U.S. real property interest shall recognize gain on the receipt of property in a section 332(a) liquidation where section 334(b)(2) applies to the extent that the fair market value of the distributed assets that are not U.S real property interests exceeds the basis of such assets determined under section 334(b)(2) (for example, if the liquidation does not occur immediately upon the purchase of stock in the domestic corporation). The gain recognized shall not exceed the excess of the fair market value of the stock of the domestic corporation in the hands of the foreign corporation at the time of the distribution over the shareholder's adjusted basis in such stock. The basis of the distributed U.S. real property interests in the hands of the foreign corporation shall be determined under section 334(b)(2), by reference to the adjusted basis of the stock with respect to which the distribution was made. The basis of such property other than U.S. real property interests shall be tentatively determined under section 334(b)(2), and then increased by any gain recognized by the foreign corporation on the distribution allocated among such assets in proportion to the potential gain inherent in each such asset at the time of distribution (computed using the tentative basis as determined under section 334(b)(2)). The basis of each asset is limited, however, to its fair market value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Distribution to a foreign corporation under section 332 after July 31, 1986 and after the repeal of the General Utilities doctrine.

The domestic corporation shall not recognize gain under section 367(e)(2) on the distribution of U.S. real property interests (other than stock in a former U.S. real property holding corporation which is treated as a U.S. real property interest) to the foreign corporation. The domestic corporation shall recognize gain under section 367(e)(2) on the distribution of stock in a former U.S. real property holding corporation which is treated as a U.S. real property interest. With respect to the recognition of gain or loss by the domestic corporation under section 367(e)(2) on the distribution of property other than U.S. real property interests, see the regulations under section 367(e)(2). The basis of the distributed U.S. real property interests (other than stock in a former U.S. real property holding corporation) in the hands of the foreign corporation shall be the same as it was in the hands of the domestic corporation. The basis of any property (other than U.S. real property interests) and stock in a former U.S. real property holding corporation that is a U.S. real property interest in the hands of the foreign corporation shall be the same as it was in the hands of the domestic corporation

A foreign corporation that meets the stock ownership requirements of section 332(b) with respect to stock in another foreign corporation, that has made an effective election under section 897(i) and the stock of which is treated as a U.S. real property interest, shall recognize gain pursuant to section 897(e)(1) on such stock upon the receipt from the distributing foreign corporation of property that is not a U.S. real property interest, and that is not used by the distributee foreign corporation in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States (if the distributee foreign corporation is not a resident of a country with which the United States maintains an income tax treaty) or in a permanent establishment within the United States (if the distributee foreign corporation is a resident of a country with which the United States maintains an income tax treaty). The gain on the stock in the foreign corporation (making an effective election under section 897(i)) to be recognized by the distributee foreign corporation pursuant to section 897(e)(1) shall be determined by multiplying the gain realized on the distribution by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction shall be the fair market value of the property received by the distributee foreign corporation upon which it must recognize gain, and the denominator of the fraction shall be the fair market value of all property received by the distributee foreign corporation on the distribution. The distributing foreign corporation shall not recognize gain under section 367(e)(2) on the distribution of U.S. real property interests to the distributee foreign corporation. With respect to the recognition of gain or loss under section 367(e)(2) on the distribution of property other than U.S. real property interests, see the regulations under section 367(e)(2).

The gain recognized on a respective portion of domestic corporation stock shall not exceed the gain realized on that portion. Property other than U.S. real property interests subject to U.S. taxation upon disposition shall have a fair market value basis in the hands of the foreign shareholder.

Whether a foreign corporation recognizes gain on the distribution of U.S. real property interests to a U.S. corporation meeting the stock ownership requirements of section 332(b) depends upon whether the U.S. corporation satisfies the subject to tax requirement provided in paragraph (d)(1)(i) (in addition to the procedural requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(iii)). With respect to section 332 distributions by a foreign corporation occurring after July 31, 1986, section 367(e)(2) shall not affect the application of section 337(a) (as in effect after the Tax Reform Act of 1986) and paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section to the distribution of a U.S. real property interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Recognition of gain required in certain section 332 liquidations.

In September 1987, FC liquidates under section 332(a) and transfers Parcel P to DC.

The gain recognized shall be limited under this paragraph (c)(3), however, to the amount by which the aggregate

basis of the distributed stock in the hands of the distributees exceeds the aggregate adjusted basis of the distributed stock in the hands of the distributing corporation. The distributees' basis in the distributed U.S. real property interest shall be determined under the otherwise applicable provisions of section 358.

After the distribution, the FC stock has a fair market value of 400x.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, FC must recognize gain on the distribution of the DC stock to C equal to the difference between the fair market value of the DC stock (600x) and FC's adjusted basis in the DC stock (200x). This results in a potential gain of 400x. Under section 358, C takes a 360x adjusted basis in the DC stock. Provided that FC complies with the filing requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section, the gain recognized by FC is limited under paragraph (c)(3)(i) to 160x because (A) this is the amount by which the basis of the DC stock in the hands of C (360x) exceeds the adjusted basis of the DC stock in the hands of FC (200x), and (B) at the time of receipt of the DC stock, C would be subject to U.S. taxation on a subsequent disposition of the stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> C's adjusted basis in the DC stock is not increased by the 160x recognized by FC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Distribution by a foreign corporation in certain reorganizations--(i) In general. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a foreign corporation that transfers property to another corporation in an exchange under section 361(a) for stock of a domestic corporation which is a United States real property holding corporation immediately after the transfer in a reorganization under section 368(a)(1) (C), (D), or (F) shall recognize gain under section 897(d)(1) on the distribution (whether actual or deemed) of the stock of the domestic corporation received by the foreign corporation to its shareholders (whether domestic or foreign). See Sec. 1.897-6T(a) of the regulations for the consequences to the foreign corporation of the exchange of its property for the domestic corporation stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Statutory exception. Pursuant to the exception provided in section 897(d)(2)(A), no gain shall be recognized by the foreign corporation on its distribution of the domestic corporation stock if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> At the time of the distribution, the distributee (i.e., the exchanging shareholder in the section 354 exchange) would be subject to U.S. taxation on a subsequent disposition of the stock of the domestic corporation, determined in accordance with the rules of paragraph (d)(1) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The distributee's adjusted basis in the stock of the foreign corporation immediately before the distribution was no greater than the foreign corporation's basis in the stock of the domestic corporation determined under section 358; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The distributing corporation complies with the filing requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Regulatory limitation on gain recognized. If the requirements of subdivisions (A) and (C) of paragraph (c)(4)(ii) are met, the amount of any gain recognized by the foreign corporation shall not exceed the excess of the distributee's adjusted basis in the stock of the foreign corporation immediately before the distribution over the foreign corporation's basis in the stock of the domestic corporation immediately before the distribution as determined under section 358.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The rules of paragraph (c)(4) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. (i) A, a nonresident alien, organized FC, a Country W corporation, in September 1980 to invest in U.S. real estate. In 1986, FC's only asset is Parcel P, a U.S. real property interest with a fair market value of $600,000 and an adjusted basis to FC of

$200,000. Parcel P is subject to a mortgage with an outstanding balance of $100,000. The fair market value of the FC stock is $500,000, and A's adjusted basis in the stock is $100,000. FC does not have liabilities in excess of the adjusted basis in Parcel P. The United States does not have a treaty with Country W that entitles FC to nondiscriminatory treatment as described in section 1.897-3(b)(2) of the regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pursuant to a plan of reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(D), FC transfers Parcel P to DC, a newly formed domestic corporation, in exchange for DC stock. FC distributes the DC stock to A in exchange for A's FC stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> FC's exchange of Parcel P for the DC stock is a disposition of a U.S. real property interest. Under Sec. 1.897-6T(a)(1), there is an exchange of a U.S. real property interest (Parcel P) for another U.S. real property interest (DC stock) so that no gain is recognized on the exchange under section 897(e). DC takes FC's basis of $200,000 in Parcel P under section 362(b). Under section 358(a)(1), FC takes a $100,000 basis in the DC stock because FC's substituted basis of $200,000 in the DC stock is reduced by the $100,000 of liabilities to which Parcel P is subject.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Under section 897(d)(1) and paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, FC generally must recognize gain on the distribution of the DC stock received in exchange for FC's assets equal to the difference between the fair market value of the DC stock ($500,000) and FC's adjusted basis in the DC stock prior to the distribution ($100,000). This results in a potential gain of $400,000. Under section 358(a)(1), A takes a basis in the DC stock equal to its basis in the FC stock of $100,000. Provided that FC complies with the filing requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section, no gain is recognized by FC on the distribution of the DC stock under the statutory exception to the general rule of section 897(d)(1) provided in section 897(d)(2)(A) and paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section because (1) A's basis in the DC stock ($100,000) does not exceed FC's adjusted basis in the DC stock ($100,000) immediately prior to the distribution and (2) A, at the time of receipt of the DC stock, would be subject to U.S. taxation on a subsequent disposition of the stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The FC stock in the hands of A is not a U.S. real property interest because FC is a foreign corporation that has not elected to be treated as a domestic corporation under section 897(i). Accordingly, the exchange of the FC stock by A for DC stock is not a disposition of a U.S. real property interest under section 897(a).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that A purchased the FC stock in September 1983 for $100,000 from S, a nonresident alien, and that S had a basis of $40,000 in the FC stock at the time of the sale to A. The results are the same as in Example 1.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. (i) The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that A's adjusted basis in the FC stock prior to the reorganization is $300,000. Following the distribution, A takes its basis of $300,000 in the FC stock as its basis in the DC stock pursuant to section 358(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> FC does not qualify under the statutory exception of paragraph (c)(4)(ii) to the general recognition rule of section 897(d)(1) and paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section because A's basis in the DC stock ($300,000) exceeds FC's adjusted basis in the DC stock ($100,000) immediately prior to the distribution. However, provided that FC complies with the filing requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section, the gain recognized by FC is limited to $200,000 under the regulatory limitation of gain provided by paragraph (c)(4)(iii). This is the excess of A's basis in the FC stock immediately before the distribution ($300,000) over A's adjusted basis in the DC stock immediately before the distribution ($100,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A takes a basis of $300,000 in the DC stock under section 358(a)(1). A's basis in the DC stock is not increased by the gain recognized by FC. DC takes a basis of $200,000 in Parcel P under section 362(b).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. (i) The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that the United States has an income tax treaty with Country W entitling FC to nondiscriminatory treatment under section 1.897-3(b)(2) of the regulations. A valid election under section 897(i) is made to treat FC as a U.S. corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> FC is treated as a domestic corporation for purposes of section 897 and is not required to recognize gain under section 897(d)(1) and paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section on the distribution of the DC stock as described in Example 3. (If a valid section 897(i) election were not made, the result would be same as in Example 3.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The FC stock in the hands of A is a U.S. real property interest because an election was made under section 897(i) to treat FC as a U.S. corporation. The exchange of the FC stock for DC stock by A is a disposition of a U.S. real property interest. Under section 897(e)(1) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.897-6T, A does not recognize gain on the exchange because there is an exchange of a U.S. real property interest (the FC stock) for another U.S. real property interest (the DC stock). Under section 358(a)(1), A takes as its basis in the DC stock A's basis in the FC stock ($300,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Sales of U.S. real property interests by foreign corporations under section 337. Section 337 as in effect prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 shall not apply to any sale or exchange (including a deemed section 337 sale pursuant to an

election under section 338(a) to treat a stock purchase as an asset acquisition) of a U.S. real property interest by a foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Section 897(l) credit. If a foreign corporation adopts a plan of complete liquidation and if, solely by reason of section 897(d) and this section, section 337(a) (as in effect before the Tax Reform Act of 1986) does not apply to sales or exchanges of, or section 336 (as in effect before the Tax Reform Act of 1986) does not apply to distributions of, United States real property interests by the liquidating corporation, then--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount realized by the shareholder on the distribution shall be increased by its proportionate share of the amount by which the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code, as modified by the provisions of any applicable U.S. income tax treaty, on the liquidating corporation would have been reduced if section 897(d) and this section had not been applicable, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of the Code, the shareholder shall be deemed to have paid, on the last day prescribed by law for the payment of the tax imposed by subtitle A of the Code on the shareholder for the taxable year, an amount of tax equal to the amount of increase in the amount realized described in subdivison (i) of this paragraph (c).

The special rule provided by this paragraph (c)(5) applies only to shareholders who are United States citizens or residents, and who have held stock in the liquidating corporation continuously since June 18, 1980. This special rule also only applies for the first taxable year of any such shareholder in which the shareholder receives a distribution in complete liquidation from the foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Other applicable rules. For rules concerning exemption of gain pursuant to a U.S. income tax treaty, withholding of tax from distributions, and other applicable rules, see paragraph (d) of this section. For the treatment of liquidations described in section 334(b)(2)(A) of certain foreign corporations acquired before November 6, 1980, see Sec. 1.897-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Rules of general application--(1) Interests subject to taxation upon later disposition--(i) In general. Pursuant to the otherwise applicable rules of this section and Sec. 1.897-6T, nonrecognition of gain or loss may apply with respect to certain distribution or exchanges of U.S. real property interests if any gain from a subsequent disposition of the interests that are distributed or received by the transferor in the exchange would be included in the gross income of the distributee or transferor and be subject to U.S. taxation. Gain is considered subject to U.S. taxation if the gain is included on the income tax return of a U.S. tax paying entity even if there is no U.S. tax liability (for example, because of net operating losses or an investment tax credit). Gain is not considered subject to U.S. taxation if the gain is derived by a tax exempt entity. A real estate investment trust is considered to be a pass-through entity for purposes of the rule of taxability of this paragraph (d)(1)(i). Thus, for example, a tax exempt entity holding an interest in a real estate investment trust is not subject to tax. A domestic corporation (including a foreign corporation that makes an effective section 897(i) election after receipt of the U.S. real property interest) shall not be considered subject to U.S. taxation on a subsequent disposition of a U.S. real property interest if it received the U.S. real property interest prior to the effective date of the repeal of section 336(a) or 337(a) as in effect prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986, unless the U.S. real property interest has not been sold or exchanged by the domestic corporation prior to such effective date in a transaction to which either section 336(a) or section 337(a) (as in effect prior to such effective date) applied. In addition, an interest shall be considered to be subject to U.S. taxation upon its subsequent disposition only if the requirements set forth in subdivision (iii) of this paragraph (d)(1) are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Effects of income tax treaties--(A) Effect of treaty exemption from tax. Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (C) of this paragraph (d)(1)(ii), a U.S. real property interest shall not be considered to be subject to U.S. taxation upon a subsequent disposition if, at the time of its distribution or exchange, the recipient is entitled pursuant to the provisions of a U.S. income tax treaty to an exemption from U.S.

taxation upon a disposition of the interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Effect of treaty reduction of tax. If, at the time of a distribution or exchange, a distributee of a U.S. real property interest in a distribution or a transferor who receives a U.S. real property interest in an exchange would be entitled pursuant to the provisions of a U.S. income tax treaty to reduced U.S. taxation upon the disposition of the interest, then a portion of the interest received shall be treated as an interest subject to U.S. taxation upon its disposition, and, therefore, that portion shall be entitled to nonrecognition treatment under the rules of this section or Sec. 1.897-6T. The portion of the interest that is treated as subject to U.S. taxation is determined by multiplying the fair market value of the interest by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the amount of tax that would be due pursuant to the provisions of the applicable U.S. income tax treaty upon the recipient's disposition of the interest, determined as of the date of the distribution or transfer. The denominator of the fraction is the amount of tax that would be due upon such disposition but for the provisions of the treaty. However, nonrecognition treatment may be preserved in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (C) of this paragraph (d)(1)(ii). With regard to the provisions of this paragraph, see Article XIII (9) of the United States-Canada Income Tax Convention.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Waiver of treaty benefits to preserve nonrecognition. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions (A) and (B) of this paragraph (d)(1)(ii), an interest shall be considered to be subject to U.S. taxation upon its subsequent disposition if, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(F) of this section, the recipient waives the benefits of a U.S. income tax treaty that would otherwise entitle the recipient to an exemption from (or reduction of) U.S. tax upon a disposition of the interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Procedural requirements. If a U.S. real property interest is distributed or transferred after December 31, 1987, the transferor or distributor (that is a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation) shall file an income tax return for the taxable year of the distribution or transfer. Also, if a U.S. real property interest is distributed or transferred in a transaction before January 1, 1988, with respect to which nonrecognition treatment would not have been available under the express provisions of section 897 (d) or (e) of the Code but is available under the provisions of this section or Sec. 1.897-6T, then the person that would otherwise be subject to tax by reason of the operation of section 897 must file an income tax return for the taxable year of the distribution or transfer. This requirement is satisfied by filing a tax return or an amended tax return for the year of the distribution or transfer by May 5, 1989, or by the date that the filing of the return is otherwise required. The person filing the return must attach thereto a document setting forth the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A statement that the distribution or transfer is one to which section 897 applies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A description of the U.S. real property interest distributed or transferred, including its location, its adjusted basis in the hands of the distributor or tranferor immediately before the distribution or transfer, and the date of the distribution or transfer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A description of the U.S. real property interest received in an exchange;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A declaration signed by an officer of the corporation that the distributing foreign corporation has substantiated the adjusted basis of the shareholder in its stock if the distributing corporation has nonrecognition or recognition limitation under paragraph (c) (3) or (4) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The amount of any gain recognized and tax withheld by any person with respect to the distribution or transfer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 1.897-5(d)(1)(iii)(F).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> The treaty and article (if any) under which the distributee or transferor would be exempt from U.S. taxation on a sale of the distributed U.S. real property interest or the U.S. real property interest received in the transfer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> A declaration, signed by the distributee or transferor or its authorized legal representative, that the distributee or transferor shall treat any

subsequent sale, exchange, or other disposition of the U.S. real property interest as a disposition that is subject to U.S. taxation, notwithstanding the provisions of any U.S. income tax treaty or intervening change in circumstances.

A person who has provided or filed a notice described in Sec. 1.1445-2(d)(2)(iii) or Sec. 1.1445-5(b)(2)(ii) in connection with a transaction may satisfy the requirement of this paragraph (d)(1)(iii) by attaching to his return a copy of that notice together with any information or declaration required by this subdivision not contained in that notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Treaty exception to imposition of tax. If gain that would be currently recognized pursuant to the provisions of this section or Sec. 1.897-6T is subject to an exemption from (or reduction of) U.S. tax pursuant to a U.S. income tax treaty, then gain shall be recognized only as provided by that treaty, for dispositions occurring before January 1, 1985. For dispositions occurring after December 31, 1984, all gain shall be recognized as provided in section 897 and the regulations thereunder, except as provided by Articles XIII (9) and XXX (5) of the United States-Canada Income Tax Convention or other income tax treaty entered into force after June 6, 1988.</p><p class="depth0">With regard to Article XXX (5) of the Income Tax Treaty with Canada, see, Rev.

Sec. 1.897-6T  Nonrecognition exchanges applicable to corporations,their shareholders, and other taxpayers, and certain transfers ofproperty in corporate reorganizations (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Nonrecognition exchanges--(1) In general. Except as otherwise provided in this section and in Sec. 1.897-5T, for purposes of section 897(e) any nonrecognition provision shall apply to a transfer by a foreign person of a U.S. real property interest on which gain is realized only to the extent that the transferred U.S. real property interest is exchanged for a U.S. real property interest which, immediately following the exchange, would be subject to U.S. taxation upon its disposition, and the transferor complies with the filing requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of Sec. 1.897-5T. No loss shall be recognized pursuant to section 897(e) or the rules of this section unless such loss is otherwise permitted to be recognized. In the case of an exchange of a U.S. real property interest for stock in a domestic corporation (that is otherwise treated as a U.S. real property interest), such stock shall not be considered a U.S. real property interest unless the domestic corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation immediately after the exchange. Whether an interest would be subject to U.S. taxation in the hands of the transferor upon its disposition shall be determined in accordance with the rules of Sec. 1.897-5T(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definition of ``nonrecognition'' provision. A ``nonrecognition provision'' is any provision of the Code which provides that gain or loss shall not be recognized if the requirements of that provision are met. Nonrecognition provisions relevant to this section include, but are not limited to, sections 332, 351,

354, 355, 361, 721, 731, 1031, 1033, and 1036. For purposes of section 897(e), sections 121 and 453 are not nonrecognition provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Consequence of nonapplication of nonrecognition provisions. If a nonrecognition provision does not apply to a transaction, then the U.S. real property interest transferred shall be considered exchanged pursuant to a transaction that is subject to U.S. taxation by reason of the operation of section 897. See, however, Sec. 1.897-5T (d)(2) with respect to the treaty exceptions to the imposition of tax. If a U.S. real property interest is exchanged for an interest the disposition of which is only partially subject to taxation under chapter 1 of the Code (as modified by the provisions of any applicable U.S. income tax treaty), then any nonrecognition provision shall apply only to the extent that the interest received in the exchange would be subject to taxation under chapter 1 of the Code, as modified. For example, the exchange of a U.S. real property interest for an interest in a partnership will receive nonrecognition treatment pursuant to section 721 only to the extent that a disposition of the partnership interest will be subject to U.S. taxation by reason of the operation of section 897(g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Section 355 distributions treated as exchanges. If a domestic corporation, stock in which is treated as a U.S. real property interest, distributes stock in a foreign corporation or stock in a domestic corporation that is not a U.S. real property holding corporation to a foreign person under section 355(a), then the foreign person shall be considered as having exchanged a proportionate part of the stock in the domestic corporation that is treated as a U.S. real property interest for stock that is not treated as a U.S. real property interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Determination of basis. If a nonrecognition provision applies to the transfer of a U.S. real property interest pursuant to the provisions of this section, then the basis of the property received in the exchange shall be determined in accordance with the rules generally applicable with respect to such nonrecognition provision. Similarly, the basis of the exchanged property in the hands of the transferee shall be determined in accordance with the rules that generally apply to such transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Examples. The rules of paragraphs (a) (1) through (6) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples. In each instance, the filing requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of Sec. 1.897-5T have been satisfied.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1.

the distribution, the DC stock has a fair market value of 300x.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under the rules of paragraph (a)(4) of this section, C is considered to have exchanged DC stock with a fair market value of 200x and an adjusted basis of 40x for FC stock with a fair market value of 200x. Because the FC stock is not a U.S. real property interest, C must recognize gain of 160x under section 897(a) on the distribution. C takes a basis of 200x in the FC stock. C's basis in the DC stock is reduced to 60x pursuant to section 358(c).</p><p class="depth0">Example. (i) A is an individual citizen and resident of Country F. F has an income tax treaty with the United States that exempts gain from the sale of stock, but not real property, by a resident of F from U.S. taxation.

A owned all of the stock of DC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under the rules of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, A must recognize gain on the transfer of Parcel P. Even though there is an exchange of a U.S. real property interest for another U.S. real property interest, there is gain recognition because the U.S. real property interest received (the DC stock) would not have been subject to U.S. taxation upon a disposition immediately following the exchange. A may not convert a U.S. real property interest that was subject to taxation under section 897 into a U.S. real property interest that could be sold without taxation under section 897 due to a treaty exemption.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7.

The rules of paragraph (a)(8)(ii) of this section may be illustrated by the following example.</p><p class="depth0">Example. (i) A is an individual citizen and resident of country F. Country F does not have an income tax treaty with the United States. A is the sole proprietor of a business located in the United States, the assets of which consist of a U.S. real property interest with a fair market value of $1,000,000 and an adjusted basis of $700,000, and equipment used in the business with a fair market value of $500,000 and an adjusted basis of $250,000. A decides to incorporate the business, and on January 1, 1987, A transfers his assets to domestic corporation DC in exchange for 100 percent of the stock of DC, with a fair market value of $900,000. In addition, A receives a long term note (constituting a security) from DC for $600,000, bearing arm's length interest and repayment terms. DC has no assets other than those received in the exchange with A. Pursuant to section 897(c)(2) and Sec. 1.897-2, DC is a U.S. real property holding corporation. Therefore, the stock of DC is a U.S. real property interest. Assume that the note from DC constitutes an interest in the corporation solely as a creditor as provided by Sec. 1.897-1(d)(4) of the regulation. A complies with the filing requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of Sec. 1.897-5T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because the note from DC would not be subject to U.S. taxation upon its disposition, it is nonqualifing property for purposes of determining whether A is entitled to receive nonrecognition treatment pursuant to section 351 with respect to his exchange of the U.S. real property interest. Thus, A must recognize gain in the manner provided in paragraph (a)(8)(ii) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (a)(8)(ii)(A), the amount of nonqualifying property received in exchange for the real property interests is determined by multiplying the fair market value of such property ($600,000) by the real property fraction. The numerator of the fraction is $1,000,000, the fair market value of the real property transferred by A. The demoninator is $1,500,000, the fair market value of all property transferred by A. Thus, A is considered to have received $400,000 of the note in exchange for the real property ($600,000 x $1,000,000/$1,500,000). Pursuant to paragraph (a)(8)(ii)(B), A must recognize the lesser of the amount initially determined or the gain realized with respect to the U.S. real property interest. Therefore, A must recognize the $300,000 gain realized with respect to the real property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Pursuant to paragraph (a)(8)(ii)(C) of this section, A is considered to have received $200,000 of the note in exchange for equipment ($600,000 [total value of note received] minus $400,000 [portion of note received in exchange for real property]), $600,000 of the stock in exchange for real property ($900,000 [total value of stock received] times $1,000,000/1,500,000) [proportion of property exchanged consisting of real property]), and $300,000 of the stock in exchange for equipment ($900,000 [total value of stock received] minus $600,000 [portion of stock received in exchange for real property]). All three amounts are entitled to nonrecognition treatment pursuant to section 351.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, A's basis in the stock and note received and DC's basis in the U.S. real property interest and equipment will be determined in accordance with the generally applicable rules. The $400,000 portion of the note received in exchange for the real property interest is other property. Pursuant to section 358(a)(2), A takes a fair market value ($400,000) basis for that portion of the note. Pursuant to section 358(a)(1), A's basis in the property received without the recognition of gain (the DC stock and the other portion of the note) will be equal to the basis of the property transferred ($950,000 [$700,000 basis of U.S. real property interest plus $250,000 basis of equipment]), decreased by the fair market value of the other property received ($400,000 portion of the note), and increased by the amount of gain recognized to A on the transaction ($300,000). Thus, A's basis in the stock and the nonrecognition portion of the note is $850,000 ($950,000-$400,000 + $300,000). Under Sec. 1.358-2(b)(2) of the regulations, the $850,000 is allocated between the stock and the nonrecognition portion of the note in proportion to their fair market values. A takes a basis of $697,000 in the DC stock ($850,000 x 900,000/1,100,000). A takes a basis of $153,000 in the nonrecognition portion of the note ($850,000 x 200,000/1,100,000). A's basis in the note is $553,000 ($400,000 + $153,000). DC's basis in the property received from A will be determined under section 362(a). DC takes a basis of $1,000,000 in the real property interest (A's basis of $700,000 increased by the $300,000 of gain recognized by A on it). DC takes a basis of $250,000 in the equipment (A's basis of $250,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Treaty exception to imposition of tax. If gain that would be currently recognized pursuant to the provisions of this section is subject to an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. tax pursuant to a U.S. income tax treaty, then

gain shall be recognized only as provided by that treaty for dispositions occurring before January 1, 1985. For dispositions occurring after December 31, 1984, all gain shall be recognized as provided in section 897 and the regulations thereunder, except as provided by Articles XII (9) and XXX (5) of the United States-Canada Income Tax Convention or other income tax treaty entered into after June 6, 1988.

Pursuant to section 897(g), an interest in a partnership in which, directly or indirectly, fifty percent or more of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real property interests, and ninety percent or more of the value of the gross assets consist of U.S. real property interests plus any cash or cash equivalents shall, for purposes of section 1445, be treated as entirely a U.S. real property interest. For purposes of section 897(g), such interest shall be treated as a U.S. real property interest only to the extent that the gain on the disposition is attributable to U.S. real property interests (and not cash, cash equivalents or other property). Consequently, a disposition of any portion of such partnership interest shall be subject to partial taxation under section 897(a) and full withholding under section 1445(a). For purposes of this paragraph, cash equivalent means any asset readily convertible into cash (whether or not denominated in U.S. dollars) including, but not limited to, bank accounts, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, commercial paper, U.S. and foreign treasury obligations and bonds, corporate obligations and bonds, precious metals or commodities, and publicly traded instruments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Effective date.

However, if a non-regularly traded class of interests in the corporation is convertible into a regularly traded class of interests in the corporation, an interest in such non-regularly traded class shall be treated as a U.S. real property interest

if on the date it was acquired by its present holder it had a fair market value greater than the fair market value on that date of 5 percent of the regularly traded class of the corporation's stock into which it is convertible. If a person holds interests in a corporation of a class that is not regularly traded, and subsequently acquires additional interests of the same class, then all such interests must be aggregated and valued as of the date of the subsequent acquisition. If the subsequent acquisition causes that person's interests to exceed the applicable limitation, then all such interests shall be treated as U.S. real property interests, regardless of when acquired. In addition, if a person holds interests in a corporation of separate classes that are not regularly traded, and if such interests were separately acquired for a principal purpose of avoiding the applicable 5 percent limitation of this paragraph, then such interests shall be aggregated for purposes of applying that limitation. This rule shall not apply to interests of separate classes acquired in transactions more than three years apart.

Sec. 1.901-2  Income, war profits, or excess profits tax paidor accrued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definition of income, war profits, or excess profits tax--(1) In general. Section 901 allows a credit for the amount of income, war profits or excess profits tax (referred to as ``income tax'' for purposes of this section and Sec. Sec. 1.901-2A and 1.903-1) paid to any foreign country. Whether a foreign levy is an income tax is determined independently for each separate foreign levy. A foreign levy is an income tax if and only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> It is a tax; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The predominant character of that tax is that of an income tax in the U.S. sense.

Except to the extent otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii) and (c) of this section, a tax either is or is not an income tax, in its entirety, for all persons subject to the tax. Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section define an income tax for purposes of section 901. Paragraph (d) of this section contains rules describing what constitutes a separate foreign levy. Paragraph (e) of this section contains rules for determining the amount of tax paid by a person. Paragraph (f) of this section contains rules for determining by whom foreign tax is paid. Paragraph (g) of this section contains definitions of the terms ``paid by,'' ``foreign country,'' and ``foreign levy.'' Paragraph (h) of this section states the effective date of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Tax--(i) In general. A foreign levy is a tax if it requires a compulsory payment pursuant to the authority of a foreign country to levy taxes. A penalty, fine, interest, or similar obligation is not a tax, nor is a customs duty a tax. Whether a foreign levy requires a compulsory payment pursuant to a foreign country's authority to levy taxes is determined by principles of U.S. law and not by principles of law of the foreign country. Therefore, the assertion by a foreign country that a levy is pursuant to the foreign country's authority to levy taxes is not determinative that, under U.S. principles, it is pursuant thereto. Notwithstanding any assertion of a foreign country to the contrary, a foreign levy is not pursuant to a foreign country's authority to levy taxes, and thus is not a tax, to the extent a person subject to the levy receives (or will receive), directly or indirectly, a specific economic benefit (as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) from the

foreign country in exchange for payment pursuant to the levy. Rather, to that extent, such levy requires a compulsory payment in exchange for such specific economic benefit. If, applying U.S. principles, a foreign levy requires a compulsory payment pursuant to the authority of a foreign country to levy taxes and also requires a compulsory payment in exchange for a specific economic benefit, the levy is considered to have two distinct elements: A tax and a requirement of compulsory payment in exchange for such specific economic benefit. In such a situation, these two distinct elements of the foreign levy (and the amount paid pursuant to each such element) must be separated. No credit is allowable for a payment pursuant to a foreign levy by a dual capacity taxpayer (as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section) unless the person claiming such credit establishes the amount that is paid pursuant to the distinct element of the foreign levy that is a tax. See paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section and Sec. 1.901-2A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Dual capacity taxpayers--(A) In general. For purposes of this section and Sec. Sec. 1.901-2A and 1.903-1, a person who is subject to a levy of a foreign state or of a possession of the United States or of a political subdivision of such a state or possession and who also, directly or indirectly (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(E) of this section) receives (or will receive) a specific economic benefit from the state or possession or from a political subdivision of such state or possession or from an agency or instrumentality of any of the foregoing is referred to as a ``dual capacity taxpayer.'' Dual capacity taxpayers are subject to the special rules of Sec. 1.901-2A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Specific economic benefit. For purposes of this section and Sec. Sec. 1.901-2A and 1.903-1, the term ``specific economic benefit'' means an economic benefit that is not made available on substantially the same terms to substantially all persons who are subject to the income tax that is generally imposed by the foreign country, or, if there is no such generally imposed income tax, an economic benefit that is not made available on substantially the same terms to the population of the country in general. Thus, a concession to extract government-owned petroleum is a specific economic benefit, but the right to travel or to ship freight on a government-owned airline is not, because the latter, but not the former, is made generally available on substantially the same terms. An economic benefit includes property; a service; a fee or other payment; a right to use, acquire or extract resources, patents or other property that a foreign country owns or controls (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(D) of this section); or a reduction or discharge of a contractual obligation. It does not include the right or privilege merely to engage in business generally or to engage in business in a particular form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Pension, unemployment, and disability fund payments. A foreign levy imposed on individuals to finance retirement, old-age, death, survivor, unemployment, illness, or disability benefits, or for some substantially similar purpose, is not a requirement of compulsory payment in exchange for a specific economic benefit, as long as the amounts required to be paid by the individuals subject to the levy are not computed on a basis reflecting the respective ages, life expectancies or similar characteristics of such individuals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Control of property. A foreign country controls property that it does not own if the country exhibits substantial indicia of ownership with respect to the property, for example, by both regulating the quantity of property that may be extracted and establishing the minimum price at which it may be disposed of.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Indirect receipt of a benefit. A person is considered to receive a specific economic benefit indirectly if another person receives a specific economic benefit and that other person--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Owns or controls, directly or indirectly, the first person or is owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the first person or by the same persons that own or control, directly or indirectly, the first person; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Engages in a transaction with the first person under terms and conditions such that the first person receives, directly or indirectly, all or part of the value of the specific economic benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Predominant character. The predominant character of a foreign tax is

that of an income tax in the U.S. sense--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If, within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the foreign tax is likely to reach net gain in the normal circumstances in which it applies,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> But only to the extent that liability for the tax is not dependent, within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section, by its terms or otherwise, on the availability of a credit for the tax against income tax liability to another country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Net gain--(1) In general. A foreign tax is likely to reach net gain in the normal circumstances in which it applies if and only if the tax, judged on the basis of its predominant character, satisfies each of the realization, gross receipts, and net income requirements set forth in paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3) and (b)(4), respectively, of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Realization--(i) In general. A foreign tax satisfies the realization requirement if, judged on the basis of its predominant character, it is imposed--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Upon or subsequent to the occurrence of events (``realization events'') that would result in the realization of income under the income tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Upon the occurrence of an event prior to a realization event (a ``prerealization event'') provided the consequence of such event is the recapture (in whole or part) of a tax deduction, tax credit or other tax allowance previously accorded to the taxpayer; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Upon the occurrence of a prerealization event, other than one described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, but only if the foreign country does not, upon the occurrence of a later event (other than a distribution or a deemed distribution of the income), impose tax (``second tax'') with respect to the income on which tax is imposed by reason of such prerealization event (or, if it does impose a second tax, a credit or other comparable relief is available against the liability for such a second tax for tax paid on the occurrence of the prerealization event) and--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The imposition of the tax upon such prerealization event is based on the difference in the values of property at the beginning and end of a period; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The prerealization event is the physical transfer, processing, or export of readily marketable property (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section).

A foreign tax that, judged on the basis of its predominant character, is imposed upon the occurrence of events described in this paragraph (b)(2)(i) satisfies the realization requirement even if it is also imposed in some situations upon the occurrence of events not described in this paragraph (b)(2)(i). For example, a foreign tax that, judged on the basis of its predominant character, is imposed upon the occurrence of events described in this paragraph (b)(2)(i) satisfies the realization requirement even though the base of that tax also includes imputed rental income from a personal residence used by the owner and receipt of stock dividends of a type described in section 305(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. As provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a tax either is or is not an income tax, in its entirety, for all persons subject to the tax; therefore, a foreign tax described in the immediately preceding sentence satisfies the realization requirement even though some persons subject to the tax will on some occasions not be subject to the tax except with respect to such imputed rental income and such stock dividends. However, a foreign tax based only or predominantly on such imputed rental income or only or predominantly on receipt of such stock dividends does not satisfy the realization requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certain deemed distributions. A foreign tax that does not satisfy the realization requirement under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section is nevertheless considered to meet the realization requirement if it is imposed with respect to a deemed distribution (e.g., by a corporation to a shareholder) of amounts that meet the realization requirement in the hands of the person that, under foreign law, is deemed to distribute such amount, but only if the foreign country does not, upon the occurrence of a later event (e.g., an actual distribution), impose tax (``second tax'') with respect to the income on which tax was imposed by reason of such deemed distribution (or, if it does impose a second tax, a credit or other

comparable relief is available against the liability for such a second tax for tax paid with respect to the deemed distribution).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Readily marketable property. Property is readily marketable if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> It is stock in trade or other property of a kind that properly would be included in inventory if on hand at the close of the taxable year or if it is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> It can be sold on the open market without further processing or it is exported from the foreign country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Residents of country X are subject to a tax of 10 percent on the aggregate net appreciation in fair market value during the calendar year of all shares of stock held by them at the end of the year. In addition, all such residents are subject to a country X tax that qualifies as an income tax within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Included in the base of the income tax are gains and losses realized on the sale of stock, and the basis of stock for purposes of determining such gain or loss is its cost. The operation of the stock appreciation tax and the income tax as applied to sales of stock is exemplified as follows: A, a resident of country X, purchases stock in June, 1983 for 100u (units of country X currency) and sells it in May, 1985 for 160u. On December 31, 1983, the stock is worth 120u and on December 31, 1984, it is worth 155u. Pursuant to the stock appreciation tax, A pays 2u for 1983 (10 percent of (120u-100u)), 3.5u for 1984 (10 percent of (155u-120u)), and nothing in 1985 because no stock was held at the end of that year. For purposes of the income tax, A must include 60u (160u-100u) in his income for 1985, the year of sale. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section, the stock appreciation tax does not satisfy the realization requirement because country X imposes a second tax upon the occurrence of a later event (i.e., the sale of stock) with respect to the income that was taxed by the stock appreciation tax and no credit or comparable relief is available against such second tax for the stock appreciation tax paid.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1 except that if stock was held on the December 31 last preceding the date of its sale, the basis of such stock for purposes of computing gain or loss under the income tax is the value of the stock on such December 31. Thus, in 1985, A includes only 5u (160u--155u) as income from the sale for purposes of the income tax. Because the income tax imposed upon the occurrence of a later event (the sale) does not impose a tax with respect to the income that was taxed by the stock appreciation tax, the stock appreciation tax satisfies the realization requirement. The result would be the same if, instead of a basis adjustment to reflect taxation pursuant to the stock appreciation tax, the country X income tax allowed a credit (or other comparable relief) to take account of the stock appreciation tax. If a credit mechanism is used, see also paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Country X imposes a tax on the realized net income of corporations that do business in country X. Country X also imposes a branch profits tax on corporations organized under the law of a country other than country X that do business in country X. The branch profits tax is imposed when realized net income is remitted or deemed to be remitted by branches in country X to home offices outside of country X. The branch profits tax is imposed subsequent to the occurrence of events that would result in realization of income (i.e., by corporations subject to such tax) under the income tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code; thus, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the branch profits tax satisfies the realization requirement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Country X imposes a tax on the realized net income of corporations that do business in country X (the ``country X corporate tax''). Country X also imposes a separate tax on shareholders of such corporations (the ``country X shareholder tax''). The country X shareholder tax is imposed on the sum of the actual distributions received during the taxable year by such a shareholder from the corporation's realized net income for that year (i.e., income from past years is not taxed in a later year when it is actually distributed) plus the distributions deemed to be received by such a shareholder. Deemed distributions are defined as (A) a shareholder's pro rata share of the corporation's realized net income for the taxable year, less (B) such shareholder's pro rata share of the corporation's country X corporate tax for that year, less (C) actual distributions made by such corporation to such shareholder from such net income. A shareholder's receipt of actual distributions is a realization event within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section. The deemed distributions are not realization events, but they are described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. Accordingly, the country X shareholder tax satisfies the realization requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Gross receipts--(i) In general. A foreign tax satisfies the gross receipts requirement if, judged on the basis of its predominant character, it is imposed on the basis of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Gross receipts; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Gross receipts computed under a method that is likely to produce an amount that is not greater than fair market value.

A foreign tax that, judged on the basis of its predominant character, is imposed on the basis of amounts described in this paragraph (b)(3)(i) satisfies the gross receipts requirement even if it is also imposed on the basis of some amounts not described in this paragraph (b)(3)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The provisions of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Country X imposes a ``headquarters company tax'' on country X corporations that serve as regional headquarters for affiliated nonresident corporations, and this tax is a separate tax within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this section. A headquarters company for purposes of this tax is a corporation that performs administrative, management or coordination functions solely for nonresident affiliated entities. Due to the difficulty of determining on a case-by-case basis the arm's length gross receipts that headquarters companies would charge affiliates for such services, gross receipts of a headquarters company are deemed, for purposes of this tax, to equal 110 percent of the business expenses incurred by the headquarters company. It is established that this formula is likely to produce an amount that is not greater than the fair market value of arm's length gross receipts from such transactions with affiliates. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section, the headquarters company tax satisfies the gross receipts requirement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, with the added fact that in the case of a particular taxpayer, A, the formula actually produces an amount that is substantially greater than the fair market value of arm's length gross receipts from transactions with affiliates. As provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the headquarters company tax either is or is not an income tax, in its entirety, for all persons subject to the tax. Accordingly, the result is the same as in example 1 for all persons subject to the headquarters company tax, including A.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Country X imposes a separate tax (within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this section) on income from the extraction of petroleum. Under that tax, gross receipts from extraction income are deemed to equal 105 percent of the fair market value of petroleum extracted. This computation is designed to produce an amount that is greater than the fair market value of actual gross receipts; therefore, the tax on extraction income is not likely to produce an amount that is not greater than fair market value. Accordingly, the tax on extraction income does not satisfy the gross receipts requirement. However, if the tax satisfies the criteria of Sec. 1.903-1(a), it is a tax in lieu of an income tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Net income--(i) In general. A foreign tax satisfies the net income requirement if, judged on the basis of its predominant character, the base of the tax is computed by reducing gross receipts (including gross receipts as computed under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section) to permit--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Recovery of the significant costs and expenses (including significant capital expenditures) attributable, under reasonable principles, to such gross receipts; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Recovery of such significant costs and expenses computed under a method that is likely to produce an amount that approximates, or is greater than, recovery of such significant costs and expenses.

A foreign tax law permits recovery of significant costs and expenses even if such costs and expenses are recovered at a different time than they would be if the Internal Revenue Code applied, unless the time of recovery is such that under the circumstances there is effectively a denial of such recovery. For example, unless the time of recovery is such that under the circumstances there is effectively a denial of such recovery, the net income requirement is satisfied where items deductible under the Internal Revenue Code are capitalized under the foreign tax system and recovered either on a recurring basis over time or upon the occurrence of some future event or where the recovery of items capitalized under the Internal Revenue Code occurs less rapidly under the foreign tax system. A foreign tax law that does not permit recovery of one or more significant costs or expenses, but that provides allowances that effectively compensate for nonrecovery of such significant costs or expenses, is considered to permit recovery of such costs or expenses. Principles used in the foreign tax law to attribute costs and expenses to gross receipts may be reasonable even if they differ from principles that apply under

the Internal Revenue Code (e.g., principles that apply under section 265, 465 or 861(b) of the Internal Revenue Code). A foreign tax whose base, judged on the basis of its predominant character, is computed by reducing gross receipts by items described in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) or (B) of this section satisfies the net income requirement even if gross receipts are not reduced by some such items. A foreign tax whose base is gross receipts or gross income does not satisfy the net income requirement except in the rare situation where that tax is almost certain to reach some net gain in the normal circumstances in which it applies because costs and expenses will almost never be so high as to offset gross receipts or gross income, respectively, and the rate of the tax is such that after the tax is paid persons subject to the tax are almost certain to have net gain. Thus, a tax on the gross receipts or gross income of businesses can satisfy the net income requirement only if businesses subject to the tax are almost certain never to incur a loss (after payment of the tax). In determining whether a foreign tax satisfies the net income requirement, it is immaterial whether gross receipts are reduced, in the base of the tax, by another tax, provided that other tax satisfies the realization, gross receipts and net income requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Consolidation of profits and losses. In determining whether a foreign tax satisfies the net income requirement, one of the factors to be taken into account is whether, in computing the base of the tax, a loss incurred in one activity (e.g., a contract area in the case of oil and gas exploration) in a trade or business is allowed to offset profit earned by the same person in another activity (e.g., a separate contract area) in the same trade or business. If such an offset is allowed, it is immaterial whether the offset may be made in the taxable period in which the loss is incurred or only in a different taxable period, unless the period is such that under the circumstances there is effectively a denial of the ability to offset the loss against profit. In determining whether a foreign tax satisfies the net income requirement, it is immaterial that no such offset is allowed if a loss incurred in one such activity may be applied to offset profit earned in that activity in a different taxable period, unless the period is such that under the circumstances there is effectively a denial of the ability to offset such loss against profit. In determining whether a foreign tax satisfies the net income requirement, it is immaterial whether a person's profits and losses from one trade or business (e.g., oil and gas extraction) are allowed to offset its profits and losses from another trade or business (e. g., oil and gas refining and processing), or whether a person's business profits and losses and its passive investment profits and losses are allowed to offset each other in computing the base of the foreign tax. Moreover, it is immaterial whether foreign law permits or prohibits consolidation of profits and losses of related persons, unless foreign law requires separate entities to be used to carry on separate activities in the same trade or business. If foreign law requires that separate entities carry on such separate activities, the determination whether the net income requirement is satisfied is made by applying the same considerations as if such separate activities were carried on by a single entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Carryovers. In determining whether a foreign tax satisfies the net income requirement, it is immaterial, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, whether losses incurred during one taxable period may be carried over to offset profits incurred in different taxable periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (b)(4) may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Country X imposes an income tax on corporations engaged in business in country X; however, that income tax is not applicable to banks. Country X also imposes a tax (the ``bank tax'') of 1 percent on the gross amount of interest income derived by banks from branches in country X; no deductions are allowed. Banks doing business in country X incur very substantial costs and expenses (e.g., interest expense) attributable to their interest income. The bank tax neither provides for recovery of significant costs and expenses nor provides any allowance that significantly compensates for the lack of such recovery. Since such banks are not almost certain never to incur a loss on

their interest income from branches in country X, the bank tax does not satisfy the net income requirement. However, if the tax on corporations is generally imposed, the bank tax satisfies the criteria of Sec. 1.903-1(a) and therefore is a tax in lieu of an income tax.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Country X law imposes an income tax on persons engaged in business in country X. The base of that tax is realized net income attributable under reasonable principles to such business. Under the tax law of country X, a bank is not considered to be engaged in business in country X unless it has a branch in country X and interest income earned by a bank from a loan to a resident of country X is not considered attributable to business conducted by the bank in country X unless a branch of the bank in country X performs certain significant enumerated activities, such as negotiating the loan. Country X also imposes a tax (the ``bank tax'') of 1 percent on the gross amount of interest income earned by banks from loans to residents of country X if such banks do not engage in business in country X or if such interest income is not considered attributable to business conducted in country X. For the same reasons as are set forth in example 1, the bank tax does not satisfy the net income requirement. However, if the tax on persons engaged in business in country X is generally imposed, the bank tax satisfies the criteria of Sec. 1.903-1(a) and therefore is a tax in lieu of an income tax.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. A foreign tax is imposed at the rate of 40 percent on the amount of gross wages realized by an employee; no deductions are allowed. Thus, the tax law neither provides for recovery of costs and expenses nor provides any allowance that effectively compensates for the lack of such recovery. Because costs and expenses of employees attributable to wage income are almost always insignificant compared to the gross wages realized, such costs and expenses will almost always not be so high as to offset the gross wages and the rate of the tax is such that, under the circumstances, after the tax is paid, employees subject to the tax are almost certain to have net gain.

Accordingly, the tax satisfies the net income requirement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Country X imposes a tax at the rate of 48 percent of the ``taxable income'' of nonresidents of country X who furnish specified types of services to customers who are residents of country X. ``Taxable income'' for purposes of the tax is defined as gross receipts received from residents of country X (regardless of whether the services to which the receipts relate are performed within or outside country X) less deductions that permit recovery of the significant costs and expenses (including significant capital expenditures) attributable under reasonable principles to such gross receipts. The country X tax satisfies the net income requirement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Each of country X and province Y (a political subdivision of country X) imposes a tax on corporations, called the ``country X income tax'' and the ``province Y income tax,'' respectively. Each tax has an identical base, which is computed by reducing a corporation's gross receipts by deductions that, based on the predominant character of the tax, permit recovery of the significant costs and expenses (including significant capital expenditures) attributable under reasonable principles to such gross receipts. The country X income tax does not allow a deduction for the province Y income tax for which a taxpayer is liable, nor does the province Y income tax allow a deduction for the country X income tax for which a taxpayer is liable. As provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, each of the country X income tax and the province Y income tax is a separate levy. Both of these levies satisfy the net income requirement; the fact that neither levy's base allows a deduction for the other levy is immaterial in reaching that determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Soak-up taxes--(1) In general. Pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, the predominant character of a foreign tax that satisfies the requirement of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section is that of an income tax in the U.S. sense only to the extent that liability for the foreign tax is not dependent (by its terms or otherwise) on the availability of a credit for the tax against income tax liability to another country. Liability for foreign tax is dependent on the availability of a credit for the foreign tax against income tax liability to another country only if and to the extent that the foreign tax would not be imposed on the taxpayer but for the availability of such a credit. See also Sec. 1.903-1(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Country X imposes a tax on the receipt of royalties from sources in country X by nonresidents of country X. The tax is 15 percent of the gross amount of such royalties unless the recipient is a resident of the United States or of country A, B, C, or D, in which case the tax is 20 percent of the gross amount of such royalties. Like the United States, each of countries A, B, C, and D allows its residents a credit against the income tax otherwise payable to it for income taxes paid to other countries. Because the 20 percent rate applies only to residents of countries which allow a credit for taxes paid

to other countries and the 15 percent rate applies to residents of countries which do not allow such a credit, one-fourth of the country X tax would not be imposed on residents of the United States but for the availability of such a credit. Accordingly, one-fourth of the country X tax imposed on residents of the United States who receive royalties from sources in country X is dependent on the availability of a credit for the country X tax against income tax liability to another country.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Country X imposes a tax on the realized net income derived by all nonresidents from carrying on a trade or business in country X. Although country X law does not prohibit other nonresidents from carrying on business in country X, United States persons are the only nonresidents of country X that carry on business in country X in 1984. The country X tax would be imposed in its entirety on a nonresident of country X irrespective of the availability of a credit for country X tax against income tax liability to another country. Accordingly, no portion of that tax is dependent on the availability of such a credit.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Country X imposes tax on the realized net income of all corporations incorporated in country X. Country X allows a tax holiday to qualifying corporations incorporated in country X that are owned by nonresidents of country X, pursuant to which no country X tax is imposed on the net income of a qualifying corporation for the first ten years of its operations in country X. A corporation qualifies for the tax holiday if it meets certain minimum investment criteria and if the development office of country X certifies that in its opinion the operations of the corporation will be consistent with specified development goals of country X. The development office will not so certify to any corporation owned by persons resident in countries that allow a credit (such as that available under section 902 of the Internal Revenue Code) for country X tax paid by a corporation incorporated in country X. In practice, tax holidays are granted to a large number of corporations, but country X tax is imposed on a significant number of other corporations incorporated in country X (e.g., those owned by country X persons and those which have had operations for more than 10 years) in addition to corporations denied a tax holiday because their shareholders qualify for a credit for the country X tax against income tax liability to another country. In the case of corporations denied a tax holiday because they have U.S. shareholders, no portion of the country X tax during the period of the denied 10-year tax holiday is dependent on the availability of a credit for the country X tax against income tax liability to another country.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in example 3, except that corporations owned by persons resident in countries that will allow a credit for country X tax at the time when dividends are distributed by the corporations are granted a provisional tax holiday. Under the provisional tax holiday, instead of relieving such a corporation from country X tax for 10 years, liability for such tax is deferred until the corporation distributes dividends. The result is the same as in example 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Separate levies--(1) In general. For purposes of sections 901 and 903, whether a single levy or separate levies are imposed by a foreign country depends on U.S. principles and not on whether foreign law imposes the levy or levies in a single or separate statutes. A levy imposed by one taxing authority (e.g., the national government of a foreign country) is always separate for purposes of sections 901 and 903 from a levy imposed by another taxing authority (e.g., a political subdivision of that foreign country). Levies are not separate merely because different rates apply to different taxpayers. For example, a foreign levy identical to the tax imposed on U.S. citizens and resident alien individuals by section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code is a single levy notwithstanding the levy has graduated rates and applies different rate schedules to unmarried individuals, married individuals who file separate returns and married individuals who file joint returns. In general, levies are not separate merely because some provisions determining the base of the levy apply, by their terms or in practice, to some, but not all, persons subject to the levy. For example, a foreign levy identical to the tax imposed by section 11 of the Internal Revenue Code is a single levy even though some provisions apply by their terms to some but not all corporations subject to the section 11 tax (e.g., section 465 is by its terms applicable to corporations described in sections 465(a)(1)(B) and 465(a)(1)(C), but not to other corporations), and even though some provisions apply in practice to some but not all corporations subject to the section 11 tax (e.g., section 611 does not, in practice, apply to any corporation that does not have a qualifying interest in the type of property described in section 611(a)). However, where the base of a levy is different in kind, and not merely in degree, for different classes of persons subject to the levy, the levy

is considered for purposes of sections 901 and 903 to impose separate levies for such classes of persons. For example, regardless of whether they are contained in a single or separate foreign statutes, a foreign levy identical to the tax imposed by section 871(b) of the Internal Revenue Code is a separate levy from a foreign levy identical to the tax imposed by section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code as it applies to persons other than those described in section 871(b), and foreign levies identical to the taxes imposed by sections 11, 541, 881, 882, 1491 and 3111 of the Internal Revenue Code are each separate levies, because the base of each of those levies differs in kind, and not merely in degree, from the base of each of the others. Accordingly, each such levy must be analyzed separately to determine whether it is an income tax within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section and whether it is a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.903-1. Where foreign law imposes a levy that is the sum of two or more separately computed amounts, and each such amount is computed by reference to a separate base, separate levies are considered, for purposes of sections 901 and 903, to be imposed. A separate base may consist, for example, of a particular type of income or of an amount unrelated to income, e.g., wages paid. Amounts are not separately computed if they are computed separately merely for purposes of a preliminary computation and are then combined as a single base. In the case of levies that apply to dual capacity taxpayers, see also Sec. 1.901-2A(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contractual modifications. Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, if foreign law imposing a levy is modified for one or more persons subject to the levy by a contract entered into by such person or persons and the foreign country, then foreign law is considered for purposes of sections 901 and 903 to impose a separate levy for all persons to whom such contractual modification of the levy applies, as contrasted to the levy as applied to all persons to whom such contractual modification does not apply. In applying the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section to a tax as modified by such a contract, the provisions of Sec. 1.903-1(b)(2) shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A foreign statute imposes a levy on corporations equal to the sum of 15% of the corporation's realized net income plus 3% of its net worth. As the levy is the sum of two separately computed amounts, each of which is computed by reference to a separate base, each of the portion of the levy based on income and the portion of the levy based on net worth is considered, for purposes of sections 901 and 903, to be a separate levy.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. A foreign statute imposes a levy on nonresident alien individuals analogous to the taxes imposed by section 871 of the Internal Revenue Code. For the same reasons as set forth in example 1, each of the portion of the foreign levy analogous to the tax imposed by section 871(a) and the portion of the foreign levy analogous to the tax imposed by sections 871 (b) and 1, is considered, for purposes of sections 901 and 903, to be a separate levy.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. A single foreign statute or separate foreign statutes impose a foreign levy that is the sum of the products of specified rates applied to specified bases, as follows:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Rate</p><p class="depth0">Base                              (percent)------------------------------------------------------------------------Net income from mining.....................................           45Net income from manufacturing..............................           50Net income from technical services.........................           50Net income from other services.............................           45Net income from investments................................           15All other net income.......................................           50------------------------------------------------------------------------

In computing each such base, deductible expenditures are allocated to the type of income they generate. If allocated deductible expenditures exceed the gross amount of a specified type of income, the excess may not be applied against income of a different specified type. Accordingly, the levy is the sum of several separately computed amounts, each of which is computed by reference to a separate base. Each of the levies on mining net income, manufacturing net income, technical services net income, other services net income, investment net income and other net income is, therefore, considered, for purposes of sections 901 and 903, to be a separate levy.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in example 3, except that excess deductible expenditures allocated to one type of income are applied against other types of income to which the same rate applies. The levies on mining net income and other services net income together are considered, for purposes of sections 901 and 903, to be a single levy since, despite a separate preliminary computation

of the bases, by reason of the permitted application of excess allocated deductible expenditures, the bases are not separately computed. For the same reason, the levies on manufacturing net income, technical services net income and other net income together are considered, for purposes of sections 901 and 903, to be a single levy. The levy on investment net income is considered, for purposes of sections 901 and 903, to be a separate levy. These results are not dependent on whether the application of excess allocated deductible expenditures to a different type of income, as described above, is permitted in the same taxable period in which the expenditures are taken into account for purposes of the preliminary computation, or only in a different (e.g., later) taxable period.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. The facts are the same as in example 3, except that excess deductible expenditures allocated to any type of income other than investment income are applied against the other types of income (including investment income) according to a specified set of priorities of application. Excess deductible expenditures allocated to investment income are not applied against any other type of income. For the reason expressed in example 4, all of the levies are together considered, for purposes of sections 901 and 903, to be a single levy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Amount of income tax that is creditable--(1) In general. Credit is allowed under section 901 for the amount of income tax (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section) that is paid to a foreign country by the taxpayer. The amount of income tax paid by the taxpayer is determined separately for each taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Refunds and credits--(i) In general. An amount is not tax paid to a foreign country to the extent that it is reasonably certain that the amount will be refunded, credited, rebated, abated, or forgiven. It is not reasonably certain that an amount will be refunded, credited, rebated, abated, or forgiven if the amount is not greater than a reasonable approximation of final tax liability to the foreign country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The provisions of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. The internal law of country X imposes a 25 percent tax on the gross amount of interest from sources in country X that is received by a nonresident of country X. Country X law imposes the tax on the nonresident recipient and requires any resident of country X that pays such interest to a nonresident to withhold and pay over to country X 25 percent of such interest, which is applied to offset the recipient's liability for the 25 percent tax. A tax treaty between the United States and country X overrides internal law of country X and provides that country X may not tax interest received by a resident of the United States from a resident of country X at a rate in excess of 10 percent of the gross amount of such interest. A resident of the United States may claim the benefit of the treaty only by applying for a refund of the excess withheld amount (15 percent of the gross amount of interest income) after the end of the taxable year. A, a resident of the United States, receives a gross amount of 100u (units of country X currency) of interest income from a resident of country X from sources in country X in the taxable year 1984, from which 25u of country X tax is withheld. A files a timely claim for refund of the 15u excess withheld amount. 15u of the amount withheld (25u-10u) is reasonably certain to be refunded; therefore 15u is not considered an amount of tax paid to country X.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. A's initial income tax liability under country X law is 100u (units of country X currency). However, under country X law A's initial income tax liability is reduced in order to compute its final tax liability by an investment credit of 15u and a credit for charitable contributions of 5u. The amount of income tax paid by A is 80u.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. A computes his income tax liability in country X for the taxable year 1984 as 100u (units of country X currency), files a tax return on that basis, and pays 100u of tax. The day after A files that return, A files a claim for refund of 90u. The difference between the 100u of liability reflected in A's original return and the 10u of liability reflected in A's refund claim depends on whether a particular expenditure made by A is nondeductible or deductible, respectively. Based on an analysis of the country X tax law, A's country X tax advisors have advised A that it is not clear whether or not that expenditure is deductible. In view of the uncertainty as to the proper treatment of the item in question under country X tax law, no portion of the 100u paid by A is reasonably certain to be refunded. If A receives a refund, A must treat the refund as required by section 905(c) of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. A levy of country X, which qualifies as an income tax within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, provides that each person who makes payment to country X pursuant to the levy will receive a bond to be issued by country X with an amount payable at maturity equal to 10 percent of the amount paid pursuant to the levy. A pays 38,000u (units of country X currency) to country X and is entitled to receive a bond with an amount payable at maturity of 3800u. It is reasonably certain that a refund in the form of property (the bond) will

be made. The amount of that refund is equal to the fair market value of the bond. Therefore, only the portion of the 38,000u payment in excess of the fair market value of the bond is an amount of tax paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Subsidies--(i) General rule. An amount of foreign income tax is not an amount of income tax paid or accrued by a taxpayer to a foreign country to the extent that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount is used, directly or indirectly, by the foreign country imposing the tax to provide a subsidy by any means (including, but not limited to, a rebate, a refund, a credit, a deduction, a payment, a discharge of an obligation, or any other method) to the taxpayer, to a related person (within the meaning of section 482), to any party to the transaction, or to any party to a related transaction; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The subsidy is determined, directly or indirectly, by reference to the amount of the tax or by reference to the base used to compute the amount of the tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Subsidy. The term ``subsidy'' includes any benefit conferred, directly or indirectly, by a foreign country to one of the parties enumerated in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A) of this section. Substance and not form shall govern in determining whether a subsidy exists. The fact that the U.S. taxpayer may derive no demonstrable benefit from the subsidy is irrelevant in determining whether a subsidy exists.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Official exchange rate. A subsidy described in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(B) of this section does not include the actual use of an official foreign government exchange rate converting foreign currency into dollars where a free exchange rate also exists if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The economic benefit represented by the use of the official exchange rate is not targeted to or tied to transactions that give rise to a claim for a foreign tax credit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The economic benefit of the official exchange rate applies to a broad range of international transactions, in all cases based on the total payment to be made without regard to whether the payment is a return of principal, gross income, or net income, and without regard to whether it is subject to tax; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any reduction in the overall cost of the transaction is merely coincidental to the broad structure and operation of the official exchange rate.

In regard to foreign taxes paid or accrued in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987, to which the Mexican Exchange Control Decree, effective as of December 20, 1982, applies, see Rev. Rul. 84-143, 1984-2 C.B. 127.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (e)(3) may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. (i) Country X imposes a 30 percent tax on nonresident lenders with respect to interest which the nonresident lenders receive from borrowers who are residents of Country X, and it is established that this tax is a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.903-1(a). Country X provides the nonresident lenders with receipts upon their payment of the 30 percent tax. Country X remits to resident borrowers an incentive payment for engaging in foreign loans, which payment is an amount equal to 20 percent of the interest paid to nonresident lenders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because the incentive payment is based on the interest paid, it is determined by reference to the base used to compute the tax that is imposed on the nonresident lender. The incentive payment is considered a subsidy under this paragraph (e)(3) since it is provided to a party (the borrower) to the transaction and is based on the amount of tax that is imposed on the lender with respect to the transaction. Therefore, two-thirds (20 percent/30 percent) of the amount withheld by the resident borrower from interest payments to the nonresidential lender is not an amount of income tax paid or accrued for purposes of section 901(b).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. (i) A U.S. bank lends money to a development bank in Country X. The development bank relends the money to companies resident in Country X. A withholding tax is imposed by Country X on the U.S. bank with respect to the interest that the development bank pays to the U.S. bank, and appropriate receipts are provided. On the date that the tax is withheld, fifty percent of the tax is credited by Country X to an account of the development bank. Country X requires the development bank to transfer the amount credited to the borrowing companies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount successively credited to the account of the development bank and then to the account of the borrowing companies is determined by reference to the amount of the tax and the tax base. Since the amount credited to the borrowing companies is a subsidy provided to a party (the borrowing companies) to a related transaction and is based on the amount of tax and

the tax base, it is not an amount paid or accrued as an income tax for purposes of section 901(b).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. (i) A U.S. bank lends dollars to a Country X borrower. Country X imposes a withholding tax on the lender with respect to the interest. The tax is to be paid in Country X currency, although the interest is payable in dollars. Country X has a dual exchange rate system, comprised of a controlled official exchange rate and a free exchange rate. Priority transactions such as exports of merchandise, imports of merchandise, and payments of principal and interest on foreign currency loans payable abroad to foreign lenders are governed by the official exchange rate which yields more dollars per unit of Country X currency than the free exchange rate. The Country X borrower remits the net amount of dollar interest due to the U.S. bank (interest due less withholding tax), pays the tax withheld in Country X currency to the Country X government, and provides to the U.S. bank a receipt for payment of the Country X taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The use of the official exchange rate by the U.S. bank to determine foreign taxes with respect to interest is not a subsidy described in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(B) of this section. The official exchange rate is not targeted to or tied to transactions that give rise to a claim for a foreign tax credit. The use of the official exchange rate applies to the interest paid and to the principal paid. Any benefit derived by the U.S. bank through the use of the official exchange rate is merely coincidental to the broad structure and operation of the official exchange rate.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. (i) B, a U.S. corporation, is engaged in the production of oil and gas in Country X pursuant to a production sharing agreement between B, Country X, and the state petroleum authority of Country X. The agreement is approved and enacted into law by the Legislature of Country X. Both B and the petroleum authority are subject to the Country X income tax. Each entity files an annual income tax return and pays, to the tax authority of Country X, the amount of income tax due on its annual income. B is a dual capacity taxpayer as defined in Sec. 1.901-2(a)(2)(ii)(A). Country X has agreed to return to the petroleum authority one-half of the income taxes paid by B by allowing it a credit in calculating its own tax liability to Country X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The petroleum authority is a party to a transaction with B and the amount returned by Country X to the petroleum authority is determined by reference to the amount of the tax imposed on B. Therefore, the amount returned is a subsidy as described in this paragraph (e)(3) and one-half the tax imposed on B is not an amount of income tax paid or accrued.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Assume the same facts as in Example 4, except that the state petroleum authority of Country X does not receive amounts from Country X related to tax paid by B. Instead, the authority of Country X receives a general appropriation from Country X which is not calculated with reference to the amount of tax paid by B. The general appropriation is therefore not a subsidy described in this paragraph (e)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Effective Date. This paragraph (e)(3) shall apply to foreign taxes paid or accrued in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Multiple levies--(i) In general. If, under foreign law, a taxpayer's tentative liability for one levy (the ``first levy'') is or can be reduced by the amount of the taxpayer's liability for a different levy (the ``second levy''), then the amount considered paid by the taxpayer to the foreign country pursuant to the second levy is an amount equal to its entire liability for that levy, and the remainder of the amount paid is considered paid pursuant to the first levy. This rule applies regardless of whether it is or is not likely that liability for one such levy will always exceed liability for the other such levy. For an example of the application of this rule, see example 5 of Sec. 1.903-1(b)(3). If, under foreign law, the amount of a taxpayer's liability is the greater or lesser of amounts computed pursuant to two levies, then the entire amount paid to the foreign country by the taxpayer is considered paid pursuant to the levy that imposes such greater or lesser amount, respectively, and no amount is considered paid pursuant to such other levy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Integrated tax systems. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Noncompulsory amounts--(i) In general. An amount paid is not a compulsory payment, and thus is not an amount of tax paid, to the extent that the amount paid exceeds the amount of liability under foreign law for tax. An amount paid does not exceed the amount of such liability if the amount paid is determined by the taxpayer in a manner that is consistent with a reasonable interpretation and application of the substantive and procedural provisions of foreign law (including applicable tax treaties) in such a way as to

reduce, over time, the taxpayer's reasonably expected liability under foreign law for tax, and if the taxpayer exhausts all effective and practical remedies, including invocation of competent authority procedures available under applicable tax treaties, to reduce, over time, the taxpayer's liability for foreign tax (including liability pursuant to a foreign tax audit adjustment). Where foreign tax law includes options or elections whereby a taxpayer's tax liability may be shifted, in whole or part, to a different year or years, the taxpayer's use or failure to use such options or elections does not result in a payment in excess of the taxpayer's liability for foreign tax. An interpretation or application of foreign law is not reasonable if there is actual notice or constructive notice (e.g., a published court decision) to the taxpayer that the interpretation or application is likely to be erroneous. In interpreting foreign tax law, a taxpayer may generally rely on advice obtained in good faith from competent foreign tax advisors to whom the taxpayer has disclosed the relevant facts. A remedy is effective and practical only if the cost thereof (including the risk of offsetting or additional tax liability) is reasonable in light of the amount at issue and the likelihood of success. A settlement by a taxpayer of two or more issues will be evaluated on an overall basis, not on an issue-by-issue basis, in determining whether an amount is a compulsory amount. A taxpayer is not required to alter its form of doing business, its business conduct, or the form of any business transaction in order to reduce its liability under foreign law for tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The provisions of paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A, a corporation organized and doing business solely in the United States, owns all of the stock of B, a corporation organized in country X. In 1984 A buys merchandise from unrelated persons for $1,000,000, shortly thereafter resells that merchandise to B for $600,000, and B later in 1984 resells the merchandise to unrelated persons for $1,200,000. Under the country X income tax, which is an income tax within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, all corporations organized in country X are subject to a tax equal to 3 percent of their net income. In computing its 1984 country X income tax liability B reports $600,000 ($1,200,000--$600,000) of profit from the purchase and resale of the merchandise referred to above. The country X income tax law requires that transactions between related persons be reported at arm's length prices, and a reasonable interpretation of this requirement, as it has been applied in country X, would consider B's arm's length purchase price of the merchandise purchased from A to be $1,050,000. When it computes its country X tax liability B is aware that $600,000 is not an arm's length price (by country X standards). B's knowing use of a non-arm's length price (by country X standards) of $600,000, instead of a price of $1,050,000 (an arm's length price under country X's law), is not consistent with a reasonable interpretation and application of the law of country X, determined in such a way as to reduce over time B's reasonably expected liability for country X income tax. Accordingly, $13,500 (3 percent of $450,000 ($1,050,000--$600,000)), the amount of country X income tax paid by B to country X that is attributable to the purchase of the merchandise from B's parent at less than an arm's length price, is in excess of the amount of B's liability for country X tax, and thus is not an amount of tax.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. A, a corporation organized and doing business solely in the United States, owns all of the stock of B, a corporation organized in country X. Country X has in force an income tax treaty with the United States. The treaty provides that the profits of related persons shall be determined as if the persons were not related. A and B deal extensively with each other. A and B, with respect to a series of transactions involving both of them, treat A as having $300,000 of income and B as having $700,000 of income for purposes of A's United States income tax and B's country X income tax, respectively. B has no actual or constructive notice that its treatment of these transactions under country X law is likely to be erroneous. Subsequently, the Internal Revenue Service reallocates $200,000 of this income from B to A under the authority of section 482 and the treaty. This reallocation constitutes actual notice to A and constructive notice to B that B's interpretation and application of country X's law and the tax treaty is likely to be erroneous. B does not exhaust all effective and practical remedies to obtain a refund of the amount of country X income tax paid by B to country X that is attributable to the reallocated $200,000 of income. This amount is in excess of the amount of B's liability for country X tax and thus is not an amount of tax.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in example 2, except that B files a claim for refund (an administrative proceeding) of country X tax and A or B invokes the competent authority procedures of the treaty, the cost

of which is reasonable in view of the amount at issue and the likelihood of success, Nevertheless, B does not obtain any refund of country X tax. The cost of pursuing any judicial remedy in country X would be unreasonable in light of the amount at issue and the likelihood of B's success, and B does not pursue any such remedy. The entire amount paid by B to country X is a compulsory payment and thus is an amount of tax paid by B.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in example 2, except that, when the Internal Revenue Service makes the reallocation, the country X statute of limitations on refunds has expired; and neither the internal law of country X nor the treaty authorizes the country X tax authorities to pay a refund that is barred by the statute of limitations. B does not file a claim for refund, and neither A nor B invokes the competent authority procedures of the treaty. Because the country X tax authorities would be barred by the statute of limitations from paying a refund, B has no effective and practicable remedies. The entire amount paid by B to country X is a compulsory payment and thus is an amount of tax paid by B.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. A is a U.S. person doing business in country X. In computing its income tax liability to country X, A is permitted, at its election, to recover the cost of machinery used in its business either by deducting that cost in the year of acquisition or by depreciating that cost on the straight line method over a period of 2, 4, 6 or 10 years. A elects to depreciate machinery over 10 years. This election merely shifts A's tax liability to different years (compared to the timing of A's tax liability under a different depreciation period); it does not result in a payment in excess of the amount of A's liability for country X income tax in any year since the amount of country X tax paid by A is consistent with a reasonable interpretation of country X law in such a way as to reduce over time A's reasonably expected liability for country X tax. Because the standard of paragraph (e)(5(i) of this section refers to A's reasonably expected liability, not its actual liability, events actually occurring in subsequent years (e.g. whether A has sufficient profit in such years so that such depreciation deductions actually reduce A's country X tax liability or whether the country X tax rates change) are immaterial.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. The internal law of country X imposes a 25 percent tax on the gross amount of interest from sources in country X that is received by a nonresident of country X. Country X law imposes the tax on the nonresident recipient and requires any resident of country X that pays such interest to a nonresident to withhold and pay over to country X 25 percent of such interest, which is applied to offset the recipient's liability for the 25 percent tax. A tax treaty between the United States and country X overrides internal law of country X and provides that country X may not tax interest received by a resident of the United States from a resident of country X at a rate in excess of 10 percent of the gross amount of such interest. A resident of the United States may claim the benefit of the treaty only by applying for a refund of the excess withheld amount (15 percent of the gross amount of interest income) after the end of the taxable year. A, a resident of the United States, receives a gross amount of 100u (units of country X currency) of interest income from a resident of country X from sources in country X in the taxable year 1984, from which 25u of country X tax is withheld. A does not file a timely claim for refund. 15u of the amount withheld (25u-10u) is not a compulsory payment and hence is not an amount of tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Structured passive investment arrangements--(A) In general. Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section, an amount paid to a foreign country (a ``foreign payment'') is not a compulsory payment, and thus is not an amount of tax paid, if the foreign payment is attributable (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)(1)(ii) of this section) to a structured passive investment arrangement (as described in paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Conditions. An arrangement is a structured passive investment arrangement if all of the following conditions are satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Special purpose vehicle (SPV). An entity that is part of the arrangement meets the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Substantially all of the gross income (for U.S. tax purposes) of the entity, if any, is passive investment income, and substantially all of the assets of the entity are assets held to produce such passive investment income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> There is a foreign payment attributable to income of the entity (as determined under the laws of the foreign country to which such foreign payment is made), including the entity's share of income of a lower-tier entity that is a branch or pass-through entity under the laws of such foreign country, that, if the foreign payment were an amount of tax paid, would be paid or accrued in a U.S. taxable year in which the entity meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)(1)(i) of this section. A foreign payment attributable to income of an entity includes a foreign payment

attributable to income that is required to be taken into account by an owner of the entity, if the entity is a branch or pass-through entity under the laws of such foreign country. A foreign payment attributable to income of the entity also includes a withholding tax (within the meaning of section 901(k)(1)(B)) imposed on a dividend or other distribution (including distributions made by a pass-through entity or an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for U.S. tax purposes) with respect to the equity of the entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> U.S. party. A person would be eligible to claim a credit under section 901(a) (including a credit for foreign taxes deemed paid under section 902 or 960) for all or a portion of the foreign payment described in paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)(1)(ii) of this section if the foreign payment were an amount of tax paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Direct investment. The U.S. party's proportionate share of the foreign payment or payments described in paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)(1)(ii) of this section is (or is expected to be) substantially greater than the amount of credits, if any, that the U.S. party reasonably would expect to be eligible to claim under section 901(a) for foreign taxes attributable to income generated by the U.S. party's proportionate share of the assets owned by the SPV if the U.S. party directly owned such assets. For this purpose, direct ownership shall not include ownership through a branch, a permanent establishment or any other arrangement (such as an agency arrangement or dual resident status) that would result in the income generated by the U.S. party's proportionate share of the assets being subject to tax on a net basis in the foreign country to which the payment is made. A U.S. party's proportionate share of the assets of the SPV shall be determined by reference to such U.S. party's proportionate share of the total value of all of the outstanding interests in the SPV that are held by its equity owners and creditors. A U.S. party's proportionate share of the assets of the SPV, however, shall not include any assets that produce income subject to gross basis withholding tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Foreign tax benefit. The arrangement is reasonably expected to result in a credit, deduction, loss, exemption, exclusion or other tax benefit under the laws of a foreign country that is available to a counterparty or to a person that is related to the counterparty (determined under the principles of paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(C)(7) of this section by applying the tax laws of a foreign country in which the counterparty is subject to tax on a net basis). However, a foreign tax benefit in the form of a credit is described in this paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)(4) only if the amount of any such credit corresponds to 10 percent or more of the amount of the U.S. party's share (for U.S. tax purposes) of the foreign payment referred to in paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)(1)(ii) of this section. In addition, a foreign tax benefit in the form of a deduction, loss, exemption, exclusion or other tax benefit is described in this paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)(4) only if such amount corresponds to 10 percent or more of the foreign base with respect to which the U.S. party's share (for U.S. tax purposes) of the foreign payment is imposed. For purposes of the preceding two sentences, if an arrangement involves more than one U.S. party or more than one counterparty or both, the aggregate amount of foreign tax benefits available to all of the counterparties and persons related to such counterparties is compared to the aggregate amount of all of the U.S. parties' shares of the foreign payment or foreign base, as the case may be. Where a U.S. party indirectly owns interests in an SPV that are treated as equity interests for both U.S. and foreign tax purposes, a foreign tax benefit available to a foreign entity in the chain of ownership that begins with the SPV and ends with the first-tier entity in the chain does not correspond to the U.S. party's share of the foreign payment attributable to income of the SPV to the extent that such benefit relates to earnings of the SPV that are distributed with respect to equity interests in the SPV that are owned directly or indirectly by the U.S. party for purposes of both U.S. and foreign tax law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Counterparty. The arrangement involves a counterparty. A counterparty

is a person that, under the tax laws of a foreign country in which the person is subject to tax on the basis of place of management, place of incorporation or similar criterion or otherwise subject to a net basis tax, directly or indirectly owns or acquires equity interests in, or assets of, the SPV. However, a counterparty does not include the SPV or a person with respect to which for U.S. tax purposes the same domestic corporation, U.S. citizen or resident alien individual directly or indirectly owns more than 80 percent of the total value of the stock (or equity interests) of each of the U.S. party and such person. A counterparty also does not include a person with respect to which for U.S. tax purposes the U.S. party directly or indirectly owns more than 80 percent of the total value of the stock (or equity interests), but only if the U.S. party is a domestic corporation, a U.S. citizen or a resident alien individual. In addition, a counterparty does not include an individual who is a U.S. citizen or resident alien.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Inconsistent treatment. The United States and an applicable foreign country treat one or more of the aspects of the arrangement listed in paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)(6)(i) through (e)(5)(iv)(B)(6)(iv) of this section differently under their respective tax systems, and for one or more tax years when the arrangement is in effect one or both of the following two conditions applies; either the amount of income attributable to the SPV that is recognized for U.S. tax purposes by the SPV, the U.S. party or parties, and persons related to a U.S. party or parties is materially less than the amount of income that would be recognized if the foreign tax treatment controlled for U.S. tax purposes; or the amount of credits claimed by the U.S. party or parties (if the foreign payment described in paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)(1)(ii) of this section were an amount of tax paid) is materially greater than it would be if the foreign tax treatment controlled for U.S. tax purposes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The classification of the SPV (or an entity that has a direct or indirect ownership interest in the SPV) as a corporation or other entity subject to an entity-level tax, a partnership or other flow-through entity or an entity that is disregarded for tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The characterization as debt, equity or an instrument that is disregarded for tax purposes of an instrument issued by the SPV (or an entity that has a direct or indirect ownership interest in the SPV) to a U.S. party, a counterparty or a person related to a U.S. party or a counterparty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The proportion of the equity of the SPV (or an entity that directly or indirectly owns the SPV) that is considered to be owned directly or indirectly by a U.S. party and a counterparty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The amount of taxable income that is attributable to the SPV for one or more tax years during which the arrangement is in effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of paragraph (e)(5)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Applicable foreign country. An applicable foreign country means each foreign country to which a foreign payment described in paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)(1)(ii) of this section is made or which confers a foreign tax benefit described in paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Counterparty. The term counterparty means a person described in paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Entity. The term entity includes a corporation, trust, partnership or disregarded entity described in Sec. 301.7701-2(c)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Indirect ownership. Indirect ownership of stock or another equity interest (such as an interest in a partnership) shall be determined in accordance with the principles of section 958(a)(2), regardless of whether the interest is owned by a U.S. or foreign entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Passive investment income--(i) In general. The term passive investment income means income described in section 954(c), as modified by this paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(C)(5)(i) and paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(C)(5)(ii) of this section. In determining whether income is described in section 954(c), paragraphs (c)(1)(H), (c)(3), and (c)(6) of that section shall be disregarded. Sections 954(c), 954(h), and 954(i) shall be applied at the entity level as if the entity (as defined in

paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(C)(3) of this section) were a controlled foreign corporation (as defined in section 957(a)). For purposes of determining if sections 954(h) and 954(i) apply for purposes of this paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(C)(5)(i) and paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(C)(5)(ii) of this section, any income of an entity attributable to transactions that, assuming the entity is an SPV, are with a person that is a counterparty, or with persons that are related to a counterparty within the meaning of paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)(4) of this section, shall not be treated as qualified banking or financing income or as qualified insurance income, and shall not be taken into account in applying sections 954(h) and 954(i) for purposes of determining whether other income of the entity is excluded from section 954(c)(1) under section 954(h) or 954(i), but only if any such person (or a person that is related to such person within the meaning of paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)(4) of this section) is eligible for a foreign tax benefit described in paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)(4) of this section. In addition, in applying section 954(h) for purposes of this paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(C)(5)(i) and paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(C)(5)(ii) of this section, section 954(h)(3)(E) shall not apply, section 954(h)(2)(A)(ii) shall be satisfied only if the entity conducts substantial activity with respect to its business through its own employees, and the term ``any foreign country'' shall be substituted for ``home country'' wherever it appears in section 954(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Income attributable to lower-tier entities; holding company exception. Income of an upper-tier entity that is attributable to an equity interest in a lower-tier entity, including dividends, an allocable share of partnership income, and income attributable to the ownership of an interest in an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner is passive investment income unless substantially all of the upper-tier entity's assets consist of qualified equity interests in one or more lower-tier entities, each of which is engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business and derives more than 50 percent of its gross income from such trade or business, and substantially all of the upper-tier entity's opportunity for gain and risk of loss with respect to each such interest in a lower-tier entity is shared by the U.S. party (or persons that are related to a U.S. party) and, assuming the entity is an SPV, a counterparty (or persons that are related to a counterparty) (``holding company exception''). If an arrangement involves more than one U.S. party or more than one counterparty or both, then substantially all of the upper-tier entity's opportunity for gain and risk of loss with respect to its interest in any lower-tier entity must be shared (directly or indirectly) by one or more U.S. parties (or persons related to such U.S. parties) and, assuming the upper-tier entity is an SPV, one or more counterparties (or persons related to such counterparties). Substantially all of the upper-tier entity's opportunity for gain and risk of loss with respect to its interest in any lower-tier entity is not shared if the opportunity for gain and risk of loss is borne (directly or indirectly) by one or more U.S. parties (or persons related to such U.S. party or parties) or, assuming the upper-tier entity is an SPV, by one or more counterparties (or persons related to such counterparty or counterparties). Whether and the extent to which a person is considered to share in an upper-tier entity's opportunity for gain and risk of loss is determined based on all the facts and circumstances, provided, however, that a person does not share in an upper-tier entity's opportunity for gain and risk of loss if its equity interest in the upper-tier entity was acquired in a sale-repurchase transaction or if its interest is treated as debt for U.S. tax purposes. If a U.S. party owns an interest in an entity indirectly through a chain of entities, the application of the holding company exception begins with the lowest-tier entity in the chain that may satisfy the holding company exception and proceeds upward; provided, however, that the opportunity for gain and risk of loss borne by any upper-tier entity in the chain that is a counterparty shall be disregarded to the extent borne indirectly by a U.S. party. An upper-tier entity that satisfies the holding company exception is itself considered to be engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business

and to derive more than 50 percent of its gross income from such trade or business for purposes of applying the holding company exception to the owners of such entity. A lower-tier entity that is engaged in a banking, financing, or similar business shall not be considered to be engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business unless the income derived by such entity would be excluded from section 954(c)(1) under section 954(h) or 954(i) as modified by paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(C)(5)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Qualified equity interest. With respect to an interest in a corporation, the term qualified equity interest means stock representing 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and 10 percent or more of the total value of the stock of the corporation or disregarded entity, but does not include any preferred stock (as defined in section 351(g)(3)). Similar rules shall apply to determine whether an interest in an entity other than a corporation is a qualified equity interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Related person. Two persons are related if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> One person directly or indirectly owns stock (or an equity interest) possessing more than 50 percent of the total value of the other person; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The same person directly or indirectly owns stock (or an equity interest) possessing more than 50 percent of the total value of both persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Special purpose vehicle (SPV). The term SPV means the entity described in paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> U.S. party. The term U.S. party means a person described in paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (e)(5)(iv) of this section. No inference is intended as to whether a taxpayer would be eligible to claim a credit under section 901(a) if a foreign payment were an amount of tax paid. The examples set forth below do not limit the application of other principles of existing law to determine the proper tax consequences of the structures or transactions addressed in the regulations.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. U.S. borrower transaction. (i) Facts. A domestic corporation (USP) forms a country M corporation (Newco), contributing $1.5 billion in exchange for 100% of the stock of Newco. Newco, in turn, loans the $1.5 billion to a second country M corporation (FSub) wholly owned by USP. USP then sells its entire interest in Newco to a country M corporation (FP) for the original purchase price of $1.5 billion, subject to an obligation to repurchase the interest in five years for $1.5 billion. The sale has the effect of transferring ownership of the Newco stock to FP for country M tax purposes. Assume the sale-repurchase transaction is structured in a way that qualifies as a collateralized loan for U.S. tax purposes. Therefore, USP remains the owner of the Newco stock for U.S. tax purposes. In year 1, FSub pays Newco $120 million of interest. Newco pays $36 million to country M with respect to such interest income and distributes the remaining $84 million to FP. Under country M law, the $84 million distribution is excluded from FP's income. None of FP's stock is owned, directly or indirectly, by USP or any shareholders of USP that are domestic corporations, U.S. citizens, or resident alien individuals. Under an income tax treaty between country M and the United States, country M does not impose country M tax on interest received by U.S. residents from sources in country M.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. The $36 million payment by Newco to country M is not a compulsory payment, and thus is not an amount of tax paid because the foreign payment is attributable to a structured passive investment arrangement. First, Newco is an SPV because all of Newco's income is passive investment income described in paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(C)(5) of this section; Newco's only asset, a note, is held to produce such income; the payment to country M is attributable to such income; and if the payment were an amount of tax paid it would be paid or accrued in a U.S. taxable year in which Newco meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)(1)(i) of this section. Second, if the foreign payment were treated as an amount of tax paid, USP would be deemed to pay the foreign payment under section 902(a) and, therefore, would be eligible to claim a credit for such payment under section 901(a). Third, USP would not pay any country M tax if it directly owned Newco's loan receivable. Fourth, the distribution from Newco to FP is exempt from tax under country M law, and the exempt amount corresponds to more than 10% of the foreign base with respect to which USP's share (which is 100% under U.S. tax law) of the foreign payment was imposed. Fifth, FP is a counterparty because FP owns stock of Newco under country M law and none of FP's stock is owned by USP or shareholders of USP that are domestic corporations, U.S. citizens, or resident alien individuals. Sixth, FP is the owner of 100% of Newco's stock for

country M tax purposes, while USP is the owner of 100% of Newco's stock for U.S. tax purposes, and the amount of credits claimed by USP if the payment to country M were an amount of tax paid is materially greater than it would be if country M tax treatment controlled for U.S. tax purposes such that FP, rather than USP, owned 100% of Newco's stock. Because the payment to country M is not an amount of tax paid, USP is not deemed to pay any country M tax under section 902(a). USP has dividend income of $84 million and also has interest expense of $84 million. FSub's post-1986 undistributed earnings are reduced by $120 million of interest expense.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. U.S. borrower transaction. (i) Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that FSub is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Newco. In addition, assume FSub is engaged in the active conduct of manufacturing and selling widgets and derives more than 50% of its gross income from such business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. The results are the same as in Example 1. Although Newco wholly owns FSub, which is engaged in the active conduct of manufacturing and selling widgets and derives more than 50% of its income from such business, Newco's income that is attributable to Newco's equity interest in FSub is passive investment income because the sale-repurchase transaction limits FP's interest in Newco and its assets to that of a creditor, so that substantially all of Newco's opportunity for gain and risk of loss with respect to its stock in FSub is borne by USP. See paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(C)(5)(ii) of this section. Accordingly, Newco's stock in FSub is held to produce passive investment income. Thus, Newco is an SPV because all of Newco's income is passive investment income described in paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(C)(5) of this section, Newco's assets are held to produce such income, the payment to country M is attributable to such income, and if the payment were an amount of tax paid it would be paid or accrued in a U.S. taxable year in which Newco meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. U.S. borrower transaction. (i) Facts. (A) A domestic corporation (USP) loans $750 million to its wholly-owned domestic subsidiary (Sub). USP and Sub form a country M partnership (Partnership) to which each contributes $750 million. Partnership loans all of its $1.5 billion of capital to Issuer, a wholly-owned country M affiliate of USP, in exchange for a note and coupons providing for the payment of interest at a fixed rate over a five-year term. Partnership sells all of the coupons to Coupon Purchaser, a country N partnership owned by a country M corporation (Foreign Bank) and a wholly-owned country M subsidiary of Foreign Bank, for $300 million. At the time of the coupon sale, the fair market value of the coupons sold is $290 million and, pursuant to section 1286(b)(3), Partnership's basis allocated to the coupons sold is $290 million. Several months later and prior to any interest payments on the note, Foreign Bank and its subsidiary sell all of their interests in Coupon Purchaser to an unrelated country O corporation for $280 million. None of Foreign Bank's stock or its subsidiary's stock is owned, directly or indirectly, by USP or Sub or by any shareholders of USP or Sub that are domestic corporations, U.S. citizens, or resident alien individuals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Assume that both the United States and country M respect the sale of the coupons for tax law purposes. In the year of the coupon sale, for country M tax purposes USP's and Sub's shares of Partnership's profits total $300 million, a payment of $60 million to country M is made with respect to those profits, and Foreign Bank and its subsidiary, as partners of Coupon Purchaser, are entitled to deduct the $300 million purchase price of the coupons from their taxable income. For U.S. tax purposes, USP and Sub recognize their distributive shares of the $10 million premium income and claim a direct foreign tax credit for their shares of the $60 million payment to country M. Country M imposes no additional tax when Foreign Bank and its subsidiary sell their interests in Coupon Purchaser. Country M also does not impose country M tax on interest received by U.S. residents from sources in country M.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. The payment to country M is not a compulsory payment, and thus is not an amount of tax paid, because the foreign payment is attributable to a structured passive investment arrangement. First, Partnership is an SPV because all of Partnership's income is passive investment income described in paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(C)(5) of this section; Partnership's only asset, Issuer's note, is held to produce such income; the payment to country M is attributable to such income; and if the payment were an amount of tax paid, it would be paid or accrued in a U.S. taxable year in which Partnership meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)(1)(i) of this section. Second, if the foreign payment were an amount of tax paid, USP and Sub would be eligible to claim a credit for such payment under section 901(a). Third, USP and Sub would not pay any country M tax if they directly owned Issuer's note. Fourth, for country M tax purposes, Foreign Bank and its subsidiary deduct the $300 million purchase price of the coupons and are exempt from country M tax on the $280 million received upon the sale of Coupon Purchaser, and the deduction and exemption correspond to more than 10% of the $300 million base with respect to which USP's and Sub's 100% share of the foreign payments was imposed. Fifth, Foreign Bank and its subsidiary are counterparties because

they indirectly acquired assets of Partnership, the interest coupons on Issuer's note, and are not directly or indirectly owned by USP or Sub or shareholders of USP or Sub that are domestic corporations, U.S. citizens, or resident alien individuals. Sixth, the amount of taxable income of Partnership for one or more years is different for U.S. and country M tax purposes, and the amount of income attributable to USP and Sub for U.S. tax purposes is materially less than the amount of income they would recognize if the country M tax treatment of the coupon sale controlled for U.S. tax purposes. Because the payment to country M is not an amount of tax paid, USP and Sub are not considered to pay tax under section 901. USP and Sub have income of $10 million in the year of the coupon sale.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Active business; no SPV. (i) Facts. A, a domestic corporation, wholly owns B, a country X corporation engaged in the manufacture and sale of widgets. On January 1, year 1, C, also a country X corporation, loans $400 million to B in exchange for an instrument that is debt for U.S. tax purposes and equity in B for country X tax purposes. As a result, C is considered to own stock of B for country X tax purposes. B loans $55 million to D, a country Y corporation wholly owned by A. In year 1, B has $166 million of net income attributable to its sales of widgets and $3.3 million of interest income attributable to the loan to D. Substantially all of B's assets are used in its widget business. Country Y does not impose tax on interest paid to nonresidents. B makes a payment of $50.8 million to country X with respect to B's net income. Country X does not impose tax on dividend payments between country X corporations. None of C's stock is owned, directly or indirectly, by A or by any shareholders of A that are domestic corporations, U.S. citizens, or resident alien individuals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. B is not an SPV within the meaning of paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)(1) of this section because the amount of interest income received from D does not constitute substantially all of B's income and the $55 million note from D does not constitute substantially all of B's assets. Accordingly, the $50.8 million payment to country X is not attributable to a structured passive investment arrangement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. U.S. lender transaction. (i) Facts. (A) A country X corporation (Foreign Bank) contributes $2 billion to a newly-formed country X company (Newco) in exchange for 90% of the common stock of Newco and securities that are treated as debt of Newco for U.S. tax purposes and preferred stock of Newco for country X tax purposes. A domestic corporation (USP) contributes $1 billion to Newco in exchange for 10% of Newco's common stock and securities that are treated as preferred stock of Newco for U.S. tax purposes and debt of Newco for country X tax purposes. Newco loans the $3 billion to a wholly-owned, country X subsidiary of Foreign Bank (FSub) in return for a $3 billion, seven-year note paying interest currently. The Newco securities held by USP entitle the holder to fixed distributions of $4 million per year, and the Newco securities held by Foreign Bank entitle the holder to receive $82 million per year, payable only on maturity of the $3 billion FSub note in year 7. At the end of year 5, pursuant to a prearranged plan, Foreign Bank acquires USP's Newco stock and securities for a prearranged price of $1 billion. Country X does not impose tax on dividends received by one country X corporation from a second country X corporation. Under an income tax treaty between country X and the United States, country X does not impose country X tax on interest received by U.S. residents from sources in country X. None of Foreign Bank's stock is owned, directly or indirectly, by USP or any shareholders of USP that are domestic corporations, U.S. citizens, or resident alien individuals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In each of years 1 through 7, FSub pays Newco $124 million of interest on the $3 billion note. Newco distributes $4 million to USP in each of years 1 through 5. The distributions are deductible for country X tax purposes, and Newco pays country X $36 million with respect to $120 million of taxable income from the FSub note in each year. For U.S. tax purposes, in each year Newco's post-1986 undistributed earnings are increased by $124 million of interest income and reduced by accrued interest expense with respect to the Newco securities held by Foreign Bank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. The $36 million payment to country X is not a compulsory payment, and thus is not an amount of tax paid, because the foreign payment is attributable to a structured passive investment arrangement. First, Newco is an SPV because all of Newco's income is passive investment income described in paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(C)(5) of this section; Newco's only asset, a note of FSub, is held to produce such income; the payment to country X is attributable to such income; and if the payment were an amount of tax paid it would be paid or accrued in a U.S. taxable year in which Newco meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)(1)(i) of this section. Second, if the foreign payment were an amount of tax paid, USP would be deemed to pay its pro rata share of the foreign payment under section 902(a) in each of years 1 through 5 and, therefore, would be eligible to claim a credit under section 901(a). Third, USP would not pay any country X tax if it directly owned its proportionate share of Newco's assets, a note of FSub. Fourth, for country X tax purposes, Foreign Bank is eligible to receive a tax-free distribution of $82 million attributable to each of years 1 through 5, and that amount corresponds to more than 10% of the foreign

base with respect to which USP's share of the foreign payment was imposed. Fifth, Foreign Bank is a counterparty because it owns stock of Newco for country X tax purposes and none of Foreign Bank's stock is owned, directly or indirectly, by USP or shareholders of USP that are domestic corporations, U.S. citizens, or resident alien individuals. Sixth, the United States and country X treat various aspects of the arrangement differently, including whether the Newco securities held by Foreign Bank and USP are debt or equity. The amount of credits claimed by USP if the payment to country X were an amount of tax paid is materially greater than it would be if the country X tax treatment controlled for U.S. tax purposes such that the securities held by USP were treated as debt or the securities held by Foreign Bank were treated as equity, and the amount of income recognized by Newco for U.S. tax purposes is materially less than the amount of income recognized for country X tax purposes. Because the payment to country X is not an amount of tax paid, USP is not deemed to pay any country X tax under section 902(a). USP has dividend income of $4 million in each of years 1 through 5.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Holding company; no SPV. (i) Facts. A, a country X corporation, and B, a domestic corporation, each contribute $1 billion to a newly-formed country X entity (C) in exchange for 50% of the common stock of C. C is treated as a corporation for country X purposes and a partnership for U.S. tax purposes. C contributes $1.95 billion to a newly-formed country X corporation (D) in exchange for 100% of D's common stock. C loans its remaining $50 million to D. Accordingly, C's sole assets are stock and debt of D. D uses the entire $2 billion to engage in the business of manufacturing and selling widgets. In year 1, D derives $300 million of income from its widget business and derives $2 million of interest income. Also in year 1, C has dividend income of $200 million and interest income of $3.2 million with respect to its investment in D. Country X does not impose tax on dividends received by one country X corporation from a second country X corporation. C makes a payment of $960,000 to country X with respect to C's net income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. C qualifies for the holding company exception described in paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(C)(5)(ii) of this section because C holds a qualified equity interest in D, D is engaged in an active trade or business and derives more than 50% of its gross income from such trade or business, C's interest in D constitutes substantially all of C's assets, and A and B share in substantially all of C's opportunity for gain and risk of loss with respect to D. As a result, C's dividend income from D is not passive investment income and C's stock in D is not held to produce such income. Accordingly, C is not an SPV within the meaning of paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)(1) of this section, and the $960,000 payment to country X is not attributable to a structured passive investment arrangement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Holding company; no SPV. (i) Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 6, except that instead of loaning $50 million to D, C contributes the $50 million to E in exchange for 10% of the stock of E. E is a country Y corporation that is not engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business. Also in year 1, D pays no dividends to C, E pays $3.2 million in dividends to C, and C makes a payment of $960,000 to country X with respect to C's net income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. C qualifies for the holding company exception described in paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(C)(5)(ii) of this section because C holds a qualified equity interest in D, D is engaged in an active trade or business and derives more than 50% of its gross income from such trade or business, C's interest in D constitutes substantially all of C's assets, and A and B share in substantially all of C's opportunity for gain and risk of loss with respect to D. As a result, less than substantially all of C's assets are held to produce passive investment income. Accordingly, C is not an SPV because it does not meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)(1) of this section, and the $960,000 payment to country X is not attributable to a structured passive investment arrangement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Holding company; no SPV. (i) Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 6, except that B's $1 billion investment in C consists of 30% of C's common stock and 100% of C's preferred stock. A's $1 billion investment in C consists of 70% of C's common stock. B sells its preferred stock to F, a country X corporation, subject to a repurchase obligation. Assume that under country X tax law, but not U.S. tax law, F is treated as the owner of the preferred shares and receives a distribution in year 1 of $50 million. The remaining earnings are distributed 70% to A and 30% to B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. C qualifies for the holding company exception described in paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(C)(5)(ii) of this section because C holds a qualified equity interest in D, D is engaged in an active trade or business and derives more than 50% of its gross income from such trade or business, and C's interest in D constitutes substantially all of C's assets. Additionally, although F does not share in C's opportunity for gain and risk of loss with respect to C's interest in D because F acquired its interest in C in a sale-repurchase transaction, B (the U.S. party) and in the aggregate A and F (who would be counterparties assuming C were an SPV) share in substantially all of C's opportunity for gain and risk of loss with respect to D and such opportunity for gain and risk of loss is not borne exclusively either by B or by A and F in the aggregate. Accordingly,

C's shares in D are not held to produce passive investment income and the $200 million dividend from D is not passive investment income. C is not an SPV within the meaning of paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)(1) of this section, and the $960,000 payment to country X is not attributable to a structured passive investment arrangement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. Asset holding transaction. (i) Facts. (A) A domestic corporation (USP) contributes $6 billion of country Z debt obligations to a country Z entity (DE) in exchange for all of the class A and class B stock of DE. DE is a disregarded entity for U.S. tax purposes and a corporation for country Z tax purposes. A corporation unrelated to USP and organized in country Z (FC) contributes $1.5 billion to DE in exchange for all of the class C stock of DE. DE uses the $1.5 billion contributed by FC to redeem USP's class B stock. The terms of the class C stock entitle its holder to all income from DE, but FC is obligated immediately to contribute back to DE all distributions on the class C stock. USP and FC enter into--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A contract under which USP agrees to buy after five years the class C stock for $1.5 billion; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An agreement under which USP agrees to pay FC periodic payments on $1.5 billion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The transaction is structured in such a way that, for U.S. tax purposes, there is a loan of $1.5 billion from FC to USP, and USP is the owner of the class C stock and the class A stock. In year 1, DE earns $400 million of interest income on the country Z debt obligations. DE makes a payment to country Z of $100 million with respect to such income and distributes the remaining $300 million to FC. FC contributes the $300 million back to DE. None of FC's stock is owned, directly or indirectly, by USP or shareholders of USP that are domestic corporations, U.S. citizens, or resident alien individuals. Assume that country Z imposes a withholding tax on interest income derived by U.S. residents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Country Z treats FC as the owner of the class C stock. Pursuant to country Z tax law, FC is required to report the $400 million of income with respect to the $300 million distribution from DE, but is allowed to claim credits for DE's $100 million payment to country Z. For country Z tax purposes, FC is entitled to current deductions equal to the $300 million contributed back to DE.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. The payment to country Z is not a compulsory payment, and thus is not an amount of tax paid because the payment is attributable to a structured passive investment arrangement. First, DE is an SPV because all of DE's income is passive investment income described in paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(C)(5) of this section; all of DE's assets are held to produce such income; the payment to country Z is attributable to such income; and if the payment were an amount of tax paid it would be paid or accrued in a U.S. taxable year in which DE meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)(1)(i) of this section. Second, if the payment were an amount of tax paid, USP would be eligible to claim a credit for such amount under section 901(a). Third, USP's proportionate share of DE's foreign payment of $100 million is substantially greater than the amount of credits USP would be eligible to claim if it directly held its proportionate share of DE's assets, excluding any assets that would produce income subject to gross basis withholding tax if directly held by USP. Fourth, FC is entitled to claim a credit under country Z tax law for the payment and recognizes a deduction for the $300 million contributed to DE under country Z law. The credit claimed by FC corresponds to more than 10% of USP's share (for U.S. tax purposes) of the foreign payment and the deductions claimed by FC correspond to more than 10% of the base with respect to which USP's share of the foreign payment was imposed. Fifth, FC is a counterparty because FC is considered to own equity of DE under country Z law and none of FC's stock is owned, directly or indirectly, by USP or shareholders of USP that are domestic corporations, U.S. citizens, or resident alien individuals. Sixth, the United States and country X treat certain aspects of the transaction differently, including the proportion of equity owned in DE by USP and FC, and the amount of credits claimed by USP if the country Z payment were an amount of tax paid is materially greater than it would be if the country X tax treatment controlled for U.S. tax purposes such that FC, rather than USP, owned the class C stock. Because the payment to country Z is not an amount of tax paid, USP is not considered to pay tax under section 901. USP has $400 million of interest income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 10. Loss surrender. (i) Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 9, except that the deductions attributable to the arrangement contribute to a loss recognized by FC for country Z tax purposes, and pursuant to a group relief regime in country Z FC elects to surrender the loss to its country Z subsidiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. The results are the same as in Example 9. The surrender of the loss to a related party is a foreign tax benefit that corresponds to the base with respect to which USP's share of the foreign payment was imposed.</p><p class="depth0">Example 11. Joint venture; no foreign tax benefit. (i) Facts. FC, a country X corporation, and USC, a domestic corporation, each contribute $1 billion to a newly-formed country X entity (C) in exchange for stock of C. FC and U.S.C. are entitled to equal 50% shares of all of C's income, gain, expense and loss. C is treated as a corporation for country X purposes and a partnership for U.S. tax purposes. In year 1, C earns $200 million of net

passive investment income, makes a payment to country X of $60 million with respect to that income, and distributes $70 million to each of FC and USC. Country X does not impose tax on dividends received by one country X corporation from a second country X corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. FC's tax-exempt receipt of $70 million, or its 50% share of C's profits, is not a foreign tax benefit within the meaning of paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)(4) of this section because it does not correspond to any part of the foreign base with respect to which USC's share of the foreign payment was imposed. Accordingly, the $60 million payment to country X is not attributable to a structured passive investment arrangement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 12. Joint venture; no foreign tax benefit.

D is treated as a corporation for country X purposes and disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for U.S. tax purposes. C has no other assets and earns no other income. In year 1, D earns $200 million of passive investment income, makes a payment to country X of $60 million with respect to that income, and distributes $140 million to C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. C's tax-exempt receipt of $140 million is not a foreign tax benefit within the meaning of paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)(4) of this section because it does not correspond to any part of the foreign base with respect to which USC's share of the foreign payment was imposed. Fifty percent of C's foreign tax exemption is not a foreign tax benefit within the meaning of paragraph (e)(5)(iv)(B)(4) because it relates to earnings of D that are distributed with respect to an equity interest in D that is owned indirectly by U.S.C. under both U.S. and foreign tax law. The remaining 50% of C's foreign tax exemption, as well as FC's tax-exempt receipt of $70 million from C, is also not a foreign tax benefit because it does not correspond to any part of the foreign base with respect to which USC's share of the foreign payment was imposed. Accordingly, the $60 million payment to country X is not attributable to a structured passive investment arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Taxpayer--(1) In general. The person by whom tax is considered paid for purposes of sections 901 and 903 is the person on whom foreign law imposes legal liability for such tax, even if another person (e.g., a withholding agent) remits such tax. For purposes of this section, Sec. 1.901-2A and Sec. 1.903-1, the person on whom foreign law imposes such liability is referred to as the ``taxpayer.'' A foreign tax of a type described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(C) of this section is considered to be imposed on the recipients of wages if such tax is deducted from such wages under provisions that are comparable to section 3102 (a) and (b) of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Party undertaking tax obligation as part of transaction--(i) In general. Tax is considered paid by the taxpayer even if another party to a direct or indirect transaction with the taxpayer agrees, as a part of the transaction, to assume the taxpayer's foreign tax liability. The rules of the foregoing sentence apply notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. See Sec. 1.901-2A for additional rules regarding dual capacity taxpayers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The provisions of paragraphs (f)(1) and (2)(i) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Under a loan agreement between A, a resident of country X, and B, a United States person, A agrees to pay B a certain amount of interest net of any tax that country X may impose on B with respect to its interest income. Country X imposes a 10 percent tax on the gross amount of interest income received by nonresidents of country X from sources in country X, and it is established that this tax is a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.903-1(a). Under the law of country X this tax is imposed on the nonresident recipient, and any resident of country X that pays such interest to a nonresident is required to withhold and pay over to country X 10 percent of the amount of such interest, which is applied to offset the recipient's liability for the tax. Because legal liability for the tax is imposed on the recipient of such interest income, B is the taxpayer with respect to the country X tax imposed on B's interest income from B's loan to A. Accordingly, B's interest income for federal income tax purposes includes the amount of country X tax that is imposed on B with respect to such interest income and that is paid on B's behalf by A pursuant to the loan agreement, and, under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, such tax is considered for purposes of section 903 to be paid by B.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1, except that in collecting and receiving the interest B is acting as a nominee for, or agent of, C, who is a United States person. Because C (not B) is the beneficial owner of the interest, legal liability for the tax is imposed on C, not B (C's nominee or agent). Thus, C is the taxpayer with respect to the country X tax imposed on C's interest income from C's loan to A. Accordingly, C's interest income for federal income tax purposes includes the amount of country X tax

that is imposed on C with respect to such interest income and that is paid on C's behalf by A pursuant to the loan agreement. Under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, such tax is considered for purposes of section 903 to be paid by C. No such tax is considered paid by B.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Country X imposes a tax called the ``country X income tax.'' A, a United States person engaged in construction activities in country X, is subject to that tax. Country X has contracted with A for A to construct a naval base. A is a dual capacity taxpayer (as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section) and, in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) and (c)(1) of Sec. 1.901-2A, A has established that the country X income tax as applied to dual capacity persons and the country X income tax as applied to persons other than dual capacity persons together constitute a single levy. A has also established that that levy is an income tax within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Pursuant to the terms of the contract, country X has agreed to assume any country X tax liability that A may incur with respect to A's income from the contract. For federal income tax purposes, A's income from the contract includes the amount of tax liability that is imposed by country X on A with respect to its income from the contract and that is assumed by country X; and for purposes of section 901 the amount of such tax liability assumed by country X is considered to be paid by A. By reason of paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, country X is not considered to provide a subsidy, within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3) of this section, to A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Taxes imposed on combined income of two or more persons--(i) In general. If foreign tax is imposed on the combined income of two or more persons (for example, a husband and wife or a corporation and one or more of its subsidiaries), foreign law is considered to impose legal liability on each such person for the amount of the tax that is attributable to such person's portion of the base of the tax. Therefore, if foreign tax is imposed on the combined income of two or more persons, such tax is allocated among, and considered paid by, such persons on a pro rata basis in proportion to each person's portion of the combined income, as determined under foreign law and paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section. Combined income with respect to each foreign tax that is imposed on a combined basis is computed separately, and the tax on that combined income is allocated separately under this paragraph (f)(3)(i). If foreign law exempts from tax, or provides for specific rates of tax with respect to, certain types of income, or if certain expenses, deductions or credits are taken into account only with respect to a particular type of income, combined income with respect to such portions of the combined income is also computed separately, and the tax on that combined income is allocated separately under this paragraph (f)(3)(i). The rules of this paragraph (f)(3) apply regardless of which person is obligated to remit the tax, which person actually remits the tax, or which person the foreign country could proceed against to collect the tax in the event all or a portion of the tax is not paid. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(3), the term person means an individual or an entity (including a disregarded entity described in Sec. 301.7701-2(c)(2)(i) of this chapter) that is subject to tax in a foreign country as a corporation (or otherwise at the entity level). In determining the amount of tax paid by an owner of a partnership or a disregarded entity, this paragraph (f)(3) first applies to determine the amount of tax paid by the partnership or disregarded entity, and then paragraph (f)(4) of this section applies to allocate the amount of such tax to the owner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Combined income. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(3), foreign tax is imposed on the combined income of two or more persons if such persons compute their taxable income on a combined basis under foreign law and foreign tax would otherwise be imposed on each such person on its separate taxable income. For example, income is computed on a combined basis if two or more persons add their items of income, gain, deduction, and loss to compute a single consolidated taxable income amount for foreign tax purposes. Foreign tax is considered to be imposed on the combined income of two or more persons even if the combined income is computed under foreign law by attributing to one such person (for example, the foreign parent of a foreign consolidated group) the income of other such persons or by treating persons that would otherwise be subject to tax as separate entities as unincorporated branches of a single corporation for

purposes of computing the foreign tax on the combined income of the group. However, foreign tax is not considered to be imposed on the combined income of two or more persons if, because one or more persons is a fiscally transparent entity (under the principles of Sec. 1.894-1(d)(3)) under foreign law, only one of such persons is subject to tax under foreign law (even if two or more of such persons are corporations for U.S. Federal income tax purposes). Therefore, foreign tax is not considered to be imposed on the combined income of two or more persons solely because foreign law:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Permits one person to surrender a loss to another person pursuant to a group relief or other loss-sharing regime described in Sec. 1.909-2T(b)(2)(vi);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Requires a shareholder of a corporation to include in income amounts attributable to taxes imposed on the corporation with respect to distributed earnings, pursuant to an integrated tax system that allows the shareholder a credit for such taxes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Requires a shareholder to include, pursuant to an anti-deferral regime (similar to subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code (sections 951 through 965)), income attributable to the shareholder's interest in the corporation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Reallocates income from one person to a related person under foreign transfer pricing rules;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Requires a person to take into account a distributive share of income of an entity that is a partnership or other fiscally transparent entity for foreign tax law purposes; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Requires a person to take all or part of the income of an entity that is a corporation for U.S. Federal income tax purposes into account because foreign law treats the entity as a branch or fiscally transparent entity (a reverse hybrid). A reverse hybrid does not include an entity that is treated under foreign law as a branch or fiscally transparent entity solely for purposes of calculating combined income of a foreign consolidated group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Portion of combined income--(A) In general. Each person's portion of the combined income is determined by reference to any return, schedule or other document that must be filed or maintained with respect to a person showing such person's income for foreign tax purposes, as properly amended or adjusted for foreign tax purposes. If no such return, schedule or other document must be filed or maintained with respect to a person for foreign tax purposes, then, for purposes of this paragraph (f)(3), such person's income is determined from the books of account regularly maintained by or on behalf of the person for purposes of computing its income for foreign tax purposes. Each person's portion of the combined income is determined by adjusting such person's income determined under this paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(A) as provided in paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(B) and (f)(3)(iii)(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Effect of certain payments--(1) Each person's portion of the combined income is determined by giving effect to payments and accrued amounts of interest, rents, royalties, and other amounts between persons whose income is included in the combined base to the extent such amounts would be taken into account in computing the separate taxable incomes of such persons under foreign law if they did not compute their income on a combined basis. Each person's portion of the combined income is determined without taking into account any payments from other persons whose income is included in the combined base that are treated as dividends or other non-deductible distributions with respect to equity under foreign law, and without taking into account deemed dividends or any similar attribution of income made for purposes of computing the combined income under foreign law, regardless of whether any such deemed dividend or attribution of income results in a deduction or inclusion under foreign law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of determining each person's portion of the combined income, the treatment of a payment is determined under foreign law. Thus, for example, interest accrued by one group member with respect to an instrument held by another member that is treated as debt for foreign tax purposes but as equity for U.S. Federal income tax purposes would be considered income of the holder and would reduce the income of the issuer. See also Sec. 1.909-2T(b)(3)(i) for rules requiring

suspension of foreign income taxes paid or accrued by the owner of a U.S. equity hybrid instrument.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Net losses. If tax is considered to be imposed on the combined income of three or more persons and one or more of such persons has a net loss for the taxable year for foreign tax purposes, the following rules apply. If foreign law provides mandatory rules for allocating the net loss among the other persons, then the rules that apply for foreign tax purposes apply for purposes of this paragraph (f)(3). If foreign law does not provide mandatory rules for allocating the net loss, the net loss is allocated among all other such persons on a pro rata basis in proportion to the amount of each person's income, as determined under paragraphs (f)(3)(iii)(A) and (f)(3)(iii)(B) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(C), foreign law is not considered to provide mandatory rules for allocating a net loss solely because such loss is attributed from one person to a second person for purposes of computing combined income, as described in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Collateral consequences. U.S. tax principles apply to determine the tax consequences if one person remits a tax that is the legal liability of, and thus is considered paid by, another person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Taxes imposed on partnerships and disregarded entities--(i) Partnerships. If foreign law imposes tax at the entity level on the income of a partnership, the partnership is considered to be legally liable for such tax under foreign law and therefore is considered to pay the tax for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. The rules of this paragraph (f)(4)(i) apply regardless of which person is obligated to remit the tax, which person actually remits the tax, or which person the foreign country could proceed against to collect the tax in the event all or a portion of the tax is not paid. See Sec. Sec. 1.702-1(a)(6) and 1.704-1(b)(4)(viii) for rules relating to the determination of a partner's distributive share of such tax. If the U.S. taxable year of a partnership closes for all partners due to a termination of the partnership under section 708(b)(1)(A) and the regulations under that section and the foreign taxable year of the partnership does not close, then foreign tax paid or accrued with respect to the foreign taxable year in which the termination occurs is allocated between the terminating partnership and its successors or assigns. For example, if, as a result of a change in ownership during a partnership's foreign taxable year, the partnership becomes a disregarded entity and the entity's foreign taxable year does not close, foreign tax paid or accrued by the owner of the disregarded entity with respect to the foreign taxable year is allocated between the partnership and the owner of the disregarded entity. If the U.S. taxable year of a partnership closes for all partners due to a termination of the partnership under section 708(b)(1)(B) and the regulations under that section and the foreign taxable year of the partnership does not close, then foreign tax paid or accrued by the new partnership with respect to the foreign taxable year in which the termination occurs is allocated between the terminating partnership and the new partnership. If multiple terminations under section 708(b)(1)(B) occur within the foreign taxable year, foreign tax paid or accrued with respect to that foreign taxable year by a new partnership is allocated among all terminating and new partnerships. In the case of any termination under section 708(b)(1), the allocation of foreign tax is made based on the respective portions of the taxable income (as determined under foreign law) for the foreign taxable year that are attributable under the principles of Sec. 1.1502-76(b) to the period of existence of each terminating and new partnership, or successor or assign of a terminating partnership, during the foreign taxable year. Foreign tax allocated to a terminating partnership under this paragraph (f)(4)(i) is treated as paid or accrued by such partnership as of the close of the last day of its final U.S. taxable year. In the case of a change in any partner's interest in the partnership (a variance), except as otherwise provided in section 706(d)(2) (relating to certain cash basis items) or 706(d)(3) (relating to tiered partnerships), foreign tax paid or accrued by the partnership during its U.S. taxable year in which the variance occurs is allocated between the portion of the U.S. taxable year ending on, and the portion of the

U.S. taxable year beginning on the day after, the day of the variance. The allocation is made under the principles of this paragraph (f)(4)(i) as if the variance were a termination under section 708(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Disregarded entities. If foreign law imposes tax at the entity level on the income of an entity described in Sec. 301.7701-2(c)(2)(i) of this chapter (a disregarded entity), the person (as defined in section 7701(a)(1)) who is treated as owning the assets of the disregarded entity for U.S. Federal income tax purposes is considered to be legally liable for such tax under foreign law. Such person is considered to pay the tax for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. The rules of this paragraph (f)(4)(ii) apply regardless of which person is obligated to remit the tax, which person actually remits the tax, or which person the foreign country could proceed against to collect the tax in the event all or a portion of the tax is not paid. If there is a change in the ownership of such disregarded entity during the entity's foreign taxable year and such change does not result in a closing of the disregarded entity's foreign taxable year, foreign tax paid or accrued with respect to such foreign taxable year is allocated between the transferor and the transferee. If there is more than one change in the ownership of a disregarded entity during the entity's foreign taxable year, foreign tax paid or accrued with respect to that foreign taxable year is allocated among all transferors and transferees. The allocation is made based on the respective portions of the taxable income of the disregarded entity (as determined under foreign law) for the foreign taxable year that are attributable under the principles of Sec. 1.1502-76(b) to the period of ownership of each transferor and transferee during the foreign taxable year. If, as a result of a change in ownership, the disregarded entity becomes a partnership and the entity's foreign taxable year does not close, foreign tax paid or accrued by the partnership with respect to the foreign taxable year is allocated between the owner of the disregarded entity and the partnership under the principles of this paragraph (f)(4)(ii). If the person who owns a disregarded entity is a partnership for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, see Sec. 1.704-1(b)(4)(viii) for rules relating to the allocation of such tax among the partners of the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Allocation of foreign taxes in connection with elections under section 336(e) or 338. For rules relating to the allocation of foreign taxes in connection with elections made pursuant to section 336(e), see Sec. 1.336-2(g)(3)(ii). For rules relating to the allocation of foreign taxes in connection with elections made pursuant to section 338, see Sec. 1.338-9(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraphs (f)(3) and (f)(4) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. (i) Facts. A, a United States person, owns 100 percent of B, an entity organized in country X. B owns 100 percent of C, also an entity organized in country X. B and C are corporations for U.S. and foreign tax purposes that use the ``u'' as their functional currency. Pursuant to a consolidation regime, country X imposes an income tax described in (a)(1) of this section on the combined income of B and C within the meaning of paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section. In year 1, C pays 25u of interest to B. If B and C did not report their income on a combined basis for country X tax purposes, the interest paid from C to B would result in 25u of interest income to B and 25u of deductible interest expense to C. For purposes of reporting the combined income of B and C, country X first requires B and C to determine their own income (or loss) on a separate schedule. For this purpose, however, neither B nor C takes into account the 25u of interest paid from C to B because the income of B and C is included in the same combined base. The separate income of B and C reported on their country X schedules for year 1, which do not reflect the 25u intercompany payment, is 100u and 200u, respectively. The combined income reported for country X purposes is 300u (the sum of the 100u separate income of B and 200u separate income of C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. On the separate schedules described in paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, B's separate income is 100u and C's separate income is 200u. Under paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(B)(1) of this section, the 25u interest payment from C to B is taken into account for purposes of determining B's and C's portions of the combined income under paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section, because B and C would have taken the items into account if they did not compute their income on a combined basis. Thus, B's portion of the combined income is 125u (100u plus 25u) and C's portion of the combined income is 175u (200u less 25u). The result is the same regardless of whether the 25u interest payment from C to B is deductible for U.S. Federal income tax

purposes. See paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(B)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. (i) Facts. A, a United States person, owns 100 percent of B, an entity organized in country X. B is a corporation for country X tax purposes, and a disregarded entity for U.S. income tax purposes. B owns 100 percent of C and D, entities organized in country X that are corporations for both U.S. and country X tax purposes. B, C, and D use the ``u'' as their functional currency and file on a combined basis for country X income tax purposes. Country X imposes an income tax described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section at the rate of 30 percent on the taxable income of corporations organized in country X. Under the country X combined reporting regime, income (or loss) of C and D is attributed to, and treated as income (or loss) of, B. B has the sole obligation to pay country X income tax imposed with respect to income of B and income of C and D that is attributed to, and treated as income of, B. Under the law of country X, country X may proceed against B, but not C or D, if B fails to pay over to country X all or any portion of the country X income tax imposed with respect to such income. In year 1, B has income of 100u, C has income of 200u, and D has a net loss of (60u). Under the law of country X, B is considered to have 240u of taxable income with respect to which 72u of country X income tax is imposed. Country X does not provide mandatory rules for allocating D's loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Under paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section, the 72u of country X tax is considered to be imposed on the combined income of B, C, and D. Because country X law does not provide mandatory rules for allocating D's loss between B and C, under paragraph (f)(3)(iii)(C) of this section D's (60u) loss is allocated pro rata: 20u to B ((100u/300u) x 60u) and 40u to C ((200u/300u) x 60u). Under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, the 72u of country X tax must be allocated pro rata among B, C, and D. Because D has no income for country X tax purposes, no country X tax is allocated to D. Accordingly, 24u (72u x (80u/240u)) of the country X tax is allocated to B, and 48u (72u x (160u/240u)) of such tax is allocated to C. Under paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section, A is considered to have legal liability for the 24u of country X tax allocated to B under paragraph (f)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. (i) Facts. A, B, and C are U.S. persons that each use the calendar year as their taxable year. A and B each own 50 percent of the capital and profits of D, an entity organized in country M. D is a partnership for U.S. tax purposes, but is a corporation for country M tax purposes. D uses the ``u'' as its functional currency and the calendar year as its taxable year for both U.S. tax purposes and country M tax purposes. Country M imposes an income tax described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section at a rate of 30 percent at the entity level on the taxable income of D. On September 30 of Year 1, A sells its 50 percent interest in D to C. A's sale of its partnership interest results in a termination of the partnership under section 708(b)(1)(B) for U.S. tax purposes. As a result of the termination, ``old'' D's taxable year closes on September 30 of Year 1 for U.S. tax purposes. New D also has a short U.S. taxable year, beginning on October 1 and ending on December 31 of Year 1. The sale of A's interest does not close D's taxable year for country M tax purposes. D has 400u of taxable income for its foreign taxable year ending December 31, Year 1 with respect to which country M imposes 120u of income tax, equal to $120 as translated in accordance with section 986(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result. Under paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, partnership D is legally liable for the $120 of country M income tax imposed on its foreign taxable income. Because D's taxable year closes on September 30, Year 1, for U.S. tax purposes, but does not close for country M tax purposes, under paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section the $120 of country M tax must be allocated under the principles of Sec. 1.1502-76(b) between terminating D and new D. See Sec. 1.704-1(b)(4)(viii) for rules relating to the allocation of terminating D's country M taxes between A and B and the allocation of new D's country M taxes between B and C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Definitions.

If the application of a foreign levy (as defined in Sec. 1.901-2(g)(3)) is different, either by the terms of the levy or in practice, for dual capacity taxpayers (as defined in Sec. 1.901-2(a)(2)(ii)(A)) from its application to other persons, then, unless the only such difference is that a lower rate (but the same base) applies to dual capacity taxpayers, such difference is considered to be related to the fact that dual capacity taxpayers receive, directly or indirectly, a specific economic benefit (as defined in Sec. 1.901-2(a)(2)(ii)(B)) from the foreign country and thus to be a difference in kind, and not merely of degree. In such a case, notwithstanding any contrary provision of Sec. 1.901-2(d), the levy as applicable to such dual capacity taxpayers is a separate levy (within the meaning of Sec. 1.901-2(d)) from the levy as applicable to such other persons, regardless of whether such difference is in the base of the levy, in the rate of the levy, or both. In such a case, each of the levy as applied to dual capacity taxpayers and the levy as applied to other persons must be analyzed separately to determine whether it is an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.901-2(a)(1) and whether it is a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.903-1(a). However, if the application of the levy is neither different by its terms nor different in practice for dual capacity taxpayers from its application to other persons, or if the only difference is that a lower rate (but the same base) applies to dual capacity taxpayers, then, in accordance with Sec. 1.901-2(d), such foreign levy as applicable to dual capacity taxpayers and such levy as applicable to other persons together constitute a single levy. In such a case, no amount paid (as defined in Sec. 1.901-2(g)(1)) pursuant to such levy by any such dual capacity taxpayer is considered to be paid in exchange for a specific economic benefit, and such levy, as applicable in the aggregate to such dual capacity taxpayers and to such other persons, is analyzed to determine whether it is an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.901-2(a)(1) or a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.903-1(a). Application of a foreign levy to dual capacity taxpayers will be considered to be different in practice from application of that levy to other persons, even if no such difference is apparent from the terms of the levy, unless it is

established that application of that levy to dual capacity taxpayers does not differ in practice from its application to other persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Under a levy of country X called the country X income tax, every corporation that does business in country X is required to pay to country X 40 percent of its income from its business in country X. Income for purposes of the country X income tax is computed by subtracting specified deductions from the corporation's gross income derived from its business in country X. The specified deductions include the corporation's expenses attributable to such gross income and allowances for recovery of the cost of capital expenditures attributable to such gross income, except that under the terms of the country X income tax a corporation engaged in the exploitation of minerals K, L or M in country X is not permitted to recover, currently or in the future, expenditures it incurs in exploring for those minerals. In practice, the only corporations that engage in exploitation of the specified minerals in country X are dual capacity taxpayers. Thus, the application of the country X income tax to dual capacity taxpayers is different from its application to other corporations. The country X income tax as applied to corporations that engage in the exploitation of minerals K, L or M (dual capacity taxpayers) is, therefore, a separate levy from the country X income tax as applied to other corporations. Accordingly, each of (i) the country X income tax as applied to such dual capacity taxpayers and (ii) the country X income tax as applied to such other persons, must be analyzed separately to determine whether it is an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.901-2(a)(1) and whether it is a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.903-1(a).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1, except that it is demonstrated that corporations that engage in exploitation of the specified minerals in country X and that are subject to the levy include both dual capacity taxpayers and other persons. The country X income tax as applied to all corporations is, therefore, a single levy. Accordingly, no amount paid pursuant to the country X income tax by a dual capacity taxpayer is considered to be paid in exchange for a specific economic benefit; and, if the country X income tax is an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.901-2(a)(1) or a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.903-1(a), it will be so considered in its entirety for all corporations subject to it.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Under a levy of country Y called the country Y income tax, each corporation incorporated in country Y is required to pay to country Y a percentage of its worldwide income. The applicable percentage is greater for such corporations that earn more than a specified amount of income than for such corporations that earn less than that amount. Income for purposes of the levy is computed by deducting from gross income specified types of expenses and specified allowances for capital expenditures. The expenses for which deductions are permitted differ depending on the type of business in which the corporation subject to the levy is engaged, e.g., a deduction for interest paid to a related party is not allowed for corporations engaged in enumerated types of activities. In addition, carryover of losses from one taxable period to another is permitted for corporations engaged in specified types of activities, but not for corporations engaged in other activities. By its terms, the foreign levy makes no distinction between dual capacity taxpayers and other persons. It is established that in practice the higher rate of the country Y income tax applies to both dual capacity taxpayers and other persons and that in practice the differences in the base of the country Y income tax (e.g., the lack of a deduction for interest paid to related parties for some corporations subject to the levy and the lack of a carryover provision for some corporations subject to the levy) apply to both dual capacity taxpayers and other persons. The country Y income tax as applied to all corporations incorporated in country Y is therefore a single levy. Accordingly, no amount paid pursuant to the country Y income tax by a dual capacity taxpayer is considered to be paid in exchange for a specific economic benefit; and if the country Y income tax is an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.901-2(a)(1) or a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.903-1(a), it will be so considered in its entirety for all persons subject to it.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in example 3, except that it is not established that in practice the higher rate does not apply only to dual capacity taxpayers. By reason of such higher rate, application of the country Y income tax to dual capacity taxpayers is different in practice from application of the country Y income tax to other persons subject to it. The country Y income tax as applied to dual capacity taxpayers is therefore a separate levy from the country Y income tax as applied to other corporations incorporated in country Y. Accordingly, each of (i) the country Y income tax as applied to dual capacity taxpayers and (ii) the country Y income tax as applied to other corporations incorporated in country Y, must be analyzed separately to determine whether it is an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.901-2(a)(1) and whether it is a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.903-1(a).</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Under a levy of country X called the country X tax, all persons who do not engage in business in country X and who receive interest income from residents of country X are required to pay to country X 25 percent of the gross amount of such interest income. It is established that the country X tax applies by its terms and in practice to certain banks that are dual capacity taxpayers and to persons who are not dual capacity taxpayers and that application to such dual capacity taxpayers does not differ by its terms or in practice from application to such other persons. The country X tax as applied to all such persons (both the dual capacity taxpayers and the other persons) is, therefore, a single levy. Accordingly, no amount paid pursuant to the country X tax by such a dual capacity taxpayer is considered to be paid in exchange for a specific economic benefit; and, if the country X tax is a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.903-1(a), it will be so considered in its entirety for all persons subject to it.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Under a levy of country X called the country X tax, every corporation incorporated outside of country X (``foreign corporation'') that maintains a branch in country X is required annually to pay to country X 52 percent of its net income attributable to that branch. It is established that the application of the country X tax is neither different by its terms nor different in practice for certain banks that are dual capacity taxpayers from its application to persons (which may, but do not necessarily, include other banks) that are not dual capacity taxpayers. The country X tax as applied to all foreign corporations with branches in country X (i.e., both those banks that are dual capacity taxpayers and the foreign corporations that are not dual capacity taxpayers) is, therefore, a single levy. Accordingly, no amount paid pursuant to the country X tax by a bank that is a dual capacity taxpayer is considered to be paid in exchange for a specific economic benefit; and, if the country X tax is an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.901-2(a)(1) or a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.903-1(a), it will be so considered in its entirety for all persons subject to it.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Under a levy of country H called the country H tax, all corporations that are organized outside country H and that do not engage in business in country H are required to pay to country H a percentage of the gross amount of interest income derived from residents of country H. The percentage is 30 percent, except that it is 15 percent for a specified category of corporations. All corporations in that category are dual capacity taxpayers. It is established that the country H tax applies by its terms and in practice to dual capacity taxpayers and to persons that are not dual capacity taxpayers and that the only difference in application between such dual capacity taxpayers and such other persons is that a lower rate (but the same base) applies to such dual capacity taxpayers. The country H tax as applied to all such persons (both the dual capacity taxpayers and the other persons) is, therefore, a single levy. Accordingly, no amount paid pursuant to the country H tax by such a dual capacity taxpayer is considered to be paid in exchange for a specific economic benefit, and if the country H tax is a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.903-1(a), it will be so considered in its entirety for all persons subject to it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Burden of proof for dual capacity taxpayers--(1) In general. For credit to be allowable under section 901 or 903, the person claiming credit must establish that the foreign levy with respect to which credit is claimed is an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.901-2(a)(1) or a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.903-1(a), respectively. Thus, such person must establish, among other things, that such levy is a tax. See Sec. 1.901-2(a)(2)(i) and Sec. 1.903-1(a). Where a person claims credit under section 901 or 903 for an amount paid by a dual capacity taxpayer pursuant to a foreign levy, Sec. 1.901-2(a)(2)(i) and Sec. 1.903-1(a), respectively, require such person to establish the amount, if any, that is paid pursuant to the distinct element of the levy that is a tax. If, pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section and Sec. 1.901-2(d), such levy as applicable to dual capacity taxpayers and such levy as applicable to other persons together constitute a single levy, then no amount paid pursuant to that levy by any such dual capacity taxpayer is considered to be paid in exchange for a specific economic benefit. Accordingly, such levy has only one distinct element, and the levy either is or is not, in its entirety, a tax. If, however, such levy as applicable to dual capacity taxpayers is a separate levy from such levy as applicable to other persons, then a person claiming credit under section 901 or 903 for an amount paid by a dual capacity taxpayer pursuant to such separate levy may establish the amount, if any, that is paid pursuant to the distinct element of the levy that is a tax only by the facts and circumstances method or the safe harbor method described in paragraph (c) of this section. If such

person fails to so establish such amount, no portion of the amount that is paid pursuant to the separate levy by the dual capacity taxpayer to such foreign country shall be treated as an amount of tax. Any amount that, either by reason of application of the methods of paragraph (c) of this section or by reason of the immediately preceding sentence, is not treated as an amount of tax shall (i) be considered to have been paid in exchange for a specific economic benefit; (ii) be characterized (e.g., as royalty, purchase price, cost of sales, reduction of the proceeds of a sale, or reduction of interest income) according to the nature of the transaction and of the specific economic benefit received; and (iii) be treated according to such characterization for all purposes of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that any determination that an amount is not tax for purposes of section 901 or 903 by reason of application of the safe harbor method shall not be taken into account in determining whether or not such an amount is to be characterized and treated as tax for purposes of computing an allowance for percentage depletion under sections 611 and 613.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effect of certain treaties. If, irrespective of whether such credit would be allowable under section 901 or 903 in the absence of a treaty, the United States has in force a treaty with a foreign country that treats a foreign levy as an income tax for purposes of allowing credit for United States tax and if the person claiming credit is entitled to the benefit of such treaty, then, unless such person claims credit not under the treaty but under section 901 or 903, and except to the extent the treaty provides otherwise and subject to all terms, conditions and limitations provided in the treaty, no portion of an amount paid with respect to such levy by a dual capacity taxpayer shall be considered to be paid in exchange for a specific economic benefit. If, however, such person claims credit not under such treaty but rather under section 901 or 903 (e.g., so as not to be subject to a limitation contained in such treaty), the provisions of this section apply to such levy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Satisfaction of burden of proof--(1) In general. This paragraph (c) sets out the methods by which a person who claims credit under section 901 or 903 for an amount paid by a dual capacity taxpayer pursuant to a foreign levy that satisfies all of the criteria of section 901 or 903 other than the determination of the distinct element of the levy that is a tax and of the amount that is paid pursuant to that distinct element (a ``qualifying levy'') may establish such distinct element and amount. Such person must establish the amount paid pursuant to a qualifying levy that is paid pursuant to the distinct element of the levy that is a tax (which amount therefore is an amount of income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.901-2(a)(1) or an amount of tax in lieu of income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.903-1(a) (a ``qualifying amount'')) only by the facts and circumstances method set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section or the safe harbor method set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. A levy is not a qualifying levy, and neither the facts and circumstances method nor the safe harbor method applies to an amount paid by a dual capacity taxpayer pursuant to a foreign levy, if it has been established pursuant to Sec. 1.901-2(d) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section that that levy as applied to that dual capacity taxpayer and that levy as applied to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers together constitute a single levy, or if it has been established in accordance with the first sentence of paragraph (b)(2) of this section that credit is allowable by reason of a treaty for an amount paid with respect to such levy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Facts and circumstances method--(i) In general. If the person claiming credit establishes, based on all of the relevant facts and circumstances, the amount, if any, paid by the dual capacity taxpayer pursuant to the qualifying levy that is not paid in exchange for a specific economic benefit, such amount is the qualifying amount with respect to such qualifying levy. In determining the qualifying amount with respect to a qualifying levy under the facts and circumstances method, neither the methodology nor the results that would have obtained if a person had elected to apply the safe harbor method to such qualifying levy is a relevant

fact or circumstance. Accordingly, neither such methodology nor such results shall be taken into account in applying the facts and circumstances method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The application of the facts and circumstances method is illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Country A, which does not have a generally imposed income tax, imposes a levy, called the country A income tax, on corporations that carry on the banking business through a branch in country A. All such corporations lend money to the government of country A, and the consideration (interest) paid by the government of country A for the loans is not made available by the government on substantially the same terms to the population of country A in general. Thus, the country A income tax is imposed only on dual capacity taxpayers. L, a corporation that carries on the banking business through a branch in country A and that is a dual capacity taxpayer, establishes that all of the criteria of section 901 are satisfied by the country A income tax, except for the determination of the distinct element of the levy that is a tax and of L's qualifying amount with respect thereto. The country A income tax is, therefore, a qualifying levy. L establishes that, although all persons subject to the country A income tax are dual capacity taxpayers, the country A income tax applies in the same manner to income from such persons' transactions with the government of country A as it does to income from their transactions with private persons; that there are significant transactions (either in volume or in amount) with private persons; and that the portion of such persons' income that is derived from transactions with the government of country A on the one hand or private persons on the other varies greatly among persons subject to the country A income tax. By making this showing, L has demonstrated that no portion of the amount paid by it to country A pursuant to the levy is paid in exchange for a specific economic benefit (the interest income). Accordingly, L has demonstrated under the facts and circumstances method that the entire amount it has paid pursuant to the country A income tax is a qualifying amount.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. A, a domestic corporation that is a dual capacity taxpayer subject to a qualifying levy of country X, pays 1000u (units of country X currency) to country X in 1986 pursuant to the qualifying levy. A does not elect to apply the safe harbor method to country X, but if it had so elected, 800u would have been A's qualifying amount with respect to the levy. Based on all of the relevant facts and circumstances (which do not include either the methodology of the safe harbor method or the qualifying amount that would have obtained under that method), A establishes that 628u of such 1000u is not paid in exchange for a specific economic benefit. A has demonstrated under the facts and circumstances method that 628u is a qualifying amount. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, 372u (1000u-628u) is considered to have been paid by A in exchange for a specific economic benefit. That amount is characterized and treated as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in example 2 except that under the safe harbor method 580u would have been A's qualifying amount with respect to the levy. That amount is not a relevant fact or circumstance and the result is the same as in example 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Safe harbor method. Under the safe harbor method, the person claiming credit makes an election as provided in paragraph (d) of this section and, pursuant to such election, applies the safe harbor formula described in paragraph (e) of this section to the qualifying levy or levies to which the election applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Election to use the safe harbor method--(1) Scope of election. An election to use the safe harbor method is made with respect to one or more foreign states and possessions of the United States with respect to a taxable year of the person making the election (the ``electing person''). Such election applies to such taxable year and to all subsequent taxable years of the electing person (``election years''), unless the election is revoked in accordance with paragraph (d)(4) of this section. If an election applies to a foreign state or possession of the United States (``elected country''), it applies to all qualifying levies of the elected country and to all qualifying levies of all political subdivisions of the elected country with respect to which the electing person claims credit for amounts paid (or deemed to be paid) by any dual capacity taxpayer. A member of an affiliated group that files a consolidated United States income tax return may use the safe harbor method for a foreign state or U.S. possession only if an election to use the safe harbor method for that state or possession has been made by the common parent of such affiliated group on behalf of all members of the group. Similarly, a member of an affiliated group that does not file a consolidated United States income tax return

may elect to use the safe harbor method for a foreign state or U.S. possession only if an election to use the safe harbor method for that state or possession is made by each member of the affiliated group which claims credit for taxes paid to such state or possession or to any political subdivision thereof. An election to use the safe harbor method for an elected country does not apply to foreign taxes carried back or forward to any election year from any taxable year to which the election does not apply. Such election does apply to foreign taxes carried back or forward from any election year to any taxable year. A person who elects to use the safe harbor method for one or more foreign countries may, in a later taxable year, also elect to use that method for other foreign countries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effect of election. An election to use the safe harbor method described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section requires the electing person to apply the safe harbor formula of paragraph (e) of this section to all qualifying levies of all elected countries and their political subdivisions, and constitutes a specific waiver by such person of the right to use the facts and circumstances method described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section with respect to any levy of any elected country or any political subdivision thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Time and manner of making election--(i) In general. To elect to use the safe harbor method, an electing person must attach a statement to its United States income tax return for the taxable year for which the election is made and must file such return by the due date (including extensions) for the filing thereof. Such statement shall state--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> That the electing person elects to use the safe harbor method for the foreign states and the possessions of the United States designated in the statement and their political subdivisions, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> That the electing person waives the right, for any election year, to use the facts and circumstances method for any levy of the designated states, possessions and political subdivisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a person may, with the consent of the Commissioner, elect to use the safe harbor method for a taxable year for one or more foreign states or possessions of the United States, at a date later than that specified in the first sentence of this paragraph (d)(3)(i), e.g., upon audit of such person's United States income tax return for such taxable year. The Commissioner will normally consent to such a later election if such person demonstrates that it failed to make a timely election for such a foreign state or possession for such taxable year because such person reasonably believed either that it was not a dual capacity taxpayer with respect to such state or possession or that no levy that it paid to such state or possession or any political subdivision thereof was a qualifying levy (for example, because it reasonably, but incorrectly, believed that the levy it paid was not a separate levy from that applicable to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers). The Commissioner will not, however, consent to such a later election with respect to any state or possession for a taxable year if such person (or any other member of an affiliated group of which such person is a member) applied the facts and circumstances method to any levy of such state or possession or any political subdivision thereof for such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certain retroactive elections. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section relating to the time and manner of making an election, an election may be made for a taxable year beginning on or before November 14, 1983, provided the electing person elects in accordance with Sec. 1.901-2(h) to apply all of the provisions of this section, Sec. 1.901-2 and Sec. 1.903-1 to such taxable year and provided all of the requirements set forth in this paragraph (d)(3)(ii) are satisfied. Such an election shall be made by timely (including extensions) filing a federal income tax return or an amended federal income tax return for such taxable year; by attaching to such return a statement containing the statements and information set forth in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section; and by filing amended income tax returns for all subsequent election years for which income tax returns have previously been filed in which credit is

claimed under section 901 or 903 and applying the safe harbor method in such amended returns. All amended returns referred to in the immediately preceding sentence must be filed on or before October 12, 1984, (unless the Commissioner consents to a later filing in circumstances similar to those provided in paragraph (d)(3)(i)) and at a time when neither assessment of a deficiency for any of such election years nor the filing of a claim for any refund claimed in any such amended return is barred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Election to credit taxes made in amended return. If a person has filed a United States income tax return for a taxable year to which this Sec. 1.901-2A applies (including application by reason of the election provided in Sec. 1.901-2(h)(2)) in which such person has deducted (instead of credited) qualifying foreign taxes and such person validly makes an election to credit (instead of deduct) such taxes in a timely filed amended return for such taxable year, an election to use the safe harbor method may be made in such amended return provided all of the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section are satisfied other than the requirement that such amended return and the other amended returns referred to in that paragraph be filed on or before October 12, 1984.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Revocation of election. An election to use the safe harbor method described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section may not be revoked without the consent of the Commissioner. An application for consent to revoke such election with respect to one or more elected countries shall be made to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, DC 20224. Such application shall be made not later than the 30th day before the due date (including extensions) for the filing of the income tax return for the first taxable year for which the revocation is sought to be effective, except in the case of an event described in (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) below, in which case an application for revocation with retroactive effect may be made within a reasonable time after such event. The Commissioner may make his consent to any revocation conditioned upon adjustments being made in one or more taxable years so as to prevent the revocation from resulting in a distortion of the amount of any item relating to tax liability in any taxable year. The Commissioner will normally consent to a revocation (including, in the case of (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) below, one with retroactive effect), if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code or the regulations thereunder is made which applies to the taxable year for which the revocation is to be effective and the amendment substantially affects the taxation of income from sources outside the United States under subchapter N of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> After a safe harbor election is made with respect to a foreign state, a tax treaty between the United States and that state enters into force; that treaty covers a foreign tax to which the safe harbor election applies; and that treaty applies to the taxable year for which the revocation is to be effective; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> After a safe harbor election is made with respect to a foreign state or possession of the United States, a material change is made in the tax law of that state or possession or of a political subdivision of that state or possession; and the changed law applies to the taxable year for which the revocation is to be effective and has a material effect on the taxpayer; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> With respect to a foreign country to which a safe harbor election applies, the Internal Revenue Service issues a letter ruling to the electing person and that letter ruling (A) relates to the availability or application of the safe harbor method to one or more levies of such foreign country; (B) does not relate to the facts and circumstances method described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section; and (C) fails to include a ruling requested by the electing person or includes a ruling contrary to one requested by such person (in either case, other than one relating to the facts and circumstances method) and such failure or inclusion has a material adverse effect on the amount of such electing person's credit for taxes paid to such foreign country for the taxable year for which the revocation is to be effective; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A corporation (``new member'') becomes a member of an affiliated group; the new member and one or more pre-existing members of such group are dual capacity taxpayers with respect to the same foreign country; and, with respect to such country, either the new member or the pre-existing members (but not both) have made a safe harbor election; and the Commissioner in his discretion determines that obtaining the benefit of the right to revoke the safe harbor election with respect to such foreign country was not the principal purpose of the affiliation between such new member and such group; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The election has been in effect with respect to at least three taxable years prior to the taxable year for which the revocation is to be effective.

The Commissioner may, in his discretion, consent to a revocation even if none of the foregoing subdivisions (i) through (vi) is applicable. If an election has been revoked with respect to an elected country, a subsequent election to apply the safe harbor method with respect to such elected country may be made only with the consent of the Commissioner and upon such terms and conditions as the Commissioner in his discretion may require.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Safe harbor formula--(1) In general. The safe harbor formula applies to determine the distinct element of a qualifying levy that is a tax and the amount paid by a dual capacity taxpayer pursuant to such qualifying levy that is the qualifying amount with respect to such levy. Under the safe harbor formula the amount paid in a taxable year pursuant to a qualifying levy that is the qualifying amount with respect to such levy is an amount equal to:
(A - B - C) x D / (1 - D)

In no case, however, shall the qualifying amount exceed the actual payment amount; and the qualifying amount is zero if the safe harbor formula yields a qualifying amount less than zero. The safe harbor formula is intended to yield a qualifying amount that is approximately equal to the amount of generally imposed income tax within the meaning of paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) of Sec. 1.903-1 (``general tax'') of the foreign country that would have been required to be paid in the taxable year by the dual capacity taxpayer if it had not been a dual capacity taxpayer and if the base of the general tax had allowed a deduction in such year for the amount (``specific economic benefit amount'') by which the actual payment amount exceeds the qualifying amount. See, however, paragraph (e)(5) of this section if an elected country has no general tax. The specific economic benefit amount is considered to be the portion of the actual payment amount that is paid pursuant to the distinct portion of the qualifying levy that imposes an obligation in exchange for a specific economic benefit. The specific economic benefit amount is therefore considered to be an amount paid by the dual capacity taxpayer in exchange for such specific economic benefit, which amount must be treated for purposes of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determination of gross receipts and costs and expenses. For purposes of the safe harbor formula, gross receipts and costs and expenses are, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e), the gross receipts and the deductions for costs and expenses, respectively, as determined under the foreign law applicable in computing the actual payment amount of the qualifying levy to which the safe harbor formula applies. However, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e), if provisions of the qualifying levy increase or decrease the liability imposed on dual capacity taxpayers compared to the general tax

liability of persons other than dual capacity taxpayers by reason of the determination or treatment of gross receipts or of costs or expenses, the provisions generally applicable in computing such other persons' tax base under the general tax shall apply to determine gross receipts and costs and expenses for purposes of computing the qualifying amount. If provisions of the qualifying levy relating to gross receipts meet the requirements of Sec. 1.901-2(b) (3)(i), such provisions shall apply to determine gross receipts for purposes of computing the qualifying amount. If neither the general tax nor the qualifying levy permits recovery of one or more costs or expenses, and by reason of the failure to permit such recovery the qualifying levy does not satisfy the net income requirement of Sec. 1.901-2(b)(4) (even though the general tax does satisfy that requirement), then such cost or expense shall be considered a cost or expense for purposes of computing the qualifying amount. If the qualifying levy does not permit recovery of one or more significant costs or expenses, but provides allowances that effectively compensate for nonrecovery of such significant costs or expenses, then, for purposes of computing the qualifying amount, costs and expenses shall not include the costs and expenses under the general tax whose nonrecovery under the qualifying levy is compensated for by such allowances but shall instead include such allowances. In determining costs and expenses for purposes of computing the qualifying amount with respect to a qualifying levy, the actual payment amount with respect to such levy shall not be considered a cost or expense. For purposes of this paragraph, the following differences in gross receipts and costs and expenses between the qualifying levy and the general tax shall not be considered to increase the liability imposed on dual capacity taxpayers compared to the general tax liability of persons other than dual capacity taxpayers, but only if the general tax would be an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.901-2(a)(1) if such different treatment under the qualifying levy had also applied under the general tax:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Differences in the time of realization or recognition of one or more items of income or in the time when recovery of one or more costs and expenses is allowed (unless the period of recovery of such costs and expenses pursuant to the qualifying levy is such that it effectively is a denial of recovery of such costs and expenses, as described in Sec. 1.901-2(b)(4)(i)); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Differences in consolidation or carryover provisions of the types described in paragraphs (b)(4)(ii) and (b)(4)(iii) of Sec. 1.901-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Determination of tax rate. The tax rate for purposes of the safe harbor formula is the tax rate (expressed as a decimal) that is applicable in computing tax liability under the general tax. If the rate of the general tax varies according to the amount of the base of that tax, the rate to be applied in computing the qualifying amount is the rate that applies under the general tax to a person whose base is, using the terminology of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, ``A'' minus ``B'' minus the specific economic benefit amount paid by the dual capacity taxpayer pursuant to the qualifying levy, provided such rate applies in practice to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers, or, if such rate does not so apply in practice, the next lowest rate of the general tax that does so apply in practice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Determination of applicable provisions of general tax--(i) In general. If the general tax is a series of income taxes (e.g., on different types of income), or if the application of the general tax differs by its terms for different classes of persons subject to the general tax (e.g., for persons in different industries), then, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e), the qualifying amount small be computed by reference to the income tax contained in such series of income taxes, or in the case of such different applications the application of the general tax, that by its terms and in practice imposes the highest tax burden on persons other than dual capacity taxpayers. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the general tax amount shall be computed by reference to the application of the general tax to entities of the same type (as determined under the general tax) as the dual capacity taxpayer and to

persons of the same resident or nonresident status (as determined under the general tax) as the dual capacity taxpayer; and, if the general tax treats business income differently from non-business (e.g., investment) income (as determined under the general tax), the dual capacity taxpayer's business and non-business income shall be treated as the general tax treats such income. If, for example, the dual capacity taxpayer would, under the general tax, be treated as a resident (e.g., because the general tax treats an entity that is organized in the foreign country or managed or controlled there as a resident) and as a corporation (i.e., because the rules of the general tax treat an entity like the dual capacity taxpayer as a corporation), and if some of the dual capacity taxpayer's income would, under the general tax, be treated as business income and some as non-business income, the dual capacity taxpayer and its income shall be so treated in computing the qualifying amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Establishing that provisions apply in practice. For purposes of the safe harbor formula a provision (including tax rate) shall be considered a provision of the general tax only if it is reasonably likely that that provision applies by its terms and in practice to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers. In general, it will be assumed that a provision (including tax rate) that by its terms applies to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers is reasonably likely to apply in practice to such other persons, unless the person claiming credit knows or has reason to know otherwise. However, in cases of doubt, the person claiming credit may be required to demonstrate that such provision is reasonably likely so to apply in practice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> No general tax. If a foreign country does not impose a general tax (and thus a levy, in order to be a qualifying levy must satisfy all of the criteria of section 901 (because section 903 cannot apply), other than the determination of the distinct element of the levy that is a tax and of the amount that is paid pursuant to that distinct element), paragraphs (e)(2), (3) and (4) of this section do not apply to a qualifying levy of such country, and the terms of the safe harbor formula set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section are defined with respect to such levy as follows:
A = the amount of gross receipts as determined under the qualifying</p><p class="depth0">levy;B = the amount of deductions for costs and expenses as determined under</p><p class="depth0">the qualifying levy;C = the actual payment amount; andD = the lower of the rate of the qualifying levy, or the rate of tax</p><p class="depth0">specified in section 11(b)(5) (or predecessor or successor</p><p class="depth0">section, as the case may be) of the Internal Revenue Code as</p><p class="depth0">applicable to the taxable year in which the actual payment</p><p class="depth0">amount is paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Certain taxes in lieu of an income tax. To the extent a tax in lieu of an income tax (within the meaning of Sec. 1.903-1(a)) that applies in practice to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers would actually have been required to be paid in the taxable year by a dual capacity taxpayer if it had not been a dual capacity taxpayer (e.g., in substitution for the general tax with respect to a type of income, such as interest income, dividend income, royalty income, insurance income), such tax in lieu of an income tax shall be treated as if it were an application of the general tax for purposes of applying the safe harbor formula of this paragraph (e) to such dual capacity taxpayer, and such formula shall be applied to yield a qualifying amount that is approximately equal to the general tax (so defined) that would have been required to be paid in the taxable year by such dual capacity taxpayer if the base of such general tax had allowed a deduction in such year for the specific economic benefit amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Multiple levies. If, in any election year of an electing person, with respect to any elected country and all of its political subdivisions,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Amounts are paid by a dual capacity taxpayer pursuant to more than one qualifying levy or pursuant to one or more levies that are qualifying levies and one or more levies that are not qualifying levies by reason of the last sentence of paragraph (c)(1) of this section but with respect to which credit is allowable, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> More than one general tax (including a tax treated as if it were an application of the general tax under

paragraph (e)(6)) would have been required to be paid by a dual capacity taxpayer (or taxpayers) if it (or they) had not been a dual capacity taxpayer (or taxpayers), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Credit is claimed with respect to amounts paid by more than one dual capacity taxpayer,the provisions of this paragraph (e) shall be applied such that the aggregate qualifying amount with respect to such qualifying levy or levies plus the aggregate amount paid with respect to levies referred to in (e)(7)(i) that are not qualifying levies shall be the aggregate amount that would have been required to be paid in the taxable year by such dual capacity taxpayer (or taxpayers) pursuant to such general tax or taxes if it (or they) had not been a dual capacity taxpayer (or taxpayers) and if the base of such general tax or taxes had allowed a deduction in such year for the aggregate specific economic benefit amount (except that, if paragraph (e)(5) applies to any levy of such elected country or any political subdivision thereof, the aggregate qualifying amount for qualifying levies of such elected country and all of its political subdivisions plus the aggregate amount paid with respect to levies referred to in paragraph (e)(7)(i) that are not qualifying levies shall not exceed the greater of the aggregate amount paid with respect to levies referred to in paragraph (e)(7)(i) that are not qualifying levies and the amount determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(5) where ``D'' is the rate of tax specified in section 11(b)(5) (or predecessor or successor section, as the case may be) of the Internal Revenue Code as applicable to the taxable year in which the actual payment amount is paid). However, in no event shall such aggregate amount exceed the aggregate actual payment amount plus the aggregate amount paid with respect to levies referred to in (e)(7)(i) that are not qualifying levies, nor be less than the aggregate amount paid with respect to levies referred to in (e)(7)(i) that are not qualifying levies. In applying (e)(7)(ii) a person who is not subject to a levy but who is considered to receive a specific economic benefit by reason of Sec. 1.901-2(a)(2)(ii)(E) shall be treated as a dual capacity taxpayer. See example 12 in paragraph (e)(8) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (e) may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Under a levy of country X called the country X income tax, every corporation that does business in country X is required to pay to country X 40% of its income from its business in country X. Income for purposes of the country X income tax is computed by subtracting specified deductions from the corporation's gross income derived from its business in country X. The specified deductions include the corporation's expenses attributable to such gross income and allowances for recovery of the cost of capital expenditures attributable to such gross income, except that under the terms of the country X income tax a corporation engaged in the exploitation of minerals K, L or M in country X is not permitted to recover, currently or in the future, expenditures it incurs in exploring for those minerals. Under the terms of the country X income tax interest is not deductible to the extent it exceeds an arm's length amount (e.g., if the loan to which the interest relates is not in accordance with normal commercial practice or to the extent the interest rate exceeds an arm's length rate). In practice, the only corporations that engage in exploitation of the specified minerals in country X are dual capacity taxpayers. Because no other persons subject to the levy engage in exploitation of minerals K, L or M in country X, the application of the country X income tax to dual capacity taxpayers is different from its application to other corporations. The country X income tax as applied to corporations that engage in the exploitation of minerals K, L or M (dual capacity taxpayers) is, therefore, a separate levy from the country X income tax as applied to other corporations.</p><p class="depth0">A is a U.S. corporation that is engaged in country X in exploitation of mineral K. Natural deposits of mineral K in country X are owned by country X, and A has been allowed to extract mineral K in consideration of payment of a bonus and of royalties to an instrumentality of country X. Therefore, A is a dual capacity taxpayer. In 1984, A does business in country X within the meaning of the levy. A has validly elected the safe harbor method for country X for 1984. In 1984, as determined in accordance with the country X income tax as applied to A, A has gross receipts of 120u (units of country X currency), deducts 20u of costs and expenses, and pays 40u (40% of (120u-20u)) to country X pursuant to the levy. A also incurs in 1984 10u of nondeductible expenditures for exploration for mineral K and 2u of nondeductible interest costs attributable to an advance of funds

from a related party to finance an undertaking relating to the exploration for mineral K for which normal commercial financing was unavailable because of the substantial risk inherent in the undertaking. A establishes that the country X income tax as applied to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers is an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.901-2(a)(1), that it is the generally imposed income tax of country X and hence the general tax, and that all of the criteria of section 903 are satisfied with respect to the country X income tax as applied to dual capacity taxpayers, except for the determination of the distinct element of the levy that is a tax and of A's qualifying amount with respect thereto. (No conclusion is reached whether the country X income tax as applied to dual capacity taxpayers is an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.901-2(a)(1). Such a determination would require, among other things, that the country X income tax as so applied, judged on the basis of its predominant character, meets the net income requirement of Sec. 1.901-2(b)(4) notwithstanding its failure to permit recovery of exploration expenses.) A has therefore demonstrated that the country X income tax as applied to dual capacity taxpayers is a qualifying levy.</p><p class="depth0">In applying the safe harbor formula, in accordance with paragraph (e)(2), the amount of A's costs and expenses includes the 10u of nondeductible exploration expenses. The failure to permit recovery of interest in excess of arm's length amounts, a provision of both the general tax and the qualifying levy, does not cause the qualifying levy to fail to satisfy the net income requirement of Sec. 1.901-2(b)(4); therefore, the amount of A's costs and expenses does not include the 2u of nondeductible interest costs. Thus, under the safe harbor method, A's qualifying amount with respect to the levy is 33.33u ((120u-30u-40u) x .40/(1-.40)). A's specific economic benefit amount is 6.67u (A's actual payment amount (40u) less A's qualifying amount (33.33u)). Under paragraph (a) of this section, this 6.67u is considered to be consideration paid by A for the right to extract mineral K. Pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, this amount is characterized according to the nature of A's transactions with country X and its instrumentality and of the specific economic benefit received (the right to extract mineral K), as an additional royalty or other business expense paid or accrued by A and is so treated for all purposes of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that if an allowance for percentage depletion is allowable to A under sections 611 and 613 with respect to A's interest in mineral K, the determination whether this 6.67u is tax or royalty for purposes of computing the amount of such allowance shall be made under sections 611 and 613 without regard to the determination that under the safe harbor formula such 6.67u is not tax for purposes of section 901 or 903.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Under a levy of country Y called the country Y income tax, each corporation incorporated in country Y is required to pay to country Y a percentage of its worldwide income. The applicable percentage is 40 percent of the first 1,000u (units of country Y currency) of income and 50 percent of income in excess of 1,000u. Income for purposes of the levy is computed by deducting from gross income specified types of expenses and specified allowances for capital expenditures. The expenses for which deductions are permitted differ depending on the type of business in which the corporation subject to the levy is engaged, e.g., a deduction for interest paid to a related party is not allowed for corporations engaged in enumerated types of activities. In addition, carryover of losses from one taxable period to another is permitted for corporations engaged in specified types of activities, but not for corporations engaged in other activities. By its terms, the foreign levy makes no distinction between dual capacity taxpayers and other persons. In practice the differences in the base of the country Y income tax (e.g., the lack of a deduction for interest paid to related parties for some corporations subject to the levy and the lack of a carryover provision for some corporations subject to the levy) apply to both dual capacity taxpayers and other persons, but the 50 percent rate applies only to dual capacity taxpayers. By reason of such higher rate, application of the country Y income tax to dual capacity taxpayers is different in practice from application of the country Y income tax to other persons subject to it. The country Y income tax as applied to dual capacity taxpayers is therefore a separate levy from the country Y income tax as applied to other corporations incorporated in country Y.</p><p class="depth0">B is a corporation incorporated in country Y that is engaged in construction activities in country Y. B has a contract with the government of country Y to build a hospital in country Y for a fee that is not made available on substantially the same terms to substantially all persons who are subject to the general tax of country X. Accordingly, B is a dual capacity taxpayer. B has validly elected the safe harbor method for country Y for 1985. In 1985, as determined in accordance with the country Y income tax as applied to B, B has gross receipts of 10,000u, deducts 6,000u of costs and expenses, and pays 1900u ((1,000u x 40%) + (3,000u x 50%)) to country Y pursuant to the levy.</p><p class="depth0">It is assumed that B has established that the country Y income tax as applied to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers is an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.901-2(a)(1) and is the general tax. It is further assumed that B has demonstrated that all of the criteria of section 901 are satisfied with

respect to the country Y income tax as applied to dual capacity taxpayers, except for the determination of the distinct element of such levy that is a tax and of B's qualifying amount with respect to that levy, and therefore that the country Y income tax as applied to dual capacity taxpayers is a qualifying levy.</p><p class="depth0">In applying the safe harbor formula, in accordance with paragraph (e)(3), the 50 percent rate is not used because it does not apply in practice to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers. The next lowest rate of the general tax that does apply in practice to such persons, 40 percent, is used. Accordingly, under the safe harbor formula, B's qualifying amount with respect to the levy is 1400u ((10,000u-6000u-1900u) x .40/(1-.40)). B's specific economic benefit amount is 500u (B's actual payment amount (1900u) less B's qualifying amount (1400u)). Pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, B's specific economic benefit amount is characterized according to the nature of B's transactions with country Y and of the specific economic benefit received, as a reduction of B's proceeds of its contract with country Y; and this amount is so treated for all purposes of chapter 1 of the Code, including the computation of B's accumulated profits for purposes of section 902.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in example 2, with the following additional facts: The contract between B and country Y is a cost plus contract. One of the costs of the contract which country Y is required to pay or for which it is required to reimburse B is any tax of country Y on B's income or receipts from the contract. Instead of reimbursing B therefor, country Y agrees with B to assume any such tax liability. Under country Y tax law, B is not considered to have additional income or receipts by reason of country Y's assumption of B's country Y tax liability. In 1985, B's gross receipts of 10,000u include 3000u from the contract, and its costs and expenses of 6000u include 2000u attributable to the contract. B's other gross receipts and expenses do not relate to any transaction in which B receives a specific economic benefit. In accordance with the contract, country Y, and not B, is required to bear the amount of B's country Y income tax liability on B's 1000u (3000u-2000u) income from the contract. In accordance with the contract B computes its country Y income tax without taking this 1000u into account and therefore pays 1400u ((1000u x 40%) + (2000u x 50%)) to country Y pursuant to the levy.</p><p class="depth0">In accordance with Sec. 1.901-2(f)(2)(i), the country Y income tax which country Y is, under the contract, required to bear is considered to be paid by country Y on behalf of B. B's proceeds of its contract, for all purposes of chapter 1 of the Code (including the computation of B's accumulated profits for purposes of section 902), therefore, are increased by the additional 500u (1900u computed as in example 2 less 1400u as computed above) of B's liability under the country Y income tax that is assumed by country Y and such 500u is considered to be paid pursuant to the levy by country Y on behalf of B. In applying the safe harbor formula, therefore, the computation is exactly as in example 2 and the results are the same as in example 2.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Country L issues a decree (the ``April 11 decree''), in which it states it is exercising its tax authority to impose a tax on all corporations on their ``net income'' from country L. ``Net income'' is defined as actual gross receipts less all expenses attributable thereto, except that in the case of income from extraction of petroleum, gross receipts are defined as 105 percent of actual gross receipts, and no deduction is allowed for interest incurred on loans whose proceeds are used for exploration for petroleum. Under the April 11 decree, wages paid by corporations subject to the decree are deductible in the year of payment, except that corporations engaged in the extraction of petroleum may deduct such wages only by amortization over a 5-year period and, to the extent such wages are paid to officers, they may be deducted only by amortization over a period of 50 years. The April 11 decree permits related corporations subject to the decree to file consolidated returns in which net income and net losses of related corporations offset each other in computing net income for purposes of the April 11 decree, except that corporations engaged in petroleum exploration or extraction activities are not eligible for inclusion in such a consolidated return. The law of country L does not require separate entities to carry on separate activities in connection with exploring for or extracting petroleum. Net losses of a taxable year may be carried over for 10 years to offset income, except that no more than 25% of net income (before deducting the loss carryover) in any such future year may be offset by a carryover of net loss, and, in the case of any corporation engaged in exploration or extraction of petroleum, losses incurred prior to such a corporation's having net income from production may be carried forward for only 8 years and no more than 15% of net income in any such future year may be offset by such a net loss. The rate to be paid under the April 11 decree is 50% of net income (as defined in the levy), except that if net income exceeds 10,000u (units of country L currency), the rate is 75% of the corporation's net income (including the first 10,000u thereof). In practice, no corporations other than corporations engaged in extraction of petroleum have net income in excess of 10,000u. All petroleum resources of country L are owned by

the government of country L, whose petroleum ministry licenses corporations to explore for and extract petroleum in consideration for payment of royalties as petroleum is produced.</p><p class="depth0">J is a U.S. corporation that is engaged in country L in the exploration and extraction of petroleum and therefore is a dual capacity taxpayer.

However, the April 11 decree as applied to such corporations is a qualifying levy because J has demonstrated that all of the criteria of section 903 are satisfied with respect to the April 11 decree as applied to such corporations, except for the determination of the distinct element of such levy that imposes a tax and of J's qualifying amount with respect thereto.</p><p class="depth0">In applying the safe harbor formula, in accordance with paragraph (e)(2), gross receipts are computed by reference to the general levy, and thus are 100%, not 105%, of actual gross receipts. Similarly, costs and expenses include exploration interest expense. In accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section the difference between the general tax and the qualifying levy in the timing of the deduction for wages, other than wages of officers, is not considered to increase the liability of dual capacity taxpayers because the general tax would not have failed to be an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.901-2(a)(1) if it had provided for 5-year amortization of such wages instead of for current deduction. See Sec. 1.901-2(b)(4)(i). However, amortization of wages paid to officers over a 50-year period is such a deferred recovery of such wages that it effectively is a denial of the deduction of the excess of such wages paid in any year over the amortization of such cumulative wages permitted in such year. See Sec. 1.901-2(b)(4)(i). The different treatment of wages paid to officers under the general tax and the qualifying levy is thus not merely a difference in timing within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section. Accordingly, the difference between the amount of wages paid by J to officers in any year and J's deduction (in computing the actual payment amount) for amortization of such cumulative wages allowed in such year is, pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section, treated as a cost and expense in computing J's qualifying amount for such year with respect to the April 11 decree. The differences in the consolidation and carryover provisions between the general tax and the qualifying levy are of the types described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section and, pursuant to paragraphs (b)(4)(ii) and (b)(4)(iii) of

Sec. 1.901-2, the general tax would not fail to be an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.901-2(a)(i) even if it contained the consolidation and carryover provisions of the qualifying levy. Thus, such differences are not considered to increase the liability of dual capacity taxpayers pursuant to the qualifying levy as compared to the general tax liability of persons other than dual capacity taxpayers.</p><p class="depth0">Accordingly, in applying the safe harbor formula to the qualifying levy for 1985 and 1986, gross receipts and costs and expenses are computed as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Gross receipts

Pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, J's specific economic benefit amounts are characterized according to the nature of J's transactions with country L and of the specific economic benefit received by J as additional royalties paid to country L with respect to the petroleum extracted by J in country L in 1985 and 1986, and these amounts are so treated for all purposes of chapter 1 of the Code.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Country E, which has no generally imposed income tax, imposes a levy called the country E income tax only on corporations carrying on the banking business through a branch in country E and on corporations engaged in the extraction of petroleum in country E. All of the petroleum resources of country E are owned by the government of country E, whose petroleum ministry licenses corporations to explore for and extract petroleum in consideration of payment of royalties as petroleum is extracted. The base of the country E income tax is a corporation's actual gross receipts from sources in country E less all expenses attributable, on reasonable principles, to such gross receipts; the rate of tax is 29 percent.</p><p class="depth0">A is a U.S corporation that carries on the banking business through a branch in country E. B is a U.S. corporation (unrelated to A) that is engaged in the extraction of petroleum in country E. In 1984 A receives interest on loans it has made to 160 borrowers in country E, seven of which are agencies and instrumentalities of the government of country E. The economic benefits received by A and B (i.e., the interest received by A from the government and B's license to extract petroleum owned by the government) are not made available on substantially the same terms to the population of country E in general.</p><p class="depth0">A and B are dual capacity taxpayers. Each of them has validly elected the safe harbor method for country E for 1984. A demonstrates that the country E income tax as applied to it (a dual capacity taxpayer) is not different by its terms or in practice from the country E income tax as applied to persons (in this case other banks) that are not dual capacity taxpayers. A has therefore established pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section and Sec. 1.901-2(d) that the country E income tax as applied to it and the country E income tax as applied to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers are together a single levy. A establishes that such levy is an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.901-2(a)(1). In accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, no portion of the amount paid by A pursuant to such levy is considered to be paid in exchange for a specific economic benefit. Thus, the entire amount paid by A pursuant to this levy is an amount of income tax paid.</p><p class="depth0">B does not demonstrate that the country E income tax as applied to corporations engaged in the extraction of petroleum in country E (dual capacity taxpayers) is not different by its terms or in practice from the country E income tax as applied to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers (i.e., banks that are not dual capacity taxpayers). Accordingly, pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section and Sec. 1.901-2(d), the country E income tax as applied to corporations engaged in the extraction of petroleum in country E is a separate levy from the country E income tax as applied to other persons.</p><p class="depth0">B demonstrates that all of the criteria of section 901 are satisfied with respect to the country E income tax as applied to corporations engaged in the exploration of petroleum in country E, except for the determination of the distinct element of such levy that imposes a tax and of B's qualifying amount with respect to the levy. Pursuant to paragraph (e)(5) of this section, in applying the safe harbor formula to B, ``A'' is the amount of B's gross receipts as determined under the country E income tax as applied to B; ``B'' is the amount of B's costs and expenses as determined thereunder; ``C'' is B's actual payment amount; and ``D'' is .29, the lower of the rate (29 percent) of the qualifying levy (the country E income tax as applied to corporations engaged in the extraction of petroleum in country E) or the rate (46 percent) of tax specified for 1984 in section 11(b)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code. Thus, B's qualifying amount is equal to its actual payment amount.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. The facts are the same as in example 5, except that the rate of the country E income tax is 55 percent. For the reasons stated in example 5, the results with respect to A are the same as in example 5. In applying the safe harbor formula to B, ``A,'' ``B,'' and ``C'' are the same as in example 5, but ``D'' is .46, as that rate is less than .55. Thus, B's qualifying amount is less than B's actual payment amount, and the difference is B's specific economic benefit amount.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Country E imposes a tax (called the country E income tax) on the realized net income derived by corporations from sources in country E, except that, with respect to interest income received from sources in country E and certain insurance income, nonresident corporations are instead subject to other levies. With respect to such interest income a levy (called the country E interest tax) requires nonresident corporations to pay to country E 20 percent of such gross interest income unless the nonresident corporation falls within a specified category of corporations (``special corporations''), all of which are dual capacity taxpayers, in which case the rate is instead 25 percent. With respect to such insurance income nonresident corporations are subject to a levy (called the country E insurance tax), which is not an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.901-2(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">The country E interest tax applies at the 20 percent rate by its terms and in practice to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers. The country E interest tax as applied at the 25 percent rate to special corporations applies only to dual capacity taxpayers; therefore, the country E interest tax as applied to special corporations is a separate levy from the country E interest tax as applied at the 20 percent rate.</p><p class="depth0">A is a U.S. corporation which is a special corporation subject to the 25 percent rate of the country E interest tax. A does not have any insurance income that is subject to the country E insurance tax. A, a dual capacity taxpayer, has validly elected the safe harbor formula for 1984. In 1984 A receives 100u (units of country E currency) of gross interest income subject to the country E interest tax and pays 25u to country E.</p><p class="depth0">A establishes that the country E income tax is the generally imposed income tax of country E; that all of the criteria of section 903 are satisfied with respect to the country E interest tax as applied to special corporations except for the determination of the distinct element of the levy that is a tax and of A's qualifying amount with respect thereto. A has therefore demonstrated that the country E interest tax as applied to special corporations is a qualifying levy. A establishes that the country E interest tax at the 20 percent rate is a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.903-1(a). Pursuant to paragraph (e)(6) of this section the country E interest tax at the 20 percent rate is treated as if it were an application of the general tax for purposes of the safe harbor formula of this paragraph (e), since that tax would actually have been required to have been paid by A with respect to its interest

income had A not been a dual capacity taxpayer (special corporation) instead subject to the qualifying levy (the country E interest tax at the 25 percent rate).</p><p class="depth0">Even if the country E insurance tax is a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.903-1(a), that tax is not treated as if it were an application of the general tax for purposes of applying the safe harbor formula to A since A had no insurance income in 1984 and hence such tax would not actually have been required to be paid by A had A not been a dual capacity taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Under a levy of country S called the country S income tax, each corporation operating in country S is required to pay country S 50 percent of its income from operations in country S. Income for purposes of the country S income tax is computed by subtracting all attributable costs and expenses from a corporation's gross receipts derived from its business in country S. Among corporations on which the country S income tax is imposed are corporations engaged in the exploitation of mineral K in country S. Natural deposits of mineral K in country S are owned by country S, and all corporations engaged in the exploitation thereof do so under concession agreement with an instrumentality of country S. Such corporations, in addition to the 50 percent country S income tax, are also subject to a levy called a surtax, which is equal to 60 percent of posted price net income less the amount of the contry S income tax. The surtax is not deductible in computing the country S income tax of corporations engaged in the exploitation of mineral K in country S.</p><p class="depth0">A is a U.S. corporation engaged in country S in the exploitation of mineral K, and A has been allowed to extract mineral K under a concession agreement with an instrumentality of country S. Therefore, A is a dual capacity taxpayer. In accordance with a term of the concession agreement, certain of A's income (net of expenses attributable thereto) is exempted from the income tax and surtax.</p><p class="depth0">The results for A in 1984 are as follows:

Moreover, because A's concession agreement provides for a modification (exemption of certain income) of the country S income tax and surtax as they otherwise apply to other persons engaged in the exploitation of mineral K in country S, those levies (contractual levies) as applied to A are separate levies from those levies as applied to other persons engaged in the exploitation of mineral K in country S.</p><p class="depth0">A establishes that the country S income tax as applied to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers is an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.901-2(a)(1) and is the general tax. A demonstrates that all the criteria of section 903 are satisfied with respect to the country S income tax as applied to A and with respect to the surtax as applied to A, except for the determination of the distinct elements of such levies that are taxes and of A's qualifying amounts with respect to such levies. Therefore, both the country S income tax as applied to A and the surtax as applied to A are qualifying levies.</p><p class="depth0">In applying the safe harbor formula, in accordance with paragraph (e)(2), the amount of A's gross receipts includes the exempt realized income, and the amount of A's costs and expenses includes the costs attributable to such exempt income. In accordance with paragraph (e)(7)(i), the amount of the qualifying levy for purposes of the formula is the sum of A's liability for the country S income tax and A's liability for the surtax. Accordingly, under the safe harbor formula, A's qualifying amount with respect to the country S income tax and the surtax is 35u ((135u-25u-75u) x .50/(1-.50)). A's specific economic benefit amount is 40u (A's actual payment amount (75u) less A's qualifying amount (35u)).</p><p class="depth0">Example 9.

The results of any loss year are disregarded since the country T income tax as applied to dual capacity taxpayers does not allow consolidation, and, pursuant to paragraph (e)(2)(ii), differences in consolidation provisions between such levy and the country T income tax as applied to persons that are not dual capacity taxpayers are not considered. Accordingly, in 1984 the qualifying amount with respect to the country T income tax is 50u ((120u-20u-50u) x .50/(1-.50)), all of which is considered paid by C.

Thus, with respect to B, the country W income tax is not a qualifying levy by reason of the last sentence of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. A demonstrates that all the criteria of section 901 are satisfied with respect to the 80 percent levy, except for the determination of the distinct element of such levy that is a tax and of A's qualifying amount with respect thereto.

Accordingly, the 75 percent levy is a qualifying levy.</p><p class="depth0">Pursuant to paragraph (e)(7), D (which is not subject to a levy of country Y but is considered to receive a specific economic benefit by reason of Sec. 1.901-2(a)(2)(ii)(E)) is treated as a dual capacity taxpayer in applying paragraph (e)(7)(ii). D demonstrates that the withholding tax is a tax in lieu of an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.903-1, which tax applies in practice to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers, and that such tax actually would have applied to D had D not been a dual capacity taxpayer (i.e., had C not been a dual capacity taxpayer, in which case D also would not have been one). Accordingly, the withholding tax is treated for purposes of the safe harbor formula as if it were an application of the general tax.</p><p class="depth0">In applying the safe harbor formula to this situation in accordance with paragraph (e)(7)(ii), the rates of the country Y income tax and the withholding tax are aggregated into a single effective general tax rate. In this case, the rate is .60 (.50 + [(1-.50) x .20]). Accordingly, under the safe harbor formula, C's qualifying amount with respect to the 75 percent levy is 37.5u [(120u-20u-75u) x .60/(1-.60)], the aggregate amount that C and D would have paid if C had been subject to the country Y income tax and had distributed to D as a dividend subject to the withholding tax the entire amount that remained for the year after payment of the country Y income tax. Because C is in fact the only taxpayer, the entire qualifying amount is paid by C.</p><p class="depth0">Example 13. The facts are the same as in example 12, except that dividends received from corporations engaged in the exploitation of mineral K in country Y are subject to the withholding tax. Thus, C's liability under the 75 percent levy is 75u, and D's liability under the withholding tax on the 25u distribution is 5u.</p><p class="depth0">D, which is a dual capacity taxpayer, demonstrates that the withholding tax as applied to D does not differ by its terms or in practice from the withholding tax as applied to persons other than dual capacity taxpayers and hence that the withholding tax as applied to D and that levy as applied to such other persons is a single levy. D demonstrates that all of the criteria of section 903 are satisfied with respect to the withholding tax. The withholding tax is not a qualifying levy by reason of the last sentence of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraphs (e)(7)(i), (e)(7)(ii) and (e)(7)(iii) all apply in this situation. As in example 10, it is not necessary to incorporate the withholding tax into the safe harbor formula. All of the amount paid by D, 5u, is an amount of tax paid by D in lieu of an income tax. In applying the safe harbor formula to C, therefore, with respect to the 75 percent levy, ``A'' is 120, ``B'' is ``20'', ``C'' is 75 and ``D'' is .50. Accordingly, C's qualifying amount with respect to the 75 percent levy is 25u; the remaining 50u that it paid is its specific economic benefit amount.</p><p class="depth0">Example 14. The facts are the same as in example 12, except that dividends received from corporations engaged in the exploitation of mineral K in country Y are subject to a 10 percent withholding tax (the ``10 percent withholding tax''). Thus, C's liability

under the 75 percent levy is 75u, and D's liability under the 10 percent withholding tax on the 25u distribution is 2.5u.</p><p class="depth0">The only difference between the withholding tax and the 10 percent withholding tax applicable only to dual capacity taxpayers (including D) is that a lower rate (but the same base) applies to dual capacity taxpayers. Although the withholding tax and the 10 percent withholding tax are together a single levy, this difference makes it necessary, when dealing with multiple levies, to incorporate the withholding tax and D's payment pursuant to the 10 percent withholding tax in the safe harbor formula. Accordingly, as in example 12, the safe harbor formula is applied by aggregation.</p><p class="depth0">The aggregate effective rate of the general taxes for purposes of the safe harbor formula is .60 (.50 + [(1-.50) x .20]). Pursuant to paragraph (e)(7), the aggregate actual payment amount of the qualifying levies for purposes of the formula is the sum of C and D's liability for the 75 percent levy and the 10 percent withholding tax. Accordingly, under the safe harbor formula, the aggregate qualifying amount with respect to the 75 percent levy on C and the 10 percent withholding tax on D is 33.75u ((120u-20u-[75u + 2.5u]) x .60/(1-.60)), which is the aggregate amount of tax that C and D would have paid if C had been subject to the country Y income tax and had paid out its entire amount remaining after payment of that tax to D as a dividend subject to the withholding tax.</p><p class="depth0">Example 15. The facts are the same as in example 5, except that the rate of the country E income tax is 45 percent and a political subdivision of country E also imposes a levy, called the ``local tax,'' on all corporations subject to the country E income tax. The base of the local tax is the same as the base of the country E income tax; the rate is 10 percent.</p><p class="depth0">The reasoning of example 5 with regard to the country E income tax as applied to A and B, respectively, applies equally with regard to the local tax as applied to A and B, respectively. Accordingly, the entire amount paid by A pursuant to each of the country E income tax and the local tax is an amount of income tax paid, and both the country E income tax as applied to B and the local tax as applied to B are qualifying levies.</p><p class="depth0">Pursuant to paragraph (e)(7), in applying the safe harbor formula to B, ``A'' is the amount of B's gross receipts as determined under the (identical) country E income tax and local tax as applied to B; ``B'' is the amount of B's costs and expenses thereunder; and ``C'' is the sum of B's actual payment amounts with respect to the two levies. Pursuant to paragraph (e)(7), in applying the safe harbor formula to B, B's aggregate qualifying amount with respect to the two levies is limited to the amount determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(5) where ``D'' is the rate of tax specified in section 11(b)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, ``D'' is .46, which is the lower of the aggregate rate (55 percent) of the qualifying levies or the section 11(b)(5) rate (46 percent). B's aggregate qualifying amount is, therefore, identical to B's qualifying amount in example 6, which is less than its aggregate actual payment amount, and the difference is B's specific economic benefit amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective date.

Sec. 1.901-3  Reduction in amount of foreign taxes on foreign mineralincome allowed as a credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Determination of amount of reduction--(1) In general. For purposes of determining the amount of taxes which are allowed as a credit under section 901(a) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, the amount of any income, war profits, and excess profits taxes paid or accrued, or deemed to be paid under section 902, during the taxable year to any foreign country or possession of the United States with respect to foreign mineral income (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) from sources within such country or possession shall be reduced by the amount, if any, by which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The smaller of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The amount of such foreign income, war profits, and excess profits taxes, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The amount of the tax which would be computed under chapter 1 of the Code for such year with respect to such foreign mineral income if the deduction for depletion were determined under section 611 without regard to the deduction for percentage depletion under section 613, exceeds</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of the tax computed under chapter 1 of the Code for such year with respect to such foreign mineral income.

The reduction required by this subparagraph must be made on a country-by-country basis whether the taxpayer uses for the taxable year the per-country limitation under section 904(a)(1), or the overall limitation under section

904(a)(2), on the amount of taxes allowed as credit under section 901(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determination of amount of tax on foreign mineral income--(i) Foreign tax. For purposes of subparagraph (1)(i)(a) of this paragraph, the amount of the income, war profits, and excess profits taxes paid or accrued during the taxable year to a foreign country or possession of the United States with respect to foreign mineral income from sources within such country or possession is an amount which is the greater of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The amount by which the total amount of the income, war profits, and excess profits taxes paid or accrued during the taxable year to such country or possession exceeds the amount of such taxes that would be paid or accrued for such year to such country or possession without taking into account such foreign mineral income, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The amount of the income, war profits, and excess profits taxes that would be paid or accrued to such country or possession if such foreign mineral income were the taxpayer's only income for the taxable year, except that in no case shall the amount so determined exceed the total of all income, war profits, and excess profits taxes paid or accrued during the taxable year to such country or possession. For such purposes taxes which are paid or accrued also include taxes which are deemed paid under section 902. In the case of a dividend described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) (a) of this section which is from sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States and is attributable in whole or in part to foreign mineral income, the amount of the income, war profits, and excess profits taxes deemed paid under section 902 during the taxable year to such country or possession with respect to foreign mineral income from sources within such country or possession is an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of the income, war profits, and excess profits taxes deemed paid under section 902 during such year to such country or possession with respect to such dividend as the portion of the dividend which is attributable to foreign mineral income bears to the total dividend. For purposes of (a) and (b) of this subdivision, foreign mineral income is to be reduced by any credits, expenses, losses, and other deductions which are properly allocable to such income under the law of the foreign country or possession of the United States from which such income is derived.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> U.S. tax. For purposes of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, the amount of the tax computed under chapter 1 of the Code for the taxable year with respect to foreign mineral income from sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States is the greater of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The amount by which the tax under chapter 1 of the Code on the taxpayer's taxable income for the taxable year exceeds a tax determined under such chapter on the taxable income for such year determined without regard to such foreign mineral income, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The amount of tax that would be determined under chapter 1 of the Code if such foreign mineral income were the taxpayer's only income for the taxable year.

For purposes of this subdivision the tax is to be determined without regard to any credits against the tax and without taking into account any tax against which a credit is not allowed under section 901(a). For purposes of (b) of this subdivision, the foreign mineral income is to be reduced only by expenses, losses, and other deductions properly allocable under chapter 1 of the Code to such income and is to be computed without any deduction for personal exemptions under section 151 or 642(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> U.S. income tax computed without deduction allowed by section 613. For purposes of subparagraph (1)(i)(b) of this paragraph, the amount of the tax which would be computed under chapter 1 of the Code (without regard to section 613) for the taxable year with respect to foreign mineral income from sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States is the amount of the tax on such income that would be computed under such chapter by using as the allowance for depletion cost depletion computed upon the adjusted depletion basis of the property. For purposes of this subdivision the tax is to be determined without regard to

any credits against the tax and without taking into account any tax against which credit is not allowed under section 901(a). If the greater tax with respect to the foreign mineral income under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph is the tax determined under (a) of such subdivision, the tax determined for purposes of subparagraph (1)(i)(b) of this paragraph is to be determined by applying the principles of (a) (rather than of (b)) of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. On the other hand, if the greater tax with respect to the foreign mineral income under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph is the tax determined under (b) of such subdivision, the tax determined for purposes of subparagraph (1)(i)(b) of this paragraph is to be determined by applying the principles of (b) (rather than of (a)) of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special rules. (i) The reduction required by this paragraph in the amount of taxes paid, accrued, or deemed to be paid to a foreign country or possession of the United States applies only where the taxpayer is allowed a deduction for percentage depletion under section 613 with respect to any part of his foreign mineral income for the taxable year from sources within such country or possession, whether or not such deduction is allowed with respect to the entire foreign mineral income from sources within such country or possession for such year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of this section, the term ``foreign country'' or ``possession of the United States'' includes the adjacent continental shelf areas to the extent, and in the manner, provided by section 638(2) and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The provisions of this section are to be applied before making any reduction required by section 1503(b) in the amount of income, war profits, and excess profits taxes paid or accrued to foreign countries or possessions of the United States by a Western Hemisphere trade corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If a taxpayer chooses with respect to any taxable year to claim a credit under section 901 and has any foreign mineral income from sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States with respect to which the deduction under section 613 is allowed, he must attach to his return a schedule showing the computations required by subdivisions (i), (ii), and (iii) of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A taxpayer who has elected to use the overall limitation under section 904(a)(2) on the amount of the foreign tax credit for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970, may, for his first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, revoke his election without first securing the consent of the Commissioner. See paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.904-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Foreign mineral income defined--(1) In general. The term ``foreign mineral income'' means income (determined under chapter 1 of the Code) from sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States derived from--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The extraction of minerals from mines, wells, or other natural deposits,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The processing of minerals into their primary products, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The transportation, distribution, or sale of minerals or of the primary products derived from minerals.

Any income of the taxpayer derived from an activity described in either subdivision (i), (ii), or (iii) of this subparagraph is foreign mineral income, since it is not necessary that the taxpayer extract, process, and transport, distribute, or sell minerals or their primary products for the income derived from any such activity to be foreign mineral income. Thus, for example, an integrated oil company must treat as foreign mineral income from sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States all income from such sources derived from the production of oil, the refining of crude oil into gasoline, the distribution of gasoline to marketing outlets, and the retail sale of gasoline. Similarly, income from such sources from the refining, distribution, or marketing of fuel oil by the taxpayer is foreign mineral income, whether or not the crude oil was extracted by the taxpayer. In further illustration, income from sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States derived from the processing of minerals into their primary products by the taxpayer is foreign mineral income, whether or not

the minerals were extracted, or the primary products were sold, by the taxpayer. Section 901(e) and this section apply whether or not the extraction, processing, transportation, distribution, or selling of the minerals or primary products is done by the taxpayer. Thus, for example, an individual who derives royalty income from the extraction of oil from an oil well in a foreign country has foreign mineral income for purposes of this paragraph. Income from the manufacture, distribution, and marketing of petrochemicals is not foreign mineral income. Foreign mineral income is not limited to gross income from the property within the meaning of section 613(c) and Sec. 1.613-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Income included in foreign mineral income--(i) In general. Foreign mineral income from sources within a foreign country or possession of the United States includes, but is not limited to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Dividends from such sources, as determined under Sec. 1.902-1(h)(1), received from a foreign corporation in respect of which taxes are deemed paid by the taxpayer under section 902, to the extent such dividends are attributable to foreign mineral income described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. The portion of such a dividend which is attributable to such income is that amount which bears the same ratio to the total dividend received as the earnings and profits out of which such dividend is paid that are attributable to foreign mineral income bear to the total earnings and profits out of which such dividend is paid. For such purposes, the foreign mineral income of a foreign corporation is its foreign mineral income described in this paragraph (including any dividends described in this (a) which are received from another foreign corporation), whether or not such income is derived from sources within the foreign country or possession of the United States in which, or under the laws of which, the former corporation is created or organized. A foreign corporation is considered to have no foreign mineral income for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Any section 78 dividend to which a dividend described in (a) of this subdivision gives rise, but only to the extent such section 78 dividend is deemed paid under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section with respect to foreign mineral income from sources within such country or possession and to the extent it is treated under of Sec. 1.902-1(h)(1) as income from sources within such country or possession.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Any amounts includible in income of the taxpayer under section 702(a) as his distributive share of the income of a partnership consisting of income described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Any amounts includible in income of the taxpayer by virtue of section 652(a), 662(a), 671, 682(a), or 691(a), to the extent such amounts consist of income described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Illustration. The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. (a) Throughout 1974, M, a domestic corporation, owns all the one class of stock of N, a foreign corporation which is not a less developed country corporation within the meaning of section 902(d). Both corporations use the calendar year as the taxable year. N is incorporated in foreign country Y. During 1974, N has income from sources within foreign country X, all of which is foreign mineral income. During 1974, N also has income from sources within country Y, none of which is foreign mineral income. N is taxed in each foreign country only on income derived from sources within that country. Neither country X nor country Y allows a credit against its tax for foreign income taxes. N pays a dividend of $40,000 to M for 1974. For purposes of section 902, the dividend is paid from earnings and profits for 1974.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> N's earnings and profits and taxes for 1974 are determined as follows:

is foreign mineral income from a property in country W and is subject to the allowance for depletion. During 1971, M incurs intangible drilling and development costs of $15,000, which are currently deductible for purposes of the tax of both countries. Cost depletion amounts to $2,000 for purposes of the tax of both countries, and only cost depletion is allowed as a deduction under the law of country W. It is assumed that no other deductions are allowable under the law of either country.

Sec. 1.902-1  Credit for domestic corporate shareholder of a foreigncorporation for foreign income taxes paid by the foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions and special effective date. For purposes of section 902, this section, and Sec. 1.902-2, the definitions provided in paragraphs (a) (1) through (12) of this section and the special effective date of paragraph (a)(13) of this section apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Domestic shareholder. In the case of dividends received by a domestic corporation from a foreign corporation after December 31, 1986, the term domestic shareholder means a domestic corporation, other than an S corporation as defined in section 1361(a), that owns at least 10 percent of the voting stock of the foreign corporation at the time the domestic corporation receives a dividend from that foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> First-tier corporation. In the case of dividends received by a domestic shareholder from a foreign corporation in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986, the term first-tier corporation means a foreign corporation, at least 10 percent of the voting stock of which is owned by a domestic shareholder at the time the domestic shareholder receives a dividend from that foreign corporation. The term first-tier corporation also includes a DISC or former DISC, but only with respect to dividends from the DISC or former DISC that are treated under sections 861(a)(2)(D) and 862(a)(2) as income from sources without the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Second-tier corporation. In the case of dividends paid to a first-tier corporation by a foreign corporation in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986, the foreign corporation is a second-tier corporation if, at the time a first-tier corporation receives a dividend from that foreign corporation, the first-tier corporation owns at least 10 percent of the foreign corporation's voting stock and the product of the following equals at least 5 percent--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The percentage of voting stock owned by the domestic shareholder in the first-tier corporation; multiplied by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The percentage of voting stock owned by the first-tier corporation in the second-tier corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Third- or lower-tier corporation.-- (i) Third-tier corporation. In the case of dividends paid to a second-tier corporation by a foreign corporation in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986, a foreign corporation is a third-tier corporation if, at the time a second-tier corporation receives a dividend from that foreign corporation, the second-tier corporation owns at least 10 percent of the foreign corporation's voting stock and the product of the following equals at least 5 percent--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The percentage of voting stock owned by the domestic shareholder in the first-tier corporation; multiplied by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The percentage of voting stock owned by the first-tier corporation in the second-tier corporation; multiplied by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The percentage of voting stock owned by the second-tier corporation in the third-tier corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Fourth-, fifth-, or sixth-tier corporation. In the case of dividends paid to a third-, fourth-, or fifth-tier corporation by a foreign corporation in a taxable year beginning after August 5, 1997, the foreign corporation is a fourth-, fifth-, or sixth-tier corporation, respectively, if at the time the dividend is paid, the corporation receiving the dividend owns at least 10 percent of the foreign corporation's voting stock, the chain of foreign corporations that includes the foreign corporation is connected through stock ownership of at least 10 percent of their voting stock, the domestic shareholder in the first-tier corporation in such chain indirectly owns at least 5 percent of the voting stock of the foreign corporation through such chain, such corporation is a controlled foreign corporation (as defined in section 957) and the domestic shareholder is a United States shareholder (as defined in section 951(b)) in the foreign corporation. Taxes paid by a fourth-, fifth-, or sixth-tier corporation shall be taken into account in determining post-1986 foreign income taxes only if such taxes are paid with respect to taxable years beginning after August 5, 1997, in which the corporation was a controlled foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the ownership requirements of paragraphs (a) (1) through (4) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example. (i) Domestic corporation M owns 30 percent of the voting stock of foreign corporation A on January 1, 1991, and for all periods thereafter. Corporation A owns 40 percent of the voting stock of foreign corporation B on January 1, 1991, and continues to own that stock until June 1, 1991, when Corporation A sells its stock in Corporation B. Both Corporation A and Corporation B use the calendar year as the taxable year. Corporation B pays a dividend out of its post-1986 undistributed earnings to Corporation A, which Corporation A receives on February 16, 1991. Corporation A pays a dividend out of its post-1986 undistributed earnings to Corporation M, which Corporation M receives on January 20, 1992. Corporation M uses a fiscal year ending on June 30 as the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On February 16, 1991, when Corporation B pays a dividend to Corporation A, Corporation M satisfies the 10 percent stock ownership requirement of paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section with respect to Corporation A. Therefore, Corporation A is a first-tier corporation within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2) of this section and Corporation M is a domestic shareholder of Corporation A within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Also on February 16, 1991, Corporation B is a second-tier corporation within the meaning of paragraph (a)(3) of this section because Corporation A owns at least 10 percent of its voting stock, and the percentage of voting stock owned by Corporation M in Corporation A on February 16, 1991 (30 percent) multiplied by the percentage of voting stock owned by Corporation A in Corporation B on February 16, 1991 (40 percent) equals 12 percent. Corporation A shall be deemed to have paid foreign income taxes of Corporation B with respect to the dividend received from Corporation B on February 16, 1991.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> On January 20, 1992, Corporation M satisfies the 10-percent stock ownership requirement of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section with respect to Corporation A. Therefore, Corporation A is a first-tier corporation within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2) of this section and Corporation M is a domestic shareholder within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Accordingly, for its taxable year ending on June 30, 1992, Corporation M is deemed to have paid a portion of the post-1986 foreign income taxes paid, accrued, or deemed to be paid, by Corporation A. Those taxes will include taxes paid by Corporation B that were deemed paid by Corporation A with respect to the dividend paid by Corporation B to Corporation A on February 16, 1991, even though Corporation B is no longer a second-tier corporation with respect to Corporations A and M on January 20, 1992, and has not been a second-tier corporation with respect to Corporations A and M at any time during the taxable years of Corporations A and M that include January 20, 1992.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Upper- and lower-tier corporations. In the case of a sixth-tier corporation, the term upper-tier corporation means a first-, second-, third-, fourth-, or fifth-tier corporation. In the case of a fifth-tier corporation, the term upper-tier corporation means a first-, second-, third-, or fourth-tier corporation. In the case of a fourth-tier corporation, the term upper-tier corporation means a first-, second-, or third-tier corporation. In the case of a third-tier corporation, the term upper-tier corporation means a first- or second-tier corporation. In the case of a second-tier corporation, the term upper-tier corporation means a first-tier corporation. In the case of a first-tier corporation, the

term lower-tier corporation means a second-, third-, fourth-, fifth-, or sixth-tier corporation. In the case of a second-tier corporation, the term lower-tier corporation means a third-, fourth-, fifth-, or sixth-tier corporation. In the case of a third-tier corporation, the term lower-tier corporation means a fourth-, fifth-, or sixth-tier corporation. In the case of a fourth-tier corporation, the term lower-tier corporation means a fifth- or sixth-tier corporation. In the case of a fifth-tier corporation, the term lower-tier corporation means a sixth-tier corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Foreign income taxes. The term foreign income taxes means income, war profits, and excess profits taxes as defined in Sec. 1.901-2(a), and taxes included in the term income, war profits, and excess profits taxes by reason of section 903, that are imposed by a foreign country or a possession of the United States, including any such taxes deemed paid by a foreign corporation under this section. Foreign income, war profits, and excess profits taxes shall not include amounts excluded from the definition of those taxes pursuant to section 901 and the regulations under that section. See section 901(f) and (i) and paragraph (c)(5) of this section. Foreign income, war profits, and excess profits taxes also shall not include taxes for which a credit is disallowed under section 901 and the regulations under section 901. See section 901(j), (k), and (l), and paragraphs (c)(4) and (8) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Post-1986 foreign income taxes--(i) In general. Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(10) and (13) of this section, the term post-1986 foreign income taxes of a foreign corporation means the sum of the foreign income taxes paid, accrued, or deemed paid in the taxable year of the foreign corporation in which it distributes a dividend plus the foreign income taxes paid, accrued, or deemed paid in the foreign corporation's prior taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, to the extent the foreign taxes were not attributable to dividends distributed to, or earnings otherwise included (for example, under section 304, 367(b), 551, 951(a), 1248, or 1293) in the income of, a foreign or domestic shareholder in prior taxable years. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, foreign taxes paid or deemed paid by the foreign corporation on or with respect to earnings that were distributed or otherwise removed from post-1986 undistributed earnings in prior post-1986 taxable years shall be removed from post-1986 foreign income taxes regardless of whether the shareholder is eligible to compute an amount of foreign taxes deemed paid under section 902, and regardless of whether the shareholder in fact chose to credit foreign income taxes under section 901 for the year of the distribution or inclusion. Thus, if an amount is distributed or deemed distributed by a foreign corporation to a United States person that is not a domestic shareholder within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section (for example, an individual or a corporation that owns less than 10% of the foreign corporation's voting stock), or to a foreign person that does not meet the definition of an upper-tier corporation under paragraph (a)(6) of this section, then although no foreign income taxes shall be deemed paid under section 902, foreign income taxes attributable to the distribution or deemed distribution that would have been deemed paid had the shareholder met the ownership requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section shall be removed from post-1986 foreign income taxes. Further, if a domestic shareholder chooses to deduct foreign taxes paid or accrued for the taxable year of the distribution or inclusion, it shall nonetheless be deemed to have paid a proportionate share of the foreign corporation's post-1986 foreign income taxes under section 902(a), and the foreign income taxes deemed paid must be removed from post-1986 foreign income taxes. In the case of a foreign corporation the foreign income taxes of which are determined based on an accounting period of less than one year, the term year means that accounting period. See sections 441(b)(3) and 443.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Distributions out of earnings and profits accumulated by a lower-tier corporation in its taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987, and included in the gross income of an upper-tier corporation in its taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986. Post-1986 foreign income taxes shall include foreign income

taxes that are deemed paid by an upper-tier corporation with respect to distributions from a lower-tier corporation out of nonpreviously taxed pre-1987 accumulated profits, as defined in paragraph (a)(10) of this section, that are received by an upper-tier corporation in any taxable year of the upper-tier corporation beginning after December 31, 1986, provided the upper-tier corporation's earnings and profits in that year are included in its post-1986 undistributed earnings under paragraph (a)(9) of this section. Foreign income taxes deemed paid with respect to a distribution of pre-1987 accumulated profits shall be translated from the functional currency of the lower-tier corporation into dollars at the spot exchange rate in effect on the date of the distribution. To determine the character of the earnings and profits and associated taxes for foreign tax credit limitation purposes, see section 904 and Sec. 1.904-7(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Foreign income taxes paid or accrued with respect to high withholding tax interest. Post-1986 foreign income taxes shall not include foreign income taxes paid or accrued by a noncontrolled section 902 corporation (as defined in section 904(d)(2)(E)(i)) in a taxable year beginning on or before December 31, 2002 with respect to high withholding tax interest (as defined in section 904(d)(2)(B)) to the extent the foreign tax rate imposed on such interest exceeds 5 percent. See section 904(d)(2)(E)(ii) and Sec. 1.904-4(g)(2)(iii) (26 CFR revised as of April 1, 2006). The reduction in foreign income taxes paid or accrued by the amount of tax in excess of 5 percent imposed on high withholding tax interest income must be computed in functional currency before foreign income taxes are translated into U.S. dollars and included in post-1986 foreign income taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Post-1986 undistributed earnings--(i) In general. Except as provided in paragraphs (a) (10) and (13) of this section, the term post-1986 undistributed earnings means the amount of the earnings and profits of a foreign corporation (computed in accordance with sections 964(a) and 986) accumulated in taxable years of the foreign corporation beginning after December 31, 1986, determined as of the close of the taxable year of the foreign corporation in which it distributes a dividend. Post-1986 undistributed earnings shall not be reduced by reason of any earnings distributed or otherwise included in income, for example under section 304, 367(b), 551, 951(a), 1248 or 1293, during the taxable year. Post-1986 undistributed earnings shall be reduced to account for distributions or deemed distributions that reduced earnings and profits and inclusions that resulted in previously-taxed amounts described in section 959(c) (1) and (2) or section 1293(c) in prior taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986. Thus, post-1986 undistributed earnings shall not be reduced to the extent of the ratable share of a controlled foreign corporation's subpart F income, as defined in section 952, attributable to a shareholder that is not a United States shareholder within the meaning of section 951(b) or section 953(c)(1)(A), because that amount has not been included in a shareholder's gross income. Post-1986 undistributed earnings shall be reduced as provided herein regardless of whether any shareholder is deemed to have paid any foreign taxes, and regardless of whether any domestic shareholder chose to claim a foreign tax credit under section 901(a) for the year of the distribution. For rules on carrybacks and carryforwards of deficits and their effect on post-1986 undistributed earnings, see Sec. 1.902-2. In the case of a foreign corporation the foreign income taxes of which are computed based on an accounting period of less than one year, the term year means that accounting period. See sections 441(b)(3) and 443.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Distributions out of earnings and profits accumulated by a lower-tier corporation in its taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987, and included in the gross income of an upper-tier corporation in its taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986. Distributions by a lower-tier corporation out of non-previously taxed pre-1987 accumulated profits, as defined in paragraph (a)(10) of this section, that are received by an upper-tier corporation in any taxable year of the upper-tier corporation beginning after December 31, 1986, shall be treated as post-1986 undistributed earnings of the upper-tier corporation, provided the

upper-tier corporation's earnings and profits for that year are included in its post-1986 undistributed earnings under paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section. To determine the character of the earnings and profits and associated taxes for foreign tax credit limitation purposes, see section 904 and Sec. 1.904-7(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Reduction for foreign income taxes paid or accrued. In computing post-1986 undistributed earnings, earnings and profits shall be reduced by foreign income taxes paid or accrued regardless of whether the taxes are creditable. Thus, earnings and profits shall be reduced by foreign income taxes paid with respect to high withholding tax interest even though a portion of the taxes is not creditable pursuant to section 904(d)(2)(E)(ii) and is not included in post-1986 foreign income taxes under paragraph (a)(8)(iii) of this section. Earnings and profits of an upper-tier corporation, however, shall not be reduced by foreign income taxes paid by a lower-tier corporation and deemed to have been paid by the upper-tier corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Special allocations. The term post-1986 undistributed earnings means the total amount of the earnings of the corporation determined at the corporate level. Special allocations of earnings and taxes to particular shareholders, whether required or permitted by foreign law or a shareholder agreement, shall be disregarded. If, however, the Commissioner establishes that there is an agreement to pay dividends only out of earnings in the separate categories for passive or high withholding tax interest income, then only taxes imposed on passive or high withholding tax interest earnings shall be treated as related to the dividend. See Sec. 1.904-6(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Pre-1987 accumulated profits--(i) Definition. The term pre-1987 accumulated profits means the amount of the earnings and profits of a foreign corporation computed in accordance with section 902 and attributable to its taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987. If the special effective date of paragraph (a)(13) of this section applies, pre-1987 accumulated profits also includes any earnings and profits (computed in accordance with sections 964(a) and 986) attributable to the foreign corporation's taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, but before the first day of the first taxable year of the foreign corporation in which the ownership requirements of section 902(c)(3)(B) and paragraphs (a) (1) through (4) of this section are met with respect to that corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Computation of pre-1987 accumulated profits. Pre-1987 accumulated profits must be computed under United States principles governing the computation of earnings and profits. Pre-1987 accumulated profits are determined at the corporate level. Special allocations of accumulated profits and taxes to particular shareholders with respect to distributions of pre-1987 accumulated profits in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, whether required or permitted by foreign law or a shareholder agreement, shall be disregarded. Pre-1987 accumulated profits of a particular year shall be reduced by amounts distributed from those accumulated profits or otherwise included in income from those accumulated profits, for example under sections 304, 367(b), 551, 951(a), 1248 or 1293. If a deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings is carried back to offset pre-1987 accumulated profits, pre-1987 accumulated profits of a particular taxable year shall be reduced by the amount of the deficit carried back to that year. See Sec. 1.902-2. The amount of a distribution out of pre-1987 accumulated profits, and the amount of foreign income taxes deemed paid under section 902, shall be determined and translated into United States dollars by applying the law as in effect prior to the effective date of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. See Sec. Sec. 1.902-3, 1.902-4 and 1.964-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Foreign income taxes attributable to pre-1987 accumulated profits. The term pre-1987 foreign income taxes means any foreign income taxes paid, accrued, or deemed paid by a foreign corporation on or with respect to its pre-1987 accumulated profits. Pre-1987 foreign income taxes of a particular year shall be reduced by the amount of taxes paid or deemed paid by the foreign corporation on or with respect to amounts distributed or otherwise included in income from pre-1987 accumulated profits of that year. Thus, pre-1987 foreign income taxes shall be reduced by the

amount of taxes deemed paid by a domestic shareholder (regardless of whether the shareholder chose to credit foreign income taxes under section 901 for the year of the distribution or inclusion) or a first-tier or second-tier corporation, and by the amount of taxes that would have been deemed paid had any other shareholder been eligible to compute an amount of foreign taxes deemed paid under section 902. Foreign income taxes deemed paid with respect to a distribution of pre-1987 accumulated profits shall be translated from the functional currency of the distributing corporation into United States dollars at the spot exchange rate in effect on the date of the distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Dividend. For purposes of section 902, the definition of the term dividend in section 316 and the regulations under that section applies. Thus, for example, distributions and deemed distributions under sections 302, 304, 305(b) and 367(b) that are treated as dividends within the meaning of section 301(c)(1) also are dividends for purposes of section 902. In addition, the term dividend includes deemed dividends under sections 551 and 1248, but not deemed inclusions under sections 951(a) and 1293. For rules concerning excess distributions from section 1291 funds that are treated as dividends solely for foreign tax credit purposes, (see Regulation Project INTL-656-87 published in 1992-1 C.B. 1124; see Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Dividend received. A dividend shall be considered received for purposes of section 902 when the cash or other property is unqualifiedly made subject to the demands of the distributee. See Sec. 1.301-1(b). A dividend also is considered received for purposes of section 902 when it is deemed received under section 304, 367(b), 551, or 1248.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Special effective date--(i) Rule. If the first day on which the ownership requirements of section 902(c)(3)(B) and paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section are met with respect to a foreign corporation, without regard to whether a dividend is distributed, is in a taxable year of the foreign corporation beginning after December 31, 1986, then--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes of the foreign corporation shall be determined by taking into account only taxable years beginning on and after the first day of the first taxable year of the foreign corporation in which the ownership requirements are met, including subsequent taxable years in which the ownership requirements of section 902(c)(3)(B) and paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section are not met; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Earnings and profits accumulated prior to the first day of the first taxable year of the foreign corporation in which the ownership requirements of section 902(c)(3)(B) and paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section are met shall be considered pre-1987 accumulated profits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the special effective date rules of this paragraph (a)(13):</p><p class="depth0">Example. As of December 31, 1991, and since its incorporation, foreign corporation A has owned 100 percent of the stock of foreign corporation B. Corporation B is not a controlled foreign corporation. Corporation B uses the calendar year as its taxable year, and its functional currency is the u. Assume 1u equals $1 at all relevant times. On April 1, 1992, Corporation B pays a 200u dividend to Corporation A and the ownership requirements of section 902(c)(3)(B) and paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section are not met at that time. On July 1, 1992, domestic corporation M purchases 10 percent of the Corporation B stock from Corporation A and, for the first time, Corporation B meets the ownership requirements of section 902(c)(3)(B) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Corporation M uses the calendar year as its taxable year. Corporation B does not distribute any dividends to Corporation M during 1992. For its taxable year ending December 31, 1992, Corporation B has 500u of earnings and profits (after foreign taxes but before taking into account the 200u distribution to Corporation A) and pays 100u of foreign income taxes that is equal to $100. Pursuant to paragraph (a)(13)(i) of this section, Corporation B's post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes will include earnings and profits and foreign income taxes attributable to Corporation B's entire 1992 taxable year and all taxable years thereafter. Thus, the April 1, 1992, dividend to Corporation A will reduce post-1986 undistributed earnings to 300u (500u-200u) under paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section. The foreign income taxes attributable to the amount distributed as a dividend to Corporation A will not be

creditable because Corporation A is not a domestic shareholder. Post-1986 foreign income taxes, however, will be reduced by the amount of foreign taxes attributable to the dividend. Thus, as of the beginning of 1993, Corporation B has $60 ($100-[$100 x 40% (200u/500u)]) of post-1986 foreign income taxes. See paragraphs (a)(8)(i) and (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Computation of foreign income taxes deemed paid by a domestic shareholder, first-tier corporation, or lower-tier corporation--(1) General rule. If a foreign corporation pays a dividend in any taxable year out of post-1986 undistributed earnings to a shareholder that is a domestic shareholder or an upper-tier corporation at the time it receives the dividend, the recipient shall be deemed to have paid the same proportion of any post-1986 foreign income taxes paid, accrued or deemed paid by the distributing corporation on or with respect to post-1986 undistributed earnings which the amount of the dividend out of post-1986 undistributed earnings (determined without regard to the gross-up under section 78) bears to the amount of the distributing corporation's post-1986 undistributed earnings. An upper-tier corporation shall not be entitled to compute an amount of foreign taxes deemed paid on a dividend from a lower-tier corporation, however, unless the ownership requirements of paragraphs (a) (1) through (4) of this section are met at each tier at the time the upper-tier corporation receives the dividend. Foreign income taxes deemed paid by a domestic shareholder or an upper-tier corporation must be computed under the following formula:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC07OC91.030</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Allocation rule for dividends attributable to post-1986 undistributed earnings and pre-1987 accumulated profits--(i) Portion of dividend out of post-1986 undistributed earnings. Dividends will be deemed to be paid first out of post-1986 undistributed earnings to the extent thereof. If dividends exceed post-1986 undistributed earnings and dividends are paid to more than one shareholder, then the dividend to each shareholder shall be deemed to be paid pro rata out of post-1986 undistributed earnings, computed as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC07OC91.031</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Portion of dividend out of pre-1987 accumulated profits. After the portion of the dividend attributable to post-1986 undistributed earnings is determined under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the remainder of the dividend received by a shareholder is attributable to pre-1987 accumulated profits to the extent thereof. That part of the dividend attributable to pre-1987 accumulated profits will be treated as paid first from the most recently accumulated earnings and profits. See Sec. 1.902-3. If dividends paid out of pre-1987 accumulated profits are attributable to more than one pre-1987 taxable year

and are paid to more than one shareholder, then the dividend to each shareholder attributable to earnings and profits accumulated in a particular pre-1987 taxable year shall be deemed to be paid pro rata out of accumulated profits of that taxable year, computed as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC07OC91.032</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Dividends paid out of pre-1987 accumulated profits. If dividends are paid by a first-tier corporation or a lower-tier corporation out of pre-1987 accumulated profits, the domestic shareholder or upper-tier corporation that receives the dividends shall be deemed to have paid foreign income taxes to the extent provided under section 902 and the regulations thereunder as in effect prior to the effective date of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. See paragraphs (a) (10) and (13) of this section and Sec. Sec. 1.902-3 and 1.902-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Deficits in accumulated earnings and profits. No foreign income taxes shall be deemed paid with respect to a distribution from a foreign corporation out of current earnings and profits that is treated as a dividend under section 316(a)(2), and post-1986 foreign income taxes shall not be reduced, if as of the end of the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or accrued, the corporation has zero or a deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings and the sum of current plus accumulated earnings and profits is zero or less than zero. The dividend shall reduce post- 1986 undistributed earnings and accumulated earnings and profits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (b):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Domestic corporation M owns 100 percent of foreign corporation A. Both Corporation M and Corporation A use the calendar year as the taxable year, and Corporation A uses the u as its functional currency. Assume that 1u equals $1 at all relevant times. All of Corporation A's pre-1987 accumulated profits and post-1986 undistributed earnings are non-subpart F general limitation earnings and profits under section 904(d)(1)(I). As of December 31, 1992, Corporation A has 100u of post-1986 undistributed earnings and $40 of post-1986 foreign income taxes. For its 1986 taxable year, Corporation A has accumulated profits of 200u (net of foreign taxes) and paid 60u of foreign income taxes on those earnings. In 1992, Corporation A distributes 150u to Corporation M. Corporation A has 100u of post-1986 undistributed earnings and the dividend, therefore, is treated as paid out of post-1986 undistributed earnings to the extent of 100u. The first 100u distribution is from post-1986 undistributed earnings, and, because the distribution exhausts those earnings, Corporation M is deemed to have paid the entire amount of post-1986 foreign income taxes of Corporation A ($40). The remaining 50u dividend is treated as a dividend out of 1986 accumulated profits under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Corporation M is deemed to have paid $15 (60u x 50u/200u, translated at the appropriate exchange rates) of Corporation A's foreign income taxes for 1986. As of January 1, 1993, Corporation A's post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes are 0. Corporation A has 150u of accumulated profits and 45u of foreign income taxes remaining in 1986.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Domestic corporation M (incorporated on January 1, 1987) owns 100 percent of foreign corporation A (incorporated on January 1, 1987). Both Corporation M and Corporation A use the calendar year as the taxable year, and Corporation A uses the u as its functional currency. Assume that 1u equals $1 at all relevant times. Corporation A has no pre-1987 accumulated profits. All of Corporation A's post-1986 undistributed earnings are non-subpart F general limitation earnings and profits under section 904(d)(1)(I). On January 1, 1992, Corporation A has a deficit in accumulated earnings and profits and a deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings of (200u). No foreign taxes have been paid with respect to post-1986 undistributed earnings. During 1992, Corporation A earns 100u (net of foreign taxes), pays $40 of foreign taxes on those earnings and distributes 50u to Corporation M. As of the end of 1992, Corporation A has a deficit of (100u)

((200u) post1986 undistributed earnings + 100u current earnings and profits) in post-1986 undistributed earnings. Corporation A, however, has current earnings and profits of 100u. Therefore, the 50u distribution is treated as a dividend in its entirety under section 316(a)(2). Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, Corporation M is not deemed to have paid any of the foreign taxes paid by Corporation A because post-1986 undistributed earnings and the sum of current plus accumulated earnings and profits are (100u). The dividend reduces both post-1986 undistributed earnings and accumulated earnings and profits. Therefore, as of January 1, 1993, Corporation A's post-1986 undistributed earnings are (150u) and its accumulated earnings and profits are (150u). Corporation A's post-1986 foreign income taxes at the start of 1993 are $40.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Special rules--(1) Separate computations required for dividends from each first-tier and lower-tier corporation--(i) Rule. If in a taxable year dividends are received by a domestic shareholder or an upper-tier corporation from two or more first-tier corporations or two or more lower-tier corporations, the foreign income taxes deemed paid by the domestic shareholder or the upper-tier corporation under sections 902 (a) and (b) and paragraph (b) of this section shall be computed separately with respect to the dividends received from each first-tier corporation or lower-tier corporation. If a domestic shareholder receives dividend distributions from one or more first-tier corporations and in the same taxable year the first-tier corporation receives dividends from one or more lower-tier corporations, then the amount of foreign income taxes deemed paid shall be computed by starting with the lowest-tier corporation and working upward.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (c)(1):</p><p class="depth0">Example. P, a domestic corporation, owns 40 percent of the voting stock of foreign corporation S. S owns 30 percent of the voting stock of foreign corporation T, and 30 percent of the voting stock of foreign corporation U. Neither S, T, nor U is a controlled foreign corporation. P, S, T and U all use the calendar year as their taxable year. In 1993, T and U both pay dividends to S and S pays a dividend to P. To compute foreign taxes deemed paid, paragraph (c)(1) of this section requires P to start with the lowest tier corporations and to compute foreign taxes deemed paid separately for dividends from each first-tier and lower-tier corporation. Thus, S first will compute foreign taxes deemed paid separately on its dividends from T and U. The deemed paid taxes will be added to S's post-1986 foreign income taxes, and the dividends will be added to S's post-1986 undistributed earnings. Next, P will compute foreign taxes deemed paid with respect to the dividend from S. This computation will take into account the taxes paid by T and U and deemed paid by S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Section 78 gross-up--(i) Foreign income taxes deemed paid by a domestic shareholder. Except as provided in section 960(b) and the regulations under that section (relating to amounts excluded from gross income under section 959(b)), any foreign income taxes deemed paid by a domestic shareholder in any taxable year under section 902(a) and paragraph (b) of this section shall be included in the gross income of the domestic shareholder for the year as a dividend under section 78. Amounts included in gross income under section 78 shall, for purposes of section 904, be deemed to be derived from sources within the United States to the extent the earnings and profits on which the taxes were paid are treated under section 904(g) as United States source earnings and profits. Section 1.904-5(m)(6). Amounts included in gross income under section 78 shall be treated for purposes of section 904 as income in a separate category to the extent that the foreign income taxes were allocated and apportioned to income in that separate category. See section 904(d)(3)(G) and Sec. 1.904-6(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Foreign income taxes deemed paid by an upper-tier corporation. Foreign income taxes deemed paid by an upper-tier corporation on a distribution from a lower-tier corporation are not included in the earnings and profits of the upper-tier corporation. For purposes of section 904, foreign income taxes shall be allocated and apportioned to income in a separate category to the extent those taxes were allocated to the earnings and profits of the lower-tier corporation in that separate category. See section 904(d)(3)(G) and Sec. 1.904-6(b)(3). To the extent that section 904(g) treats the earnings of the lower-tier corporation on which those foreign income taxes were paid as United States source earnings and profits, the foreign income taxes deemed paid by the upper-tier corporation on

the distribution from the lower-tier corporation shall be treated as attributable to United States source earnings and profits. See section 904(g) and Sec. 1.904-5(m)(6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (c)(2):</p><p class="depth0">Example. P, a domestic corporation, owns 100 percent of the voting stock of controlled foreign corporation S. Corporations P and S use the calendar year as their taxable year, and S uses the u as its functional currency. Assume that 1u equals $1 at all relevant times. As of January 1, 1992, S has -0- post-1986 undistributed earnings and -0- post-1986 foreign income taxes. In 1992, S earns 150u of non-subpart F general limitation income net of foreign taxes and pays 60u of foreign income taxes. As of the end of 1992, but before dividend payments, S has 150u of post-1986 undistributed earnings and $60 of post-1986 foreign income taxes. Assume that 50u of S's earnings for 1992 are from United States sources. S pays P a dividend of 75u which P receives in 1992. Under Sec. 1.904-5(m)(4), one-third of the dividend, or 25u (75u x 50u/150u), is United States source income to P. P computes foreign taxes deemed paid on the dividend under paragraph (b)(1) of this section of $30 ($60 x 50%[75u/150u]) and includes that amount in gross income under section 78 as a dividend. Because 25u of the 75u dividend is United States source income to P, $10 ($30 x 33.33%[25u/75u]) of the section 78 dividend will be treated as United States source income to P under this paragraph (c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Creditable foreign income taxes. The amount of creditable foreign income taxes under section 901 shall include, subject to the limitations and conditions of sections 902 and 904, foreign income taxes actually paid and deemed paid by a domestic shareholder that receives a dividend from a first-tier corporation. Foreign income taxes deemed paid by a domestic shareholder under paragraph (b) of this section shall be deemed paid by the domestic shareholder only for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit allowed under section 901.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Foreign mineral income.

P, S, T, U, and V each use the calendar year as their U.S. taxable year. Thus, beginning in 1998 V was a fourth-tier controlled foreign corporation, and its foreign taxes paid or accrued in 1998 and later taxable years were eligible to be deemed

paid. On June 30, 2002, T was liquidated, causing S to acquire 100 percent of the stock of U. As a result, V became a third-tier controlled foreign corporation. In 2003, V paid a dividend to U.

Corporation M also is deemed to have paid $5 of the post-1986 foreign income taxes paid by Corporation B and includes $5 in gross income as a deemed dividend under section 78. Both the income inclusion and the foreign taxes deemed paid are subject to a separate limitation for dividends from Corporation B, a noncontrolled section 902 corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. (i) Since 1987, domestic corporation M has owned 50 percent of the one class of stock of foreign corporation A. The remaining 50 percent of Corporation A is owned by foreign corporation Z. For the same time period, Corporation A has owned 40 percent of the one class of stock of foreign corporation B, and Corporation B has owned 30 percent of the one class of stock of foreign corporation C. The remaining 60 percent of Corporation B is owned by foreign corporation Y, and the remaining 70 percent of Corporation C is owned by foreign corporation X. Corporations A, B, and C are not controlled foreign corporations. Corporations A, B, and C use the u as their functional currency, and 1u equals $1 at all relevant times. Corporation B uses a fiscal year ending June 30 as its taxable year; all other corporations use the calendar year as the taxable year. On February 1, 1992, Corporation C pays a 500u dividend out of post-1986 undistributed earnings, 150u to Corporation B and 350u to Corporation X. On February 15, 1992, Corporation B pays a 300u dividend out of post-1986 undistributed earnings computed as of the close of Corporation B's fiscal year ended June 30, 1992, 120u to Corporation A and 180u to Corporation Y. On August 15, 1992, Corporation A pays a 200u dividend out of post-1986 undistributed earnings, 100u to Corporation M and 100u to Corporation Z. In computing foreign taxes deemed paid by Corporations B and A, section 78 does not apply and Corporations B and A thus do not have to include the foreign taxes deemed paid in earnings and profits. See paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. Foreign income taxes deemed paid by Corporations B, A and M, and the foreign corporations' opening balances in post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes for Corporation B's fiscal year beginning July 1, 1992, and Corporation C's and Corporation A's 1993 calendar years are computed as follows:

Both the income inclusion and the credit are subject to a separate limitation for dividends from Corporation A, a noncontrolled section 902 corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. (i) Since 1987, domestic corporation M has owned 100 percent of the voting

stock of controlled foreign corporation A, and Corporation A has owned 100 percent of the voting stock of controlled foreign corporation B. Corporations M, A and B use the calendar year as the taxable year. Corporations A and B are organized in the same foreign country and use the u as their functional currency. 1u equals $1 at all relevant times. Assume that all of the earnings of Corporations A and B are general limitation earnings and profits within the meaning of section 904(d)(2)(I), and that neither Corporation A nor Corporation B has any previously taxed income accounts. In 1992, Corporation B pays a dividend of 150u to Corporation A out of post-1986 undistributed earnings, and Corporation A computes an amount of foreign taxes deemed paid under section 902(b)(1). The dividend is not subpart F income to Corporation A because section 954(c)(3)(B)(i) (the same country dividend exception) applies. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, Corporation A is not required to include the deemed paid taxes in earnings and profits. Corporation A has no pre-1987 accumulated profits and a deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings for 1992. In 1992, Corporation A pays a dividend of 100u to Corporation M out of its earnings and profits for 1992 (current earnings and profits). Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, Corporation M is not deemed to have paid any of the foreign income taxes paid or deemed paid by Corporation A because Corporation A has a deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings as of December 31, 1992, and the sum of its current plus accumulated profits is less than zero. Note that if instead of paying a dividend to Corporation A in 1992, Corporation B had made an additional investment of $150 in United States property under section 956, that amount would have been included in gross income by Corporation M under section 951(a)(1)(B) and Corporation M would have been deemed to have paid $50 of foreign income taxes paid by Corporation B. See sections 951(a)(1)(B) and 960. Foreign income taxes of Corporation B deemed paid by Corporation A and the opening balances in post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes for Corporation A and Corporation B for 1993 are computed as follows:

The 100u dividend to Corporation M carries with it some of the foreign income taxes paid and deemed paid by Corporation A in 1992, which were not deemed paid by Corporation M in 1992 because Corporation A had no post-1986 undistributed earnings.

(i) Since 1987, domestic corporation M has owned 100 percent of the voting stock of controlled foreign corporation A. Corporation M also conducts operations through a foreign branch. Both Corporation A and Corporation M use the calendar year as the taxable year. Corporation A uses the u as its functional currency and 1u equals $1 at all relevant times. Corporation A has no subpart F income, as defined in section 952, and no increase in earnings invested in United States property under section 956 for 1992. Corporation A also has no previously taxed income accounts. Corporation A has general limitation income and high withholding tax interest income that, by operation of section 954(b)(4), does not constitute foreign base company income under section 954(a). Because Corporation A is a controlled foreign corporation, it is not required to reduce post-1986 foreign income taxes by foreign taxes paid or accrued with respect to high withholding tax interest in excess of 5 percent. See Sec. 1.902-1(a)(8)(iii). Corporation A pays a 60u dividend to Corporation M in 1992. For 1992, Corporation M is deemed, under paragraph (b) of this section, to have paid $24 of the post-1986 foreign income taxes paid by Corporation A and includes that amount in gross income under section 78 as a dividend, determined as follows:

Sec. 1.902-2  Treatment of deficits in post-1986 undistributed earningsand pre-1987 accumulated profits of a first- or lower-tier corporationfor purposes of computing an amount of foreign taxes deemed paid underSec. 1.902-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Carryback of deficits in post-1986 undistributed earnings of a first- or lower-tier corporation to pre-effective date taxable years--(1) Rule. For purposes of computing foreign income taxes deemed paid under Sec. 1.902-1(b) with respect to dividends paid by a first- or lower-tier corporation, when there is a deficit in the post-1986 undistributed earnings of that corporation and the corporation makes a distribution to shareholders that is a dividend or would be a dividend if there were current or accumulated earnings and profits, then the post-1986 deficit shall be carried back to the most recent pre-effective date taxable year of the first- or lower-tier corporation with positive accumulated profits computed under section 902. See Sec. 1.902-3(e). For purposes of this Sec. 1.902-2, a pre-effective date taxable year is a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1987, or a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986, if the special effective date of Sec. 1.902-1(a)(13) applies. The deficit shall reduce the section 902 accumulated profits in the most recent pre-effective date year to the extent thereof, and any remaining deficit shall be carried back to the next preceding year or years until the deficit is completely allocated. The amount carried back shall reduce the deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings. Any foreign income taxes paid in a post-effective date year will not be carried back to pre-effective date taxable years or removed from post-1986 foreign income taxes. See section 960 and the regulations under that section for rules governing the carryback of deficits and the computation of foreign income taxes deemed

paid with respect to deemed income inclusions from controlled foreign corporations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (a):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. (i) From 1985 through 1990, domestic corporation M owns 10 percent of the one class of stock of foreign corporation A. The remaining 90 percent of Corporation A's stock is owned by Z, a foreign corporation. Corporation A is not a controlled foreign corporation and uses the u as its functional currency. 1u equals $1 at all relevant times. Both Corporation A and Corporation M use the calendar year as the taxable year. Corporation A has pre-1987 accumulated profits and post-1986 undistributed earnings or deficits in post-1986 undistributed earnings, pays pre-1987 and post-1986 foreign income taxes, and pays dividends as summarized below:

At that time Corporation A has a deficit of (100u) in post-1986 undistributed earnings and $10 of post-1986 foreign income taxes. The (100u) deficit (but not the post-1986 foreign income taxes) is carried back to offset the accumulated profits of 1986 and removed from post-1986 undistributed earnings. The accumulated profits for 1986 are reduced to 50u (150u-100u). The dividend is paid out of the reduced 1986 accumulated profits. Foreign taxes deemed paid by Corporation M with respect to the 5u dividend are 12u (120u x (5u / 50u)). See Sec. 1.902-1(b)(3). Corporation M must include 12u in gross income (translated under the rule applicable to foreign income taxes paid on earnings accumulated in pre-effective date years) under section 78 as a dividend. Both the income inclusion and the foreign taxes deemed paid are subject to a separate limitation for dividends from Corporation A, a noncontrolled section 902 corporation. No accumulated profits remain in Corporation A with respect to 1986 after the carryback of the 1987 deficit and the December 31, 1987, dividend distributions to Corporations M and Z.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> On December 31, 1989, Corporation A distributes a 5u dividend to Corporation M and a 45u dividend to Corporation Z. At that time Corporation A has 100u of post-1986 undistributed earnings and $60 of post-1986 foreign income taxes. Therefore, the dividend is considered paid out of Corporation A's post-1986 undistributed earnings. Foreign taxes deemed paid by Corporation M with respect to the 5u dividend are $3 ($60 x 5%[5u / 100u]). Corporation M must include $3 in gross income under section 78 as a dividend. Both the income inclusion and the foreign taxes deemed paid are subject to a separate limitation for dividends from noncontrolled section 902 corporation A. Corporation A's post-1986 undistributed earnings as of January 1, 1990, are 50u (100u-50u). Corporation A's post-1986 foreign income taxes must be reduced by the amount of foreign taxes that would have been deemed paid if both Corporations M and Z were eligible to compute an amount of deemed paid taxes. Section 1.902-1(a)(8)(i). The amount of foreign income taxes that would have been deemed paid if both Corporations M and Z were eligible to compute an amount of deemed paid taxes on the 50u dividend distributed by Corporation A is $30 ($60 x 50%[50u / 100u]). Thus, post-1986 foreign income taxes as of January 1, 1990, are $30 ($60-$30).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that Corporation A has a deficit in its post-1986 undistributed earnings of (150u) on December 31, 1987. The deficit is carried back to 1986 and reduces accumulated profits for that year to -0-. Thus, the foreign income taxes paid with respect to the 1986 accumulated profits will never be deemed paid. The 1987 dividend is deemed to be out of Corporation A's 1985 accumulated profits. Foreign taxes deemed paid by Corporation M under section 902 with respect to the 5u dividend paid on December 31, 1987, are 4u (120u x 5u / 150u). See Sec. 1.902-1(b)(3). As a result of

the December 31, 1987, dividend distributions, 100u (150u-50u) of accumulated profits and 80u (120u reduced by 40u[120u x 50u / 150u] of foreign taxes that would have been deemed paid had all of Corporation A's shareholders been eligible to compute an amount of foreign taxes deemed paid with respect to the dividend paid out of 1985 accumulated profits) remain in Corporation A with respect to 1985.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. (i) From 1986 through 1991, domestic corporation M owns 10 percent of the one class of stock of foreign corporation A. The remaining 90 percent of Corporation A's stock is owned by Corporation Z, a foreign corporation. Corporation A is not a controlled foreign corporation and uses the u as its functional currency. 1u equals $1 at all relevant times. Both Corporation A and Corporation M use the calendar year as the taxable year. Corporation A has pre-1987 accumulated profits and post-1986 undistributed earnings or deficits in post-1986 undistributed earnings, pays pre-1987 and post-1986 foreign income taxes, and pays dividends as summarized below:

At that time Corporation A has 100u in its post-1986 undistributed earnings and $120 in its post-1986 foreign income taxes. Corporation M is deemed, under Sec. 1.902-1(b)(1), to have paid $12 ($120 x 10%[10u / 100u]) of the post-1986 foreign income taxes paid by Corporation A and includes that amount in gross income under section 78 as a dividend. Both the income inclusion and the foreign taxes deemed paid are subject to a separate limitation for dividends from noncontrolled section 902 corporation A. Corporation A's post-1986 undistributed earnings as of January 1, 1989, are 0 (100u-100u). Its post-1986 foreign taxes as of January 1, 1989, also are 0, $120 reduced by $120 of foreign income taxes paid that would have been deemed paid if both Corporations M and Z were eligible to compute an amount of foreign taxes deemed paid on the dividend from Corporation A ($120 x 100%[100u / 100u]).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> On December 31, 1990, Corporation A distributes a 12u dividend to Corporation M and a 108u dividend to Corporation Z. At that time Corporation A has 100u in its post-1986 undistributed earnings and $40 in its post-1986 foreign income taxes. The dividend is paid out of post-1986 undistributed earnings to the extent thereof (100u), and the remainder of 20u is paid out of 1986 accumulated profits. Under Sec. 1.902-1(b)(2), the 12u dividend to Corporation M is deemed to be paid out of post-1986 undistributed earnings to the extent of 10u (100u x 12u / 120u) and the remaining 2u is deemed to be paid out of Corporation A's 1986 accumulated profits. Similarly, the 108u dividend to Corporation Z is deemed to be paid out of post-1986 undistributed earnings to the extent of 90u (100u x 108u / 120u) and the remaining 18u is deemed to be paid out of Corporation A's 1986 accumulated profits. Foreign income taxes deemed paid by Corporation M under section 902 with respect to the portion of the dividend paid out of post-1986 undistributed earnings are $4 ($40 x 10%[10u / 100u]), and foreign taxes deemed paid by Corporation M with respect to the portion of the dividend deemed paid out of 1986 accumulated profits are 1.6u (80u x 2u / 100u). Corporation M must include $4 plus 1.6u translated under the rule applicable to foreign income taxes paid on earnings accumulated in taxable years prior to the effective date of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 in gross income as a dividend under section 78. The income inclusion and the foreign income taxes deemed paid are subject to a separate limitation for dividends from noncontrolled section 902 Corporation A. As of January 1, 1991, Corporation A's post-1986 undistributed earnings are 0 (100u-100u). 80u (100u-20u) of accumulated profits remain with respect to 1986. Post-1986 foreign income taxes as of January 1, 1991, are 0, $40 reduced by $40 of foreign income taxes paid that would have been deemed paid if both Corporations M and Z were eligible to compute an amount of

deemed paid taxes on the 100u dividend distributed by Corporation A out of post-1986 undistributed earnings ($40 x 100%[100u / 100u]). Corporation A has 64u of foreign income taxes remaining with respect to 1986, 80u reduced by 16u [80u x 20u / 100u] of foreign income taxes that would have been deemed paid if Corporations M and Z both were eligible to compute an amount of deemed paid taxes on the 20u dividend distributed by Corporation A out of 1986 accumulated profits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Carryforward of deficit in pre-1987 accumulated profits of a first- or lower-tier corporation to post-1986 undistributed earnings for purposes of section 902--(1) General rule. For purposes of computing foreign income taxes deemed paid under Sec. 1.902-1(b) with respect to dividends paid by a first- or lower-tier corporation out of post-1986 undistributed earnings, the amount of a deficit in accumulated profits of the foreign corporation determined under section 902 as of the end of its last pre-effective date taxable year is carried forward and reduces post-1986 undistributed earnings on the first day of the foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986, or on the first day of the first taxable year in which the ownership requirements of section 902(c)(3)(B) and Sec. 1.902-1(a)(1) through (4) are met if the special effective date of Sec. 1.902-1(a)(13) applies. Any foreign income taxes paid with respect to a pre-effective date year shall not be carried forward and included in post-1986 foreign income taxes. Post-1986 undistributed earnings may not be reduced by the amount of a pre-1987 deficit in earnings and profits computed under section 964(a). See section 960 and the regulations under that section for rules governing the carryforward of deficits and the computation of foreign income taxes deemed paid with respect to deemed income inclusions from controlled foreign corporations. For translation rules governing carryforwards of deficits in pre-1987 accumulated profits to post-1986 taxable years of a foreign corporation with a dollar functional currency, see Sec. 1.985-6(d)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effect of pre-effective date deficit. If a foreign corporation has a deficit in accumulated profits as of the end of its last pre-effective date taxable year, then the foreign corporation cannot pay a dividend out of pre-effective date years unless there is an adjustment made (for example, a refund of foreign taxes paid) that restores section 902 accumulated profits to a pre-effective date taxable year or years. Moreover, if a foreign corporation has a deficit in section 902 accumulated profits as of the end of its last pre-effective date taxable year, then no deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings will be carried back under paragraph (a) of this section. For rules concerning carrybacks of eligible deficits from post-1986 undistributed earnings to reduce pre-1987 earnings and profits computed under section 964(a), see section 960 and the regulations under that section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples.

Corporation A has 200u of current earnings and profits for 1987, but its post-1986 undistributed earnings are only 100u as a result of the reduction for pre-1987 accumulated deficits required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Corporation A has $100 of post-1986 foreign income taxes. Only 100u of the 150u distribution is a dividend out of post-1986 undistributed earnings. Foreign income taxes deemed paid by Corporation M in 1987 with respect to the 10u dividend attributable to post-1986 undistributed earnings, computed under Sec. 1.902-1(b), are $10 ($100 x 10%[10u/100u]). Corporation M includes this amount in gross income under section 78 as a dividend. Both the income inclusion and the foreign taxes deemed paid are subject to a separate limitation for dividends from noncontrolled section 902 corporation A. After the distribution, Corporation A has (50u) of post-1986 undistributed earnings (100u -150u) and -0- post-1986 foreign income taxes, $100 reduced by $100 of foreign income taxes paid that would have been deemed paid if both Corporations M and Z were eligible to compute an amount of deemed paid taxes on the 100u dividend distributed by Corporation A out of post-1986 undistributed earnings ($100 x 100%[100u / 100u]).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The remaining 50u of the 150u distribution cannot be deemed paid out of accumulated profits of a pre-1987 year because Corporation A has an accumulated deficit as of the end of 1986 that eliminated all pre-1987 accumulated profits. See paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The 50u is a dividend out of current earnings and profits under section 316(a)(2), but Corporation M is not deemed to have paid any additional foreign income taxes paid by Corporation A with respect to that 50u dividend out of current earnings and profits.

Corporation A is not a controlled foreign corporation and uses the u as its functional currency. 1u equals $1 at all relevant times. Both Corporation A and Corporation M use the calendar year as the taxable year.

At the time of the distribution, Corporation A has 50u of post-1986 undistributed earnings and 150u of current earnings and profits. Thus, 50u of the dividend distribution (5u to Corporation M and 45u to Corporation Z) is a dividend out of post-1986 undistributed earnings. The remaining 50u is a dividend out of current earnings and profits under section 316(a)(2), but Corporation M is not deemed to have paid any additional foreign income taxes paid by Corporation A with respect to that 50u dividend out of current earnings and profits. See Sec. 1.902-1(b)(4). Note that even if there were no current earnings and profits in Corporation A, the remaining 50u of the 100u distribution cannot be deemed paid out of accumulated profits of a pre1987 year because Corporation A has an accumulated deficit as of the end of 1986 that eliminated all pre-1987 accumulated profits. See paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Corporation A has $120 of post-1986 foreign income taxes. Foreign taxes deemed paid by Corporation M under section 902 with respect to the 5u dividend out of post-1986 undistributed earnings are $12 ($120 x 10%[5u/50u]). Corporation M includes this amount in gross income as a dividend under section 78. Both the foreign taxes deemed paid and the deemed dividend are subject to a separate limitation for dividends from noncontrolled section 902 corporation A.

Although the distribution is considered a dividend in its entirety out of 1989 earnings and profits pursuant to section 316(a)(2), post-1986 undistributed earnings are (100u). Accordingly, for purposes of section 902, Corporation M is deemed to have paid no post-1986 foreign income taxes. See Sec. 1.902-1(b)(4). Corporation A's post-1986 undistributed earnings as of January 1, 1990, are (200u) ((100u) - 100u). Corporation A's post-1986 foreign income taxes are not reduced because no taxes were deemed paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> On December 31, 1990, Corporation A distributes a 5u dividend to Corporation M and a 45u dividend to Corporation Z. At that time Corporation A has 50u of post-1986 undistributed earnings, and $150 of post-1986 foreign income taxes. Foreign taxes deemed paid by Corporation M under section 902 with respect to the 5u dividend are $15 ($150 x 10%[5u / 50u]). Post-1986 undistributed earnings as of January 1, 1991, are -0- (50u - 50u). Post-1986 foreign income taxes as of January 1, 1991, also are -0-, $150 reduced by $150 ($150 x 100%[50u / 50u]) of foreign income taxes that would have been deemed paid if both Corporations M and Z were eligible to compute an amount of deemed paid taxes on the 50u dividend.

On February 10, 1976, foreign corporation B pays a dividend out of its accumulated profits for 1975 to foreign corporation A. On February 16, 1976, the date on which it receives the dividend, A Corporation owns 40 percent of the voting stock of B Corporation. Both corporations use the calendar year as the taxable year. On June 1, 1976, A Corporation sells its stock in B Corporation. On January 17, 1977, A Corporation pays a dividend out of its accumulated profits for 1976 to domestic corporation M. M Corporation owns 30 percent of the voting stock of A Corporation on January 20, 1977, the date on which it receives the dividend. M Corporation uses a fiscal year ending on April 30 as the taxable year. On February 16, 1976, A Corporation satisfies the 10-percent stock ownership requirement referred to in paragraph (a)(3) of this section with respect to B Corporation, and on January 20, 1977, M Corporation satisfies the 10-percent stock-ownership requirement referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section with respect to A Corporation. The 5-percent requirement of this paragraph (c)(1) is also satisfied since 30 percent (the percentage of voting stock owned by M Corporation in A Corporation on January 20, 1977), when multiplied by 40 percent (the percentage of voting stock owned by A Corporation in B Corporation on February 16, 1976), equals 12 percent. Accordingly, for its taxable year ending on April 30, 1977, M Corporation is entitled to a credit for a portion of the foreign income taxes paid, accrued, or deemed to be paid, by A Corporation for 1976; and for 1976 A Corporation is deemed to have paid a portion of the foreign income taxes paid or accrued by B Corporation for 1975.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Amount of foreign taxes deemed paid by a first-tier corporation. A first-tier corporation which receives dividends in any taxable year from its second-tier corporation shall be deemed to have paid for such year the same proportion of any foreign income taxes paid, accrued, or deemed, in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section, to be paid by its second-tier corporation on or with respect to the accumulated profits, as defined in paragraph (e) of this section, for the taxable year of the second-tier corporation from which such dividends are paid which the amount of such dividends bears to the amount by which such accumulated profits of the second-tier corporation exceed the taxes so paid or accrued. For determining the amount of the foreign income taxes paid or accrued by such second-tier corporation on or with respect to the accumulated profits for the taxable year of such second-tier corporation, see paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Second-tier corporation owning stock in a third-tier corporation--(1) In general. For purposes of applying section 902(b)(1) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if a second-tier corporation receives dividends in any taxable year from its third-tier corporation, the foreign income taxes deemed to be paid by the second-tier corporation on or with respect to its own accumulated profits for such year shall be the amount determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section. This paragraph (d) shall not apply unless the product of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The percentage of voting stock arrived at in applying the 5-percent requirement of paragraph (c)(1) of this section with respect to dividends received by the first-tier corporation from the second-tier corporation, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> the percentage of voting stock owned by the second-tier corporation in the third-tier corporation equals at least 5 percent. The percentage under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section of voting stock owned by the second-tier corporation in the third-tier corporation is determined as of the time that the dividend distributed by the third-tier corporation is received by the second-tier corporation and thus included in accumulated profits of the second-

tier corporation out of which dividends referred to in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section are distributed by the second-tier corporation to the first-tier corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Example. On February 27, 1975, foreign corporation C pays a dividend out of its accumulated profits for 1974 to foreign corporation B. On March 3, 1975, the date on which it receives the dividend, B Corporation owns 50 percent of the voting stock of C Corporation. On February 10, 1976, B Corporation pays a dividend out of its accumulated profits for 1975 to foreign corporation A. On February 16, 1976, the date on which it receives the dividend, A Corporation owns 40 percent of the voting stock of B Corporation. All three corporations use the calendar year as the taxable year. On January 17, 1977, A Corporation pays a dividend out of its accumulated profits for 1976 to domestic corporation M. M Corporation owns 30 percent of the voting stock of A Corporation on January 20, 1977, the date on which it receives the dividend. M Corporation uses a fiscal year ending on April 30 as the taxable year. On February 16, 1976, A Corporation satisfies the 10-percent stock ownership requirement referred to in paragraph (a)(3) of this section with respect to B Corporation, and on January 20, 1977, M Corporation satisfies the 10-percent stock-ownership requirement referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section with respect to A Corporation. The 5-percent requirement of paragraph (c)(1) of this section is also satisfied since 30 percent (the percentage of voting stock owned by M Corporation in A Corporation on January 20, 1977), when multiplied by 40 percent (the percentage of voting stock owned by A Corporation in B Corporation on February 16, 1976), equals 12 percent. On March 3, 1975, B Corporation satisfies the 10 percent stock ownership requirement referred to in paragraph (a)(4) of this section with respect to C Corporation. The 5-percent requirement of this paragraph (d)(1) is also satisfied since 12 percent (the percentage of voting stock arrived at in applying the 5-percent requirement of paragraph (c)(1) of this section with respect to the dividends received by A Corporation from B Corporation on February 16, 1976), when multiplied by 50 percent (the percentage of voting stock owned by B Corporation in C Corporation on March 3, 1975), equals 6 percent. Accordingly, for its taxable year ending on April 30, 1977, M Corporation is entitled to a credit for a portion of the foreign income taxes paid, accrued, or deemed to be paid, by A Corporation for 1976; for 1976 A Corporation is deemed to have paid a portion of the foreign income taxes paid, accrued, or deemed to be paid, by B Corporation for 1975; and for 1975 B Corporation is deemed to have paid a portion of the foreign income taxes paid or accrued by C Corporation for 1974.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Amount of foreign taxes deemed paid by a second-tier corporation. For purposes of applying paragraph (c)(2) of this section to a first-tier corporation, a second-tier corporation which receives dividends in its taxable year from its third-tier corporation shall be deemed to have paid for such year the same proportion of any foreign income taxes paid or accrued by its third-tier corporation on or with respect to the accumulated profits, as defined in paragraph (e) of this section, for the taxable year of the third-tier corporation from which such dividends are paid which the amount of such dividends bears to the amount by which such accumulated profits of the third-tier corporation exceed the taxes so paid or accrued.

For purposes of this paragraph (f), the gains, profits, and income of a foreign corporation for any taxable

For purposes of this section, the earnings and profits of a foreign corporation for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1962, other than a taxable year to which paragraph (g)(2) of this section applies, may, if the domestic shareholder chooses, be determined under the rules provided by Sec. 1.964-1 exclusive of paragraphs (d) and (e) of such section. The translation of amounts so determined into United States dollars or other foreign currency shall be made at the proper exchange rate for the date of distribution with respect to which the determination is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Taxable year to which section 963 applies.

Effective for taxable years of foreign corporations beginning after December 31, 1975, section 963 is repealed by section 602(a)(1) of the Tax Reduction Act of 1975 (89 Stat. 58); accordingly, this paragraph (g)(2) is inapplicable with respect to computing earnings and profits for such taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Time and manner of making choice.

For purposes of this paragraph (g)(3), the 180-day period shall commence on the date of receipt of any distribution which is considered paid from the accumulated profits of a preceding year or years under paragraph (g)(4) of this section. See Sec. 1.964-1(c)(3) (ii) and (iii) for procedures requiring notification of the Director of the Internal Revenue Service Center and noncontrolling shareholders of action taken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Determination by district director. The district director in whose district is filed the income tax return of the domestic shareholder claiming a credit under section 901 for foreign income taxes deemed, under section 902 and this section, to be paid by such shareholder shall have the power to determine, with respect to a foreign corporation, from the accumulated profits of what taxable year or years the dividends were paid. In making such determination the district director shall, unless it is otherwise established to his satisfaction, treat any dividends which are paid in the first 60 days of any taxable year of such a corporation as having been paid from the accumulated profits of the preceding taxable year or years of such corporation and shall, in other respects, treat any dividends as having been paid from the most recently accumulated profits. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(4), in the case of a foreign corporation the foreign income taxes of which are determined on the basis of an accounting period of less than 1 year, the term ``year'' shall mean such accounting period.

Section 903 provides that the term ``income, war profits, and excess profits taxes'' shall include a tax paid in lieu of a tax on income, war profits, or excess profits (``income tax'') otherwise generally imposed by any foreign country. For purposes of this section and Sec. Sec. 1.901-2 and 1.901-2A, such a tax is referred to as a ``tax in lieu of an income tax''; and the terms ``paid'' and ``foreign country'' are defined in Sec. 1.901-2(g). A foreign levy (within the meaning of Sec. 1.901-2(g)(3)) is a tax in lieu of an income tax if and only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> It is a tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.901-2(a)(2); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> It meets the substitution requirement as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.

The foreign country's purpose in imposing the foreign tax (e.g., whether it imposes the foreign tax because of administrative difficulty in determining the base of the income tax otherwise generally imposed) is immaterial. It is also immaterial whether the base of the foreign tax bears any relation to realized net income. The base of the tax may, for example, be gross income, gross receipts or sales, or the number of units produced or exported. Determinations of the amount of a tax in lieu of an income tax that is paid by a person and determinations of the person by whom such tax is paid are made under Sec. 1.901-2 (e) and (f), respectively, substituting the phrase ``tax in lieu of an income tax'' for the phrase ``income tax'' wherever the latter appears in those sections. Section 1.901-2A contains additional rules applicable to dual capacity taxpayers (as defined in Sec. 1.901-2(a)(2)(ii) (A)). The rules of this section are applied independently to each separate levy (within the meaning of Sec. Sec. 1.901-2(d) and 1.901-2A (a)) imposed by the foreign country. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a foreign tax either is or is not a tax in lieu of an income tax in its entirety for all persons subject to the tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Substitution--(1) In general. A foreign tax satisfies the substitution requirement if the tax in fact operates as a tax imposed in substitution for, and not in addition to, an income tax or a series of income taxes otherwise generally imposed. However, not all income derived by persons subject to the foreign tax need be exempt from the income tax. If, for example, a taxpayer is subject to a generally imposed income tax except that, pursuant to an agreement with the foreign country, the taxpayer's income from insurance is subject to a gross receipts tax and not to the income tax, then the gross receipts tax meets the substitution requirement notwithstanding the fact that the taxpayer's income from other activities, such as the operation of a hotel, is subject to the generally imposed income tax. A comparison between the tax burden of this insurance gross receipts tax and the tax burden that would have obtained under the generally imposed income tax is irrelevant to this determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Soak-up taxes. A foreign tax satisfies the substitution requirement only to the extent that liability for the foreign tax is not dependent (by its terms or otherwise) on the availability of a credit for the foreign tax against income tax liability to another country. If, without regard to this paragraph (b)(2), a foreign tax satisfies the requirement of paragraph (b)(1) of this section (including for this purpose any foreign tax that both satisfies such requirement and also is an income tax within the meaning of Sec. 1.901-2(a)(1)), liability for the foreign tax is dependent on the availability of a credit for the foreign tax against income tax liability to another country only to the extent of the lesser of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount of foreign tax that would not be imposed on the taxpayer but for the availability of such a credit to the taxpayer (within the meaning of Sec. 1.901-2(c)), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount, if any, by which the foreign tax paid by the taxpayer exceeds the amount of foreign income tax that would have been paid by the taxpayer if it had instead been subject to the generally imposed income tax of the foreign country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (b) may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Country X has a tax on realized net income that is generally imposed except that nonresidents are not subject to that tax. Nonresidents are subject to a gross income tax on income from country X that is not attributable to a trade or business carried on in country X. The gross income tax imposed on nonresidents satisfies the substitution requirement set forth in this paragraph (b). See also examples 1 and 2 of Sec. 1.901-2(b)(4)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1, with the additional fact that payors located in country X are required by country X law to withhold the gross income tax from payments they make to nonresidents, and to remit such withheld tax to the government of country X. The result is the same as in example 1.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in example 2, with the additional fact that the gross income tax on nonresidents applies to payments for technical services performed by them outside of country X. The result is the same as in example 2.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Country X has a tax that is generally imposed on the realized net income of nonresident corporations that is attributable to a trade or business carried on in country X. The tax applies to all nonresident corporations that engage in business in country X except for such corporations that engage in contracting activities, each of which is instead subject to two different taxes. The taxes applicable to nonresident corporations that engage in contracting activities satisfy the substitution requirement set forth in this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Country X imposes both an excise tax and an income tax. The excise tax, which is payable independently of the income tax,is allowed as a credit against the income tax. For 1984 A has a tentative income tax liability of 100u (units of country X currency) but is allowed a credit for 30u of excise tax that it has paid. Pursuant to paragraph (e)(4)(i) of Sec. 1.901-2, the amount of excise tax A has paid to country X is 30u and the amount of income tax A has paid to country X is 70u. The excise tax paid by A does not satisfy the substitution requirement set forth in this paragraph (b) because the excise tax is imposed on A in addition to, and not in substitution for, the generally imposed income tax.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Pursuant to a contract with country X, A, a domestic corporation engaged in manufacturing activities in country X, must pay tax to country X equal to the greater of (i) 5u (units of country X currency) per item produced, or (ii) the maximum amount creditable by A against its U.S. income tax liability for that year with respect to income from its country X operations. Also pursuant to the contract, A is exempted from country X's otherwise generally imposed income tax. A produces 16 items in 1984 and the maximum amount creditable by A against its U.S. income tax liability for 1984 is 125u. If A had been subject to country X's otherwise generally imposed income tax it would have paid a tax of 150u. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the amount of tax paid by A that is dependent on the availability of a credit against income tax of another country is 0 (lesser of (i) 45u, the amount that would not be imposed but for the availability of a credit (125u-80u), or (ii) 0, the amount by which the contractual tax (125u) exceeds the generally imposed income tax (150u)).</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. The facts are the same as in example 6 except that, of the 150u A would have paid if it had been subject to the otherwise generally imposed income tax, 60u is dependent on the availability of a credit against income tax of another country. The amount of tax actually paid by A (i.e., 125u) that is dependent on the availability of a credit against income tax of another country is 35u (lesser of (i) 45u, computed as in example , Sec. 6, or (ii) 35u, the amount by which the contractual tax (125u) exceeds the amount A would have paid as income tax if it had been subject to the otherwise generally imposed income tax (90u, i.e., 150u-60u).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effective date. The effective date of this section is as provided in Sec. 1.901-2(h).

Sec. 1.904-1  Limitation on credit for foreign taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Per-country limitation--(1) General. In the case of any taxpayer who does not elect the overall limitation under section 904(a)(2), the amount allowable as a credit for income or profits taxes paid or accrued to a foreign country or a possession of the United States is subject to the per-country limitation prescribed in section 904(a)(1). Such limitation provides that the credit for such taxes paid or accrued (including those deemed to have been paid or accrued other than by reason of section 904(d)) to each foreign country or possession of the United States shall not exceed that proportion of the tax against which credit is taken which the taxpayer's taxable income from sources within such country or possession (but not in excess of the taxpayer's entire taxable income) bears to his entire taxable income for the same taxable year. For special rules regarding the application of the per-country limitation when the taxpayer has derived section 904(f) interest or section 904(f) dividends, see Sec. 1.904-4 or Sec. 1.904-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Illustration of principles.

For taxable year 1961 corporation X has taxable income of $275,000 of which $200,000 is from sources without the United States. The United States income tax is $137,500. During the taxable year corporation X pays or accrues to foreign countries $105,000 in income and profits taxes, consisting of $45,000 paid or accrued to foreign country Y and $60,000 to foreign country Z. The credit for such foreign taxes is limited to $100,000, i.e., 200,000 / 275,000 x $137,500. The limitation would be the same whether or not some portion of the $200,000 of the taxable income from sources without the United States is from sources on the high seas or in a foreign country (other than Y and Z) which imposed no taxes allowable as a credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Special computation of taxable income. For purposes of computing the limitations under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the taxable income in the case of an individual, estate, or trust shall be computed without any deduction for personal exemptions under section 151 or 642(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Election of overall limitation--(1) In general--(i) Manner of making election. The initial election under section 904(b) of the overall limitation provided by section 904(a)(2) may be made by the taxpayer for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1960, without securing the consent of the Commissioner. The taxpayer may, for the first taxable year for which the election is to be made, make such election at any time before the expiration of the period referred to in paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.901-1 for choosing the benefits of section 901 for such taxable year. Having made the initial election, the taxpayer may, within the time prescribed for making such election for such taxable year, revoke such election without the consent of the Commissioner. If such revocation is timely and properly made, the taxpayer may make his initial election of the overall limitation for a later taxable year without the consent of the Commissioner. If,

however, the taxpayer makes the initial election for a taxable year and the period prescribed for making such election for such taxable year expires, the taxpayer must continue the election of the overall limitation for all subsequent taxable years (whether or not foreign taxes were paid or accrued for any such year and notwithstanding that a deduction for foreign taxes under section 164 was claimed for any such year) until revoked with the consent of the Commissioner. See section 904(b)(1). If the election for any taxable year is revoked with the consent of the Commissioner, the taxpayer may not make a new election for such taxable year or for any subsequent taxable year without the consent of the Commissioner. If the election of the overall limitation is revoked for a taxable year, the per-country limitation shall apply to such taxable year and to all taxable years thereafter unless a new election of the overall limitation is made, either with or without the consent of the Commissioner in accordance with this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Revocation for first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969. Notwithstanding subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, if the taxpayer has made an initial election under section 904(b) of the overall limitation for a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970, and the period prescribed for making such election for such taxable year has expired, or if he has made a new election for such a taxable year with the consent of the Commissioner, he may revoke such election effective with respect to his first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, without the consent of the Commissioner. Such revocation may be made within the time prescribed for making an initial election for such first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969. If such revocation is timely and properly made, the taxpayer may make a new election of the overall limitation for a later taxable year without the consent of the Commissioner. Such new election for a later taxable year may be made at any time before the expiration of the period referred to in paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.901-1 for choosing the benefits of section 901 for such taxable year. The revocation of an election, or the making of a new election, pursuant to this subdivision shall be made in the same manner provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph for revoking or making an initial election. This subdivision applies even though the taxpayer is not required under section 901(e) and Sec. 1.901-3 to reduce the amount of any foreign taxes paid, accrued, or deemed to be paid with respect to foreign mineral income for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Method of making the initial election. The initial election of the overall limitation under section 904(b) shall be made on Form 1116 in the case of an individual or on Form 1118 in the case of a corporation. The form shall be attached to the appropriate income tax return for the taxable year to which such election applies. Such election may be made, however, only for a taxable year for which the taxpayer chooses to claim a credit under section 901. If the taxpayer revokes the initial election without the consent of the Commissioner, he must file amended Form 1116 or 1118 and amended income tax returns or claims for refund, where applicable, for the taxable years to which the revocation applies. For rules relating to the filing of such forms, see paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.905-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Method of revoking an election and making a new election. A request to revoke an election of the overall limitation under section 904(b) when such revocation requires the consent of the Commissioner, or to make a new election when such election requires the consent of the Commissioner, shall be in writing and shall be addressed to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, D.C. 20224. The request shall include the name and address of the taxpayer and shall be signed by the taxpayer or his duly authorized representative. It must specify the taxable year for which the revocation or new election is to be effective and shall be mailed within 75 days after the close of the first taxable year for which it is desired to make the change. It must be accompanied by a statement specifying the nature of the taxpayer's business, the countries in which the business is carried on, or expected to be carried

on, within the taxable year of the requested change, and grounds considered as justifying the requested revocation or new election. The Commissioner may require such other information as may be necessary in order to determine whether the proposed change will be permitted. Generally, a request for consent to revoke an election or make a new election will be granted if the basic nature of the taxpayer's business changes or if there are changes in conditions in a foreign country which substantially affect the taxpayer's business. For example, a taxpayer who enters substantial operations in a new foreign country or who loses an existing investment due to nationalization, expropriation, or war would be granted consent to revoke an election or make a new election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Joint return--(1) General. In the case of a husband and wife making a joint return, the applicable limitation prescribed by section 904(a) on the credit for taxes paid or accrued to foreign countries and possessions of the United States shall be applied with respect to the aggregate taxable income from sources within each such country or possession, or from sources without the United States, as the case may be, and the aggregate taxable income from all sources, of the spouses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Electing the overall limitation. If a husband and wife make a joint return for the current taxable year, but made a separate return for the preceding taxable year and the overall limitation applied for such preceding taxable year to one spouse or to both spouses (whether or not then married), then, unless revoked with the consent of the Commissioner, the overall limitation shall apply for the current taxable year and for subsequent taxable years of both spouses, whether or not they remain married, whether or not joint returns are filed for such subsequent taxable years, and whether or not one of such spouses could have elected the overall limitation for the current taxable year only with the consent of the Commissioner if he had filed a separate return for such year.

Sec. 1.904-2  Carryback and carryover of unused foreign tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Credit for foreign tax carryback or carryover. A taxpayer who chooses to claim a credit under section 901 for a taxable year is allowed a credit under that section not only for taxes otherwise allowable as a credit but also for taxes deemed paid or accrued in that year as a result of a carryback or carryover of an unused foreign tax under section 904(c). However, the taxes so deemed paid or accrued shall not be allowed as a deduction under section 164(a). Paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section and Sec. 1.904-3, providing rules for the computation of carryovers and carrybacks, do not reflect a number of intervening statutory amendments, including the redesignation of section 904(d) as section 904(c) for taxable years beginning after 1975, amendments to sections 904(d) and (f) regarding the application of separate limitations in taxable years beginning after 1986, the limitation of the carryback period to one year for unused foreign taxes arising in taxable years beginning after October 22, 2004, and the extension of the carryover period to ten years for unused foreign taxes that may be carried to any taxable year ending after October 22, 2004. However, the principles of paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section and Sec. 1.904-3(b) through (g) shall apply in determining carrybacks and carryovers of unused foreign taxes, modified so as to take into account the effect of statutory amendments. For transition rules relating to the carryover and carryback of unused foreign tax paid with respect to dividends from noncontrolled section 902 corporations, see paragraph (h) of this section.

preceding taxable year, and the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth succeeding taxable years, in that order and to the extent not absorbed as taxes deemed paid or accrued, under paragraph (c) of this section, in a prior taxable year. The entire unused foreign tax for any taxable year shall first be carried to the earliest of the taxable years to which, under the preceding sentence, such unused foreign tax may be carried. Any portion of such unused foreign tax not deemed paid or accrued under paragraph (c) of this section in such earliest taxable year shall then be carried to the next earliest taxable year to which such unused foreign tax may be carried, and any portion not absorbed in that year shall then be carried to the next earliest year, and so on.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definitions.

The unused foreign tax for 1961 and 1962 are not taken into account, since neither of those years is a year earlier than 1960, the year of origin in respect of which the excess limitation is being determined. Thus, for example, the excess limitation for 1963 is $200, unreduced by the unused foreign tax for 1961 and 1962. There is no excess limitation for 1966 with respect to the unused foreign tax for 1960, since the unused foreign tax may be carried forward only 5 taxable years. The unused foreign tax ($730) for 1960 is thus absorbed as taxes deemed paid to the extent of the excess limitation for each of the taxable years 1958, 1959, 1963, 1964, and 1965, respectively, and in that order,

The unused foreign tax for 1962 ($50) is not taken into account for such purposes, since that year is not a year earlier than 1961, the year of origin in respect of which the excess limitation for 1966 is being determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The excess limitation for 1966 with respect to the unused foreign tax for 1962 is $130, the amount by which the limitation applicable under section 904(a)(1) for 1966 ($600) exceeds the sum of the taxes actually paid ($400) to country X in that year and the unused foreign tax ($70) for 1961 which is absorbed in 1966 as taxes deemed paid and which is carried from a taxable year earlier than 1962, the year of origin in respect of which the excess limitation is being determined. The unabsorbed part ($80) of the unused foreign tax for 1960, a year earlier than 1962, is not taken into account in computing the excess limitation for 1966, since the unused foreign tax for 1960 may not be carried beyond 1965. The unused foreign tax ($50) for 1962 is thus absorbed in full in 1966 as taxes deemed paid, since the unused foreign tax does not exceed the excess limitation ($130) for that year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as those in example 1 except that the taxpayer does not choose to have the benefits of section 901 for 1961. In that case there is no unused foreign tax for that year to carry back or over to be absorbed in other taxable years as taxes deemed paid. Moreover, the excess limitation for 1966 which is available to absorb the unused foreign tax for 1962 is $200, instead of $130, that is, the amount by which the limitation applicable under section 904(a)(1) for 1966 ($600) exceeds the taxes actually paid ($400) to country X in that year. The amount of the unused foreign tax absorbed in each taxable year as taxes deemed paid is the same as in example 1 except for 1966.

Since the excess limitation for a taxable year for which the taxpayer does not claim a credit under section 901 is determined in the same manner as though the taxpayer had chosen such credit, the excess limitation for 1959 is determined to be $90 just as in example 1. Moreover, even though such excess limitation absorbs a carryback of $90 from the unused tax for 1960, none of such $90 so deemed paid in 1959 is allowed as a deduction under section 164 or as a credit under section 901 for 1959 or for any other taxable year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4.

To the extent any such unused foreign taxes are carried forward to a taxable year of a domestic shareholder beginning on or after the first day of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, such taxes shall be allocated among the taxpayer's separate categories in the same proportions as the related dividend would have been assigned had such dividend been eligible for look-through treatment when paid. Accordingly, the taxes shall be allocated in the same percentages as the reconstructed earnings in the noncontrolled section 902 corporation's non-look-through pool and pre-1987 accumulated profits that were accumulated in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2003, out of which the dividend was paid, in accordance with the rules of Sec. 1.904-7(f), or, if the taxpayer uses the safe harbor method of Sec. 1.904-7(f)(4)(ii), in the same percentages as the taxpayer properly

characterizes the stock of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation for purposes of apportioning its interest expense in its first taxable year ending after the first day of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002. See Sec. 1.904-7(f)(2) and (4). In the case of unused foreign taxes allocable to dividends from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation with respect to which the taxpayer was no longer a domestic shareholder (as defined in Sec. 1.902-1(a)) as of the first day of such taxable year, such taxes shall be allocated among the taxpayer's separate categories in the same percentages as the earnings in the noncontrolled section 902 corporation's non-look-through pool or pre-1987 accumulated profits would have been assigned had they been distributed and eligible for look-through treatment in the last taxable year in which the taxpayer was a domestic shareholder in such corporation. The unused foreign taxes that are carried forward shall be treated as allocable to general limitation income to the extent that such taxes would otherwise have been allocable to passive income, either on a look-through basis or as a result of inadequate substantiation under the rules of Sec. 1.904-7(f)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Carryback of unused foreign tax.

See 26 CFR Sec. 1.904-2T(h)(2) (revised as of April 1, 2009) for rules applicable to such unused foreign taxes with respect to a dividend from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation paid in a taxable year of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation beginning after December 31, 2002 and ending before April 20, 2009, which dividends were eligible for look-through treatment. To the extent any such unused foreign taxes are carried back to a prior taxable year of a domestic shareholder, a credit for such taxes shall be allowed only to the extent of the excess limitation in the same separate category or categories to which the related look-through dividend was assigned and not in any separate category for dividends from noncontrolled section 902 corporations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Transition rules for carryovers and carrybacks of pre-2007 and post-2006 unused foreign tax--(1) Carryover of unused foreign tax--(i) General rule. For purposes of this paragraph (i), the terms post-2006 separate category and pre-2007 separate category have the meanings set forth in Sec. 1.904-7(g)(1)(ii) and (iii). The rules of this paragraph (i)(1) apply to reallocate to the taxpayer's post-2006 separate categories for general category income and passive category income any unused foreign taxes (as defined in Sec. 1.904-2(b)(2)) that were paid or accrued or deemed paid under section 902 with respect to income in a pre-2007 separate category (other than a category described in Sec. 1.904-4(m)). To the extent any such unused foreign taxes are carried forward to a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2006, such taxes shall be allocated to the taxpayer's post-2006 separate categories to which those taxes would have been allocated if the taxes were paid or accrued in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2006. For example, any foreign taxes paid or accrued or deemed paid with respect to financial services income in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 2007, that are carried forward to a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2006, will be allocated to the general category because the financial services income to which those taxes relate would have been allocated to the general category if it had been earned in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2006.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Safe harbor.

A taxpayer may choose to use the safe harbor method on a timely filed (original or amended) tax return or during an audit. A taxpayer that uses the safe harbor method

on an amended return or in the course of an audit must make appropriate adjustments to eliminate any double benefit arising from application of the safe harbor method to years that are not open for assessment. A taxpayer's choice to use the safe harbor method is evidenced by employing the method.

The rules of this paragraph (i)(2) apply to any unused foreign taxes that were paid or accrued or deemed paid under section 902 with respect to income in a post-2006 separate category (other than a category described in Sec. 1.904-4(m)). To the extent any such unused foreign taxes are carried back to a taxable year beginning before January 1, 2007, a credit for such taxes shall be allowed only to the extent of the excess limitation in the pre-2007 separate category, or categories, to which the taxes would have been allocated if the taxes were paid or accrued in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 2007. For example, any foreign taxes paid or accrued or deemed paid with respect to income in the general category in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2006, that are carried back to a taxable year beginning before January 1, 2007, will be allocated to the same separate categories to which the income would have been allocated if such income had been earned in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 2007.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Safe harbor. In lieu of applying the rules of paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section, a taxpayer may allocate all unused foreign taxes in the post-2006 separate category for passive category income to the pre-2007 separate category for passive income, and may allocate all other unused foreign taxes described in paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section to the pre-2007 separate category for general limitation income. A taxpayer may choose to use the safe harbor method on a timely filed (original or amended) tax return or during an audit. A taxpayer that uses the safe harbor method on an amended return or in the course of an audit must make appropriate adjustments to eliminate any double benefit arising from application of the safe harbor method to years that are not open for assessment.

the unused foreign tax to the current taxable year, the separate carrybacks or separate carryovers shall be a joint carryback or a joint carryover to the current taxable year. If for such current year the per-country limitation applies, then only the unused foreign tax for a taxable year of a spouse for which the per-country limitation applied to such spouse may constitute a carryover or carryback to the current taxable year. If for such current taxable year the overall limitation applies, then only the unused foreign tax for a taxable year of a spouse for which the overall limitation applied to such spouse may constitute a carryover or carryback to the current taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Amounts carried from or through a joint return year to or through a separate return year.

In such cases, the separate carryback or carryover of each spouse to the current taxable year shall be computed in the manner described in Sec. 1.904-2 but with the modifications set forth in paragraph (f) of this section. Where applicable, appropriate adjustments shall be made to take into account the fact that, for any taxable year involved in the computation of the carryback or the carryover, either spouse has interest income described in section 904(f)(2) with respect to which the provisions of section 904(f) and Sec. 1.904-4 apply, or dividends described in section 904(f)(1)(B) with respect to which the provisions of section 904(f) and Sec. 1.904-5 apply, or foreign oil related income described in section 907(c) with respect to which the separate limitation in section 907(b) applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Allocation of unused foreign tax and excess limitation--(1) Limitation--(i) Per-country limitation. The per-country limitation of a particular spouse with respect to a foreign country or United States possession for a taxable year for which a joint return is made shall be the portion of the limitation on the joint return which bears the same ratio to such limitation as such spouse's taxable income (with gross income and deductions taken into account to the same extent as taken into account on the joint return) from sources within such country or possession (but not in excess of the joint taxable income from sources within such country or possession) bears to the joint taxable income from such sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Overall limitation. The overall limitation of a particular spouse for a taxable year for which a joint return is made shall be the portion of the limitation on the joint return which bears the same ratio to such limitation as such spouse's taxable income (with gross income and deductions taken into account to the same extent as taken into account on the joint return) from sources without the United States (but not in excess of the joint taxable income from such sources) bears to the joint taxable income from such sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Unused foreign tax--(i) Per-country limitation.

The unused foreign tax of a particular spouse for a taxable year to which the overall limitation applies and for which a joint return is made shall be the excess of his tax paid or accrued to foreign countries and United States possessions over his limitation determined under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Excess limitation--(i) Per-country limitation taxpayer.

A spouse's excess limitation for a taxable year to which the overall limitation applies and for which a joint return is made shall be the excess of his limitation determined under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph over his taxes paid or accrued to foreign countries and United States possessions for such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Excess limitation to be applied. The excess limitation of the particular spouse for any taxable year which is applied against the unused foreign tax of that spouse for another taxable year in order to determine the amount of the unused foreign tax which shall be carried back or over to a third taxable year shall be, in a case in which the excess limitation is determined on a joint return, the sum of the following amounts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Such spouse's excess limitation determined under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph reduced as provided in subparagraph (5)(i) of this paragraph, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The excess limitation of the other spouse determined under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph for that taxable year reduced as provided in subparagraphs (5) (i) and (ii) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Reduction of excess limitation.

If an unused foreign tax is carried through a taxable year for which spouses made a joint return and the credit under section 901 for such taxable year is not claimed, and in the prior taxable year separate returns are made in which the per-country limitation applies to one spouse and the overall limitation applies to the other spouse, the amount treated as absorbed in the taxable year for which a joint return is made--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> With respect to the spouse for which the per-country limitation applies shall be determined on the basis of the excess limitation which would be allocated to such spouse under subparagraph (3)(i) of this paragraph had the per-country limitation applied for such year to both spouses;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> With respect to the other spouse for which the overall limitation applies shall be determined on the basis of the excess limitation which would be allocated to such spouse under subparagraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph had the overall limitation applied for such year to both spouses.

Sec. 1.904-4  Separate application of section 904 with respect to certain categories of income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. A taxpayer is required to compute a separate foreign tax credit limitation for income received or accrued in a taxable year that is described in section 904(d)(1)(A) (passive category income), 904(d)(1)(B) (general category income), or Sec. 1.904-4(m) (additional separate categories).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Passive category income--(1) In general. The term passive category income means passive income and specified passive category income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Passive income--(i) In general. The term passive income means any--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Income received or accrued by any person that is of a kind that would be foreign personal holding company income (as defined in section 954(c)) if the taxpayer were a controlled foreign corporation, including any amount of gain on the sale or exchange of stock in excess of the amount treated as a dividend under section 1248; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Amount includible in gross income under section 1293.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exceptions. Passive income does not include any export financing interest (as defined in section 904(d)(2)(G) and paragraph (h) of this section), any high-taxed income (as defined in section 904(d)(2)(F) and paragraph (c) of this section), or any active rents and royalties (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section). In addition, passive income does not include any income that would otherwise be passive but is characterized as income in another separate category under the look-through rules of section 904(d)(3), (d)(4), and (d)(6)(C) and the regulations under those provisions. In determining whether any income is of a kind that would be foreign personal holding company income, the rules of section 864(d)(5)(A)(i) and (6) (treating related person factoring income of a controlled foreign corporation as foreign personal holding company income that is not eligible for the export financing income exception to the separate limitation for passive income) shall apply only in the case of income of a controlled foreign corporation (as defined in section 957). Thus, income earned directly by a United States person that is related

person factoring income may be eligible for the exception for export financing interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Active rents or royalties--(A) In general. For rents and royalties paid or accrued after September 20, 2004, passive income does not include any rents or royalties that are derived in the active conduct of a trade or business, regardless of whether such rents or royalties are received from a related or an unrelated person. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, the principles of section 954(c)(2)(A) and the regulations under that section shall apply in determining whether rents or royalties are derived in the active conduct of a trade or business. For this purpose, the term taxpayer shall be substituted for the term controlled foreign corporation if the recipient of the rents or royalties is not a controlled foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Active conduct of trade or business. Rents and royalties are considered derived in the active conduct of a trade or business by a United States person or by a controlled foreign corporation (or other entity to which the look-through rules apply) for purposes of section 904 (but not for purposes of section 954) if the requirements of section 954(c)(2)(A) are satisfied by one or more corporations that are members of an affiliated group of corporations (within the meaning of section 1504(a), determined without regard to section 1504(b)(3)) of which the recipient is a member. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B), an affiliated group includes only domestic corporations and foreign corporations that are controlled foreign corporations in which domestic members of the affiliated group own, directly or indirectly, at least 80 percent of the total voting power and value of the stock. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B), indirect ownership shall be determined under section 318 and the regulations under that section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. P is a domestic corporation with a branch in foreign country X. P does not have any financial services income. For 2008, P has a net foreign currency gain that would not constitute foreign personal holding company income if P were a controlled foreign corporation because the gain is directly related to the business needs of P. The currency gain is, therefore, general category income to P because it is not income of a kind that would be foreign personal holding company income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Controlled foreign corporation S is a wholly-owned subsidiary of P, a domestic corporation. S is regularly engaged in the restaurant franchise business. P licenses trademarks, tradenames, certain know-how, related services, and certain restaurant designs for which S pays P an arm's length royalty. P is regularly engaged in the development and licensing of such property. The royalties received by P for the use of its property are allocable under the look-through rules of Sec. 1.904-5 to the royalties S receives from the franchisees. Some of the franchisees are unrelated to S and P. Other franchisees are related to S or P and use the licensed property outside of S's country of incorporation. S does not satisfy, but P does satisfy, the active trade or business requirements of section 954(c)(2)(A) and the regulations under that section. The royalty income earned by S with regard to both its related and unrelated franchisees is foreign personal holding company income because S does not satisfy the active trade or business requirements of section 954(c)(2)(A) and, in addition, the royalty income from the related franchisees does not qualify for the same country exception of section 954(c)(3). However, all of the royalty income earned by S is general category income to S under Sec. 1.904-4(b)(2)(iii) because P, a member of S's affiliated group (as defined therein), satisfies the active trade or business test (which is applied without regard to whether the royalties are paid by a related person). S's royalty income that is taxable to P under subpart F and the royalties paid to P are general category income to P under the look-through rules of Sec. 1.904-5(c)(1)(i) and (c)(3), respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Specified passive category income means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Dividends from a DISC or former DISC (as defined in section 992(a)) to the extent such dividends are treated as income from sources without the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Taxable income attributable to foreign trade income (within the meaning of section 923(b)); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Distributions from a FSC (or a former FSC) out of earnings and profits attributable to foreign trade income (within the meaning of section 923(b)) or interest or carrying charges (as defined in section 927(d)(1)) derived from a transaction which results in foreign

trade income (as defined in section 923(b)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> High-taxed income--(1) In general. Income received or accrued by a United States person that would otherwise be passive income shall not be treated as passive income if the income is determined to be high-taxed income. Income shall be considered to be high-taxed income if, after allocating expenses, losses and other deductions of the United States person to that income under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the sum of the foreign income taxes paid or accrued by the United States person with respect to such income and the foreign taxes deemed paid or accrued by the United States person with respect to such income under section 902 or section 960 exceeds the highest rate of tax specified in section 1 or 11, whichever applies (and with reference to section 15 if applicable), multiplied by the amount of such income (including the amount treated as a dividend under section 78). If, after application of this paragraph (c), income that would otherwise be passive income is determined to be high-taxed income, such income shall be treated as general category income, and any taxes imposed on that income shall be considered related to general category income under Sec. 1.904-6. If, after application of this paragraph (c), passive income is zero or less than zero, any taxes imposed on the passive income shall be considered related to general category income. For additional rules regarding losses related to passive income, see paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Income and taxes shall be translated at the appropriate rates, as determined under sections 986, 987 and 989 and the regulations under those sections, before application of this paragraph (c). For purposes of allocating taxes to groups of income, United States source passive income is treated as any other passive income. In making the determination whether income is high-taxed, however, only foreign source income, as determined under United States tax principles, is relevant. See paragraph (c)(8) Examples 10 through 13 of this section for examples illustrating the application of this paragraph (c)(1) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section. This paragraph (c)(1) is applicable for taxable years beginning after March 12, 1999.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Grouping of items of income in order to determine whether passive income is high-taxed income</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Grouping rules--Initial allocation and apportionment of deductions and taxes. For purposes of determining whether passive income is high-taxed, expenses, losses and other deductions shall be allocated and apportioned initially to each of the groups of passive income (described in paragraphs (c)(3), (4), and (5) of this section) under the rules of Sec. Sec. 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T and 1.865-1 through 1.865-2. Taxpayers that allocate and apportion interest expense on an asset basis may nevertheless apportion passive interest expense among the groups of passive income on a gross income basis. Foreign taxes are allocated to groups under the rules of Sec. 1.904-6(a)(1)(iii). If a loss on a disposition of property gives rise to foreign tax (i.e., the transaction giving rise to the loss is treated under foreign law as having given rise to a gain), the foreign tax shall be allocated to the group of passive income to which gain on the sale would have been assigned under paragraph (c)(3) or (4) of this section. A determination of whether passive income is high-taxed shall be made only after application of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section (if applicable).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reallocation of loss groups. If, after allocation and apportionment of expenses, losses and other deductions under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the sum of the allocable deductions exceeds the gross income in one or more groups, the excess deductions shall proportionately reduce income in the other groups (but not below zero).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Amounts received or accrued by United States persons. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, all passive income received by a United States person shall be subject to the rules of this paragraph (c)(3). However, subpart F inclusions that are passive income, dividends from a controlled foreign corporation or noncontrolled section 902 corporation that are passive income, and income that is earned by a United States person through a foreign QBU that is passive income shall be subject to the rules of

this paragraph only to the extent provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. For purposes of this section, a foreign QBU is a qualified business unit (as defined in section 989(a)), other than a controlled foreign corporation or noncontrolled section 902 corporation, that has its principal place of business outside the United States. These rules shall apply whether the income is received from a controlled foreign corporation of which the United States person is a United States shareholder, from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation of which the United States person is a domestic corporation meeting the stock ownership requirements of section 902(a), or from any other person. For purposes of determining whether passive income is high-taxed income, the following rules apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All passive income received during the taxable year that is subject to a withholding tax of fifteen percent or greater shall be treated as one item of income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All passive income received during the taxable year that is subject to a withholding tax of less than fifteen percent (but greater than zero) shall be treated as one item of income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> All passive income received during the taxable year that is subject to no withholding tax or other foreign tax shall be treated as one item of income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> All passive income received during the taxable year that is subject to no withholding tax but is subject to a foreign tax other than a withholding tax shall be treated as one item of income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Dividends and inclusions from controlled foreign corporations, dividends from noncontrolled section 902 corporations, and income of foreign QBUs. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, all dividends and all amounts included in gross income of a United States shareholder under section 951(a)(1) with respect to the foreign corporation that (after application of the look-through rules of section 904(d)(3) and Sec. 1.904-5) are attributable to passive income received or accrued by a controlled foreign corporation, all dividends from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation that are received or accrued by a domestic corporate shareholder meeting the stock ownership requirements of section 902(a) that (after application of the look-through rules of section 904(d)(4) and Sec. 1.904-5) are treated as passive income, and all amounts of passive income received or accrued by a United States person through a foreign QBU shall be subject to the rules of this paragraph (c)(4). This paragraph (c)(4) shall be applied separately to dividends and inclusions with respect to each controlled foreign corporation of which the taxpayer is a United States shareholder and to dividends with respect to each noncontrolled section 902 corporation of which the taxpayer is a domestic corporate shareholder meeting the stock ownership requirements of section 902(a). This paragraph (c)(4) also shall be applied separately to income attributable to each foreign QBU of a controlled foreign corporation, noncontrolled section 902 corporation, or any other look-through entity as defined in Sec. 1.904-5(i), except that if the entity subject to the look-through rules is a United States person, then this paragraph (c)(4) shall be applied separately only to each foreign QBU of that United States person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Income from sources within the QBU's country of operation. Passive income from sources within the QBU's country of operation shall be treated as one item of income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Income from sources without the QBU's country of operation.

All items of rent or royalty income to which an item of rent or royalty expense is directly allocable shall be treated as a single item of income and shall not be grouped with other amounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Treatment of partnership income. A partner's distributive share of income

from a foreign or United States partnership that is not subject to the look-through rules and that is treated as passive income under Sec. 1.904-5(h)(2)(i) (generally providing that a less than 10 percent partner's distributive share of partnership income is passive income) shall be treated as a single item of income and shall not be grouped with other amounts. A distributive share of income from a foreign partnership that is treated as passive income under the look-through rules shall be grouped according to the rules in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. A distributive share of income from a United States partnership that is treated as passive income under the look-through rules shall be grouped according to the rules in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, except that the portion, if any, of the distributive share of income attributable to income earned by a United States partnership through a foreign QBU shall be grouped under the rules of paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Currency gain or loss--(A) Section 986(c). Any currency gain or loss with respect to a distribution received by a United States shareholder (other than a foreign QBU of that shareholder) of previously taxed earnings and profits that is recognized under section 986(c) and that is treated as an item of passive income shall be subject to the rules provided in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section. If that item, however, is received or accrued by a foreign QBU of the United States shareholder, it shall be treated as an item of passive income from sources within the QBU's country of operation for purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section. This paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(A) shall be applied separately for each foreign QBU of a United States shareholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Section 987(3).

If that item, however, is received or accrued by a foreign QBU of the United States shareholder, it shall be treated as an item of passive income from sources within the QBU's country of operation for purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section. This paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B) shall be applied separately for each foreign QBU of a United States shareholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (c)(5)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">Example. P, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of S, a controlled foreign corporation that uses x as its functional currency. In 1993, S earns 100x of passive foreign personal holding company income. When included in P's income under subpart F, the exchange rate is 1x equals $1. Therefore, P's subpart F inclusion is $100. At the end of 1993, S has previously taxed earnings and profits of 100x and P's basis in those earnings is $100. In 1994, S has no earnings and distributes 100x to P. The value of the earnings when distributed is $150. Assume that under section 986(c), P must recognize $50 of passive income attributable to the appreciation of the previously taxed income. Country X does not recognize any gain or loss on the distribution. Therefore, the section 986(c) gain is not subject to any foreign withholding tax or other foreign tax. Thus, under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, the section 986(c) gain shall be grouped with other items of P's income that are subject to no withholding tax or other foreign tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Coordination with section 954(b)(4). For rules relating to passive income of a controlled foreign corporation that is exempt from subpart F treatment because the income is subject to high foreign tax, see section 904(d)(3)(E), Sec. 1.904-4(c)(7)(iii), and Sec. 1.904-5(d)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Application of this paragraph to additional taxes paid or deemed paid in the year of receipt of previously taxed income--(i) Determination made in year of inclusion. The determination of whether an amount included in gross income under section 951(a) is high-taxed income shall be made in the taxable year the income is included in the gross income of the United States shareholder under section 951(a) (hereinafter the ``taxable year of inclusion''). Any increase in foreign taxes paid or accrued, or deemed paid or accrued, when the taxpayer receives an amount that is excluded from gross income under section 959(a) and that is attributable to a controlled foreign corporation's earnings and profits relating to the amount previously included in gross income will not be considered in determining

whether the amount included in income in the taxable year of inclusion is high-taxed income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exception. Paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section shall not apply to an increase in tax in a case in which the taxpayer is required to adjust its foreign taxes in the year of inclusion under section 905(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Allocation of foreign taxes imposed on distributions of previously taxed income. If an item of income is considered high-taxed income in the year of inclusion and paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section applies, then any increase in foreign income taxes imposed with respect to that item shall be considered to be related to general category income. If an item of income is not considered to be high-taxed income in the taxable year of inclusion and paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section applies, the following rules shall apply. The taxpayer shall treat an increase in taxes paid or accrued, or deemed paid or accrued, on any distribution of the earnings and profits attributable to the amount included in gross income in the taxable year of inclusion as taxes related to passive income to the extent of the excess of the product of (A) the highest rate of tax in section 11 (determined with regard to section 15 and determined as of the year of inclusion) and (B) the amount of the inclusion (after allocation of parent expenses) over (C) the taxes paid or accrued, or deemed paid or accrued, in the year of inclusion. The taxpayer shall treat any taxes paid or accrued, or deemed paid or accrued, on the distribution in excess of this amount as taxes related to general category income. If these additional taxes are not creditable in the year of distribution the carryover rules of section 904(c) apply. For purposes of this paragraph, the foreign tax on a subpart F inclusion shall be considered increased on distribution of the earnings and profits associated with that inclusion if the total of taxes paid and deemed paid on the inclusion and the distribution (taking into account any reductions in tax and any withholding taxes) is greater than the total taxes deemed paid in the year of inclusion. Any foreign currency loss associated with the earnings and profits that are distributed with respect to the inclusion is not to be considered as giving rise to an increase in tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Increase in taxes paid by successors--(A) General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(6)(iv)(B) of this section, if passive earnings and profits previously included in income of a United States shareholder are distributed to a person that was not a United States shareholder of the distributing corporation in the year the earnings were included, any increase in foreign taxes paid or accrued, or deemed paid or accrued, on that distribution shall be treated as taxes related to general category income, regardless of whether the previously-taxed income was considered high-taxed income under section 904(d)(2)(F) in the year of inclusion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Exception. For a special rule applicable to distributions prior to August 6, 1997, to U.S. shareholders not entitled to look-through treatment, see 26 CFR 1.904-4(c)(6)(iv)(B) (revised as of April 1, 2006).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Effective date. This paragraph (c)(6)(iv) applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986. However, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2001, taxpayers may rely on Sec. 1.904-4(c)(6)(iv) of regulations project INTL-1-92, published at 1992-1 C.B. 1209. See Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Application of this paragraph to certain reductions of tax on distributions of income--(i) In general. If the effective rate of tax imposed by a foreign country on income of a foreign corporation that is included in a taxpayer's gross income is reduced under foreign law on distribution of such income, the rules of this paragraph (c) apply at the time that the income is included in the taxpayer's gross income without regard to the possibility of subsequent reduction of foreign tax on the distribution. If the inclusion is considered to be high-taxed income, then the taxpayer shall treat the inclusion as general category income. When the foreign corporation distributes the earnings and profits to which the inclusion was attributable and the foreign tax on the inclusion is reduced, then the taxpayer shall redetermine whether the inclusion should be considered to be high-taxed income provided that a redetermination of United States tax liability is required

under section 905(c). If, taking into account the reduction in foreign tax, the inclusion would not have been considered high-taxed income, then the taxpayer, in redetermining its United States tax liability for the year or years affected, shall treat the inclusion and the associated taxes (as reduced on the distribution) as passive income and taxes. See section 905(c) and the regulations thereunder regarding the method of adjustment. For this purpose, the foreign tax on a subpart F inclusion shall be considered reduced on distribution of the earnings and profits associated with the inclusion if the total of taxes paid and deemed paid on the inclusion and the distribution (taking into account any reductions in tax and any withholding taxes) is less that the total taxes deemed paid in the year of inclusion. Any foreign currency gain associated with the earnings and profits that are distributed with respect to the inclusion is not to be considered a reduction of tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Allocation of reductions of foreign tax. For purposes of paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section, reductions in foreign tax shall be allocated among the separate categories under the same principles as those of Sec. 1.904-6 for allocating taxes among the separate categories. Thus, for purposes of determining to which year's taxes the reduction in taxes relates, foreign law shall apply. If, however, foreign law does not attribute a reduction in taxes to a particular year or years, then the reduction in taxes shall be attributable, on an annual last in-first out (LIFO) basis, to foreign taxes potentially subject to reduction that are associated with previously taxed income, then on a LIFO basis to foreign taxes associated with income that under paragraph (c)(7)(iii) of this section remains as passive income but that was excluded from subpart F income under section 954(b)(4), and finally on a LIFO basis to foreign taxes associated with other earnings and profits. Furthermore, in applying the ordering rules of section 959(c), distributions shall be considered made on a LIFO basis first out of earnings described in section 959(c) (1) and (2), then on a LIFO basis out of earnings and profits associated with income that remains passive income under paragraph (c)(7)(iii) of this section but that was excluded from subpart F under section 954(b)(4), and finally on a LIFO basis out of other earnings and profits. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(7)(ii), foreign law is not considered to attribute a reduction in tax to a particular year or years if foreign law attributes the tax reduction to a pool or group containing income from more than one taxable year and such pool or group is defined based on a characteristic of the income (for example, the rate of tax paid with respect to the income) rather than on the taxable year in which the income is derived.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Interaction with section 954(b)(4). If the effective rate of tax imposed by a foreign country on income of a foreign corporation is reduced under foreign law on distribution of that income, the rules of section 954(b)(4) shall be applied without regard to the possibility of subsequent reduction of foreign tax. If a taxpayer excludes passive income from a controlled foreign corporation's foreign personal holding company income under these circumstances, then, notwithstanding the general rule of Sec. 1.904-5(d)(2), the income shall be considered to be passive income until distribution of that income. At that time, the rules of this paragraph shall apply to determine whether the income is high-taxed income and, therefore, general category income. For purposes of determining whether a reduction in tax is attributable to taxes on income excluded under section 954(b)(4), the rules of paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section apply. The rules of paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section shall apply for purposes of ordering distributions to determine whether such distributions are out of earnings and profits associated with such excluded income. For an example illustrating the operation of this paragraph (c)(7)(iii), see paragraph (c)(8) Example (7) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Controlled foreign corporation S is a wholly-owned subsidiary of domestic corporation P. S is a single qualified business unit (QBU) operating in foreign country

X. In 1988, S earns $130 of gross passive royalty income from country X sources, and incurs $30 of expenses that do not include any payments to P. S's $100 of net passive royalty income is subject to $30 of foreign tax, and is included under section 951 in P's gross income for the taxable year. P allocates $50 of expenses to the $100 (consisting of the $70 section 951 inclusion and $30 section 78 amount), resulting in a net inclusion of $50. After application of the high-tax kick-out rules of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the $50 inclusion is treated as general category income, and the $30 of taxes deemed paid are treated as taxes imposed on general category income, because the foreign taxes paid and deemed paid on the income exceed the highest United States tax rate multiplied by the $50 inclusion ($30$17 (.34 x $50)).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example (1) except that instead of earning $130 of gross passive royalty income, S earns $65 of gross passive royalty income from country X sources and $65 of gross passive interest income from country Y sources. S incurs $15 of expenses and $5 of foreign tax with regard to the royalty income and incurs $15 of expenses and $10 of foreign tax with regard to the interest income. P allocates $50 of expenses pro rata to the $50 inclusion ($45 section 951 inclusion and $5 section 78 amount) attributable to the royalty income earned by S and the $50 inclusion ($40 section 951 inclusion and $10 section 78 amount) attributable to the interest income earned by S. Under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the high-tax test is applied separately to the section 951 inclusion attributable to the income from X sources and the section 951 inclusion attributable to the income from Y sources. Therefore, after allocation of P's $50 of expenses, the resulting $25 inclusion attributable to the royalty income from X sources is still treated as passive income because the foreign taxes paid and deemed paid on the income do not exceed the highest United States tax rate multiplied by the $25 inclusion ($5<$8.50 (.34 x $25)). The $25 inclusion attributable to the interest income from Y sources is treated as general category income because the foreign taxes paid and deemed paid exceed the highest United States tax rate multiplied by the $25 inclusion ($10$8.50 (.34 x $25)).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Controlled foreign corporation S is a whollyowned subsidiary of domestic corporation P. S is incorporated and operating in country Y and has a branch in country Z. S has two QBUs (QBU Y and QBU Z). In 1988, S earns $65 of gross passive royalty income in country Y through QBU Y and $65 of gross passive royalty income in country Z through QBU Z. S allocates $15 of expenses to the gross passive royalty income earned by each QBU, resulting in net income of $50 in each QBU. Country Y imposes $5 of foreign tax on the royalty income earned in Y, and country Z imposes $10 of tax on royalty income earned in Z. All of S's income constitutes subpart F foreign personal holding company income that is passive income and is included in P's gross income for the taxable year. P allocates $50 of expenses pro rata to the $100 subpart F inclusion attributable to the QBUs (consisting of the $45 section 951 inclusion derived through QBU Y, the $5 section 78 amount attributable to QBU Y, the $40 section 951 inclusion derived through QBU Z, and the $10 section 78 amount attributable to QBU Z), resulting in a net inclusion of $50. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the high-tax kickout rules must be applied separately to the subpart F inclusion attributable to the income earned by QBU Y and the income earned by QBU Z. After application of the high-tax kickout rules, the $25 inclusion attributable to Y will still be treated as passive income because the foreign taxes paid and deemed paid on the income do not exceed the highest United States tax rate multiplied by the $25 inclusion ($5<$8.50 (.34 x $25)). The $25 inclusion attributable to Z will be treated as general category income because the foreign taxes paid and deemed paid on the income exceed the highest United States tax rate multiplied by the $25 inclusion ($10<=$8.50 (.34 x $25)).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Domestic corporation M operates in branch form in foreign countries X and Y. The branches are qualified business units (QBUs), within the meaning of section 989(a). In 1988, QBU X earns passive royalty income, interest income and rental income. All of the QBU X passive income is from Country Z sources. The royalty income is not subject to a withholding tax, and is not taxed by Country X, and the interest and the rental income are subject to a 4 percent and 10 percent withholding tax, respectively. QBU Y earns interest income in Country Y that is not subject to foreign tax. For purposes of determining whether M's foreign source passive income is high-taxed income, the rental income and the interest income earned in QBU X are treated as one item of income pursuant to paragraphs (c) (4)(ii) and (3)(ii) of this section. The interest income earned in QBU Y and the royalty income earned in QBU X are each treated as a separate item of income under paragraphs (c)(4)(i) (with respect to QBU Y's interest income) and (c) (4)(ii) and (3)(iii) (with respect to QBU X's royalty income) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. S, a controlled foreign corporation incorporated in foreign country R, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of P, a domestic corporation. For 1988, P is required under section 951(a) to include in gross income $80 (not including the section 78 amount) attributable to the earnings and profits of S for such year, all of which is foreign personal holding company income that is passive rent or royalty income. S does not make any distributions in 1988 or 1989. Foreign income

taxes paid by S for 1988 that are deemed paid by P for such year under section 960(a) with respect to the section 951(a) inclusion equal $20. Twenty dollars ($20) of P's expenses are properly allocated to the section 951(a) inclusion. The foreign income tax paid with respect to the section 951(a) inclusion does not exceed the highest United States tax rate multiplied by the amount of income after allocation of parent expenses ($20<$27.20 (.34 x $80)). Thus, P's section 951(a) inclusion for 1988 is included in P's passive income and the $20 of taxes attributable to that inclusion are treated as taxes related to passive income. In 1990, S distributes $80 to P, and under section 959 that distribution is treated as attributable to the earnings and profits with respect to the amount included in income by P in 1988 and is excluded from P's gross income. Foreign country R imposes a withholding tax of $15 on the distribution in 1990. Under paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, the withholding tax in 1990 does not affect the characterization of the 1988 inclusion as passive income nor does it affect the characterization of the $20 of taxes paid in 1988 as taxes paid with respect to passive income. No further parent expenses are allocable to the receipt of that distribution. In 1990, the foreign taxes paid ($15) exceed the product of the highest United States tax rate and the amount of the inclusion reduced by taxes deemed paid in the year of inclusion ($15((.34 x $80)-$20)). Thus, under paragraph (c)(6)(iii) of this section, $7.20 ((.34 x $80)-$20)) of the $15 withholding tax paid in 1990 is treated as taxes related to passive income and the remaining $7.80 ($15-$7.20) of the withholding tax is treated as related to general category income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. S, a controlled foreign corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of P, a domestic corporation. P and S are calendar year taxpayers. In 1987, S's only earnings consist of $200 of passive income that is foreign personal holding company income that is earned in a foreign country X. Under country X's tax system, the corporate tax on particular earnings is reduced on distribution of those earnings and no withholding tax is imposed. In 1987, S pays $100 of foreign tax. P does not elect to exclude this income from subpart F under section 954(b)(4) and includes $200 in gross income ($100 of net foreign personal holding company income and $100 of the section 78 amount). At the time of the inclusion, the income is considered to be high-taxed income under paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(6)(i) of this section and is general category income to P. S does not distribute any of its earnings in 1987. In 1988, S has no earnings. On December 31, 1988, S distributes the $100 of earnings from 1987. At that time, S receives a $50 refund from X attributable to the reduction of the country X corporate tax imposed on those earnings. Under paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section, P must redetermine whether the 1987 inclusion should be considered to be high-taxed income. By taking into account the reduction in foreign tax, the inclusion would not have been considered high-taxed income. Therefore, P must redetermine its foreign tax credit for 1987 and treat the inclusion and the taxes associated with the inclusion as passive income and taxes. P must follow the appropriate section 905(c) procedures.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. The facts are the same as in Example 6 except that P elects to apply section 954(b)(4) to S's passive income that is subpart F income. Although the income is not considered to be subpart F income, it remains passive income until distribution. In 1988, S distributes $150 to P. The distribution is a dividend to P because S has $150 of accumulated earnings and profits (the $100 of earnings in 1987 and the $50 refund in 1988). P has no expenses allocable to the dividend from S. In 1988, the income is subject to the high-tax kick-out rules under paragraph (c)(7)(iii) of this section. The income is passive income to P because the foreign taxes paid and deemed paid by P with respect to the income do not exceed the highest United States tax rate on that income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. The facts are the same as in Example 6 except that the distribution in 1988 is subject to a withholding tax of $25. Under paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section, P must redetermine whether the 1987 inclusion should be considered to be high-taxed income because there is a net $25 reduction of foreign tax. By taking into account both the reduction in foreign corporate tax and the withholding tax, the inclusion would continue to be considered high-taxed income. P must follow the appropriate section 905(c) procedures. P must redetermine its foreign tax credit for 1987, but the inclusion and the $75 taxes ($50 of deemed paid tax and $25 withholding tax) will continue to be treated as general category income and taxes.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. (i) S, a controlled foreign corporation operating in country G, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of P, a domestic corporation. P and S are calendar year taxpayers. Country G imposes a tax of 50 percent on S's earnings. Under country G's system, the foreign corporate tax on particular earnings is reduced on distribution of those earnings to 30 percent and no withholding tax is imposed. Under country G's law, distributions are treated as made out of a pool of undistributed earnings subject to the 50 percent tax rate. For 1987, S's only earnings consist of passive income that is foreign personal holding company income that is earned in foreign country G. S has taxable income of $110 for United States purposes and $100 for country G purposes. Country G, therefore, imposes a tax of $50 on the 1987 earnings of S. P does not elect to exclude this income from subpart F under section 954(b)(4) and includes $110 in gross income ($60 of net foreign

personal holding company income and $50 of the section 78 amount). At the time of the inclusion, the income is considered to be high-taxed income under paragraph (c) of this section and is general category income to P. S does not distribute any of its taxable income in 1987.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In 1988, S earns general category income that is not subpart F income. S again has $110 in taxable income for United States purposes and $100 in taxable income for country G purposes, and S pays $50 of tax to foreign country G. In 1989, S has no taxable income or earnings. On December 31, 1989, S distributes $60 of earnings and receives a refund of foreign tax of $24. Country G treats the distribution of earnings as out of the 50% tax rate pool of earnings accumulated in 1987 and 1988. However, under paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section, the distribution, and, therefore, the reduction of tax is treated as first attributable to the $60 of passive earnings attributable to income previously taxed in 1987. However, because, under foreign law, only 40 percent (the reduction in tax rates from 50 percent to 30 percent is a 40 percent reduction in the tax) of the $50 of foreign taxes on the passive earnings can be refunded, $20 of the $24 foreign tax refund reduces foreign taxes on passive earnings. The other $4 of the tax refund reduces the general category taxes from $50 to $46 (even though for United States purposes the $60 distribution is entirely out of passive earnings).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under paragraph (c)(7) of this section, P must redetermine whether the 1987 inclusion should be considered to be high-taxed income. By taking into account the reduction in foreign tax, the inclusion would not have been considered high-taxed income ($30<.34 x $110). Therefore, P must redetermine its foreign tax credit for 1987 and treat the inclusion and the taxes associated with the inclusion as passive income and taxes. P must follow the appropriate section 905(c) procedures.</p><p class="depth0">Example 10. P, a domestic corporation, earns $100 of passive royalty income from sources within the United States. Under the laws of Country X, however, that royalty is considered to be from sources within Country X and Country X imposes a 10 percent withholding tax on the payment of the royalty. P also earns $100 of passive foreign source dividend income subject to a 10 percent withholding tax to which $15 of expenses are allocated. In determining whether P's passive income is high-taxed, the $10 withholding tax on P's royalty income is allocated to passive income, and within the passive category to the group of income described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section (passive income subject to a withholding tax of less than 15 percent (but greater than zero)). For purposes of determining whether the income is high-taxed, however, only the foreign source dividend income is taken into account. The foreign source dividend income will still be treated as passive income because the foreign taxes paid on the passive income in the group ($20) do not exceed the highest United States tax rate multiplied by the $85 of net foreign source income in the group ($20 is less than $28.90 ($100-$15) x .34).</p><p class="depth0">Example 11. In 2001, P, a U.S. citizen with a tax home in Country X, earns the following items of gross income: $400 of foreign source, passive limitation interest income not subject to foreign withholding tax but subject to Country X income tax of $100, $200 of foreign source, passive limitation royalty income subject to a 5 percent foreign withholding tax (foreign tax paid is $10), $1,300 of foreign source, passive limitation rental income subject to a 25 percent foreign withholding tax (foreign tax paid is $325), $500 of foreign source, general category income that gives rise to a $250 foreign tax, and $2,000 of U.S. source capital gain that is not subject to any foreign tax. P has a $900 deduction allocable to its passive rental income. P's only other deduction is a $700 capital loss on the sale of stock that is allocated to foreign source passive limitation income under Sec. 1.865-2(a)(3)(i). The $700 capital loss is initially allocated to the group of passive income subject to no withholding tax but subject to foreign tax other than withholding tax. The $300 amount by which the capital loss exceeds the income in the group must be reapportioned to the other groups under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. The royalty income is thus reduced by $100 to $100 ($200 - ($300 x (200/600))) and the rental income is thus reduced by $200 to $200 ($400 - ($300 x (400/600))). The $100 royalty income is not high-taxed and remains passive income because the foreign taxes do not exceed the highest United States rate of tax on that income. Under the high-tax kick-out, the $200 of rental income and the $325 of associated foreign tax are assigned to the general category category.</p><p class="depth0">Example 12. The facts are the same as in Example 11 except the amount of the capital loss that is allocated under Sec. 1.865-2(a)(3)(i) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section to the group of foreign source passive income subject to no withholding tax but subject to foreign tax other than withholding tax is $1,200. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the excess deductions of $800 must be reapportioned to the $200 of net royalty income subject to a 5 percent withholding tax and the $400 of net rental income subject to a 15 percent or greater withholding tax. The income in each of these groups is reduced to zero, and the foreign taxes imposed on the rental and royalty income are considered related to general category income. The remaining loss of $200 constitutes a separate limitation loss with respect to passive income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 13. In 2001, P, a domestic corporation, earns a $100 dividend that is foreign

source passive limitation income subject to a 30-percent withholding tax. A foreign tax credit for the withholding tax on the dividend is disallowed under section 901(k). A deduction for the tax is allowed, however, under sections 164 and 901(k)(7). In determining whether P's passive income is high-taxed, the $100 dividend and the $30 deduction are allocated to the first group of income described in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section (passive income subject to no withholding tax or other foreign tax).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Financial services income--(1) In general.

The term ``financial services entity'' means an individual or entity that is predominantly engaged in the active conduct of a banking, insurance, financing, or similar business (active financing business) for any taxable Year. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, a determination of whether an entity is a financial services entity shall be done on an entity-by-entity basis. An individual or entity is predominantly engaged in the active financing business for any year if for that year at least 80 percent of its gross income is income described in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section. For this purpose, gross income includes all income realized by an individual or entity, whether includible or excludible from gross income under other operative provisions of the Code, but excludes gain from the disposition of stock of a corporation that prior to the disposition of its stock is related to the transferor within the meaning of section 267(b). For this purpose, income received from a related person that is a financial services entity shall be excluded if such income is characterized under the look-through rules of section 904(d)(3) and Sec. 1.904-5. In addition, income received from a related person that is not a financial services entity but that is characterized as financial services income under the look-through rules shall be excluded. See paragraph (e)(3)(iv) Example 5 of this section. Any income received from a related person that is characterized under the look-through rules and that is not otherwise excluded by this paragraph will retain its character either as active financing income or other income in the hands of the recipient for purposes of determining if the recipient is a financial services entity and if the income is financial services income to the recipient. For purposes of this paragraph, related person is defined in Sec. 1.904-5(i)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for affiliated groups. In the case of any corporation that is not a financial services entity under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, but is a member of an affiliated group, such corporation will be deemed to be a financial services entity if the affiliated group as a whole meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3)(ii), affiliated group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a), determined without regard to section 1504(b)(3). In counting the income of the group for purposes of determining whether the group meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, the following rules apply. Only the income of group members that are United States corporations or foreign corporations that are controlled foreign corporations in which United States members of the affiliated group own, directly or indirectly, at least 80 percent of the total voting

power and value of the stock shall be included. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3)(ii), indirect ownership shall be determined under section 318 and the regulations under that section. The income of the group will not include any income from transactions with other members of the group. Passive income will not be considered to be active financing income merely because that income is earned by a member of the group that is a financial services entity without regard to the rule of this paragraph (e)(3)(ii). This paragraph (e)(3)(ii) applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Treatment of partnerships and other pass-through entities For purposes of determining whether a partner (including a partnership that is a partner in a second partnership) is a financial services entity, all of the partner's income shall be taken into account, except that income that is excluded under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section shall not be taken into account. Thus, if a partnership is determined to be a financial services entity none of the income of the partner received from the partnership that is characterized under the look-through rules shall be included for purpose of determining if the partner is a financial services entity. If a partnership is determined not to be a financial services entity, then income of the partner from the partnership that is characterized under the look-through rules will be taken into account (unless such income is financial services income) and such income will retain its character either as active financing income or as other income in the hands of the partner for purposes of determining if the partner is a financial service entity and if the income is financial services income to the partner. If a partnership is a financial services entity and the partner's income from the partnership is characterized as financial services income under the look-through rules, then, for purposes of determining a partner's foreign tax credit limitation, the income from the partnership shall be considered to be financial services income to the partner regardless of whether the partner is itself a financial services entity. The rules of this paragraph (e)(3)(iii) will appIy for purposes of determining whether an owner of an interest in any other pass-through entity the character of the income of which is preserved when such income is included in the income of the owner of the interest is a financial services entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The principles of paragraph (e)(3) of this section are illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. P is a domestic corporation that owns 100 percent of the stock of S, a controlled foreign corporation incorporated in Country X. For the 1990 taxable year, 60 percent of S's income is active financing income that consists of income that will be considered general limitation or passive income if S is not a financial services entity. The other 40 percent of S's income is passive non-active financing income. S is not a financial services entity and its active financing income thus retains its character as general limitation and passive income. S makes an interest payment to P in 1990 that is characterized under the look-through rules. Although the interest is not financial services income to S under the look-through rules, it retains its character as active financing income when paid to P and P must take that income into account in determining whether it is a financial services entity under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. If P is determined to be a financial services entity, both the portion of the interest payment characterized as active financing income (whether general limitation or passive income in S's hands) and the portion characterized as passive non-active financing income received from S will be recharacterized as financial services income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Foreign corporation A, which is not a controlled foreign corporation, owns 100 percent of the stock of domestic corporation B, which owns 100 percent of the stock of domestic corporation C. A also owns 100 percent of the stock of foreign corporation D. D owns 100 percent of the stock of domestic corporation E, which owns 100 percent of the stock of controlled foreign corporation F. All of the corporations are members of an affiliated group within the meaning of section 1504(a) (determined without regard to section 1504(b)(3)). Pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, however, only the income of B, C, E, and F is counted in determining whether the group meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. For the 2001 taxable year, B's income consists of $95 of active financing income and $5 of passive non-active financing income. C has $40 of active financing income and $20 of passive non-active financing income. E has $70 of active financing income and $15 of passive non-active financing income. F has $10

of passive income. B and E qualify as financial services entities under the entity test of paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. Therefore, B and E are financial services entities without regard to whether the group as a whole is a financial services entity and all of the income of B and E shall be treated as financial services income. C and F do not qualify as financial services entities under the entity test of paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. However, under the affiliated group test of paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, C and F are financial services entities because at least 80 percent of the group's total income consists of active financing income ($205 of active financing income is 80.4 percent of $255 total income). B's and E's passive income is not treated as active financing income for purposes of the affiliated group test of paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section even though it is treated as financial services income without regard to whether the group satisfies the affiliated group test. Once C and F are determined to be financial services entities under the affiliated group test, however, all of the passive income of the group is treated as financial services income. Thus, 100 percent of the income of B, C, E, and F for 2001 is financial services income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. PS is a domestic partnership operating in branch form in foreign country X. PS has two equal general partners, A and B. A and B are domestic corporations that each operate in branch form in foreign countries Y and Z. All of A's income, except that derived through PS, is manufacturing income. All of B's income, except that derived through PS, is active financing income. A and B's only income from PS are distributive shares of PS's income. PS is a financial services entity and all of its income is financial services income. The income from PS is excluded in determining if A or B are financial services entities. Thus, A is not a financial services entity because none of A's income is active financing income and B is a financial services entity because all of B's income is active financing income. However, both A and B's distributive shares of PS's taxable income consist of financial services income even though A is not a financial services entity.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. PS is a domestic partnership operating in foreign country X. A and B are domestic corporations that are equal general partners in PS and, therefore, the look-through rules apply for purposes of characterizing A's and B's distributive shares of PS's income. Fifty (50) percent of PS's gross income is active financing income that is not high withholding tax interest. The active financing income includes income that also meets the definition of passive income and income that meets the definition of general limitation income. The other 50 percent of PS's income is from manufacturing. PS is, therefore, not a financial services entity. A s and B's distributive shares of partnership taxable income consist of general limitation manufacturing income and active financing income. Under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, the active financing income shall be financial services income to A or B if either A or B is determined to be a financial services entity. If A or B is not a financial services entity, the distributive shares of income from PS will not be financial services income to A or B and will consist of passive and general limitation income. All of the income from PS is included in determining if A or B are financial services entities.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. P is a United States corporation that is not a financial services entity. P owns 100 percent of the stock of S, a controlled foreign corporation that is not a financial services entity. S owns 100 percent of the stock of T, a controlled foreign corporation that is a financial services entity. In 1991, T pays a dividend to S. The dividend from T is characterized under the look-through rules of section 904(d)(3). Pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, the dividend from T is excluded in determining whether S is a financial services entity. S is determined not to be a financial services entity but the dividend retains its character as financial services income in S's hands. Any subpart F inclusion or dividend to P out of earnings and profits attributable to the dividend from T will be excluded in determining whether P is a financial services entity but the inclusion or dividend will retain its character as financial services income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Definition of incidental income--(i) In general--(A) Rule. Incidental income is income that is integrally related to active financing income of a financial services entity. Such income includes, for example, income from precious metals trading and commodity trading that is integrally related to futures income. If securities, shares of stock, or other types of property are acquired by a financial services entity as an ordinary and necessary incident to the conduct of an active financing business, the income from such property will be considered to be financial services income but only so long as the retention of such property remains an ordinary or necessary incident to the conduct of such business. Thus property, including stock, acquired as the result of, or in order to prevent, a loss in an active financing business upon a loan held by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of such business will be considered ordinary and necessary to the conduct of such business, but income from such property will be considered financial

services income only so long as the holding of such property remains an ordinary and necessary incident to the conduct of such business. If an entity holds such property for five years or less then the property is considered held incident to the financial services business. If an entity holds such property for more than five years, a presumption will be established that the entity is not holding such property incident to its financial services business. An entity will be able to rebut the presumption by demonstrating that under the facts and circumstances it is not holding the property as an investment. However, the fact that an entity holds the property for more than five years and is not able to rebut the presumption that it is not holding the property incident to its financial services business will not affect the characterization of any income received from the property during the first five years as financial services income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. X is a financial services entity within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. In 1987, X made a loan in the ordinary course of its business to an unrelated foreign corporation, Y. As security for that loan, Y pledged certain operating assets. Those assets generate income of a type that would be subject to the general limitation. In January 1989, Y defaulted on the loan and forfeited the collateral. During the period X held the assets, X earned operating income generated by those assets. This income was applied in partial satisfaction of Y's obligation. In 1993, X sold the forfeited assets. The sales proceeds were in excess of the remainder of Y's obligation. The operating income received in the period from 1989 to 1993 and the income on the sale of the assets in 1993 are financial services income of X.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that instead of pledging its operating assets as collateral for the loan, Y pledged the stock of its operating subsidiary Z. In 1993 X sold the stock of Z in complete satisfaction of Y's obligation. X's income from the sale of Z stock in satisfaction of Y's obligation is financial services income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. P, a domestic corporation, is a financial services entity within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. P holds a United States dollar denominated debt (the ``obligation'') of the Central Bank of foreign country X. The obligation evidences a loan of $100 made by P to the Central Bank. In 1988, pursuant to a program of country X, P delivers the obligation to the Central Bank which credits 70 units of country X currency to M, a country X corporation. M issues all of its only class of capital stock to P. M invests the 70 units of country X currency in the construction and operation of a new hotel in X. In 1994, M distributes 10 units of country X currency to P as a dividend. P is not able to rebut the presumption that it is not holding the stock of M incident to its financial services business. The dividend to P is, therefore, not financial services income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Income that is not incidental income. Income that is attributable to non-financial activity is not incidental income within the meaning of paragraph (e)(4) (i) and (ii) of this section solely because such income represents a relatively small proportion of the taxpayer's total income or that the taxpayer engages in non-financial activity on a sporadic basis. Thus, for example, income from data processing services provided to related or unrelated parties or income from the sale of goods or non-financial services (for example travel services) is not financial services income, even if the recipient is a financial services entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Exceptions. Financial services income does not include income that is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Export financing interest as defined in section 904(d)(2)(G) and paragraph (h) of this section unless that income would be high withholding tax interest as defined in section 904(d)(2)(B) but for paragraph (d)(2)(B)(ii) of that section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> High withholding tax interest as defined in section 904(d)(2)(B) unless that income also meets the definition of export financing interest; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Dividends from noncontrolled section 902 corporations as defined in section 904(d)(2)(E) paid in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2003.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)-(g)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Export financing interest--(1) Definitions--(i) Export financing interest. The term ``export financing interest'' means any interest derived from financing the sale (or other disposition) for use or consumption outside the United States of any property that is manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted in the United States by the taxpayer or a related person, and not more than 50 percent of the fair market

value of which is attributable to products imported into the United States. For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``United States'' includes the fifty States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Fair market value. For purposes of this paragraph, the fair market value of any property imported into the United States shall be its appraised value, as determined by the Secretary under section 402 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1401a) in connection with its importation. For purposes of determining the foreign content of an item of property imported into the United States, see section 927 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Related person. For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``related person'' has the meaning given it by section 954(d)(3) except that such section shall be applied by substituting ``the person with respect to whom the determination is being made'' for ``controlled foreign corporation'' each place it applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Treatment of export financing interest.

P has uncollected trade and service receivables of foreign obligors. P sells the receivables at a discount (``factors'') to S. The income derived by S on the receivables is related person factoring income. The income is also export financing interest.

T uses a substantial part of its assets in its trade or business located in Country M. T has uncollected trade receivables from X that it factors to S. S derived more than 20 percent of its gross income for 1987 other than from an active financing business and the income derived by S from the receivables is not derived in an active financing business. Thus, pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, S is not a financial services entity. The income is not related person factoring income because it is described in section 864(d)(7) (income eligible for the same country exception).

The interest earned by S from financing the sales is described in section 864(d)(7) and is export financing interest. Therefore, the income shall be general category income to S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Interaction of section 907(c) and income described in this section. If a person receives or accrues income that is income described in section 907(c) (relating to oil and gas income), the rules of section 907(c) and the regulations thereunder, as well as the rules of this section, shall apply to the income. The reduction in amount allowed as foreign tax provided by section 907(a) shall therefore be calculated separately for income in each separate category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Special rule for DASTM gain or loss. Any DASTM gain or loss computed under Sec. 1.985-3(d) must be allocated among the categories of income under the rules of Sec. 1.985-3 (e)(2)(iv) or (e)(3). The rules of Sec. 1.985-3(e) apply before the rules of section 904(d)(2)(B)(iii)(II) (the exception from passive income for high-taxed income).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Special rule for alternative minimum tax foreign tax credit. For purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax foreign tax credit under section 59(a), items included in alternative minimum taxable income by reason of section 56(g) (adjustments based on adjusted current earnings) shall be characterized as income described in a separate category under section 904(d) and this section based on the character of the underlying items of income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Priority rule. Income that meets the definitions of a separate category described in paragraph (m) of this section and another category of income described in section 904(d)(2)(A)(i) and (ii) will be subject to the separate limitation described in paragraph (m) of this section and will not be treated as general category income described in section 904(d)(2)(A)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Income treated as allocable to an additional separate category. If section 904(a), (b), and (c) are applied separately to any category of income under the Internal Revenue Code (for example, under section 56(g)(4)(C)(iii)(IV), 245(a)(10), 865(h), 901(j), or 904(h)(10)), that category of income will be treated for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations as if it were a separate category listed in section 904(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Effective/applicability dates. Paragraphs (a), (b), (h)(3), and (l) of this section shall apply to taxable years of United States persons and, for purposes of section 906, foreign persons beginning after December 31, 2006 and ending on or after December 21, 2007, and to taxable years of a foreign corporation which end with or within taxable years of its domestic corporate shareholder beginning after December 31, 2006 and ending on or after December 21, 2007. For purposes of determining whether passive income is high-taxed income, the grouping rules of paragraphs (c)(3) and (4) of this section apply in taxable years ending on or after April 20, 2009.

Sec. 1.904-5  Look-through rules as applied to controlled foreigncorporations and other entities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. For purposes of section 904(d)(3) and (4) and the regulations under section 904, the following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The term separate category means, as the context requires, any category of income described in section 904(d)(1)(A) and (B) (or section 904(d)(1)(A), (B), (C), (D), (F), (G), (H), or (I) for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2007) and in Sec. 1.904-4T(b) (or Sec. 1.904-4(e) for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2007), any category of income described in Sec. 1.904-4(m), or any category of earnings and profits to which income described in such provisions is attributable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The term controlled foreign corporation has the meaning given such term by section 957 (taking into account the special rule for certain captive insurance companies contained in section 953(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The term United States shareholder has the meaning given such term by section 951(b) (taking into account the special rule for certain captive insurance companies contained in section 953(c)), except that for purposes of this section, a United States shareholder shall include any member of the controlled group of the United States shareholder. For this purpose the controlled group is any member of the affiliated group within the meaning of section 1504(a)(1) except that ``more than 50 percent'' shall be substituted for ``at least 80 percent'' wherever it appears in section 1504(a)(2). For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2001, the preceding sentence shall be applied by substituting ``50 percent'' for ``more than 50 percent''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The term noncontrolled section 902 corporation means any foreign corporation with respect to which the taxpayer meets the stock ownership requirements of section 902(a), or, with respect to a lower-tier foreign corporation, the taxpayer meets the requirements of section 902(b). Except as provided in section 902 and the regulations under that section and paragraphs (i)(3) and (i)(4) of this section, a controlled foreign corporation shall not be treated as a noncontrolled section 902 corporation with respect to any distributions out of its earnings and profits for periods during which it was a controlled foreign corporation. In the case of a partnership owning a foreign corporation, the determination of whether a taxpayer meets the ownership requirements of section 902(a) or (b) will be made with respect to the taxpayer's indirect ownership, and not the partnership's direct ownership, in the foreign corporation. See section 902(c)(7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided in section 904(d)(3) and (4) and this section, dividends, interest, rents, and royalties received or accrued by a taxpayer from a controlled foreign corporation in which the taxpayer is a United States shareholder shall be treated as general category income. See paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section for the treatment of dividends received by a domestic corporation from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation in which the domestic corporation meets the stock ownership requirements of section 902(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Rules for specific types of inclusions and payments--(1) Subpart F inclusions--(i) Rule. Any amount included in gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A) shall be treated as income in a separate category to the extent the amount so included is attributable to income received or accrued by the controlled foreign corporation that is described as income in such category. For purposes of this Sec. 1.904-5, income shall be characterized under the rules of Sec. 1.904-4 prior to the application of the rules of paragraph (c) of this section. For rules concerning inclusions under section 951(a)(1)(B), see paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c)(1):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Controlled foreign corporation S is a wholly-owned subsidiary of P, a domestic corporation. S earns $200 of net income, $85 of which is foreign base company shipping income, $15 of which is foreign personal holding company income, and $100 of which is non-subpart F general limitation income. No foreign tax is imposed on the income. One hundred dollars ($100) of S's income is subpart F income taxed currently to P under section 951(a)(1)(A). Because $85 of the subpart F inclusion is attributable to shipping income of S, $85 of the subpart F inclusion is shipping income to P. Because $15 of the subpart F inclusion is attributable to passive income of S, $15 of the subpart F inclusion is passive income to P.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Controlled foreign corporation S is a wholly-owned subsidiary of domestic corporation P. S is a financial services entity. P manufactures cars and is not a financial services entity. In 1987, S earns $200 of interest income unrelated to its banking business and $900 of interest income related to its banking business. Assume that S pays no foreign taxes and has no expenses. All of S's income is included in P's gross income as foreign personal holding company income. Because S is a financial services entity, income that would otherwise be passive income is considered to be financial services income. P, therefore, treats the entire subpart F inclusion as financial services income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Controlled foreign corporation S is a wholly-owned subsidiary of domestic corporation P. P is a financial services entity. S manufactures cars and is not a financial services entity. In 1987, S earns $200 of passive income that is subpart F income and $900 of general limitation non-subpart F income. Assume that S pays no foreign taxes on its passive earnings and has no expenses. P includes the $200 of subpart F income in gross income. Because P is a financial services entity, the inclusion will be financial services income to P.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Controlled foreign corporation S is a wholly-owned subsidiary of domestic corporation P. Neither P nor S is a financial services entity. Controlled foreign corporation T is a wholly-owned subsidiary of controlled foreign corporation S. T is a financial services entity. In 1991, T pays a dividend to S. For purposes of determining whether S is a financial services entity under Sec. 1.904-4(e)(3)(i), the dividend from T is ignored. For purposes of characterizing the dividend in S's hands under the look-through rules of paragraph (c)(4) of this section, however, the dividend retains its character as financial services income. Similarly, any subpart F inclusion or dividend to P out of the earnings and profits attributable to the dividend from S is excluded in determining whether P is a financial services entity under Sec. 1.904-4(e)(3)(i), but retains its character in P's hands as financial services income under paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Controlled foreign corporation S is a wholly-owned subsidiary of domestic corporation P. S owns 40 percent of foreign corporation A, 45 percent of foreign corporation B, 30 percent of foreign corporation C and 20 percent of foreign corporation D. A, B, C, and D are noncontrolled section 902 corporations. In 1987, S's only income is a $100 dividend from each foreign corporation. Assume that S pays no foreign taxes and has no expenses. All $400 of the income is foreign personal holding company income and is included in P's gross income. P must include $100 in its separate limitation for dividends from A, $100 in its separate limitation for dividends from B, $100 in its separate limitation for dividends from C, and $100 in its separate limitation for dividends from D.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interest--(i) In general. For purposes of this paragraph, related person interest is any interest paid or accrued by a controlled foreign corporation to any United States shareholder in that corporation (or to any other related person) to which the look-through rules of section 904(d)(3) and this section apply. Unrelated person interest is all interest other than related person interest. Related person interest shall be treated as income in a separate category to the extent it is allocable to income of the controlled foreign corporation in that category. If related person interest is received or accrued from a controlled foreign corporation by two or more persons, the amount of interest received or accrued by each person that is allocable to any separate category of income shall be determined by multiplying the amount of related person interest allocable to that separate category of income by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the amount of related person interest received or accrued by that person and the denominator is the total amount of related person interest paid or accrued by the controlled foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Allocating and apportioning expenses of a controlled foreign corporation including interest paid to a related person. Related person interest and other expenses of a controlled foreign corporation shall be allocated and apportioned in the following manner:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Gross income in each separate category shall be determined;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any expenses that are definitely related to less than all of gross income as a class, including unrelated person interest that is directly allocated to income from a specific property, shall be allocated and apportioned under the principles of Sec. Sec. 1.861-8 or 1.861-10T, as applicable, to income in each separate category;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Related person interest shall be allocated to and shall reduce (but not below zero) the amount of passive foreign personal holding company income as determined after the application of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> To the extent that related person interest exceeds passive foreign personal holding company income as determined after the application of paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) (B) and (C) of this section, the related person interest shall be apportioned under the rules of this paragraph to separate categories other than passive income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If under Sec. 1.861-9T, the modified gross income method of apportioning interest expense is elected, related person interest shall be apportioned as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC07OC91.034</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If under Sec. 1.861-9T, the asset method of apportioning interest expense is elected, related person interest shall be apportioned according to the following formula:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC07OC91.035</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Any other expenses (including unrelated person interest that is not directly allocated to income from a specific property) that are not definitely related expenses or that are definitely related to all of gross income as a class shall be apportioned under the rules of this paragraph to reduce income in each separate category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If under Sec. 1.861-9T, the modified gross income method of apportioning interest expense is elected, the interest expense shall be apportioned as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC07OC91.036</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If under Sec. 1.861-9T, the asset method of apportioning interest expense is elected, then the expense shall be apportioned as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC07OC91.037</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Expenses other than interest shall be apportioned in a similar manner depending on the apportionment method used. See Sec. 1.861-8T(c)(1) (i)-(vi).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Allocating and apportioning expenses of a noncontrolled section 902 corporation. Expenses of a noncontrolled section 902 corporation shall be allocated and apportioned in the same manner as expenses of a controlled foreign corporation under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, except that the related person interest rule of paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(C) and (D) of this section shall not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Definitions--(A) Value of assets and reduction in value of assets and gross income. For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) (D) and (E) of this section, the value of total assets is the value of assets in all categories (determined under the principles of Sec. 1.861-9T(g)). See Sec. 1.861-10T(d)(2) to determine the reduction in value of assets and gross income for purposes of apportioning additional third person interest expense that is not directly allocated when some interest expense has been directly allocated. For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, any reduction in the value of assets for indebtedness that relates to interest allocated under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section is made before determining the average of asset values. For rules relating to the averaging of reduced asset values see Sec. 1.861-9T(g)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Related person debt allocated to passive assets. For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, related person debt allocated to passive assets is determined as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC07OC91.038

For this purpose, the term total related person debt means the sum of the principal amounts of obligations of a controlled foreign corporation owed to any United States shareholder of such corporation or to any related entity (within the meaning of paragraph (g) of this section) determined at the end of the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the operation of this paragraph (c)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. (i) Controlled foreign corporation S is a wholly-owned subsidiary of P, a domestic corporation. In 1987, S earns $200 of foreign personal holding company income that is passive income. S also earns $100 of foreign base company sales income that is general limitation income. S has $2000 of passive assets and $2000 of general limitation assets. In 1987, S makes a $150 interest payment to P with respect to a $1500 loan from P. S also pays $100 of interest to an unrelated person on a $1000 loan from that person. S

has no other expenses. S uses the asset method to apportion interest expense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the $150 related person interest payment is allocable to S's passive foreign personal holding company income. Therefore, the $150 interest payment is passive income to P. Because the entire related person interest payment is allocated to passive income under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, none of the related person interest payment is apportioned to general limitation income under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(D) of this section. Under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, the entire amount of the related person debt is allocable to passive assets ($1500 = $1500 x $150/$150). Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, $20 of interest expense paid to an unrelated person is apportioned to passive income ($20 = $100 x ($2000-$1500)/($4000-$1500)). Eighty dollars ($80) of the interest expense paid to an unrelated person is apportioned to general limitation income ($80 = $100 x $2000/($4000-$1500)).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that S uses the gross income method to apportion interest expense. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, the unrelated person interest expense would be apportioned on a gross income method. Therefore, $33 of interest expense paid to unrelated persons would be apportioned to passive income ($33 = $100 x ($200-$150)/($300-$150) and $67 of interest expense paid to unrelated persons would be apportioned to general limitation income ($67 = $100 x $100/($300-$150).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. (i) The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that S has an additional $50 of third person interest expense that is directly allocated to income from a specific property that produces only passive income. The principal amount of indebtedness to which the interest relates is $500. S also has $50 of additional non-interest expenses that are not definitely related expenses and that are apportioned on an asset basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the $50 of directly allocated third person interest is first allocated to reduce the passive income of S. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the $150 of related person interest is allocated to the remaining $150 of passive income. Under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, all of the related person debt is allocated to passive assets. ($1500 = $1500 x $150/$150).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, the non-interest expenses that are not definitely related are apportioned on the basis of the asset values reduced by the allocated related person debt. Therefore, $10 of these expenses are apportioned to the passive category ($50 x ($2000-$1500)/($4000-$1500)) and $40 are apportioned to the general limitation category ($50 x $2000/($4000-$1500)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In order to apportion third person interest between the categories of assets, the value of assets in a separate category must also be reduced under the principles of Sec. 1.861-8 by the indebtedness relating to the specifically allocated interest. Therefore, under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, the value of assets in the passive category for purposes of apportioning the additional third person interest = 0 ($2000 minus $500 (the principal amount of the debt, the interest payment on which is directly allocated to specific interest producing properties) minus $1500 (the related person debt allocated to passive assets)). Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, all $100 of the non-definitely related third person interest is apportioned to the general limitation category ($100 = $100 x $2000 / ($4000 - $500 - $1500)).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. (i) Controlled foreign corporation S is a wholly-owned subsidiary of P, a domestic corporation. In 1987, S earns $100 of foreign personal holding company income that is passive income. S also earns $100 of foreign base company sales income that is general limitation income. S has $1000 of general limitation assets and $1000 of passive assets. In 1987, S makes a $150 interest payment to P on a $1500 loan from P and has $20 of general and administrative expenses (G & A) that under the principles of Sec. Sec. 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T is treated as directly allocable to all of P's gross income. S also makes a $25 interest payment to an unrelated person on a $250 loan from the unrelated person. S has no other expenses. S uses the asset method to apportion interest expense. S uses the gross income method to apportion G & A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, $100 of the interest payment to P is allocable to S's passive foreign personal holding company income. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(D) of this section, the additional $50 of related person interest expense is apportioned to general limitation income ($50 = $50 x $1000/$1000). Under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, related person debt allocated to passive assets equals $1000 ($1000 = $1500 x $100/$150).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, none of the $25 of interest expense paid to an unrelated person is apportioned to passive income ($0 = $25 x ($1000-$1000)/($2000-$1000). Twenty-five dollars ($25) of the interest expense paid to an unrelated person is apportioned to general limitation income ($25 = $25 x $1000/($2000-$1000). Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, none of the G & A is allocable to S's passive foreign personal holding company income ($0 = $20 x ($100-$100)/($200-$100). All $20 of the G & A is apportioned to S's general limitation income ($20 = $20 x $100/($200-$100).</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that S uses the gross income method to apportion interest expense. As in Example 4, $100 of the interest payment to P

is allocate to passive income under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(D) of this section, the additional $50 of related person interest expense is apportioned to general limitation income ($150-100 x $100/$100). Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, none of the unrelated person interest expense and none of the G & A is apportioned to passive income, because after the application of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, no passive income remains in the passive income category.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Controlled foreign corporation T is a wholly-owned subsidiary of S, a controlled foreign corporation. S is a wholly-owned subsidiary of P, a domestic corporation. S is not a financial services entity. S and T are incorporated in the same country. In 1987, P sells tractors to T, which T sells to X, a foreign corporation that is related to both S and T and is organized in the same country as S and T. S makes a loan to X to finance the tractor sales. Assume that the interest earned by S from financing the sales is export financing interest that is neither related person factoring income nor foreign personal holding company income. The export financing interest earned by S is, therefore, general limitation income. S earns no other income. S makes a $100 interest payment to P. The $100 of interest paid is allocable under the look-through rules of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section to the general limitation income earned by S and is therefore general limitation income to P.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Rents and Royalties. Any rents or royalties received or accrued from a controlled foreign corporation in which the taxpayer is a United States shareholder shall be treated as income in a separate category to the extent they are allocable to income of the controlled foreign corporation in that category under the principles of Sec. Sec. 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Dividends--(i) Look-through rule for controlled foreign corporations. Any dividend paid or accrued out of the earnings and profits of any controlled foreign corporation, shall be treated as income in a separate category in proportion to the ratio of the portion of earnings and profits attributable to income in such category to the total amount of earnings and profits of the controlled foreign corporation. For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``dividend'' includes any amount included in gross income under section 951(a)(1)(B) as a pro rata share of a controlled foreign corporation's increase in earnings invested in United States property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for dividends attributable to certain loans. If a dividend is distributed to a taxpayer by a controlled foreign corporation, that controlled foreign corporation is the recipient of loan proceeds from a related look-through entity (within the meaning of Sec. 1.904-5(i)), and the purpose of such loan is to alter the characterization of the dividend for purposes of this section, then, to the extent of the principal amount of the loan, the dividend shall be characterized with respect to the earnings and profits of the related person lender rather than with respect to the earnings and profits of the dividend payor. A loan will not be considered made for the purpose of altering the characterization of a dividend if the loan would have been made or maintained on substantially the same terms irrespective of the dividend. The determination of whether a loan would have been made or maintained on substantially the same terms irrespective of the dividend will be made taking into account all the facts and circumstances of the relationship between the lender and the borrower. Thus, for example, a loan by a related party lender to a controlled foreign corporation that arises from the sale of inventory in the ordinary course of business will not be considered a loan made for the purpose of altering the character of any dividend paid by the borrower.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Look-through rule for dividends from noncontrolled section 902 corporations. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(4)(iii), any dividend that is distributed by a noncontrolled section 902 corporation and received or accrued by a domestic corporation that meets the stock ownership requirements of section 902(a) shall be treated as income in a separate category in proportion to the ratio of the portion of earnings and profits attributable to income in such category to the total amount of earnings and profits of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation. A dividend distributed by a noncontrolled section 902 corporation shall be treated as passive income if the Commissioner determines that the look-through characterization of such dividend cannot reasonably be determined based on the available information, or if such dividend is received or accrued

by a shareholder that is neither a domestic corporation meeting the stock ownership requirements of section 902(a) nor a foreign corporation meeting the requirements of section 902(b). See paragraph (i)(4) of this section. See Sec. 1.904-7 for transition rules concerning the treatment of undistributed earnings (or a deficit) of a noncontrolled section 902 corporation that were accumulated in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2003.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c)(4).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Controlled foreign corporation S is a wholly-owned subsidiary of P, a domestic corporation. In 1987, S has earnings and profits of $1,000, $600 of which is attributable to general limitation income and $400 of which is attributable to dividends received by S from its wholly-owned subsidiary, T. T is a controlled foreign corporation and is incorporated and operates in the same country as S. All of T's income is financial services income. Neither S's general limitation income nor the dividend from T is subpart F income. In December 1987, S pays a dividend to P of $200, all of which is attributable to earnings and profits earned in 1987. Six-tenths of the dividend ($120) is treated as general limitation income because six-tenths of S's earnings and profits are attributable to general limitation income. Four-tenths of the dividend ($80) is treated as financial services income because four-tenths of S's earnings and profits are attributable to dividends from T, and all of T's earnings are financial services income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. A, a United States person, has been the sole shareholder in controlled foreign corporation X since its organization on January 1, 1963. Both X and A are calendar year taxpayers. X's earnings and profits for 1963 through the end of 1987 totaled $3,000. A sells his stock in X at the end of 1987 and realizes a gain of $4,000. Of the total $4,000 gain, $3,000 (A's share of the post-1962 earnings and profits) is includible in A's gross income as a dividend and is subject to the look-through rules including the transition rule of Sec. 1.904-7(a) with respect to the portion of the distribution out of pre-87 earnings and profits. The remaining $1,000 of the gain is includible as gain from the sale or exchange of the X stock and is passive income to A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effect of exclusions from subpart F income--(1) De minimis amount of subpart F income. If the sum of a controlled foreign corporation's gross foreign base company income (determined under section 954(a) without regard to section 954(b)(5)) and gross insurance income (determined under section 953(a)) for the taxable year is less than the lesser of 5 percent of gross income or $1,000,000, then all of that income (other than income that would be financial services income without regard to this paragraph (d)(1)) shall be treated as general limitation income. In addition, if the test in the preceding sentence is satisfied, for purposes of paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) (D) and (E) of this section (apportionment of interest expense to passive income using the asset method), any passive limitation assets shall be treated as general limitation assets. The determination in the first sentence shall be made prior to the application of the exception for certain income subject to a high rate of foreign tax described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exception for certain income subject to high foreign tax. Except as provided in Sec. 1.904-4(c)(7)(iii) (relating to reductions in tax upon distribution), for purposes of the dividend look-through rule of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, an item of net income that would otherwise be passive income (after application of the priority rules of Sec. 1.904-4(l)) and that is received or accrued by a controlled foreign corporation shall be treated as general limitation income, and the earnings and profits attributable to such income shall be treated as general limitation earnings and profits, if the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that such income was subject to an effective rate of income tax imposed by a foreign country greater than 90 percent of the maximum rate of tax specified in section 11 (with reference to section 15, if applicable). The preceding sentence has no effect on amounts (other than dividends) paid or accrued by a controlled foreign corporation to a United States shareholder of such controlled foreign corporation to the extent those amounts are allocable to passive income of the controlled foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Controlled foreign corporation S is a wholly-owned subsidiary of P, a domestic corporation. In 1987, S earns $100 of gross

income, $4 of which is interest that is subpart F foreign personal holding company income and $96 of which is gross manufacturing income that is not subpart F income. S has no other earnings for 1987. S has no expenses and pays no foreign taxes. S pays P a $100 dividend. Under the de minimis rule of section 954(b)(3), none of S's income is treated as foreign base company income. All of S's income, therefore, is treated as general limitation income. The entire $100 dividend is general limitation income to P.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. (i) Controlled foreign corporation S is a wholly-owned subsidiary of P, a domestic corporation. In 1987, S earns $50 of shipping income of a type that is foreign base company shipping income. S also earns $50 of dividends from T, a foreign corporation in which S owns 45 percent of the voting stock, and receives $50 of dividends from U, a foreign corporation in which S owns 5% of the voting stock. Foreign persons hold the remaining voting stock of both T and U. S, T, and U are all incorporated in different foreign countries. The dividends S receives from T and U are of a type that normally would be subpart F foreign personal holding company income that is passive income. Under Sec. 1.904-4(l)(1)(iv), however, the dividends from T are dividends from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation rather than passive income. S has no expenses. The earnings and profits of S are equal to the net income after taxes of S. The dividends and the shipping income are taxed abroad by S's country of incorporation at an effective rate of 40 percent. P establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the effective rate of tax on both the dividends and the shipping income exceeds 90 percent of the maximum United States tax rate. Thus, under section 954(b)(4), neither the shipping income nor the dividends are taxed currently to P under subpart F. S's earnings attributable to shipping income and dividends from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation retain their character as such. Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, S's earnings attributable to the dividends from U are treated as earnings attributable to general limitation income. See Sec. Sec. 1.905-3T and 1.905-4T, however, for rules concerning adjustments to the pools of earnings and profits and foreign taxes and redeterminations of United States tax liability when foreign taxes are refunded in a later year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In 1988, S has no earnings and pays a $150 dividend (including gross-up) to P. The dividend is paid out of S's post-1986 pool of earnings and profits. One-third of the dividend ($50) is attributable to S's shipping earnings, one-third ($50) is attributable to the dividend from T, and one-third ($50) is attributable to the dividend from U. Pursuant to section 904(d)(3)(E) and paragraph (c)(4) of this section, one-third of the dividend is shipping income, one-third is a dividend from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation, T, and one-third is general limitation income to P.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Treatment of subpart F income in excess of 70 percent of gross income--(1) Rule. If the sum of a controlled foreign corporation's gross foreign base company income (determined without regard to section 954(b)(5)) and gross insurance income for the taxable year exceeds 70 percent of the gross income, then all of the controlled foreign corporation's gross income shall be treated as foreign base company income (whichever is appropriate) and, thus, included in a United States shareholder's gross income. However, the inclusion in gross income of an amount that would not otherwise be subpart F income does not affect its character for purposes of determining whether the income is within a separate category. The determination of whether the controlled foreign corporation's gross foreign base company income and gross insurance income exceeds 70 percent of gross income is made before the exception for certain income subject to a high rate of foreign tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0">Example. Controlled foreign corporation S is a wholly-owned subsidiary of P, a domestic corporation. S earns $100, $75 of which is foreign personal holding company income and $25 of which is non-subpart F services income. S is not a financial services entity. S's gross and net income are equal. Under the 70 percent full inclusion rule of section 954(b)(3)(B), the entire $100 is foreign base company income currently taxable to P under section 951. Because $75 of the $100 section 951 inclusion is attributable to S's passive income, $75 of the inclusion is passive income to P. The remaining $25 of the inclusion is treated as general limitation income to P because $25 is attributable to S's general limitation income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Modification of look-through rules for certain income--(1) High withholding tax interest. If a taxpayer receives or accrues interest from a controlled foreign corporation that is a financial services entity, and the interest would be described as high withholding tax interest if section 904(d)(3) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section (the look-through rules for interest) did not apply, then the interest shall be treated as high

withholding tax interest to the extent that the interest is allocable under section 904(d)(3) and paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section to financial services income of the controlled foreign corporation. See section 904(d)(3)(H). The amount treated as high-withholding tax interest under this paragraph (f)(1) shall not exceed the interest, or equivalent income, of the payor that would be taken into account in determining the financial services income of the payor if the look-through rules applied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Distributions from a FSC. Income received or accrued by a taxpayer that, under the rules of paragraph (c)(4) of this section (look-through rules for dividends), would be treated as foreign trade income or as passive income that is interest and carrying charges (as defined in section 927(d)(1)), and that is also a distribution from a FSC (or a former FSC), shall be treated as a distribution from a FSC (or a former FSC).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the operation of paragraph (f)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example. Controlled foreign corporation S is a wholly-owned subsidiary of P, a domestic corporation. S is a financial services entity. In 1988, S earns $80 of interest that meets the definition of financial services income and $20 of high withholding tax interest. S makes a $100 interest payment to P. The interest payment to P is subject to a withholding tax of 15 percent. Twenty dollars ($20) of the interest payment to P is considered to be high withholding tax interest because, under section 904(d)(3), it is allocable to the high withholding tax interest earned by S. The remaining eighty dollars ($80) of the interest payment is also treated as high withholding tax interest to P because, under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, interest that is subject to a high withholding tax but would not be considered to be high withholding tax interest under the look-through rules of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, shall be treated as high withholding tax interest to the extent that the interest would have been treated as financial services interest income under the look-through rules of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Application of look-through rules to certain domestic corporations. The principles of section 904(d)(3) and this section shall apply to any foreign source interest, rents and royalties paid by a United States corporation to a related corporation. For this purpose, a United States corporation and another corporation are considered to be related if one owns, directly or indirectly, stock possessing more than 50 percent of the total voting power of all classes of stock of the other corporation or more than 50 percent of the total value of the other corporation. In addition, a United States corporation and another corporation shall be considered to be related if the same United States shareholders own, directly or indirectly, stock possessing more than 50 percent of the total voting power of all classes of stock or more than 50 percent of the total value of each corporation. For purposes of this paragraph, the constructive stock ownership rules of section 318 and the regulations under that section apply. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2001, this paragraph (g) shall be applied by substituting ``50 percent or more'' for ``more than 50 percent'' each place it appears.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Application of look-through rules to partnerships and other pass-through entities--(1) General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, a partner's distributive share of partnership income shall be characterized as income in a separate category to the extent that the distributive share is a share of income earned or accrued by the partnership in such category. Payments to a partner described in section 707 (e.g., payments to a partner not acting in capacity as a partner) shall be characterized as income in a separate category to the extent that the payment is attributable under the principles of Sec. 1.861-8 and this section to income earned or accrued by the partnership in such category, if the payments are interest, rents, or royalties that would be characterized under the look-through rules of this section if the partnership were a foreign corporation, and the partner who receives the payment owns 10 percent or more of the value of the partnership. A payment by a partnership to a member of the controlled group (as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section) of the partner shall be characterized under the look-through rules of this section if the payment would be a section 707 payment entitled to look-through

treatment if it were made to the partner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exception for certain partnership interests--(i) Rule. Except as otherwise provided, if any limited partner or corporate general partner owns less than 10 percent of the value in a partnership, the partner's distributive share of partnership income from the partnership shall be passive income to the partner, and the partner's distributive share of partnership deductions from the partnership shall be allocated and apportioned under the principles of Sec. 1.861-8 only to the partner's passive income from that partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exceptions. To the extent a partner's distributive share of income from a partnership is a share of high withholding tax interest received or accrued by the partnership, that partner's distributive share of partnership income will be high withholding tax interest regardless of the partner's level of ownership in the partnership. If a partnership interest described in paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section is held in the ordinary course of a partner's active trade or business, the rules of paragraph (h)(1) of this section shall apply for purposes of characterizing the partner's distributive share of the partnership income. A partnership interest will be considered to be held in the ordinary course of a partner's active trade or business if the partner (or a member of the partner's affiliated group of corporations (within the meaning of section 1504(a) and without regard to section 1504(b)(3))) engages (other than through a less than 10 percent interest in a partnership) in the same or related trade or business as the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Income from the sale of a partnership interest--(i) In general. To the extent a partner recognizes gain on the sale of a partnership interest, that income shall be treated as passive category income to the partner, unless the income is considered to be high-taxed under section 904(d)(2)(B)(iii)(II) and Sec. 1.904-4(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exception for sale by 25-percent owner. In the case of a sale of an interest in a partnership by a partner that is a 25-percent owner of the partnership, determined by applying section 954(c)(4)(B) and substituting ``controlled foreign corporation'' with ``partner'' every place it appears, for purposes of determining the separate category to which the income recognized on the sale of the partnership interest is assigned such partner shall be treated as selling the proportionate share of the assets of the partnership attributable to such interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Value of a partnership interest. For purposes of paragraphs (i), (h)(1), and (h)(2) of this section, a partner will be considered as owning 10 percent of the value of a partnership for a particular year if the partner has 10 percent of the capital and profits interest of the partnership. Similarly, a partnership (first partnership) is considered as owning 50 percent of the value of another partnership (second partnership) if the first partnership owns 50 percent of the capital and profits interests of another partnership. For this purpose, value will be determined at the end of the partnership's taxable year. Similarly, a partnership (first partnership) is considered as owning more than 50 percent of the value of another partnership (second partnership) if the first partnership owns more than 50 percent of the capital and profits interests of the second partnership. For this purpose, value will be determined at the end of the partnership's taxable year. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2001, the second preceding sentence shall be applied by substituting ``50 percent'' for ``more than 50 percent''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Application of look-through rules to related entities--(1) In general. Except as provided in paragraphs (i)(2), (3), and (4) of this section, the principles of this section shall apply to distributions and payments that are subject to the look-through rules of section 904(d)(3) and this section from a controlled foreign corporation or other entity otherwise entitled to look-through treatment (a ``look-through entity'') under this section to a related look-through entity. A noncontrolled section 902 corporation shall be considered a look-through entity only to the extent provided in paragraph (i)(4) of this section. Two look-through entities shall be considered to be related to each other if one owns, directly or indirectly, stock possessing more than 50 percent of the

total voting power of all classes of voting stock of the other entity or more than 50 percent of the total value of such entity. In addition, two look-through entities are related if the same United States shareholders own, directly or indirectly, stock possessing more than 50 percent of the total voting power of all voting classes of stock (in the case of a corporation) or more than 50 percent of the total value of each look-through entity. In the case of a corporation, value shall be determined by taking into account all classes of stock. In the case of a partnership, value shall be determined under the rules in paragraph (h)(4) of this section. For purposes of this section, indirect ownership shall be determined under section 318 and the regulations under that section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exception for distributive shares of partnership income. In the case of tiered partnership arrangements, a distributive share of partnership income will be characterized under the look-through rules of section 904(d)(3) and this section if the partner meets the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section with respect to the partnership (first partnership), whether or not the income is received through another partnership or partnerships (second partnership) and whether or not the first partnership and the second partnership are considered to be related under the rules of paragraph (i)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special rule for dividends between controlled foreign corporations. Solely for purposes of dividend payments between controlled foreign corporations, two controlled foreign corporations shall be considered related look-through entities if the same United States shareholder owns, directly or indirectly, at least 10 percent of the total voting power of all classes of stock of each foreign corporation. If two controlled foreign corporations are not considered related look-through entities for purposes of this section because a United States shareholder does not satisfy the ownership requirement set forth in this paragraph (i)(3), the dividend payment will be characterized under the look-through rules of section 904(d)(4) and this section if the requirements set forth in paragraph (i)(4) of this section are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Payor and recipient of dividend are members of the same qualified group. Solely for purposes of dividend payments in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2002, between controlled foreign corporations, noncontrolled section 902 corporations, or a controlled foreign corporation and a noncontrolled section 902 corporation, the payor and recipient corporations shall be considered related look-through entities if the corporations are members of the same qualified group as defined in section 902(b)(2) and the recipient corporation is eligible to compute foreign taxes deemed paid with respect to the dividend under section 902(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (i):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. P, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of S, a controlled foreign corporation. S owns 40 percent of the stock of T, a Country X corporation that is a controlled foreign corporation. The remaining 60 percent of the stock of T is owned by V, a domestic corporation. The percentages of value and voting power of T owned by S and V correspond to their percentages of stock ownership. T owns 40 percent (by vote and value) of the stock of U, a Country Z corporation that is a controlled foreign corporation. The remaining 60 percent of U is owned by unrelated U.S. persons. U earns exclusively general limitation non-subpart F income. In 2001, U makes an interest payment of $100 to T. Look-through principles do not apply because T and U are not related look-through entities under paragraph (i)(1) of this section (because T does not own more than 50 percent of the voting power or value of U). The interest is passive income to T, and is subpart F income to P and V. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, look-through principles determine P and V's characterization of the subpart F inclusion from T. P and V therefore must characterize the inclusion as passive income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that instead of a $100 interest payment, U pays a $50 dividend to T in 2001. P and V each own, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent of the voting power of all classes of stock of both T and U. Pursuant to paragraph (i)(3) of this section, for purposes of applying this section to the dividend from U to T, U and T are treated as related look-through entities. Therefore, look-through principles apply to characterize the dividend income as general limitation income to T. The dividend is subpart F income

of T that is taxable to P and V. The subpart F inclusions of P and V are also subject to look-through principles, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and are characterized as general limitation income to P and V because the income is general limitation income of T.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that U pays both a $100 interest payment and a $50 dividend to T, and T owns 80 percent (by vote and value) of U. Under paragraph (i)(1) of this section, T and U are related look-through entities, because T owns more than 50 percent (by vote and value) of U. Therefore, look-through principles apply to both the interest and dividend income paid or accrued by U to T, and T treats both types of income as general limitation income. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, P and V apply look-through principles to the resulting subpart F inclusions, which therefore are also general limitation income to P and V.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. P, a domestic corporation, owns all of the voting stock of S, a controlled foreign corporation. S owns 5 percent of the voting stock of T, a controlled foreign corporation. The remaining 95 percent of the stock of T is owned by P. In 2006, T pays a $50 dividend to S and a $950 dividend to P. The dividend to S is not eligible for look-through treatment under paragraph (i)(4) of this section, and S is not eligible to compute an amount of foreign taxes deemed paid with respect to the dividend from T, because S and T are not members of the same qualified group (S owns less than 10 percent of the voting stock of T). See section 902(b) and Sec. 1.902-1(a)(3). However, the dividend is eligible for look-through treatment under paragraph (i)(3) of this section because P owns at least 10 percent of the voting power of all classes of stock of both S and T. The dividend is subpart F income of S that is taxable to P.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. P, a domestic corporation, owns 50 percent of the voting stock of S, a controlled foreign corporation. S owns 10 percent of the voting stock of T, a controlled foreign corporation. The remaining 50 percent of the stock of S and the remaining 90 percent of the stock of T are owned, respectively, by X and Y. X and Y are each United States shareholders of T but are not related to P, S, or each other. In 2006, T pays a $100 dividend to S. The dividend is not eligible for look-through treatment under paragraph (i)(3) of this section because no United States shareholder owns at least 10 percent of the voting power of all classes of stock of both S and T (P and X each own only 5 percent of T). However, the dividend is eligible for look-through treatment under paragraph (i)(4) of this section, and S is eligible to compute an amount of foreign taxes deemed paid with respect to the dividend from T, because S and T are members of the same qualified group. See section 902(b) and Sec. 1.902-1(a)(3). The dividend is subpart F income of S that is taxable to P and X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Look-through rules applied to passive foreign investment company inclusions. If a passive foreign investment company is a controlled foreign corporation and the taxpayer is a United States shareholder in that passive foreign investment company, any amount included in gross income under section 1293 shall be treated as income in a separate category to the extent the amount so included is attributable to income received or accrued by that controlled foreign corporation that is described as income in the separate category. For purposes of this paragraph (j), the priority rules of Sec. 1.904-4(l) shall apply prior to the application of the rules of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Ordering rules--(1) In general. Income received or accrued by a related person to which the look-through rules apply is characterized before amounts included from, or paid or distributed by that person and received or accrued by a related person. For purposes of determining the character of income received or accrued by a person from a related person if the payor or another related person also receives or accrues income from the recipient and the look-through rules apply to the income in all cases, the rules of paragraph (k)(2) of this section apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Specific rules. For purposes of characterizing income under this paragraph, the following types of income are characterized in the order stated:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Rents and royalties;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Interest;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Subpart F inclusions and distributive shares of partnership income;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Dividend distributions.

If an entity is both a recipient and a payor of income described in any one of the categories described in (k)(2) (i) through (iv) of this section, the income received will be characterized before the income that is paid. In addition, the amount of interest paid or accrued, directly or indirectly, by a person to a related person shall be offset against and eliminate any interest received or accrued, directly or indirectly, by a person from that related person before application of the ordering rules of this paragraph. In a case in which a person pays or accrues interest to a related

person, and also receives or accrues interest indirectly from the related person, the smallest interest payment is eliminated and the amount of all other interest payments are reduced by the amount of the smallest interest payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of paragraphs (g), (h), (i), and (k) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. S and T, controlled foreign corporations, are wholly-owned subsidiaries of P, a domestic corporation. S and T are incorporated in two different foreign countries and T is a financial services entity. In 1987, S earns $100 of income that is general limitation foreign base company sales income. After expenses, including a $50 interest payment to T, S's income is subject to foreign tax at an effective rate of 40 percent. P elects to exclude S's $50 of net income from subpart F under section 954(b)(4). T earns $350 of income that consists of $300 of subpart F financial services income and $50 of interest received from S. The $50 of interest is foreign personal holding company income in T's hands because section 954(c)(3)(A)(i) (same country exception for interest payments) does not apply. The $50 of interest is also general limitation income to T because S and T are related look-through entities within the meaning of paragraph (i)(1) of this section and, therefore the look-through rules of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section apply to characterize the interest payment. Thus, with respect to T, P includes in its gross income $50 of general limitation foreign personal holding company income and $300 of financial services income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example (1) except that instead of earning $100 of general limitation foreign base company sales income, S earns $100 of foreign personal holding company income that is passive income. Although the interest payment to T would otherwise be passive income, T is a financial services entity and, under Sec. 1.904-4(e)(1), the income is treated as financial services income in T's hands. Thus, P's entire $350 section 951 inclusion consists of financial services income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. P, a domestic corporation, wholly-owns S, a domestic corporation that is a 80/20 corporation. In 1987, S's earnings consist of $100 of foreign source shipping income and $100 of foreign source high withholding tax interest. S makes a $100 foreign source interest payment to P. The interest payment to P is subject to the look-through rules of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, and is characterized as shipping income and high withholding tax interest to the extent that it is allocable to such income in S's hands.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. PS is a domestic partnership that is the sole shareholder of controlled foreign corporation S. PS has two general partners, A and B. A and B each have a greater than 10 percent interest in PS. PS also has two limited partners, C and D. C has a 50 percent interest in the partnership and D has a 9 percent interest. A, B, C and D are all United States persons. In 1987, S has $100 of general limitation non-subpart F income on which it pays no foreign tax. S pays a $100 dividend to PS. The dividend is the only income of PS. Under the look-through rule of paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the dividend to PS is general limitation income. Under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, A's, B's, and C's distributive shares of PS's income are general limitation income. Under paragraph (h)(2) of this section, because D is a limited partner with a less than 10 percent interest in PS, D's distributive share of PS's income is passive income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. P has a 25 percent interest in partnership PS that he sells to X for $110. P's basis in his partnership interest is $35. P recognizes $75 of gain on the sale of its partnership interest and is subject to no foreign tax. Under paragraph (h)(3) of this section, the gain is treated as passive income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. P, a domestic corporation, owns 100 percent of the stock of S, a controlled foreign corporation, and S owns 100 percent of the stock of T, a controlled foreign corporation. S has $100 of passive foreign personal holding company income from unrelated persons and $100 of general limitation income. S also has $50 of interest income from T. S pays T $100 of interest. Under paragraph (k)(2) of this section, the $100 interest payment from S to T is reduced for limitation purposes to the extent of the $50 interest payment from T to S before application of the rules in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. Therefore, the interest payment from T to S is disregarded. S is treated as if it paid $50 of interest to T, all of which is allocable to S's passive foreign personal holding company income. Therefore the $50 interest payment from S to T is passive income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. P, a domestic corporation, owns 100 percent of the stock of S, a controlled foreign corporation. S owns 100 percent of the stock of T, a controlled foreign corporation and 100 percent of the stock of U, a controlled foreign corporation. In 1988, T pays S $5 of interest, S pays U $10 of interest and U pays T $20 of interest. Under paragraph (k)(2) of this section, the interest payments from S to U must be offset by the amount of interest that S is considered as receiving indirectly from U and the interest payment from U to T is offset by the amount of the interest payment that U is considered as receiving indirectly from T. The $l0 payment by S to U is reduced by $5, the amount of the interest payment from T to S that is treated as being paid indirectly by U to S. Similarly, the $20 interest payment from U to T is reduced by $5, the amount of the interest payment from

S to U that is treated as being paid indirectly by T to U. Therefore, under paragraph (k)(2) of this section, T is treated as having made no interest payment to S, S is treated as having paid $5 of interest to U, and U is treated as having paid $15 to T.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8.

T pays S $100 of interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (k)(2) of this section, the $100 interest payment from T to S reduces the $150 interest payment from S to T.

In 1987, S earns $100 of passive foreign personal holding company income and $200 of non-subpart F general limitation income from unrelated persons. S also receives $150 of dividend income from T. S pays $100 of interest to T and $100 of interest to U. U earns $300 of non-subpart F general limitation income and the $100 of interest received from S. U pays a $100 royalty to T.

With respect to T, the royalty is general limitation income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under paragraph (k)(2)(ii) of this section, the interest payments from S to T and U are characterized next. This characterization is done without regard to any dividend income received by S because, under paragraph (k)(2) of this section, dividends are characterized after interest payments from a related person. The interest payments are first allocable to S's passive income under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section. Therefore, $50 of the interest payment to T is passive and $50 of the interest payment to U is passive. The remaining $50 paid to T is general limitation income and the remaining $50 paid to U is general limitation income. All of the interest payments to T and U are subpart F foreign personal holding company income to both recipients.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Under paragraph (k)(2)(iii) of this section, P has a $100 subpart F inclusion with respect to T that is characterized next. Fifty dollars ($50) of the subpart F inclusion is passive income to P because it is attributable to the passive income portion of the interest income received by T from S, and $50 of the inclusion is treated as general limitation income to P because it is attributable to the general limitation portion of the interest income received by T from S. Under paragraph (k)(2)(iii) of this section, P also has a $100 subpart F inclusion with respect to U. Fifty dollars ($50) of the subpart F inclusion is passive income to P because it is attributable to the passive portion of the interest income received by U from S, and $50 of the inclusion is general limitation income to P because it is attributable to the general limitation portion of the interest income received by U from S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Under paragraph (k)(2)(iv) of this section, the $150 distribution from T to S is characterized next. One-hundred dollars ($100) of the distribution is out of earnings and profits attributable to previously taxed income. Therefore, only $50 is a dividend that is subject to the look-through rules of paragraph (d) of this section. The $50 dividend is attributable to T's general limitation income and is general limitation income to S in its entirety.</p><p class="depth0">Example 10.

The interest payments are first allocated under the rule of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section to S's passive income. Therefore, under that provision and paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, $50 of the interest payment to T is passive income to T and $50 of the interest payment to U is passive income to U. The remaining $50 paid to T is general limitation income and the remaining $50 paid to U is general limitation income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under paragraph (k)(2)(iii) of this section, any subpart F inclusion of P is determined and characterized next. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (c)(2)(ii) apply not only for purposes of determining the separate category of income of S to which the interest payments from S to T and U are allocable but also for purposes of determining the subpart F income of T and U. Although the interest payments from S to T and U are ``same country'' interest payments that would otherwise be excludible from T's and U's subpart F income under section 954(c)(3)(A)(i), section 954(c)(3)(B) provides that the exception for same country payments between related persons shall not apply to the extent such payments have reduced the subpart F income of the payor. In this case, $50 of the $100 interest payment from S to T reduced S's subpart F income and $50 of the $100 interest payment from S to U reduced the remaining $50 of S's subpart F income. Therefore, T has $50 of subpart F income that is passive income and U has $50 of subpart F income that is passive income. P includes $100 of subpart F income in gross income that is passive income to P.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The remaining $50 of interest paid by S to T and the remaining $50 of interest paid by S to U is not subpart F income to T or U because it did not reduce S's subpart F income and is therefore eligible for the same country exception.</p><p class="depth0">Example 11. P, a domestic corporation, owns 100 percent of the stock of S, a controlled foreign corporation, and S owns 100 percent of the stock of T, a controlled foreign corporation. P also owns 100 percent of the stock of U, a controlled foreign corporation. In 1991, T earns $100 of general limitation income that is not subpart F income and distributes the entire amount to S as a dividend. S earns $100 of passive foreign personal holding company income and the $100 dividend from T. S pays $100 of interest to U. U earns $200 of general limitation income that is foreign base company income and $100 of interest income from S. This transaction does not involve circular payments and, therefore, the ordering rules of paragraph (k)(2) of this section do not apply. Instead, pursuant to paragraph (k)(1) of this section, income received is characterized first. T's earnings and, thus, the dividend from T to S are characterized first. S includes the $100 dividend from T in gross income as general limitation income because all of T's earnings are general limitation income. S thus has $100 of passive foreign personal holding company income and $100 of general limitation income. The interest payment to U is then characterized as $100 passive income under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section (allocation of related person interest to passive foreign personal holding company income). For 1991, U thus has $200 of general limitation income that is subpart F income, and $100 of passive foreign personal holding company income. For 1991, P includes in its gross income $200 of general limitation subpart F income from U, $100 of passive subpart F income from U (relating to the interest payment from S to U), and $100 of general limitation subpart F income from S (relating to the dividend from T to S).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Application of section 904(h)--(1) In general. This paragraph (m) applies to certain amounts derived from controlled foreign corporations and noncontrolled section 902 corporations that are treated as United States-owned foreign corporations as defined in section 904(h)(6). For purposes of determining the portion of an interest payment that is allocable to income earned or accrued by a controlled foreign corporation or noncontrolled section 902 corporation from sources within the United States under section 904(h)(3), the rules in paragraph (m)(2) of this section apply. For purposes of determining the portion of a dividend (or amount treated as a dividend, including amounts described in section 951(a)(1)(B)) paid or accrued by a controlled foreign corporation or noncontrolled section 902 corporation that is treated as from sources within the United States under section 904(h)(4), the rules in paragraph (m)(4) of this section apply. For purposes of determining the portion of an amount included in gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A) or 1293 that is attributable to income of the controlled foreign corporation or noncontrolled section 902 corporation from sources within the United States under section 904(h)(2), the rules in paragraph (m)(5) of this section apply. In order to determine whether section 904(h) applies, section 904(h)(5) (exception if a United States-

owned foreign corporation has a de minimis amount of United States source income) shall be applied to the total amount of earnings and profits of a controlled foreign corporation or noncontrolled section 902 corporation for a taxable year without regard to the characterization of those earnings under section 904(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Treatment of interest payments.-- (i) Interest payments from controlled foreign corporations.

If related person interest is less than or equal to passive income, the related person interest will be allocable to United States source passive income based on the ratio of United States source passive income to total passive income. To the extent that related person interest exceeds passive income, and, therefore, is allocated under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(D) of this section to income in a separate category other than passive, the following formulas apply in determining the portion of the interest payment that is from sources within the United States.

Sec. 1.904-6  Allocation and apportionment of taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Allocation and apportionment of taxes to a separate category or categories of income--(1) In general--(i) Taxes related to a separate category of income. The amount of foreign taxes paid or accrued with respect to a separate category of income (including United States source income) shall include only those taxes that are related to income in that separate category. Taxes are related to income if the income is included in the base upon which the tax is imposed. If, for example, foreign law exempts certain types of income from foreign taxes, or certain types of income are exempt from foreign tax under an income tax convention, then no taxes are considered to be related to such income for purposes of this paragraph. As another example, if foreign law provides for a specific rate of tax with respect to certain types of income (e.g., capital gains), or certain expenses, deductions, or credits are allowed under foreign law only with respect to a particular type of income, then such provisions shall be taken into account in determining the amount of foreign tax imposed on such income. A withholding tax (unless it is a withholding tax that is not the final tax payable on the income as described in Sec. 1.904-4(d)) is related to the income from which it is withheld. A tax that is imposed on a base that includes more than one separate category of income is considered to be imposed on income in all such categories, and, thus, the taxes are related to all such categories

included within the foreign country or possession's taxable income base.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Apportionment of taxes related to more than one separate category. If a tax is related to more than one separate category, then, in order to determine the amount of the tax paid or accrued with respect to each separate category, the tax shall be apportioned on an annual basis among the separate categories on the basis of the following formula:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC07OC91.039

For purposes of apportioning foreign taxes among the separate categories, gross income is determined under the law of the foreign country or a possession of the United States to which the foreign income taxes have been paid or accrued. Gross income, as determined under foreign law, in the passive category shall first be reduced by any related person interest expense that is allocated to the income under the principles of section 954(b)(5) and Sec. 1.904-5(c)(2)(ii)(C) (adjusted gross passive income). Gross income in all separate categories (including adjusted gross passive income) is next reduced by deducting any expenses, losses, or other amounts that are deductible under foreign law that are specifically allocable to the gross amount of such income under the laws of that foreign country or possession. If expenses are not specifically allocated under foreign law then the expenses will be apportioned under the principles of foreign law but only after taking into account the reduction of passive income by the application of section 954(b)(5). Thus, for example, if foreign law provides that expenses will be apportioned on a gross income basis, the gross income amounts will be those amounts determined under foreign law except that, in the case of passive income, the amount will be adjusted gross passive income. If foreign law does not provide for the direct allocation or apportionment of expenses, losses, or other deductions to a particular category of income, then the principles of Sec. Sec. 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T and section 954(b)(5) shall apply in allocating and apportioning such expenses, losses, or other deductions to gross income as determined under foreign law after reduction of passive income by the amount of related person interest allocated to passive income under section 954(b)(5) and Sec. 1.904-5(c)(2)(ii)(C). For example, the principles of Sec. Sec. 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T apply to require definitely related expenses to be directly allocated to particular categories of gross income and provide the methods of apportioning expenses that are definitely related to more than one category of gross income or that are not definitely related to any particular category of gross income. For this purpose, the apportionment of expenses required to be made under Sec. Sec. 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T need not be made on other than a separate company basis. The rules in this paragraph apply only for purposes of the apportionment of taxes among separate categories of income and do not affect the computation of a taxpayer's foreign tax credit limitation with respect to a specific category of income. If the taxpayer applies the principles of Sec. Sec. 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T for purposes of allocating expenses at the level of the taxpayer (or at the level of the qualified business unit, foreign subsidiary, or other entity that paid or accrued the foreign taxes) under this paragraph (a)(1)(ii), such principles shall be applied (for such purposes) in the same manner as the taxpayer applies such principles in determining the income or earnings and profits for United States tax purposes of the taxpayer (or of the qualified business unit, foreign subsidiary, or other entity that paid or accrued the foreign taxes, as

the case may be). For example, a taxpayer must use the modified gross income method under Sec. 1.861-9T when applying the principles of that section for purposes of this paragraph (a)(1)(ii) to determine the amount of a controlled foreign corporation's income, in each separate category, that is taxed by a foreign country, if the taxpayer applies the modified gross income method under Sec. 1.861-9T(f)(3) when applying Sec. 1.861-9T to determine the income and earnings and profits of the controlled foreign corporation for United States tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Apportionment of taxes for purposes of applying the high-tax income test. If taxes have been allocated and apportioned to passive income under the rules of paragraph (a)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section, the taxes must further be apportioned to the groups of income described in Sec. 1.904-4(c) (3), (4) and (5) for purposes of determining if the group is high-taxed income. Taxes will be related to income in a particular group under the same rules as those in paragraph (a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section except that those rules shall be applied by substituting the term ``group'' for the term ``category.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Special rule for base and timing differences. If, under the law of a foreign country or possession of the United States, a tax is imposed on an item of income that does not constitute income under United States tax principles, that tax shall be treated as imposed with respect to general limitation income. If, under the law of a foreign country or possession of the United States, a tax is imposed on an item that would be income under United States tax principles in another year, that tax will be allocated to the appropriate separate category or categories as if the income were recognized under United States tax principles in the year in which the tax was imposed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Application of paragraph (a) to sections 902 and 960--(1) Determination of foreign taxes deemed paid. If, for the taxable year, there is included in the gross income of a domestic corporation under section 951 an amount attributable to the earnings and profits of a controlled foreign corporation for any taxable year and the amount included consists of income in more than one separate category of the controlled foreign corporation, then the domestic corporation shall be deemed to have paid only a portion of the taxes paid or accrued, or deemed paid or accrued, by the controlled foreign corporation that are allocated to each separate category to which the inclusion is attributable. The portion of the taxes allocated to a particular separate category that shall be deemed paid by the United States shareholder shall be equal to the taxes allocated to that separate category multiplied by the amount of the inclusion with respect to that category (as determined under Sec. 1.904-5(c)(1)) and divided by the earnings and profits of the controlled foreign corporation with respect to that separate category (in accordance with Sec. 1.904-5(c)(2)(ii)). The rules of this paragraph (b)(1) also apply for purposes of computing the foreign taxes deemed paid by United States shareholders of controlled foreign corporations under section 902.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Distributions received from foreign corporations that are excluded from gross income under section 959(b). The principles of this paragraph shall be applied to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any portion of a distribution received from a first-tier corporation by a domestic corporation or individual that is excluded from the domestic corporation's or individual's income under section 959(a) and Sec. 1.959-1; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any portion of a distribution received from an immediately lower-tier corporation by a second- or first-tier corporation that is excluded from such foreign corporation's gross income under section 959(b) and Sec. 1.959-2, if such distribution is treated as a dividend pursuant to Sec. 1.960-2(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Application of section 78. For purposes of treating taxes deemed paid by a taxpayer under section 902(a) and section 960(a)(1) as a dividend under section 78, taxes that were allocated to income in a separate category shall be treated as income in that same separate category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Increase in limitation. The amount of the increase in the foreign tax credit limitation allowed by section 960(b) and Sec. 1.960-4 shall be determined with

regard to the applicable category of income under section 904(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. M, a domestic corporation, conducts business in foreign country X. M earns $400 of shipping income, $200 of general limitation income and $200 of passive income as determined under foreign law. Under foreign law, none of M's expenses are directly allocated or apportioned to a particular category of income. Under the principles of Sec. Sec. 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T, M apportions $75 of directly allocable expenses to shipping income, $10 of directly allocable expenses to general limitation income, and no such expenses to passive income. M also apportions expenses that are not directly allocable to a specific class of gross income--$40 to shipping income, $20 to general limitation income, and $20 to passive income. Therefore, for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, M has $285 of net shipping income, $170 of net general limitation income, and $180 of net passive income. Country X imposes tax of $100 on a base that includes M's shipping income and general limitation income. Country X exempts passive income from tax. The tax paid by M is related to M's shipping and general limitation income. The $100 tax is apportioned between those limitations. Thus, M is considered to have paid $63 of X tax on its shipping income ($100 x $285/$455) and $37 of tax on its general limitation income ($100 x $170/$455). None of the X tax is allocated to M's passive income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1 except that X does not exempt all passive income from tax but only exempts interest income. M's passive income consists of $100 of gross dividend income, to which $10 of expenses that are not directly allocable are apportioned, and $100 of interest income, to which $10 of expenses that are not directly allocable are apportioned. The $90 of net dividend income is subject to X tax, and $90 of net interest income is exempt from X tax. M pays $130 of tax to X. The $130 of tax is related to M's general, shipping, and passive income. The tax is apportioned among those limitations as follows: $68 to shipping income ($130 x $285/$545) $41 to general limitation income ($130 x $170/$545), and $21 to passive income ($130 x $90/$545).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. P, a domestic corporation, owns 100 percent of S, a controlled foreign corporation organized in country X. S owns l00 percent of T, a controlled foreign corporation that is also organized in country X. Country X grants group relief to S and T. In 1987, S earns $100 of income and T incurs an $80 loss. Under country X's group relief provisions, only $20 of S's income is subject to country X tax. Country X imposes a 30 percent tax on this income ($6). P includes $100 of S's income in gross income under section 951. Six dollars ($6) of foreign tax is related to that income for purposes of section 960.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. P, a domestic corporation, owns 100 percent of S, a controlled foreign corporation organized in country X and 100 percent of T, a controlled foreign corporation organized in country Y. T has $200 of gross manufacturing general limitation income and $50 of passive income. T also pays S $100 for shipping T's goods, a price that may be justified under section 482. T has no other expenses and S has no other income or expense. T's income and earnings and profits are the same. Foreign country X does not tax S on its shipping income. Foreign country Y taxes all of T's income at a rate of 20 percent. Under the law of foreign country Y, T is only allowed a $50 deduction for the payment to S. Therefore, for foreign law purposes, T has $150 of manufacturing income and earnings and profits and $50 of passive income and earnings and profits upon which it pays $40 of tax. Under the principles of foreign law, $30 of that tax is imposed on the general limitation manufacturing income and $10 of the tax is imposed on passive income. Therefore, the foreign effective rate on the general limitation income is 30 percent and the foreign effective rate on the passive income is 20 percent. T has $100 of general limitation income and $50 of passive income and pays $30 of general limitation taxes and $10 of passive taxes. S has $100 of shipping income and pays no foreign tax.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. R, a domestic corporation, owns 50 percent of T, a foreign corporation that is not a controlled foreign corporation and that is organized in foreign country X. R licenses certain property to T. T then relicenses this property to a third person. In 1987, T paid R a royalty of $100 all of which is treated as passive income to R because it was not an active royalty as defined in Sec. 1.904-4(b)(2). R has $10 of expenses associated with the royalty income and no foreign tax was imposed on the royalty so the high-tax kickout does not apply. In 1988, the Commissioner determined that the correct arm's length royalty was $150 and under the authority of section 482 reallocated an additional $50 of income to R for 1987. Under a closing agreement with the Commissioner, R elected the benefits of Rev. Proc. 65-17 in relation to the income reallocated from R and established an account receivable from T. In 1988, T paid R an additional $50 to reflect the section 482 adjustment and the account receivable that was established because of the adjustment. Foreign country X treats the $50 payment in 1988 as a dividend by T and imposes a $10 withholding tax on the payment. Under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the $10 of withholding tax is treated as fully allocable to the $50 payment because under foreign law the tax is imposed only on that income. For

U.S. purposes, the income is not characterized as a dividend but as a repayment of a bona fide debt and, therefore, the $50 of income is not required to be recognized by R in 1988. The $10 of tax is treated as a tax paid in 1988 on the $50 of passive income included by R in 1987 pursuant to the section 482 adjustment rather than as a tax associated with a dividend from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation. The $10 tax is a tax imposed on passive income under paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. P, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of S, a controlled foreign corporation that is incorporated in country X. In 2004, S has $100 of passive income, $200 of shipping income and $200 of general limitation income. S also has $100 of related person interest expense and $100 of other expenses that under foreign law are directly allocable to the general limitation income of S. S has no other expenses. Country X imposes a tax of 25 percent on all of the net income of S and S, therefore, pays $75 in foreign tax. Under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the passive income of S is first reduced by the amount of related person interest for purposes of determining the net amount for purposes of allocating the $75 of tax. Under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the general limitation income of S is reduced by the $100 of other expenses. Therefore, $50 of the foreign tax is allocated to the shipping income of S ($50 = $75 x $200/$300), $25 is allocated to the general limitation income of S ($25 = $75 x $100/$300), and no taxes are allocated to S's passive income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Domestic corporation P owns all of the stock of controlled foreign corporation S, which owns all of the stock of controlled foreign corporation T. All such corporations use the calendar year as the taxable year. Assume that earnings and profits are equal to net income and that the income amounts are identical under United States and foreign law principles. In 1987, T earns (before foreign taxes) $187.50 of net passive income and $62.50 of net general limitation income and pays $50 of foreign taxes. S earns no income in 1987 and pays no foreign taxes. For 1987, P is required under section 951 to include in gross income $175 attributable to the earnings and profits of T for that year. One hundred and fifty dollars ($150) of the subpart F inclusion is attributable to passive income earned by T, and $25 of the subpart F inclusion is attributable to general limitation income earned by T. In 1988, T earns no income and pays no foreign taxes. T pays a $200 dividend to S, consisting of $175 from its earnings and profits attributable to amounts required to be included in P's gross income with respect to T and $25 from its other earnings and profits. Assume that no withholding tax is imposed with respect to the distribution from T to S. In 1988, S earns $100 of net general limitation income and receives a $200 dividend from T. S pays $30 in foreign taxes. For 1988, P is required under section 951 to include in gross income $22.50 attributable to the earnings and profits of S for such year. The entire subpart F inclusion is attributable to general limitation income earned by S. In 1988, S pays P a dividend of $247.50, consisting of $157.50 from its earnings and profits attributable to the amount required under section 951 to be included in P's gross income with respect to T, $22.50 from its earnings and profits attributable to the amount required under section 951 to be included in P's gross income with respect to S, and $67.50 from its other earnings and profits. Assume the de minimis rule of section 954(b)(3)(A) and the full inclusion rule of section 954(b)(3)(B) do not apply to the gross amounts of income earned by S and T. The foreign income taxes deemed paid by P for 1987 and 1988 under section 960(a)(1) and section 902(a) are determined as follows on the basis of the following facts and computations.</p><p class="depth0">T corporation (second-tier corporation):1.

Sec. 1.904-7  Transition rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Characterization of distributions and section 951(a)(1) (A) (ii) and (iii) and (B) inclusions of earnings of a controlled foreign corporation accumulated in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987, during taxable years of both the payor controlled foreign corporation and the recipient which begin after December 31, 1986--(1) Distributions and section 951(a)(1) (A) (ii) and (iii) and (B) inclusions. Earnings accumulated in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987, by a foreign corporation that was a controlled foreign corporation when

such earnings were accumulated are characterized in that foreign corporation's hands under section 904(d)(1)(A) (separate limitation interest income) or section 904(d)(1)(E) (general limitation income) (prior to their amendment by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (the Act)) after application of the de minimis rule of former section 904(d)(3)(C) (prior to its amendment by the Act). When, in a taxable year after the effective date of the Act, earnings and profits attributable to such income are distributed to, or included in the gross income of, a United States shareholder under section 951(a)(1) (A) (ii) or (iii) or (B) (hereinafter in this section ``inclusions''), the ordering rules of section 904(d)(3)(D) and Sec. 1.904-5(c)(4) shall be applied in determining initially the character of the income of the distributee or United States shareholder. Thus, a proportionate amount of a distribution described in this paragraph initially will be characterized as separate limitation interest income in the hands of the distributee based on the ratio of the separate limitation interest earnings and profits out of which the dividend was paid to the total earnings and profits out of which the dividend was paid. The distribution or inclusions must then be recharacterized in the hands of the distributee or United States shareholder on the basis of the following principles:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Distributions and inclusions that initially are characterized as separate limitation interest income shall be treated as passive income;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Distributions and inclusions that initially are characterized as old general limitation income shall be treated as general limitation income, unless the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the distribution or inclusion is attributable to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Earnings and profits accumulated with respect to shipping income, as defined in section 904(d)(2)(D) and Sec. 1.904-4(f); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of a financial services entity, earnings and profits accumulated with respect to financial services income, as defined in section 904(d)(2)(C)(ii) and Sec. 1.904-4(e)(1); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Earnings and profits accumulated with respect to high withholding tax interest, as defined in section 904(d)(2)(B) and Sec. 1.904-4(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Limitation on establishing the character of earnings and profits. In order for a taxpayer to establish that distributions or inclusions that are attributable to general limitation earnings and profits of a particular taxable year beginning before January 1, 1987, are attributable to shipping, financial services or high withholding tax interest earnings and profits, the taxpayer must establish the amounts of foreign taxes paid or accrued with respect to income attributable to those earnings and profits that are to be treated as taxes paid or accrued with respect to shipping, financial services or high withholding tax interest income, as the case may be, under section 904(d)(2)(I). Conversely, in order for a taxpayer to establish the amounts of general limitation taxes paid or accrued in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1987, that are to be treated as taxes paid or accrued with respect to shipping, financial services or high withholding tax interest income, as the case may be, the taxpayer must establish the amount of any distributions or inclusions that are attributable to shipping, financial services or high withholding tax interest earnings and profits. For purposes of establishing the amounts of general limitation taxes that are to be treated as taxes paid or accrued with respect to shipping, financial services or high withholding tax interest income, the principles of Sec. 1.904-6 shall be applied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Application of look-through rules to distributions (including deemed distributions) and payments by an entity to a recipient when one's taxable year begins before January 1, 1987 and the other's taxable year begins after December 31, 1986--(1) In general. This paragraph provides rules relating to the application of section 904(d)(3) to payments made by a controlled foreign corporation or other entity to which the look-through rules apply during its taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986, but received in a taxable year of the recipient beginning before January 1, 1987. The paragraph also provides rules relating to distributions (including deemed distributions) or payments made by a controlled foreign corporation to which

section 904(d)(3) (as in effect before the Act) applies during its taxable year beginning before January 1, 1987, and received in a taxable year of the recipient beginning after December 31, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Payor of interest, rents, or royalties is subject to the Act and recipient is not subject to the Act.

To the extent that interest payments in the hands of the recipient are initially characterized as passive income under these rules, they will be treated as separate limitation interest in the hands of the recipient. To the extent that rents or royalties in the hands of the recipient are initially characterized as passive income under these rules, they will be recharacterized as general limitation income in the hands of the recipient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Recipient of interest, rents, or royalties is subject to the Act and payor is not subject to the Act.

Therefore, under former section 904(d)(3)(A), dividends are considered to be paid or derived first from earnings attributable to separate limitation interest income.

payment to P. Because the payment is made prior to July l, 1987 (the first day of S's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986), the look-through rules of section 904(d)(3) do not apply. Assume that, under former section 904(d)(3), the interest payment would be characterized as separate limitation interest income.

Assume that, under former section 904(d)(3), S's earnings and profits for the taxable year ending June 30, 1987, consist of $200 of earnings attributable to general limitation income and $75 of earnings attributable to separate limitation interest income. The portion of the dividend that is attributable to S's separate limitation interest and is treated as separate limitation interest income under former section 904(d)(3) is $75. The remaining $25 of the dividend is treated as general limitation income under former section 904(d)(3). For purposes of determining P's foreign tax credit limitation, $75 of the dividend will be recharacterized as passive income.

The term non-look-through pools means the pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings (as defined in Sec. 1.902-1(a)(9)) that were accumulated, and post-1986 foreign income taxes (as defined in Sec. 1.902-1(a)(8)) paid, accrued, or deemed paid, in and after the first taxable year in which the foreign corporation had a domestic shareholder (as defined in Sec. 1.902-1(a)(1)) but before any such shareholder was eligible for look-through treatment with respect to dividends from the foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Treatment of non-look-through pools of a noncontrolled section 902 corporation. Any undistributed earnings in the non-look-through pool that were accumulated in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2003, by a noncontrolled section 902 corporation as of the last day of the corporation's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2003, shall be treated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2002, as if they were accumulated during a period when a dividend paid by the noncontrolled section 902 corporation to a domestic shareholder would have been eligible for look-through treatment under section 904(d)(4) and Sec. 1.904-5. Post-1986 foreign income taxes paid, accrued or deemed paid with respect to such earnings shall be treated as if they were paid, accrued or deemed paid during a period when the related earnings were eligible for look-through treatment.

Any such earnings and taxes in the non-look-through pools shall constitute the opening balance of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation's pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes on the first day of the foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, in accordance with the rules of paragraph (f)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Treatment of non-look-through pools of a controlled foreign corporation.

Any such undistributed earnings in the non-look-through pool as of the last day of the controlled foreign corporation's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2003, shall be treated in taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2003, as if they were accumulated during a period when a dividend paid by the controlled foreign corporation out of such earnings, or an amount included in the gross income of a United States shareholder under section 951 that is attributable to such earnings, would have been eligible for look-through treatment. Any post-1986 foreign income taxes paid, accrued, or deemed paid with respect to such earnings shall be treated in taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2003, as if they were paid, accrued, or deemed paid during a period when a dividend or inclusion out of such earnings would have been eligible for look-through treatment. Any such undistributed earnings and taxes in the non-look-through pools shall be added to the pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes of the controlled foreign corporation in the appropriate separate categories on the first day of the controlled foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, in accordance with the rules of paragraph (f)(4) of this section.

In order to substantiate the look-through characterization of undistributed earnings and taxes in a non-look-through pool under section 904(d)(4) and Sec. 1.904-5, the taxpayer shall make a reasonable, good-faith effort to reconstruct the non-look-through pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes (and previously-taxed earnings and profits, if any) on a look-through basis for each year in the non-look-through period, beginning with the first taxable year in which post-1986 undistributed earnings were accumulated in the non-look-through pool. Reconstruction shall be based on reasonably available books and records and other relevant information, and it must account for earnings distributed and taxes deemed paid in these years as if they were distributed and deemed paid pro rata from the amounts that were added to the non-look-through pools during the non-look-through period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Safe harbor method. A taxpayer that was eligible for look-through treatment with respect to a distribution from the foreign corporation in the taxpayer's first taxable year ending after the first day of the foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, may allocate the undistributed earnings and taxes in the non-look-through pools to the foreign corporation's look-through pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes in other separate categories on the first day of the foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, in the same percentages as the taxpayer properly characterizes the stock of the foreign corporation in the separate categories for purposes of apportioning the taxpayer's interest expense in its first taxable year ending after the first day of the foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, under Sec. 1.861-12T(c)(3) or Sec. 1.861-12(c)(4), as the case may be. If the modified gross income method described in Sec. 1.861-9T(j) is used

to apportion interest expense of the foreign corporation in its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, the taxpayer must allocate the undistributed earnings and taxes in the non-look-through pools to the foreign corporation's look-through pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes based on an average of the foreign corporation's modified gross income ratios for the foreign corporation's taxable years beginning in 2003 and 2004. A taxpayer may also use the safe harbor method described in this paragraph (f)(4)(ii) to allocate to separate categories any previously-taxed earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(1)(A) that are attributable to the non-look-through pool. A taxpayer may choose to use the safe harbor method on either a timely filed or amended tax return or during an audit. However, a taxpayer that uses the safe harbor method on an amended return or in the course of an audit must make appropriate adjustments to eliminate any duplicate benefits arising from application of the safe harbor method to taxable years that are not open for assessment. A taxpayer's choice to use the safe harbor method is evidenced by employing the method. The taxpayer need not file any separate statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Inadequate substantiation. If a taxpayer does not use, or is ineligible to use, the safe harbor method described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section and the Commissioner determines that the look-through characterization of earnings and taxes in the non-look-through pools cannot reasonably be determined based on the available information, the Commissioner shall allocate the undistributed earnings and taxes in the non-look-through pools to the foreign corporation's passive category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (f)(4):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. P, a domestic corporation, has owned 50 percent of the voting stock of S, a foreign corporation, at all times since January 1, 1987, and S has been a noncontrolled section 902 corporation with respect to P since that date. P and S use the calendar year as their U.S. taxable year. The first year in which post-1986 undistributed earnings were accumulated in the non-look-through pool of S was 1987. As of December 31, 2002, S had 200u of post-1986 undistributed earnings and $100 of post-1986 foreign income taxes in its non-look-through pools. P does not use the safe harbor method under paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section to allocate the earnings and taxes in the non-look-through pools to S's other separate categories and does not attempt to substantiate the look-through characterization of S's non-look-through pools. The Commissioner, however, reasonably determines, based on information used to characterize S's stock for purposes of apportioning P's interest expense in P's 2003 and 2004 taxable years, that 100u of the earnings and all $100 of the taxes in the non-look-through pools are properly assigned on a look-through basis to the general limitation category, and 100u of earnings and no taxes are properly assigned on a look-through basis to the passive category. Therefore, in accordance with the Commissioner's look-through characterization of the earnings and taxes in S's non-look-through pools, on January 1, 2003, S has 100u of post-1986 undistributed earnings and $100 of post-1986 foreign income taxes in the general limitation category and 100u of post-1986 undistributed earnings and no post-1986 foreign income taxes in the passive category.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the Commissioner cannot reasonably determine, based on the available information, the proper look-through characterization of the 200u of undistributed earnings and $100 of taxes in S's non-look-through pools. Accordingly, the Commissioner will assign such earnings and taxes to the passive category, so that as of January 1, 2003, S has 200u of post-1986 undistributed earnings and $100 of post-1986 foreign income taxes in the passive category, and the Commissioner will treat S as a passive category asset for purposes of apportioning P's interest expense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Treatment of a deficit accumulated in a non-look-through pool. Any deficit in the non-look-through pool of a noncontrolled section 902 corporation or a controlled foreign corporation as of the end of its last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2003, shall be treated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2002, as if the deficit had been accumulated during a period in which a dividend paid by the foreign corporation would have been eligible for look-through treatment. In the case of a noncontrolled section 902 corporation, the deficit and taxes, if any, in the non-look-through pools shall constitute the opening balance of the look-

through pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation in the appropriate separate categories on the first day of its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002. In the case of a controlled foreign corporation, the deficit and taxes, if any, in the non-look-through pools shall be added to the balance of the look-through pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes of the controlled foreign corporation in the appropriate separate categories on the first day of its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002. The taxpayer must substantiate the look-through characterization of the deficit and taxes in accordance with the rules of paragraph (f)(4) of this section. If a taxpayer does not use the safe harbor method described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section and the Commissioner determines that the look-through characterization of the deficit and taxes cannot reasonably be determined based on the available information, the Commissioner shall allocate the deficit and taxes, if any, in the non-look-through pools to the foreign corporation's passive category. If, as of the end of a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, in which it pays a dividend, the foreign corporation has zero or a deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings (taking into account any earnings or a deficit accumulated in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2003), the deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings shall be carried back to reduce pre-1987 accumulated profits, if any, on a last-in first-out basis. See Sec. 1.902-2(a)(1). If, as of the end of a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, in which the foreign corporation pays a dividend out of current earnings and profits, it has zero or a deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings (taking into account any earnings or a deficit accumulated in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2003), and the sum of current plus accumulated earnings and profits is zero or less than zero, no foreign taxes shall be deemed paid with respect to the dividend.

Any pre-1987 foreign income taxes (as defined in Sec. 1.902-1(a)(10)(iii)) shall be treated as if they were paid, accrued or deemed paid during a year when a dividend out of the related pre-1987 accumulated profits would have been eligible for look-through treatment. The taxpayer must substantiate the look-through characterization of the pre-1987 accumulated profits and pre-1987 foreign income taxes in accordance with the rules of paragraph (f)(4) of this section.

Dividends paid by a noncontrolled section 902 corporation to a controlled foreign corporation in post-1986 taxable years of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation beginning before January 1, 2003, were assigned to a separate category for dividends from that noncontrolled section 902 corporation. Beginning on the first day of the controlled foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning on or after the first day of the lower-tier corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, any post-1986 undistributed earnings, or previously-taxed earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(1) or (2), of the controlled foreign corporation in such a separate category shall

be treated as if they were accumulated during a period when a dividend paid by the noncontrolled section 902 corporation would have been eligible for look-through treatment. Any post-1986 foreign income taxes in such a separate category shall also be treated as if they were paid, accrued or deemed paid during a period when such a dividend would have been eligible for look-through treatment. Any such post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes in a separate category for dividends from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation shall be added to the opening balance of the controlled foreign corporation's look-through pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes in the appropriate separate categories on the first day of the controlled foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning on or after the first day of the lower-tier corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002. Any section 952(c)(2) recapture account with respect to such a separate category shall be allocated in the same manner as the associated post-1986 undistributed earnings. The taxpayer must substantiate the look-through characterization of such earnings and taxes in accordance with the rules of paragraph (f)(7)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Look-through treatment of deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings at controlled foreign corporation level. If a controlled foreign corporation has a deficit in a separate category for dividends from a lower-tier noncontrolled section 902 corporation that is a member of the controlled foreign corporation's qualified group as defined in section 902(b)(2), such deficit shall be treated in taxable years of the upper-tier corporation beginning on or after the first day of the lower-tier corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, as if the deficit had been accumulated during a period in which a dividend from the lower-tier corporation would have been eligible for look-through treatment. Any post-1986 foreign income taxes in the separate category for dividends from the noncontrolled section 902 corporation shall also be treated as if they were paid, accrued or deemed paid during a period when the dividends were eligible for look-through treatment.

The taxpayer must substantiate the look-through characterization of the deficit and taxes in accordance with the rules of paragraph (f)(7)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Substantiation required for look-through treatment.

Alternatively, the taxpayer may allocate the earnings (or deficit) and taxes to the controlled foreign corporation's look-through pools under the safe harbor method described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section at the level of the controlled foreign corporation. If the taxpayer uses the safe harbor method, the earnings (or deficit) and taxes shall be allocated to the controlled foreign corporation's look-through pools in the appropriate separate categories on the first day of the controlled foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning on or after the first day of the lower-tier corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002. The allocation shall be made in the same percentages as the controlled foreign corporation would properly characterize the stock of the lower-tier noncontrolled section 902 corporation in the separate categories

for purposes of apportioning the controlled foreign corporation's interest expense in its first taxable year ending after the first day of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002. Under Sec. 1.861-12T(c)(3), the apportionment ratios properly used by the controlled foreign corporation are in turn based on the apportionment ratios properly used by the noncontrolled section 902 corporation to apportion its interest expense in its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002. In the case of a taxpayer that uses the safe harbor method where the lower-tier noncontrolled section 902 corporation uses the modified gross income method described in Sec. 1.861-9T(j) to apportion interest expense for its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, earnings (or a deficit) and taxes in the separate category for dividends from the noncontrolled section 902 corporation shall be allocated to the look-through pools based on the average of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation's modified gross income ratios for its taxable years beginning in 2003 and 2004. In the case of a controlled foreign corporation that has in its qualified group a chain of lower-tier noncontrolled section 902 corporations, the safe harbor applies first to characterize the stock of the third-tier corporation and then to characterize the stock of the second-tier corporation. Where a taxpayer uses the safe harbor method with respect to a lower-tier noncontrolled section 902 corporation with respect to which the taxpayer did not meet the requirements of section 902(a) as of the end of the upper-tier controlled foreign corporation's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2003, the earnings (or deficit) and taxes in the separate category for dividends from the lower-tier corporation shall be allocated to the upper-tier corporation's look-through pools in the separate categories in the same percentages as the stock of the lower-tier corporation would have been characterized for purposes of apportioning the upper-tier corporation's interest expense in the last year the taxpayer met the ownership requirements of section 902(a) with respect to the lower-tier corporation if the look-through rules had applied in that year. If a taxpayer does not use the safe harbor method described in this paragraph (f)(7)(iii), and the Commissioner determines that the look-through characterization of the earnings (or deficit) and taxes cannot reasonably be determined based on the available information, the Commissioner shall allocate the earnings (or deficit) and associated foreign income taxes to the controlled foreign corporation's passive category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Treatment of distributions received by an upper-tier corporation from a lower-tier noncontrolled section 902 corporation, including when the corporations do not have the same taxable years--(i) Rule. In the case of dividends paid by a lower-tier noncontrolled section 902 corporation to an upper-tier corporation where both are members of the same qualified group as defined in section 902(b)(2), the following rules apply. Dividends paid by the lower-tier corporation in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2003, are assigned to a separate category for dividends from that corporation, regardless of whether the corresponding taxable year of the recipient corporation began after December 31, 2002. Post-1986 undistributed earnings, previously-taxed earnings and profits, and post-1986 foreign income taxes in such a separate category shall be treated, beginning on the first day of the upper-tier corporation's first taxable year beginning on or after the first day of the lower-tier corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, as if they were accumulated during a period when a dividend paid by the lower-tier corporation would have been eligible for look-through treatment under section 904(d)(4) and Sec. 1.904-5. Dividends paid by a lower-tier corporation in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2002, are eligible for look-through treatment when paid, without regard to whether the corresponding taxable year of the recipient upper-tier corporation began after December 31, 2002.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example.

Accordingly, X and Y are noncontrolled section 902 corporations with respect to M, and X and Y are members of the same qualified group. M and Y use the calendar year as their U.S. taxable year, and X uses a taxable year beginning on July 1.

However, under Sec. 1.861-12(c)(4), M will characterize the stock of X on a look-through basis for purposes of interest expense apportionment in its 2003 taxable year. Under Sec. 1.904-2(h)(1), any unused foreign taxes in M's separate category for dividends from X will be carried over to M's other separate categories on a look-through basis for M's taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2004. Under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, any undistributed earnings and taxes in X's non-look-through pools will be allocated to X's other separate categories on July 1, 2003.

A taxpayer shall be eligible to make such an election provided that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The taxpayer's tax liability as shown on an original or amended tax return for each of its affected taxable years is consistent with the rules of this paragraph (f)(9), the guidance set forth in Notice 2003-5 (2003-1 CB 294) (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter), and the principles of Sec. 1.861-12(c)(4) for each such year for which the statute of limitations does not preclude the filing of an amended return;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The taxpayer makes appropriate adjustments to eliminate any duplicate benefits arising from the application of this paragraph (f)(9) to taxable years that are not open for assessment; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The taxpayer attaches a statement to its next tax return for which the due date (with extensions) is more than 90 days after April 25, 2006, indicating that the taxpayer elects not to apply the provisions of section 403 of the AJCA to taxable years of its noncontrolled section 902 corporations beginning in 2003 and 2004, and that the taxpayer has filed original returns or will file amended returns reflecting tax liabilities for each affected year that satisfy the requirements described in this paragraph (f)(9)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Treatment of non-look-through pools in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2004. Undistributed earnings (or a deficit) and taxes in the non-look-through pools of a controlled foreign corporation or a noncontrolled section 902 corporation as of the end of its last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2005, shall be treated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2004, as if they were accumulated and paid during a period in which a distribution out of earnings in the non-look-through pool would have been eligible for look-through treatment. Such earnings (or deficit) and taxes shall be added to the foreign corporation's pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes in the appropriate separate categories on the first day of the foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2004. In accordance with the principles of paragraph (f)(4) of this section, the taxpayer must reconstruct the non-look-through pools or, if the taxpayer chooses to use the safe harbor method, allocate the earnings and taxes in the non-look-through pools to the foreign corporation's look-through pools in the appropriate separate categories on the first day of the foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2004. Under the safe harbor method, this allocation is made in the

same percentages as the taxpayer properly characterized the stock of the foreign corporation for purposes of apportioning the taxpayer's interest expense in the taxpayer's first taxable year ending after the first day of the foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002. See Sec. 1.861-12T(c)(3) and Sec. 1.861-12(c)(4). If a taxpayer does not use the safe harbor method described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section and the Commissioner determines that the look-through characterization of the earnings (or deficit) and taxes cannot reasonably be determined based on the available information, the earnings (or deficit) and taxes shall be allocated to the foreign corporation's passive category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Carryover of unused foreign tax. To the extent that a taxpayer has unused foreign taxes in the single category for dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations, such taxes shall be carried forward to the appropriate separate categories in the taxpayer's taxable years beginning on or after the first day of the relevant noncontrolled section 902 corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2004. Such unused taxes shall be carried forward in the same manner as Sec. 1.904-2(h)(1) provides that unused foreign taxes in the separate categories for dividends from each noncontrolled section 902 corporation are carried over to taxable years beginning on or after the first day of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, in the case of a taxpayer that does not make the election under this paragraph (f)(9). The electing taxpayer shall determine which noncontrolled section 902 corporations paid the dividends to which the unused foreign taxes are attributable and assign the taxes to the appropriate separate categories as if such dividends had been eligible for look-through treatment when paid. Accordingly, the taxpayer must substantiate the look-through characterization of the unused foreign taxes in accordance with paragraph (f)(4) of this section by reconstructing the non-look-through pools or, if the taxpayer uses the safe harbor method, by allocating the unused foreign taxes to other separate categories in the same percentages as the taxpayer properly characterized the stock of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation for purposes of apportioning the taxpayer's interest expense for its first taxable year ending after the first day of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002. The rule described in this paragraph (f)(9)(iv) shall apply only to unused foreign taxes attributable to dividends out of earnings that were accumulated by noncontrolled section 902 corporations in taxable years of such corporations beginning before January 1, 2003, because only unused foreign taxes attributable to distributions out of pre-2003 earnings are included in the single category for dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations. To the extent that unused foreign taxes carried forward to the single category for dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations under the rules of Notice 2003-5 were either absorbed by low-taxed dividends paid by noncontrolled section 902 corporations out of the non-look-through pool in taxable years of such corporations beginning in 2003 or 2004, or expired unused, the amount of taxes carried forward to the separate categories on a look-through basis will be smaller than the aggregate amount of taxes initially carried forward to the single category for dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations. In this case, the unused foreign taxes arising in each taxable year shall be deemed attributable to each noncontrolled section 902 corporation in the same ratio as the dividends included in the separate category that were paid by such corporation in such year bears to all such dividends paid by all noncontrolled section 902 corporations in such year. Unused foreign taxes carried forward from the separate categories for dividends from each noncontrolled section 902 corporation to the single category for dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations will similarly be deemed to have been utilized on a pro rata basis. The remaining unused foreign taxes are then assigned to the appropriate separate categories under the rules of paragraph (f)(4) of this section. Unused foreign taxes shall be treated

as allocable to general category income to the extent that such taxes would otherwise have been allocable to passive income (based on reconstructed pools or the safe harbor method), or to the extent that, under paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section, the Commissioner determines that the look-through characterization cannot reasonably be determined based on the available information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Carryback of unused foreign tax. To the extent that a taxpayer has unused foreign taxes attributable to a dividend paid by a noncontrolled section 902 corporation that was eligible for look-through treatment under section 904(d)(4) and Sec. 1.904-5, any such unused foreign taxes shall be carried back to prior taxable years within the same separate category and not to the single category for dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations or any separate category for dividends from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation. See Notice 2003-5 for rules relating to the carryback of unused foreign taxes in the single category for dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Recapture of overall foreign loss or separate limitation loss in the single category for dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations. To the extent that a taxpayer has a balance in a separate limitation loss or overall foreign loss account in the single category for dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations under section 904(d)(1)(E) (prior to its repeal by the AJCA), at the end of the taxpayer's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2005 (or a later taxable year in which the taxpayer received a dividend subject to the separate limitation for dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations), the amount of such balance shall be allocated on the first day of the taxpayer's next taxable year to the taxpayer's other separate categories. The amount of such balance that is attributable to each noncontrolled section 902 corporation shall be allocated in the same percentages as the taxpayer properly characterized the stock of such corporation for purposes of apportioning the taxpayer's interest expense for its first taxable year ending after the first day of such corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, under Sec. 1.861-12T(c)(3) or Sec. 1.861-12(c)(4), as the case may be. To the extent that a taxpayer has a balance in a separate limitation loss account for the single category for dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations with respect to another separate category, and the separate limitation loss account would otherwise be assigned to that other category under this paragraph (f)(9)(vi), such balance shall be eliminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Recapture of separate limitation losses in other separate categories. To the extent that a taxpayer has a balance in any separate limitation loss account in a separate category with respect to the single category for dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations at the end of the taxpayer's last taxable year with or within which ends the last taxable year of the relevant noncontrolled section 902 corporation beginning before January 1, 2005, such loss shall be recaptured in subsequent taxable years as income in the appropriate separate category. The separate limitation loss account shall be deemed attributable on a pro rata basis to those noncontrolled section 902 corporations that paid dividends out of earnings accumulated in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2003, in the years in which the separate limitation loss in the other separate category arose. The ratable portions of the separate limitation loss account shall be recaptured as income in the taxpayer's separate categories in the same percentages as the taxpayer properly characterized the stock of the relevant noncontrolled section 902 corporation for purposes of apportioning the taxpayer's interest expense in its first taxable year ending after the first day of such corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, under Sec. 1.861-12T(c)(3) or Sec. 1.861-12(c)(4), as the case may be. To the extent that a taxpayer has a balance in any separate limitation loss account in any separate category that would have been recaptured as income in that same category under this paragraph (f)(9)(vii), such balance shall be eliminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Treatment of undistributed earnings in an upper-tier corporation-level single category for dividends from lower-

tier noncontrolled section 902 corporations. Where a controlled foreign corporation or noncontrolled section 902 corporation has a single category for dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations containing earnings attributable to dividends paid by one or more lower-tier corporations, the following rules apply. The post-1986 undistributed earnings, previously-taxed earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(1) or (2), if any, and associated post-1986 foreign income taxes shall be allocated to the upper-tier corporation's other separate categories in the same manner as earnings and taxes in a separate category for dividends from each noncontrolled section 902 corporation maintained by the upper-tier corporation are allocated under paragraph (f)(7) of this section. Accordingly, post-1986 undistributed earnings, previously-taxed earnings and profits, if any, and post-1986 foreign income taxes in the single category for dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations shall be treated as if they were accumulated and paid, accrued or deemed paid during a period when a dividend paid by each lower-tier corporation that paid dividends included in the single category would have been eligible for look-through treatment. If the taxpayer uses the safe harbor method described in paragraph (f)(7)(iii) of this section, the earnings and taxes shall be allocated based on the apportionment ratios properly used by the lower-tier corporation to apportion its interest expense for its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002. Any section 952(c)(2) recapture account with respect to the single category shall be allocated in the same manner as the associated post-1986 undistributed earnings. The taxpayer must substantiate the look-through characterization of the earnings and taxes in accordance with the rules of paragraph (f)(7)(iii) of this section. If the taxpayer does not use the safe harbor method and the Commissioner determines that the look-through characterization of the earnings cannot reasonably be determined based on the available information, the earnings and taxes shall be assigned to the upper-tier corporation's passive category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Treatment of a deficit in the single category for dividends from lower-tier noncontrolled section 902 corporations. Where a controlled foreign corporation or noncontrolled section 902 corporation had an aggregate deficit in the single category for dividends from all noncontrolled section 902 corporations as of the end of the upper-tier corporation's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2005, such deficit and the associated post-1986 foreign income taxes, if any, shall be allocated to the upper-tier corporation's other separate categories in the same percentages in which the non-look-through pools of each lower-tier corporation to which the deficit is attributable were assigned to such corporation's other separate categories in its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002. If the taxpayer uses the safe harbor method described in paragraph (f)(7)(iii) of this section, the deficit and taxes shall be allocated based on how the taxpayer properly characterized the stock of the lower-tier noncontrolled section 902 corporation for purposes of apportioning the upper-tier corporation's interest expense for the upper-tier corporation's first taxable year ending after the first day of the lower-tier corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002. The taxpayer must substantiate the look-through characterization of the deficit and taxes in accordance with the rules of paragraph (f)(7)(iii) of this section. If the taxpayer does not use the safe harbor method and the Commissioner determines that the look-through characterization of the deficit cannot reasonably be determined based on the available information, the deficit and taxes shall be assigned to the upper-tier corporation's passive category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Effective/applicability date. This paragraph (f) shall apply to dividends from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation that are paid in taxable years of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation ending on or after April 20, 2009. See 26 CFR Sec. 1.904-7T(f) (revised as of April 1, 2009) for rules applicable, except in the case of a taxpayer that makes the election under paragraph (f)(9) of that section, to dividends from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation

that are paid in taxable years of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation beginning after December 31, 2002, and ending before April 20, 2009. See 26 CFR 1.904-7T(f) (revised as of April 1, 2009) for rules applicable, in the case of a taxpayer that makes the election under paragraph (f)(9) of that section, to dividends from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation that are paid in taxable years of the noncontrolled section 902 corporation beginning after December 31, 2004, and ending before April 20, 2009. However, taxpayers may choose to apply paragraph (f) of this section in its entirety in lieu of 26 CFR 1.904-7T(f) to all dividends paid in periods covered by the temporary regulations, provided that appropriate adjustments are made to eliminate duplicate benefits arising from application of paragraph (f) to taxable years that are not open for assessment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Treatment of earnings and foreign taxes of a controlled foreign corporation or a noncontrolled section 902 corporation accumulated in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2007--(1) Definitions--(i) Pre-2007 pools means the pools in each separate category of post-1986 undistributed earnings (as defined in Sec. 1.902-1(a)(9)) that were accumulated, and post-1986 foreign income taxes (as defined in Sec. 1.902-1(a)(8)) paid, accrued, or deemed paid, in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2007.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pre-2007 separate categories means the separate categories of income described in section 904(d) as applicable to taxable years beginning before January 1, 2007, and any other separate category of income described in Sec. 1.904-4(m).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Post-2006 separate categories means the separate categories of income described in section 904(d) as applicable to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006, and any other separate category of income described in Sec. 1.904-4(m).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Treatment of pre-2007 pools of a controlled foreign corporation or a noncontrolled section 902 corporation. Any post-1986 undistributed earnings in a pre-2007 pool of a controlled foreign corporation or a noncontrolled section 902 corporation shall be treated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006, as if they were accumulated during a period in which the rules governing the determination of post-2006 separate categories applied. Post-1986 foreign income taxes paid, accrued, or deemed paid with respect to such earnings shall be treated as if they were paid, accrued, or deemed paid during a period in which the rules governing the determination of post-2006 separate categories (including the rules of section 904(d)(3)(E)) applied as well. Any such earnings and taxes in pre-2007 pools shall constitute the opening balance of the foreign corporation's post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes on the first day of the foreign corporation's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2006, in accordance with the rules of paragraph (g)(3) of this section. Similar rules shall apply to characterize any deficits in the pre-2007 pools and previously-taxed earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(1) and (2) that are attributable to earnings in the pre-2007 pools. Any section 952(c)(2) recapture account with respect to a separate category shall be allocated in the same manner as the post-1986 undistributed earnings in the associated pre-2007 pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Substantiation of post-2006 character of earnings and taxes in a pre-2007 pool--(i) Reconstruction of earnings and taxes pools. In order to substantiate the post-2006 characterization of post-1986 undistributed earnings (as well as deficits and previously-taxed earnings, if any) and post-1986 foreign income taxes in pre-2007 pools of a controlled foreign corporation or a noncontrolled section 902 corporation, the taxpayer shall make a reasonable, good-faith effort to reconstruct the pre-2007 pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings (as well as deficits and previously-taxed earnings, if any) and post-1986 foreign income taxes following the rules governing the determination of post-2006 separate categories for each taxable year beginning before January 1, 2007, beginning with the first year in which post-1986 undistributed earnings were accumulated in the pre-2007 pool. Reconstruction shall be based on reasonably available books and records and other relevant information. To the extent any pre-2007 separate category includes earnings that would be allocated to

more than one post-2006 separate category, the taxpayer must account for earnings distributed and taxes deemed paid in these years for such category as if they were distributed and deemed paid pro rata from the amounts that were added to that category during each taxable year beginning before January 1, 2007.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Safe harbor method--(A) In general. Subject to the rules of paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section, a taxpayer may allocate the post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes in pre-2007 pools of a controlled foreign corporation or a noncontrolled section 902 corporation (as well as deficits and previously-taxed earnings, if any) under one of the safe harbor methods described in paragraphs (g)(3)(ii)(B) and (g)(3)(ii)(C) of this section. A taxpayer may choose to use the safe harbor method on a timely filed (original or amended) tax return or during an audit. A taxpayer that uses the safe harbor method on an amended return or in the course of an audit must make appropriate adjustments to eliminate any double benefit arising from application of the safe harbor method to years that are not open for assessment. A taxpayer's choice to use the safe harbor method is evidenced by employing the method. The taxpayer need not file any separate statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> General safe harbor method--(1) Any post-1986 undistributed earnings (as well as deficits and previously-taxed earnings, if any) and post-1986 foreign income taxes of a noncontrolled section 902 corporation or a controlled foreign corporation in a pre-2007 separate category for passive income, certain dividends from a DISC or former DISC, taxable income attributable to certain foreign trade income, or certain distributions from a FSC or former FSC shall be allocated to the post-2006 separate category for passive category income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any post-1986 undistributed earnings (as well as deficits and previously-taxed earnings, if any) and post-1986 foreign income taxes of a noncontrolled section 902 corporation or a controlled foreign corporation in a pre-2007 separate category for financial services income, shipping income or general limitation income shall be allocated to the post-2006 separate category for general category income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(B)(4) of this section, any post-1986 undistributed earnings (as well as deficits and previously-taxed earnings, if any) and post-1986 foreign income taxes of a noncontrolled section 902 corporation or a controlled foreign corporation in a pre-2007 separate category for high withholding tax interest shall be allocated to the post-2006 separate category for passive category income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If a controlled foreign corporation has positive post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes in a pre-2007 separate category for high withholding tax interest, such earnings and taxes shall be allocated to the post-2006 separate category for general category income if the earnings would qualify as income subject to high foreign taxes under section 954(b)(4) if the entire amount of post-1986 undistributed earnings were treated as a net item of income subject to the rules of Sec. 1.954-1(d). If the high withholding tax interest earnings would not qualify as income subject to high foreign taxes under section 954(b)(4), then the earnings and taxes shall be allocated to the post-2006 separate category for passive category income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Interest apportionment safe harbor. A taxpayer may allocate the post-1986 undistributed earnings (as well as deficits and previously-taxed earnings, if any) and post-1986 foreign income taxes in pre-2007 pools of a controlled foreign corporation or a noncontrolled section 902 corporation following the principles of paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Consistency rule. The election to apply a safe harbor method under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section in lieu of the rules described in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section may be made on a separate category by separate category basis. However, if a taxpayer elects to apply a safe harbor to allocate pre-2007 pools of more than one pre-2007 separate category of a controlled foreign corporation or a noncontrolled section 902 corporation, such safe harbor (the general safe harbor described in paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(B) of this section

or the interest apportionment safe harbor described in paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(C) of this section) shall apply to allocate post-1986 undistributed earnings (as well as deficits and previously-taxed earnings, if any) and post-1986 foreign income taxes for the pre-2007 pools in each pre-2007 separate category of the foreign corporation for which the taxpayer elected to apply a safe harbor method in lieu of reconstructing the pre-2007 pools.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Treatment of pre-1987 accumulated profits. Any pre-1987 accumulated profits (as defined in Sec. 1.902-1(a)(10)) of a noncontrolled section 902 corporation or a controlled foreign corporation shall be treated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006, as if they had been accumulated during a period in which the rules governing the determination of post-2006 separate categories applied. Foreign income taxes paid, accrued, or deemed paid with respect to such earnings shall be treated as if they were paid, accrued, or deemed paid during a period in which the rules governing the determination of post-2006 separate categories applied as well. The taxpayer must substantiate the post-2006 characterization of the pre-1987 accumulated profits and pre-1987 foreign income taxes in accordance with the rules of paragraph (g)(3) of this section, including the safe harbor provisions. Similar rules shall apply to characterize any deficits or previously-taxed earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(1) and (2) that are attributable to pre-1987 accumulated profits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Treatment of earnings and foreign taxes in pre-2007 pools of a lower-tier controlled foreign corporation or noncontrolled section 902 corporation. The rules of paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) of this section apply to post-1986 undistributed earnings (as well as deficits and previously-taxed earnings, if any) and post-1986 foreign income taxes in pre-2007 pools, and pre-1987 accumulated profits and pre-1987 foreign income taxes, of a lower-tier controlled foreign corporation or noncontrolled section 902 corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Effective/applicability date.

Except as otherwise provided in this section, for purposes of section 904 and this section, taxable income from sources outside the United States (in all of the taxpayer's separate categories in the aggregate) shall include capital gain net income from sources outside the United States (determined by considering all of the capital gain and loss items in all of the taxpayer's separate categories in the aggregate) only to the extent of capital gain net income from all sources. Thus, capital gain net income from sources outside the United States (determined by considering all of the capital gain and loss items in all of the taxpayer's separate categories in the aggregate) shall be reduced to the extent such amount exceeds capital gain net income from all sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Allocation of reduction to separate categories or rate groups--(A) In general. If capital gain net income from sources outside the United States exceeds capital gain net income from all sources, and the taxpayer has capital gain net income from sources outside the United States in only one separate category, such excess is allocated as a reduction to that separate category. If a taxpayer has capital gain net income from foreign sources in two or more separate categories, such excess must be apportioned on a pro rata basis as a reduction to each such separate category. For purposes of the preceding sentence, pro rata means based on the relative amounts of the capital gain net income from sources outside the United States in each separate category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Taxpayer with capital gain rate differential. If a taxpayer with a capital gain rate differential for the year (within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section) has capital gain net income from foreign sources in only one rate group within a separate category, any reduction to such separate category pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section must be allocated to such rate group. If a taxpayer with a capital gain rate differential for the year (within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section) has capital gain net income from foreign sources in two or more rate groups within a separate category, any reduction to such separate category pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section must be apportioned on a pro rata basis among such rate groups. For purposes of the preceding sentence, pro rata means based on the relative amounts of the capital gain net income from sources outside the United States

in each rate group within the applicable separate category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exclusivity of rules; no reduction by reason of net capital losses from sources outside the United States in a different separate category. Capital gains from sources outside the United States in any separate category shall be limited by reason of section 904(b)(2)(A) and the comparable limitation of section 904(b)(2)(B)(i) only to the extent provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section (relating to limitation on capital gain from sources outside the United States when taxpayer has net capital losses from sources within the United States).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Capital losses from sources outside the United States in the same separate category. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this section, taxable income from sources outside the United States in each separate category shall be reduced by any capital loss that is allocable or apportionable to income from sources outside the United States in such separate category to the extent such loss is allowable in determining taxable income for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (a) to taxpayers that do not have a capital gain rate differential for the taxable year. See paragraph (g) of this section for examples that illustrate the application of this paragraph (a) to taxpayers that have a capital gain rate differential for the year. The examples are as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Taxpayer A, a corporation, has a $3,000 capital loss from sources outside the United States in the general limitation category, a $6,000 capital gain from sources outside the United States in the passive category, and a $2,000 capital loss from sources within the United States. A's capital gain net income from sources outside the United States in the aggregate, from all separate categories, is $3,000 ($6,000 - $3,000). A's capital gain net income from all sources is $1,000 ($6,000 - $3,000 - $2,000). Thus, for purposes of section 904, A's taxable income from sources outside the United States in all of A's separate categories in the aggregate includes only $1,000 of capital gain net income from sources outside the United States. See paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section. Pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, A must reduce the $6,000 of capital gain net income from sources outside the United States in the passive category by $2,000 ($3,000 of capital gain net income from sources outside the United States - $1,000 of capital gain net income from all sources). After the adjustment, A has $4,000 of capital gain from sources outside the United States in the passive category and $3,000 of capital loss from sources outside the United States in the general limitation category.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Taxpayer B, a corporation, has a $300 capital gain from sources outside the United States in the general limitation category and a $200 capital gain from sources outside the United States in the passive category. B's capital gain net income from sources outside the United States is $500 ($300 + $200). B also has a $150 capital loss from sources within the United States and a $50 capital gain from sources within the United States. Thus, B's capital gain net income from all sources is $400 ($300 + $200 - $150 + $50). Pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, the $100 excess of capital gain net income from sources outside the United States over capital gain net income from all sources ($500 - $400) must be apportioned, as a reduction, three-fifths ($300/$500 of $100, or $60) to the general limitation category and two-fifths ($200/$500 of $100, or $40) to the passive category. Therefore, for purposes of section 904, the general limitation category includes $240 ($300 - $60) of capital gain net income from sources outside the United States and the passive category includes $160 ($200 - $40) of capital gain net income from sources outside the United States.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Taxpayer C, a corporation, has a $10,000 capital loss from sources outside the United States in the general limitation category, a $4,000 capital gain from sources outside the United States in the passive category, and a $2,000 capital gain from sources within the United States. C's capital gain net income from sources outside the United States is zero, since losses exceed gains. C's capital gain net income from all sources is also zero. C's capital gain net income from sources outside the United States does not exceed its capital gain net income from all sources, and therefore paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not require any reduction of C's passive category capital gain. For purposes of section 904, C's passive category includes $4,000 of capital gain net income. C's general limitation category includes a capital loss of $6,000 because only $6,000 of capital loss is allowable as a deduction in the current year. The entire $4,000 of capital loss in excess of the $6,000 of capital loss that offsets capital gain in the taxable year is carried back or forward under section 1212(a), and none of such $4,000 is taken into account under section 904(a) or (b) for the current taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Capital gain rate differential--(1) Application of adjustments only if capital

gain rate differential exists. Section 904(b)(2)(B) and paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section apply only for taxable years in which the taxpayer has a capital gain rate differential.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determination of whether capital gain rate differential exists. For purposes of section 904(b) and this section, a capital gain rate differential is considered to exist for the taxable year only if the taxpayer has taxable income (excluding net capital gain and qualified dividend income) for the taxable year, a net capital gain for the taxable year and--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a taxpayer other than a corporation, tax is imposed on the net capital gain at a reduced rate under section 1(h) for the taxable year; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a corporation, tax is imposed under section 1201(a) on the taxpayer at a rate less than any rate of tax imposed on the taxpayer by section 11, 511, or 831(a) or (b), whichever applies (determined without regard to the last sentence of section 11(b)(1)), for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special rule for certain noncorporate taxpayers. A taxpayer that has a capital gain rate differential for the taxable year under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and is not subject to alternative minimum tax under section 55 for the taxable year may elect not to apply the rate differential adjustments contained in section 904(b)(2)(B) and paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section if the highest rate of tax imposed on such taxpayer's taxable income (excluding net capital gain and any qualified dividend income) for the taxable year under section 1 does not exceed the highest rate of tax in effect under section 1(h) for the taxable year and the amount of the taxpayer's net capital gain from sources outside the United States, plus the amount of the taxpayer's qualified dividend income from sources outside the United States, is less than $20,000. A taxpayer that has a capital gain rate differential for the taxable year under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and is subject to alternative minimum tax under section 55 for the taxable year may make such election if the rate of tax imposed on such taxpayer's alternative minimum taxable income (excluding net capital gain and any qualified dividend income) under section 55 does not exceed 26 percent, the highest rate of tax imposed on such taxpayer's taxable income (excluding net capital gain and any qualified dividend income) for the taxable year under section 1 does not exceed the highest rate of tax in effect under section 1(h) for the taxable year and the amount of the taxpayer's net capital gain from sources outside the United States, plus the amount of the taxpayer's qualified dividend income from sources outside the United States, is less than $20,000. A taxpayer who makes this election shall apply paragraph (a) of this section as if such taxpayer does not have a capital gain rate differential for the taxable year. An eligible taxpayer shall be presumed to have elected not to apply the rate differential adjustments, unless such taxpayer applies the rate differential adjustments contained in section 904(b)(2)(B) and paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section in determining its foreign tax credit limitation for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Rate differential adjustment of capital gains--(1) Rate differential adjustment of capital gains in foreign source taxable income--(i) In general. Subject to paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, in determining taxable income from sources outside the United States for purposes of section 904 and this section, capital gain net income from sources outside the United States in each long-term rate group in each separate category (separate category long-term rate group), shall be reduced by the rate differential portion of such capital gain net income. For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, references to capital gain net income are references to capital gain net income remaining after any reduction to such income pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section (i.e., paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies before paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for taxpayers with a net long-term capital loss from sources within the United States. If a taxpayer has a net long-term capital loss from sources within the United States (i.e., the taxpayer's long-term capital losses from sources within the United States exceed the taxpayer's long-term capital

gains from sources within the United States) and also has any short-term capital gains from sources within or without the United States, then capital gain net income from sources outside the United States in each separate category long-term rate group shall be reduced by the rate differential portion of the applicable rate differential amount. The applicable rate differential amount is determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Step 1: Determine the U.S. long-term capital loss adjustment amount. The U.S. long-term capital loss adjustment amount is the excess, if any, of the net long-term capital loss from sources within the United States over the amount, if any, by which the taxpayer reduced long-term capital gains from sources without the United States pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Step 2: Determine the applicable rate differential amount. If a taxpayer has capital gain net income from sources outside the United States in only one separate category long-term rate group, the applicable rate differential amount is the excess of such capital gain net income over the U.S. long-term capital loss adjustment amount. If a taxpayer has capital gain net income from sources outside the United States in more than one separate category long-term rate group, the U.S. long-term capital loss adjustment amount shall be apportioned on a pro rata basis to each separate category long-term rate group with capital gain net income. For purposes of the preceding sentence, pro rata means based on the relative amounts of capital gain net income from sources outside the United States in each separate category long-term rate group. The applicable rate differential amount for each separate category long-term rate group with capital gain net income is the excess of such capital gain net income over the portion of the U.S. long-term capital loss adjustment amount apportioned to the separate category long-term rate group pursuant to this Step 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. The taxpayers in the examples are assumed to have taxable income (excluding net capital gain and qualified dividend income) subject to a rate of tax under section 1 greater than the highest rate of tax in effect under section 1(h) for the applicable taxable year. The examples are as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. (i) M, an individual, has $300 of long-term capital gain from foreign sources in the passive category, $200 of which is subject to tax at a rate of 15 percent under section 1(h) and $100 of which is subject to tax at a rate of 28% under section 1(h). M has $150 of short-term capital gain from sources within the United States. M has a $100 long-term capital loss from sources within the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> M's capital gain net income from sources outside the United States ($300) does not exceed M's capital gain net income from all sources ($350). Therefore, paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not require any reduction of M's capital gain net income in the passive category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Because M has a net long-term capital loss from sources within the United States ($100) and also has a short-term capital gain from U.S. sources ($150), M must apply the provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section to determine the amount of the $300 of capital gain net income in the passive category that is subject to a rate differential adjustment. Under Step 1, the U.S. long-term capital loss adjustment amount is $100 ($100 - $0). Under Step 2, M must apportion this amount to each rate group in the passive category pro rata based on the amount of capital gain net income in each rate group. Thus, $66.67 ($200/$300 of $100) is apportioned to the 15 percent rate group and $33.33 ($100/$300 of $100) is apportioned to the 28 percent rate group. The applicable rate differential amount for the 15 percent rate group is $133.33 ($200 - $66.67). Thus, $133.33 of the $200 of capital gain net income in the 15 percent rate group is subject to a rate differential adjustment pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The remaining $66.67 is not subject to a rate differential adjustment. The applicable rate differential amount for the 28 percent rate group is $66.67 ($100 - $33.33). Thus, $66.67 of the $100 of capital gain net income in the 28 percent rate group is subject to a rate differential adjustment pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The remaining $33.33 is not subject to a rate differential adjustment.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. (i) N, an individual, has $300 of long-term capital gain from foreign sources in the passive category, all of which is subject to tax at a rate of 15 percent under section 1(h). N has $50 of short-term capital gain from sources within the United States. N has a $100 long-term capital loss from sources within the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> N's capital gain net income from sources outside the United States ($300) exceeds N's capital gain net income from all sources ($250). Pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, N must reduce the $300 capital gain in the passive category by $50. N has $250 of capital gain remaining in the passive category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Because N has a net long-term capital loss from sources within the United States ($100) and also has a short-term capital gain from U.S. sources ($50), N must apply the provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section to determine the amount of the $250 of capital gain in the passive category that is subject to a rate differential adjustment. Under Step 1, the U.S. long-term capital loss adjustment amount is $50 ($100 - $50). Under Step 2, the applicable rate differential amount is $200 ($250 - $50). Thus, $200 of the capital gain in the passive category is subject to a rate differential adjustment under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The remaining $50 is not subject to a rate differential adjustment.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. (i) O, an individual, has a $100 short-term capital gain from foreign sources in the passive category. O has $300 of long-term capital gain from foreign sources in the passive category, all of which is subject to tax at a rate of 15 percent under section 1(h). O has a $100 long-term capital loss from sources within the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> O's capital gain net income from sources outside the United States ($400) exceeds O's capital gain net income from all sources ($300). Pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, O must reduce the $400 capital gain net income in the passive category by $100. Because C has capital gain net income in two or more rate groups in the passive category, O must apportion such amount, as a reduction, to each rate group on a pro rata basis pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. Thus, $25 ($100/$400 of $100) is apportioned to the short-term capital gain and $75 ($300/$400 of $100) is apportioned to the long-term capital gain in the 15 percent rate group. After application of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, O has $75 of short-term capital gain in the passive category and $225 of long-term capital gain in the 15 percent rate group in the passive category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Because O has a net long-term capital loss from sources within the United States ($100) and also has a short-term capital gain from foreign sources ($100), O must apply the provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section to determine the amount of the $225 of long-term capital gain in the 15 percent rate group that is subject to a rate differential adjustment. Under Step 1, the U.S. long-term capital loss adjustment amount is $25 ($100 - $75). Under Step 2, the applicable rate differential amount is $200 ($225 - $25). Thus, $200 of the long-term capital gain is subject to a rate differential adjustment under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The remaining $25 of long-term capital gain is not subject to a rate differential adjustment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rate differential adjustment of capital gains in entire taxable income. For purposes of section 904 and this section, entire taxable income shall include gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets only to the extent of capital gain net income reduced by the sum of the rate differential portions of each rate group of net capital gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Rate differential adjustment of capital losses from sources outside the United States--(1) In general. In determining taxable income from sources outside the United States for purposes of section 904 and this section, a taxpayer with a net capital loss in a separate category rate group shall reduce such net capital loss by the sum of the rate differential portions of the capital gain net income in each long-term rate group offset by such net capital loss. A net capital loss in a separate category rate group is the amount, if any, by which capital losses in a rate group from sources outside the United States included in a separate category exceed capital gains from sources outside the United States in the same rate group and the same separate category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determination of which capital gains are offset by net capital losses from sources outside the United States. For purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, in order to determine the capital gain net income offset by net capital losses from sources outside the United States, the following rules shall apply in the following order:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Net capital losses from sources outside the United States in each separate category rate group shall be netted against capital gain net income from sources outside the United States from the same rate group in other separate categories.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Capital losses from sources within the United States shall be netted against capital gains from sources within the United States in the same rate group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Net capital losses from sources outside the United States in excess of the amounts netted against capital gains under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this

section shall be netted against the taxpayer's remaining capital gains from sources within and outside the United States in the following order, and without regard to any net capital losses, from any rate group, from sources within the United States--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> First against capital gain net income from sources within the United States in the same rate group;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Next, against capital gain net income in other rate groups, in the order in which capital losses offset capital gains for purposes of determining the taxpayer's taxable income and without regard to whether such capital gain net income derives from sources within or outside the United States, as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A net capital loss in the short-term rate group is used first to offset any capital gain net income in the 28 percent rate group, then to offset capital gain net income in the 25 percent rate group, then to offset capital gain net income in the 15 percent rate group, and finally to offset capital gain net income in the 5 percent rate group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A net capital loss in the 28 percent rate group is used first to offset capital gain net income in the 25 percent rate group, then to offset capital gain net income in the 15 percent rate group, and finally to offset capital gain net income in the 5 percent rate group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A net capital loss in the 15 percent rate group is used first to offset capital gain net income in the 5 percent rate group, and then to offset capital gain net income in the 28 percent rate group, and finally to offset capital gain net income in the 25 percent rate group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Net capital losses from sources outside the United States in any rate group, to the extent netted against capital gains in any other separate category under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section or against capital gains in the same or any other rate group under paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, shall be treated as coming pro rata from each separate category that contains a net capital loss from sources outside the United States in that rate group. For example, assume that the taxpayer has $20 of net capital losses in the 15 percent rate group in the passive category and $40 of net capital losses in the 15 percent rate group in the general limitation category, both from sources outside the United States. Further assume that $50 of the total $60 net capital losses from sources outside the United States are netted against capital gain net income in the 28 percent rate group (from other separate categories or from sources within the United States). One-third of the $50 of such capital losses would be treated as coming from the passive category, and two-thirds of such $50 would be treated as coming from the general limitation category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> In determining the capital gain net income offset by a net capital loss from sources outside the United States pursuant to this paragraph (d)(2), a taxpayer shall take into account any reduction to capital gain net income from sources outside the United States pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section and shall disregard any adjustments to such capital gain net income pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> If at any time during a taxable year, tax is imposed under section 1(h) at a rate other than a rate of tax specified in this paragraph (d)(2), the principles of this paragraph (d)(2) shall apply to determine the capital gain net income offset by any net capital loss in a separate category rate group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The determination of which capital gains are offset by capital losses from sources outside the United States under this paragraph (d)(2) is made solely in order to determine the appropriate rate-differential-based adjustments to such capital losses under this section and section 904(b), and does not change the source, allocation, or separate category of any such capital gain or loss for purposes of computing taxable income from sources within or outside the United States or for any other purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Qualified dividend income--(1) In general. A taxpayer that has taxable income (excluding net capital gain and qualified dividend income) for the taxable year and that qualifies for a reduced rate of tax under section 1(h) on its qualified dividend income (as defined in section 1(h)(11)) for the taxable year shall adjust the amount of such qualified dividend income in a manner consistent with the rules of paragraphs

(c)(1)(i) (first sentence) and (c)(2) of this section irrespective of whether such taxpayer has a net capital gain for the taxable year. For purposes of making adjustments pursuant to this paragraph (e), the special rule in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section for taxpayers with a net long-term capital loss from sources within the United States shall be disregarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exception. A taxpayer that makes the election provided for in paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall not make adjustments pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Additionally, a taxpayer other than a corporation that does not have a capital gain rate differential for the taxable year within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2) of this section may elect not to apply paragraph (e)(1) of this section if such taxpayer would have qualified for the election provided for in paragraph (b)(3) of this section had such taxpayer had a capital gain rate differential for the taxable year. Such a taxpayer shall be presumed to make the election provided for in the preceding sentence unless such taxpayer applies the rate differential adjustments provided for in paragraph (e)(1) of this section to the qualified dividend income in determining its foreign tax credit limitation for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Definitions. For purposes of section 904(b) and this section, the following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Alternative tax rate. The term alternative tax rate means, with respect to any rate group, the rate applicable to that rate group under section 1(h) (for taxpayers other than corporations) or section 1201(a) (for corporations). For example, the alternative tax rate for unrecaptured section 1250 gain is 25 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Net capital gain. For purposes of this section, net capital gain shall not include any qualified dividend income (as defined in section 1(h)(11)). See paragraph (e) of this section for rules relating to qualified dividend income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Rate differential portion. The term rate differential portion with respect to capital gain net income from sources outside the United States in a separate category long-term rate group (or the applicable portion of such amount), net capital gain in a rate group, or capital gain net income in a long-term rate group, as the case may be, means the same proportion of such amount as--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The excess of the highest applicable tax rate (as defined in section 904(b)(3)(E)(ii)) over the alternative tax rate; bears to</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The highest applicable tax rate (as defined in section 904(b)(3)(E)(ii)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Rate group. For purposes of this section, the term rate group means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Short-term capital gains or losses. With respect to a short-term capital gain or loss, the rate group is the short-term rate group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Long-term capital gains. With respect to a long-term capital gain, the rate group is the particular rate of tax to which such gain is subject under section 1(h). Such a rate group is a long-term rate group. For example, the 28 percent rate group of capital gain net income from sources outside the United States consists of the capital gain net income from sources outside the United States that is subject to tax at a rate of 28 percent under section 1(h). Such 28 percent rate group is a long-term rate group. If a taxpayer has long-term capital gains that may be subject to tax at more than one rate under section 1(h) and the taxpayer's net capital gain attributable to such long-term capital gains and any qualified dividend income are taxed at one rate of tax under section 1(h), then all of such long-term capital gains shall be treated as long-term capital gains in that one rate group. If a taxpayer has long-term capital gains that may be subject to tax at more than one rate of tax under section 1(h) and the taxpayer's net capital gain attributable to such long-term capital gains and any qualified dividend income are taxed at more than one rate pursuant to section 1(h), the taxpayer shall determine the rate group for such long-term capital gains from sources within or outside the United States (and, to the extent from sources outside the United States, from each separate category) ratably based on the proportions of net capital gain and any qualified dividend income taxed at each applicable rate. For example, under the section 1(h) rates in effect for tax years beginning in 2004, a long-term capital gain (other than a

long-term capital gain described in section 1(h)(4)(A) or (h)(6)) may be subject to tax at 5 percent or 15 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Long-term capital losses. With respect to a long-term capital loss, a loss described in section 1(h)(4)(B)(i) (collectibles loss) or (iii) (long-term capital loss carryover) is a loss in the 28 percent rate group. All other long-term capital losses shall be treated as losses in the highest rate group in effect under section 1(h) for the tax year with respect to long-term capital gains other than long-term capital gains described in section 1(h)(4)(A) or (h)(6).

Sec. 1.904(f)-1  Overall foreign loss and the overall foreign lossaccount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)</em> Overview of regulations. In general, section 904(f) and these regulations apply to any taxpayer that sustains an overall foreign loss (as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section) in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1975. For taxable years ending after December 31, 1984, and beginning before January 1, 1987, there can be five types of overall foreign losses: a loss under each of the five separate limitations contained in former section 904(d)(1)(A) (passive interest limitation), (d)(1)(B) (DISC dividend limitation), (d)(1)(C) (foreign trade income limitation), (d)(1)(D) (foreign sales corporation (FSC) distributions limitation), and (d)(1)(E) (general limitation). For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982, and ending before January 1, 1985,

there can be three types of overall foreign losses under former section 904(d)(1)(A) (passive interest limitation), former section 904(d)(1)(B) (DISC dividend limitation) and former section 904(d)(1)(C) (general limitation). For taxpayers subject to section 907, the post-1982 general limitation overall foreign loss account may be further subdivided, as provided in Sec. 1.904(f)-6. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975, and before January 1, 1983, taxpayers should have computed overall foreign losses separately under the passive interest limitation, the DISC dividend limitation, the general limitation, and the section 907(b) (FORI) limitation. However, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975, and before January 1, 1983, taxpayers may have computed only two types of overall foreign losses: A foreign oil related loss under the FORI limitation and an overall foreign loss computed on a combined basis for the passive interest limitation, the DISC dividend limitation, and the general limitation. A taxpayer that computed overall foreign losses for these years on a combined basis will not be required to amend its return to recompute such losses on a separate basis. If a taxpayer computed its overall foreign losses for these years separately under the passive interest limitation, the DISC dividend limitation, and the general limitation, on returns previously filed, a taxpayer may not amend those returns to compute such overall foreign losses on a combined basis. Section 1.904(f)-1 provides rules for determining a taxpayer's overall foreign losses, for establishing overall foreign loss accounts, and for making additions to and reductions of such accounts for purposes of section 904(f). Section 1.904(f)-2 provides rules for recapturing the balance in any overall foreign loss account under the general recapture rule of section 904(f)(1) and under the special recapture rule of section 904(f)(3) when the taxpayer disposes of property used predominantly outside the United States in a trade or business. Section 1.904(f)-3 provides rules for allocating overall foreign losses that are part of net operating losses or net capital losses to foreign source income in years to which such losses are carried. In addition, Sec. 1.904(f)-3 provides transition rules for the treatment of net operating losses incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982, and carried back to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1983, and of net operating losses incurred in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1983, and carried forward to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982. Section 1.904(f)-4 provides rules for recapture out of an accumulation distribution of a foreign trust. Section 1.904(f)-5 provides rules for recapture of overall foreign losses of domestic trusts. Section 1.904(f)-6 provides a transition rule for recapturing a taxpayer's pre-1983 overall foreign losses under the general limitation and the FORI limitation out of taxable income subject to the general limitation in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982. Section Sec. 1.1502-9 provides rules concerning the application of these regulations to corporations filing consolidated returns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Overview of regulations.

For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982, and ending before January 1, 1985,

there can be three types of overall foreign losses under former section 904(d)(1)(A) (passive interest limitation), former section 904(d)(1)(B) (DISC dividend limitation) and former section 904(d)(1)(C) (general limitation). For taxpayers subject to section 907, the post-1982 general limitation overall foreign loss account may be further subdivided, as provided in Sec. 1.904(f)-6. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975, and before January 1, 1983, taxpayers should have computed overall foreign losses separately under the passive interest limitation, the DISC dividend limitation, the general limitation, and the section 907(b) (FORI) limitation.

Section 1.904(f)-2 provides rules for recapturing the balance in any overall foreign loss account under the general recapture rule of section 904(f)(1) and under the special recapture rule of section 904(f)(3) when the taxpayer disposes of property used predominantly outside the United States in a trade or business. Section 1.904(f)-3 provides rules for allocating overall foreign losses that are part of net operating losses or net capital losses to foreign source income in years to which such losses are carried. In addition, Sec. 1.904(f)-3 provides transition rules for the treatment of net operating losses incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982, and carried back to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1983, and of net operating losses incurred in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1983, and carried forward to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982. Section 1.904(f)-4 provides rules for recapture out of an accumulation distribution of a foreign trust. Section 1.904(f)-5 provides rules for recapture of overall foreign losses of domestic trusts. Section 1.904(f)-6 provides a transition rule for recapturing a taxpayer's pre-1983 overall foreign losses under the general limitation and the FORI limitation out of taxable income subject to the general limitation in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982. Section Sec. 1.1502-9 provides rules concerning the application of these regulations to corporations filing consolidated returns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Application to post-1986 taxable years. The principles of Sec. Sec. 1.904(f)-1 through 1.904(f)-5 shall apply to any overall foreign loss sustained in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, modified so as to take into account the effect of statutory amendments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Overall foreign loss accounts. Any taxpayer that sustains an overall foreign loss under paragraph (c) of this section must establish an account for such loss. Separate types of overall foreign losses must be kept in separate accounts. For taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 1983, taxpayers that computed losses on a combined basis in accordance with Sec. 1.904(f)-1(c)(1) will keep one overall foreign loss account for such overall foreign loss. The balance in each overall foreign loss account represents the amount of such overall foreign loss subject to recapture by the taxpayer in a given year. From year to year, amounts may be added to or subtracted from the balances in such accounts as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section. The taxpayer must report the balances (if any) in its overall foreign loss accounts annually on a Form 1116 or 1118. Such forms must be filed for each taxable year ending after September 24, 1987. The balance in each account does

not have to be attributed to the year or years in which the loss was incurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Determination of a taxpayer's overall foreign loss--(1) Overall foreign loss defined. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982, and before January 1, 1987, a taxpayer sustains an overall foreign loss in any taxable year in which its gross income from sources without the United States subject to a separate limitation (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) is exceeded by the sum of the deductions properly allocated and apportioned thereto. Such losses are to be determined separately in accordance with the principles of the separate limitations. Accordingly, income and deductions subject to a separate limitation are not to be netted with income and deductions subject to another separate limitation for purposes of determining the amount of an overall foreign loss. A taxpayer may, for example, have an overall foreign loss under the general limitation in the same taxable year in which it has taxable income under the DISC dividend limitation. The same principles of calculating overall foreign losses on a separate limitation basis apply for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1983, except that a taxpayer shall determine its overall foreign losses on a combined basis, except for income subject to the FORI limitation, if the taxpayer filed its pre-1983 returns on such basis. Thus, for taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 1983, a taxpayer can net income and losses among the passive interest limitation, the DISC dividend limitation, and the general limitation if the taxpayer calculated its overall foreign losses that way at the time. Taxpayers that computed overall foreign losses separately under each of the separate limitations on their returns filed for taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 1983, may not amend such returns to compute their overall foreign losses for pre-1983 years on a combined basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Separate limitation defined. For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section and these regulations, the term separate limitation means any of the separate limitations under former section 904(d)(1)(A) (passive interest limitation), (B) (DISC dividend limitation), (C) (foreign trade income limitation), (D) (FSC distributions limitation), and (E) (general limitation) and the separate limitation under section 907(b) (FORI limitation) (for taxable years ending after December 31, 1975, and beginning before January 1, 1983).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Method of allocation and apportionment of deductions. In determining its overall foreign loss, a taxpayer shall allocate and apportion expenses, losses, and other deductions to the appropriate category of gross income in accordance with section 862(b) and Sec. 1.861-8 of the regulations. However, the following deductions shall not be taken into account:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount of any net operating loss deduction for such year under section 172(a); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To the extent such losses are not compensated for by insurance or otherwise, the amount of any--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Expropriation losses for such year (as defined in section 172(h)), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Losses for such year which arise from fire, storm, shipwreck, or other casualty, or from theft.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Additions to the overall foreign loss account--(1) General rule. A taxpayer's overall foreign loss as determined under paragraph (c) of this section shall be added to the applicable overall foreign loss account at the end of its taxable year to the extent that the overall foreign loss has reduced United States source income during the taxable year or during a year to which the loss has been carried back. For rules with respect to carryovers see paragraph (d)(3) of this section and Sec. 1.904(f)-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Overall foreign losses of another taxpayer. If any portion of any overall foreign loss of another taxpayer is allocated to the taxpayer in accordance with Sec. 1.904(f)-5 (relating to overall foreign losses of domestic trusts) or Sec. 1.1502-9 (relating to consolidated overall foreign losses), the taxpayer shall add such amount to its applicable overall foreign loss account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Additions to overall foreign loss account created by loss carryovers. Subject to the adjustments under Sec. 1.904(f)-1(d)(4), the taxpayer shall add to each overall foreign loss account--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All net operating loss carryovers to the current taxable year attributable to the same limitation to the extent that overall foreign losses included in the net operating loss carryovers reduced United States source income for the taxable year, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All capital loss carryovers to the current taxable year attributable to the same limitation to the extent that foreign source capital loss carryovers reduced United States source capital gain net income for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Adjustments for capital gains and losses and qualified dividend income. If a taxpayer has capital gains or losses or qualified dividend income, as defined in section 1(h)(11), the taxpayer shall make adjustments to such capital gains and losses and qualified dividend income to the extent required under section 904(b)(2) and Sec. 1.904(b)-1 before applying the provisions of Sec. 1.904(f)-1. See Sec. 1.904(b)-1(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Reductions of overall foreign loss accounts. The taxpayer shall subtract the following amounts from its overall foreign loss accounts at the end of its taxable year in the following order, if applicable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Pre-recapture reduction for amounts allocated to other taxpayers. An overall foreign loss account is reduced by the amount of any overall foreign loss which is allocated to another taxpayer in accordance with Sec. 1.904(f)-5 (relating to overall foreign losses of domestic trusts) or Sec. 1.1502-9 (relating to consolidated overall foreign losses).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reduction for amounts recaptured. An overall foreign loss account is reduced by the amount of any foreign source income that is subject to the same limitation as the loss that resulted in the account and that is recaptured in accordance with Sec. 1.904(f)-2 (c) (relating to recapture under section 904(f)(1)); Sec. 1.904(f)-2 (d) (relating to recapture when the taxpayer disposes of certain properties under section 904(f)(3)); and Sec. 1.904(f)-4 (relating to recapture when the taxpayer receives an accumulation distribution from a foreign trust under section 904(f)(4)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Illustrations. The rules of this section are illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. X Corporation is a domestic corporation with foreign branch operations in country C.

The remaining $800 general limitation loss is offset by the passive interest limitation income in 1985 so that X has no net operating loss carryover that is attributable to the general limitation loss and no additional amount attributable

Sec. 1.904(f)-2  Recapture of overall foreign losses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. A taxpayer shall be required to recapture an overall foreign loss as provided in this section. Recapture is accomplished by treating as United States source income a portion of the taxpayer's foreign source taxable income of the same limitation as the foreign source loss that resulted in an overall foreign loss account. As a result, if the taxpayer elects the benefits of section 901 or section 936, the taxpayer's foreign tax credit limitation with respect to such income is decreased. As provided in Sec. 1.904 (f)-1(e)(2), the balance in a taxpayer's overall foreign loss account is reduced by the amount of loss recaptured. Recapture continues until such time as the amount of foreign source taxable income recharacterized as United States source income equals the amount in the overall foreign loss account. As provided in Sec. 1.904 (f)-1(e)(2), the balance in an overall foreign loss account is reduced at the end of each taxable year by the amount of the loss recaptured during that taxable year. Regardless of whether recapture occurs in a year in which a taxpayer elects the benefits of section 901 or in a year in which a taxpayer deducts its foreign taxes under section 164, the overall foreign loss account is recaptured only to the extent of foreign source taxable income remaining after applying the appropriate section 904(b) adjustments, if any, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Determination of taxable income from sources without the United States for purposes of recapture--(1) In general. For purposes of determining the amount of an overall foreign loss subject to recapture, the taxpayer's taxable income from sources without the United States shall be computed with respect to each of the separate limitations described in Sec. 1.904 (f)-1(c)(2) in accordance with the rules set forth in Sec. 1.904 (f)-1(c) (1) and (3). This computation is made without taking into account foreign source taxable income (and deductions properly allocated and apportioned thereto) subject to other separate limitations. Before applying the recapture rules to foreign source taxable income, the following provisions shall be applied to such income in the following order:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Former section 904(b)(3)(C) (prior to its removal by the Tax Reform Act of 1986) and the regulations thereunder shall be applied to treat certain foreign source gain as United States source gain; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 904(b)(2) and the regulations thereunder shall be applied to make adjustments in the foreign tax credit limitation fraction for certain capital gains and losses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Section 904(f)(1) recapture--(1) In general. In a taxable year in which a taxpayer elects the benefits of section 901 or section 30A, the section 904(f)(1) recapture amount is the amount of foreign source taxable income subject to recharacterization in a taxable year in which recapture of an overall foreign loss is required under paragraph (a) of this section. The section 904(f)(1) recapture amount equals the lesser of the aggregate amount of maximum potential recapture in all overall foreign loss accounts or fifty percent of the taxpayer's total foreign source taxable income. If the aggregate amount of maximum potential recapture in all overall foreign loss accounts exceeds fifty percent of the taxpayer's total foreign source taxable income, foreign source taxable income in each separate category with an overall foreign loss account is recharacterized in an amount equal to the section 904(f)(1) recapture amount, multiplied by the maximum

potential recapture in the overall foreign loss account, divided by the aggregate amount of maximum potential recapture in all overall foreign loss accounts. The maximum potential recapture in an overall foreign loss account in a separate category is the lesser of the balance in that overall foreign loss account or the foreign source taxable income for the year in the same separate category as the loss account. If, in any taxable year, in accordance with sections 164(a) and 275(a)(4)(A), a taxpayer deducts rather than credits its foreign taxes, recapture is applied to the extent of the lesser of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The balance in the overall foreign loss account in each separate category; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Foreign source taxable income (net of foreign taxes) in each separate category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Election to recapture more of the overall foreign loss than is required under paragraph (c)(1). In a year in which a taxpayer elects the benefits of sections 901 or 936, a taxpayer may make an annual revocable election to recapture a greater portion of the balance in an overall foreign loss account than is required to be recaptured under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. A taxpayer may make such an election or amend a prior election by attaching a statement to its annual Form 1116 or 1118. If an amendment is made to a prior year's election, an amended tax return should be filed. The statement attached to the Form 1116 or 1118 must indicate the percentage and dollar amount of the taxpayer's foreign source taxable income that is being recharacterized as United States source income and the percentage and dollar amount of the balance (both before and after recapture) in the overall foreign loss account that is being recaptured. Except for the special recapture rules for section 936 corporations and for recapture of pre-1983 overall foreign losses determined on a combined basis, the taxpayer that elects to credit its foreign taxes may not elect to recapture an amount in excess of the taxpayer's foreign source taxable income subject to the same limitation as the loss that resulted in the overall foreign loss account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special rule for recapture of losses incurred prior to section 936 election. If a corporation elects the application of section 936 and at the time of the election has a balance in any overall foreign loss account, such losses will be recaptured from the possessions source income of the electing section 936 corporation that qualifies for the section 936 credit, including qualified possession source investment income as defined in section 936(d)(2), even though the overall foreign loss to be recaptured may not be attributable to a loss in an income category of a type that would meet the definition of qualified possession source investment income. For purposes of recapturing an overall foreign loss incurred by a consolidated group including a corporation that subsequently elects to use section 936, the electing section 936 corporation's possession source income that qualifies for the section 936 credit, including qualified possession source investment income, shall be used to recapture the section 936 corporation's share of previously incurred overall foreign loss accounts. Rules for determining the section 936 corporation's share of the consolidated groups overall foreign loss accounts are provided in Sec. 1.1502-9(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Recapture of pre-1983 overall foreign losses determined on a combined basis. If a taxpayer computed its overall foreign losses on a combined basis in accordance with Sec. 1.904(f)-1(c)(1) for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1983, any losses recaptured in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982, shall be recaptured from income subject to the general limitation, subject to the rules in Sec. 1.904(f)-6 (a) and (b). Ordering rules for recapture of these losses are provided in Sec. 1.904(f)-6(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Illustrations. The rules of this paragraph (c) are illustrated by the following examples, all of which assume a United States corporate tax rate of 50 percent unless otherwise stated.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. X Corporation is a domestic corporation that does business in the United States and abroad. On December 31, 1983, the balance in X's general limitation overall foreign loss account is $600, all of which is attributable to a loss incurred in 1983. For 1984, X has United States source taxable income of $500 and foreign source taxable income subject to the general limitation of $500. For 1984, X pays $200 in foreign taxes and elects

section 901. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, X is required to recapture $250 (the lesser of $600 or 50 percent of $500) of its overall foreign loss. As a consequence, X's foreign tax credit limitation under the general limitation is $250/$1,000 x $500, or $125, instead of $500/$1,000 x $500, or $250. The balance in X's general limitation overall foreign loss account is reduced by $250 in accordance with Sec. 1.904(f)-1(e)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1 except that X makes an election to recapture its overall foreign loss to the extent of 80 percent of its foreign source taxable income subject to the general limitation (or $400) in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section. As a result of recapture, X's 1984 foreign tax credit limitation for income subject to the general limitation is $100/$1,000 x $500, or $50, instead of $500/$1,000 x $500, or $250. X's general limitation overall foreign loss account is reduced by $400 in accordance with Sec. 1.904(f)-1(e)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in example 1 except that X does not elect the benefits of section 901 in 1984 and instead deducts its foreign taxes paid. In 1984, X recaptures $300 of its overall foreign loss, the difference between X's foreign source taxable income of $500 and $200 of foreign taxes paid. The balance in X's general limitation overall foreign loss account is reduced by $300 in accordance with Sec. 1.904(f)-1(e)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Y Corporation is a domestic corporation that does business in the United States and abroad. On December 31, 2007, the balance in Y's general category overall foreign loss account is $500, all of which is attributable to a loss incurred in 2007. Y has no other loss accounts subject to recapture. For 2008, Y has U.S. source taxable income of $400 and foreign source taxable income of $300 in the general category and $900 in the passive category. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the amount of Y's general category income subject to recharacterization is the lesser of the aggregate maximum potential recapture or 50% of the total foreign source taxable income. In this case, Y's aggregate maximum potential recapture is $300 (the lesser of the $500 balance in the general category overall foreign loss account or $300 foreign source income in the general category for the year), which is less than 50% of Y's total foreign source taxable income ($1200 x 50% = $600). Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, $300 of foreign source income in the general category is recharacterized as U.S. source income. The balance in Y's general category overall foreign loss account is reduced to $200 in accordance with Sec. 1.904(f)-1(e)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. On December 31, 1980, V, a domestic corporation that does business in the United States and abroad, has a balance in its section 904(d)(1)(A-C) overall foreign loss account of $600. V also has a balance in its FORI limitation overall foreign loss account of $900. For 1981, V has foreign source taxable income subject to the general limitation of $500 and $500 of United States source income. V also has foreign source taxable income subject to the FORI limitation of $800. V is required to recapture $250 of its section 904(d)(1)(A-C) overall foreign loss account (the lesser of $600 or 50% of $500) and its general limitation foreign tax credit limitation is $250/$1,800 x $900, or $125 instead of $500/$1,800 x $900, or $250. V is also required to recapture $400 of its FORI limitation overall foreign loss account (the lesser of $900 or 50% of $800). V's foreign tax credit limitation for FORI is $400/$1,800 x $900, or $200, instead of $800/$1,800 x $900, or $400. The balance in V's FORI limitation overall foreign loss account is reduced to $500 and the balance in V's section 904(d)(1)(A-C) account is reduced to $350, in accordance with Sec. 1.904(f)-1(e)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. This example assumes a United States corporate tax rate of 46 percent (under section 11(b)) and an alternative rate of tax under section 1201(a) of 28 percent. W is a domestic corporation that does business in the United States and abroad. On December 31, 1984, W has $350 in its general limitation overall foreign loss account.

Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, W is required to recapture $350 (the lesser of $350 or 50 percent of $1,000), and W's general limitation overall foreign loss account is reduced to zero. W's foreign tax credit limitation for income subject to the general limitation is $650/$1,500 x $690 ((.46) (500 + 720) + (.28) (460)), or $299, instead of $1,000/$1,500 x $690, or $460.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Recapture of overall foreign losses from dispositions under section 904(f)(3)-- (1) In general. If a taxpayer disposes of property used or held for use predominantly without the United States in a trade or business during a taxable year

The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall be applied to the extent of 100 percent of the foreign source taxable income which is recognized under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section. However, amounts of foreign source gain that would not be recognized except by application of section 904(f)(3) and paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, and which are treated as United States source gain by application of section 904(b)(3)(C) (prior to its removal by the Tax Reform Act of 1986) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section, shall reduce the overall foreign loss account (subject to the adjustments described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) if such gain is net capital gain, notwithstanding the fact that such amounts would otherwise not be recaptured under the ordering rules in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Priorities among dispositions in which gain is deemed to be recognized. If, in a single taxable year, a taxpayer makes more than one disposition to which this paragraph (d)(4) is applicable, the rules of this paragraph (d)(4) shall be applied to each disposition in succession starting with the disposition which occurred earliest, until the balance in the applicable overall foreign loss account is reduced to zero. If the taxpayer simultaneously makes more than one disposition to which this paragraph (d)(4) is applicable, the rules of paragraph (d)(4) shall be applied so that the balance in the applicable overall foreign loss account to be recaptured will be allocated pro rata among the assets in proportion to the excess of the fair market value of each asset over the adjusted basis of each asset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Definitions--(i) Disposition. A disposition to which this paragraph (d) applies includes a sale; exchange; distribution; gift; transfer upon the foreclosure of a security interest (but not a mere transfer of title to a creditor upon creation of a security interest or to a debtor upon termination of a security interest); involuntary conversion; contribution to a partnership, trust, or corporation; transfer at death; or any other transfer of property whether or not gain or loss is recognized under other provisions of the Code. However, a disposition to which this paragraph (d) applies does not include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A distribution or transfer of property to a domestic corporation described in section 381 (a) (provided that paragraph (d)(6) of this section applies);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A disposition of property which is not a material factor in the realization of income by the taxpayer (as defined in paragraph (d)(5)(iv) of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A transaction in which gross income is not realized; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The entering into of a unitization or pooling agreement (as defined in Sec. 1.614-8(b)(6) of the regulations) containing a valid election under section 761(a)(2), and in which the source of the entire gain from any disposition of the interest created by the agreement would be determined to be foreign source under section 862(a)(5) if the disposition occurred presently.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Property used in a trade or business. Property is used in a trade or business if it is held for the principal purpose of promoting the present or future conduct of the trade or business. This generally includes property acquired and held in the ordinary course of a trade or business or otherwise held in a direct relationship to a trade or business. In determining whether an asset is held in a direct relationship to a trade or business, principal consideration shall be given to whether the asset is used in the trade or business. Property will be treated as held in a direct relationship to a trade or business if the property was acquired with funds generated by that trade or business or if income generated from the asset is available for use in that trade or business. Property used in a trade or business may be tangible or intangible, real

or personal property. It includes property, such as equipment, which is subject to an allowance for depreciation under section 167 or cost recovery under section 168. Property may be considered used in a trade or business even if it is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer. However, stock of another corporation shall not be considered property used in a trade or business if a substantial investment motive exists for acquiring and holding the stock. On the other hand, stock acquired or held to assure a source of supply for a trade or business shall be considered property used in that trade or business. Inventory is generally not considered property used in a trade or business. However, when disposed of in a manner not in the ordinary course of a trade or business, inventory will be considered property used in the trade or business. A partnership interest will be treated as property used in a trade or business if the underlying assets of the partnership would be property used in a trade or business. For purposes of section 904(f) (3) and Sec. 1.904(f)-2 (d) (1) and (5), a disposition of a partnership interest to which this section applies will be treated as a disposition of a proportionate share of each of the assets of the partnership. For purposes of allocating the purchase price of the interest and the seller's basis in the interest to those assets, the principles of Sec. 1.751-1(a) will apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Property used predominantly outside the United States. Property will be considered used predominantly outside the United States if for a 3-year period ending on the date of the disposition (or, if shorter, the period during which the property has been used in the trade or business) such property was located outside the United States more than 50 percent of the time. An aircraft, railroad rolling stock, vessel, motor vehicle, container, or other property used for transportation purposes is deemed to be used predominantly outside the United States if, during the 3-year (or shorter) period, either such property is located outside the United States more than 50 percent of the time or more than 50 percent of the miles traversed in the use of such property are traversed outside the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Property which is a material factor in the realization of income. For purposes of this section, property used in a trade or business will be considered a material factor in the realization of income unless the taxpayer establishes that it is not (or, if the taxpayer did not realize income from the trade or business in the taxable year, would not be expected to be) necessary to the realization of income by the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Carryover of overall foreign loss accounts in a corporate acquisition to which section 381(a) applies. In the case of a distribution or transfer described in section 381(a), an overall foreign loss account of the distributing or transferor corporation shall be treated as an overall foreign loss account of the acquiring or transferee corporation as of the close of the date of the distribution or transfer. If the transferee corporation had an overall foreign loss account under the same separate limitation prior to the distribution or transfer, the balance in the transferor's account must be added to the transferee's account. If not, the transferee must adopt the transferor's overall foreign loss account. An overall foreign loss of the transferor will be treated as incurred by the transferee in the year prior to the year of the transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Illustrations. The rules of this paragraph (d) are illustrated by the following examples which assume that the United States corporate tax rate is 50 percent (unless otherwise stated). For purposes of these examples, none of the foreign source gains are treated as net capital gains (unless so stated).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. X Corporation has a balance in its general limitation overall foreign loss account of $600 at the close of its taxable year ending December 31, 1984. In 1985, X sells assets used predominantly outside the United States in a trade or business and recognizes $1,000 of gain on the sale under section 1001. This gain is subject to the general limitation. This sale is a disposition within the meaning of paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section, and to which this paragraph (d) applies. X has no other foreign source taxable income in 1985 and has $1,000 of United States source taxable income. Under paragraph (c), X is required to recapture $500 (the lesser of the balance in X's general limitation overall foreign loss account ($600) or 50 percent of $1,000) of its overall foreign loss account. The

balance in X's general limitation overall foreign loss account is reduced to $100 in accordance with Sec. 1.904(f)-1(e)(2). In addition, under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, X is required to recapture $100 (the lesser of the remaining balance in its general limitation overall foreign loss account ($100) or 100 percent of its foreign source taxable income recognized on such disposition that has not been previously recharacterized ($500)). The total amount recaptured is $600. X's foreign tax credit limitation for income subject to the general limitation in 1985 is $200 ($400/$2,000 x $1,000) instead of $500 ($1,000/$2,000 x $1,000). The balance in X's general limitation overall foreign loss account is reduced to zero in accordance with Sec. 1.904(f)-1(e)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. On December 31, 1984, Y Corporation has a balance in its general limitation overall foreign loss account of $1,500. In 1985, Y has $500 of United States source taxable income and $200 of foreign source taxable income subject to the general limitation. Y's foreign source taxable income is from the sale of property used predominantly outside of the United States in a trade or business. This sale is a disposition to which this paragraph (d) is applicable. In 1985, Y also transferred property used predominantly outside of the United States in a trade or business to another corporation. Under section 351, no gain was recognized on this transfer. Such property had been used to generate foreign source taxable income subject to the general limitation. The excess of the fair market value of the property transferred over Y's adjusted basis in such property was $2,000. In accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, Y is required to recapture $100 (the lesser of $1,500, the amount in Y's general limitation overall foreign loss account, or 50 percent of $200, the amount of general limitation foreign source taxable income for the current year) of its general limitation overall foreign loss. Y is then required to recapture an additional $100 of its general limitation overall foreign loss account under paragraph (d)(3) of this section out of the remaining gain recognized on the sale of assets, because 100 percent of such gain is subject to recapture. The balance in Y's general limitation overall foreign loss account is reduced to $1,300 in accordance with Sec. 1.904(f)-1(e)(2). Y corporation is then required to recognize $1,300 of foreign source taxable income on its section 351 transfer under paragraph (d)(4) of this section. The remaining $700 of potential gain associated with the section 351 transfer is not recognized. Under paragraph (d)(4), 100 percent of the $1,300 is recharacterized as United States source taxable income, and Y's general limitation overall foreign loss account is reduced to zero. Y's entire taxable income for 1985 is:

W Corporation is a calendar year domestic corporation with foreign branch operations in country C. As of December 31, 1984, W has no overall foreign loss accounts and has no net operating loss carryovers. W's entire taxable income in 1985 is:
U.S. source taxable income.................................         $800Foreign source taxable income (loss) subject to the general     ($1,000)</p><p class="depth0">limitation................................................</p><p class="depth0">W cannot carry back its 1985 NOL to any earlier year. As of December 31, 1985, W therefore has $800 in its general limitation overall foreign loss account. In 1986, W earns $400 United States source taxable income and has an additional $1,000 loss from the operations of the foreign branch. Income in the loss category would be subject to the general limitation. Also in 1986, W disposes of property used predominately outside the United States in a trade or business. Such property generated income subject to the general limitation. The excess of the property's fair market value over its adjusted basis is $3,000. The disposition is of a type described in Sec. 1.904 (f)-2(d)(4)(i). W has no other income in 1986. Under Sec. 1.904 (f)-2(d)(4)(i), W is required to recognize foreign source taxable income on the disposition in an amount equal to the lesser of $2,000 ($800 (the balance in the general limitation overall foreign loss account as of 1985) + $400 (the increase in the general limitation overall foreign loss account attributable to the disposition year) + $600 (the general limitation overall foreign loss that is part of the NOL from 1986) + $200 (the general limitation overall foreign loss that is part of the NOL from 1985)) or $3,000. The $2,000 foreign source income required to be recognized under section 904(f)(3) is reduced to $1,200 by the remaining $600 loss in 1986 and the $200 net operating loss carried forward from 1985. This $1,200 of income is subject to the general limitation. In computing foreign tax credit limitation for general limitation income, the $1,200 of foreign source income is treated as United States source income and, therefore, W's foreign tax credit limitation for income subject to the general limitation is zero. W's overall foreign loss account is reduced to zero.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Z Corporation has a balance in its FORI overall foreign loss account of $1,500 at the end of its taxable year 1980. In

1981, Z has $1,600 of foreign oil related income subject to the separate limitation for FORI income and no United States source income. In addition, in 1981, Z makes two dispositions of property used predominantly outside the United States in a trade or business on which no gain was recognized. Such property generated foreign oil related income. The excess of the fair market value of the property transferred in the first disposition over Z's adjusted basis in such property is $575. The excess of the fair market value of the property transferred in the second disposition over Z's adjusted basis in such property is $1,000. Under paragraph (c) of this section, Z is required to recapture $800 (the lesser of 50 percent of its foreign oil related income of $1,600 or the balance ($1,500) in its FORI overall foreign loss account) of its foreign oil related loss. In accordance with paragraphs (d)(4) (i) and (iv) of this section, Z is required to recognize foreign oil related income in the amount of $575 on the first disposition and, since the foreign oil related loss account is now reduced by $1,375 (the $800 and $575 amounts previously recaptured), Z is required to recognize foreign oil related income in the amount of $125 on the second disposition. In accordance with paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section, the entire amount recognized is treated as United States source income and the balance in the FORI overall foreign loss account is reduced to zero under Sec. 1.904 (f)-1 (e)(2). Z's foreign tax credit limitation for FORI is $400 ($800/$2,300 x $1,150) instead of $800 ($1,600/$1,600 x $800).</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. The facts are the same as in example 4, except that the gain from the two dispositions of property is treated as net capital gain and the United States corporate tax rate is assumed to be 46 percent. As in example 4, Z is required to recapture $800 of its foreign oil related loss from its 1981 ordinary foreign oil related income. In accordance with paragraph (d)(4) (i) and (iv) of this section, Z is first required to recognize foreign oil related income (which is net capital gain) on the first disposition in the amount of $575. Under paragraphs (b) and (d) (2) of this section, this net capital gain is adjusted by subtracting the rate differential portion of such gain from the total amount of such gain to determine the amount by which the foreign oil related loss account is reduced, which is $350 ($575- ($575 x 18/46)). The balance remaining in Z's foreign oil related loss account after this step is $350. Therefore, this process will be repeated, in accordance with paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section, to recapture that remaining balance out of the gain deemed recognized on the second disposition, resulting in reduction of the foreign oil related loss account to zero and net capital gain required to be recognized from the second dispostion in the amount of $575, which must also be adjusted by subtracting the rate differential portion to determine the amount by which the foreign oil related loss account is reduced (which is $350). The $575 of net capital gain from each disposition is recharacterized as United States source net capital gain. Z's section 907 (b) foreign tax credit limitation is the same as in example 4, and Z has $1,150 ($575 + $575) of United States source net capital gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective/applicability date.

Sec. 1.904(f)-4  Recapture of foreign losses out of accumulationdistributions from a foreign trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. If a taxpayer receives a distribution of foreign source taxable income subject to a separate limitation in which the taxpayer had a balance in an overall foreign loss account and that income is treated under section 666 as having been distributed by a foreign trust in a preceding taxable year, a portion of the balance in the taxpayer's applicable overall foreign loss account shall be subject to recapture under this section. The amount subject to recapture shall be the lesser of the balance in the taxpayer's overall foreign loss account (after applying Sec. Sec. 1.904(f)-1, 1.904(f)-2, 1.904(f)-3, and 1.904(f)-6 to the taxpayer's other income or loss in the current taxable year) or the entire amount of foreign source taxable income deemed distributed in a preceding year or years under section 666.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Effect of recapture on foreign tax credit limitation under section 667(d). If

Such portion shall be determined by multiplying the amount of foreign source taxable income deemed distributed in the computation year by a fraction. The numerator of this fraction is the balance in the taxpayer's overall foreign loss account (after application of Sec. Sec. 1.904(f)-1, 1.904(f)-2, 1.904(f)-3, and 1.904(f)-6), and the denominator of the fraction is the entire amount of foreign source taxable income deemed distributed under section 666.

If paragraph (a) of this section is applicable and if, in accordance with section 667(d)(1)(B), the beneficiary deducted rather than credited its taxes in the computation year, the beneficiary shall reduce its overall foreign loss account (but not below zero) by an amount equal to the lesser of the balance in the applicable overall foreign loss account or the amount of the actual distribution deemed distributed in the computation year (without regard to the foreign taxes deemed distributed).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Illustrations. The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. X Corporation is a domestic corporation that has a balance of $10,000 in its general limitation overall foreign loss account on December 31, 1980. For its taxable year beginning January 1, 1981, X's only income is an accumulation distribution from a foreign trust of $20,000 of general limitation foreign source taxable income. Under section 666, the amount distributed and the foreign taxes paid on such amount ($4,000) are deemed distributed in two prior taxable years. In determining the partial tax on such distribution under section 667(b), the amount added to each computation year is $12,000 (the sum of the actual distribution plus the taxes deemed distributed ($24,000) divided by the number of accumulation years (2)). Of that amount, $5,000 ($10,000/$24,000 x $12,000) is treated as United States source taxable income in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. Assuming the United States tax rate is 50 percent, X's separate foreign tax credit limitation against the increase in tax in each computation year is $3,500 ($7,000/$12,000 x $6,000) instead of $6,000 ($12,000/$12,000 x $6,000). X's overall foreign loss account is reduced to zero in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that X deducted rather than credited its foreign taxes in the computation years. In 1979, the amount added to X's income is $12,000 under section 667(b), $2,000 of which is deductible under section 667(d)(1)(B). X must reduce its overall foreign loss account by $10,000, the amount of the actual distribution that is deemed distributed in 1979 (without regard to the $2,000 foreign taxes also deemed distributed). The entire overall foreign loss account is therefore reduced to $0 in 1979.

In taxable years in which a trust has foreign source taxable income subject to a separate limitation in which the trust has a balance in its overall foreign loss account, the balance in the trust's overall foreign loss account shall be recaptured as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Trust accumulates income. If the trust accumulates all of its foreign source taxable income subject to the same limitation as the loss that created the balance in the overall foreign loss account, its overall foreign loss shall be recaptured out of such income in accordance with Sec.

If the trust distributes all of its foreign source taxable income subject to the same limitation as the loss that created the overall foreign loss account, the amount of the overall foreign loss that would be subject to recapture by the trust under paragraph (b)(1) of this

section shall be allocated to the beneficiaries in proportion to the amount of such income which is distributed to each beneficiary in that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Trust accumulates and distributes income.

The amount of overall foreign loss to be allocated to such beneficiaries shall be the same portion of the total amount of such overall foreign loss that would be recaptured as the amount of such income which is distributed to each beneficiary bears to the total amount of such income of the trust for such year. That portion of the overall foreign loss subject to recapture in such year that is not allocated to the beneficiaries in accordance with this paragraph (b)(3) shall be recaptured by the trust in accordance with paragraph (b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Amounts allocated to beneficiaries. Amounts of a trust's overall foreign loss allocated to any beneficiary in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section shall be added to the beneficiary's applicable overall foreign loss account and treated as an overall foreign loss of the beneficiary incurred in the taxable year preceding the year of such allocation.

T, a domestic trust, has a balance of $2,000 in a general limitation overall foreign loss account on December 31, 1983. For its taxable year ending on December 31, 1984, T has foreign source taxable income subject to the general limitation of $1,600, all of which it accumulates. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, T is required to recapture $800 in 1984 (the lesser of the overall foreign loss or 50 percent of the foreign source taxable income). This amount is treated as United States source income for purposes of taxing T in 1984 and upon subsequent distribution to T's beneficiaries. At the end of its 1984 taxable year, T has a balance of $1,200 in its overall foreign loss account.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1. In 1985, T has general limitation foreign source taxable income of $1,000, which it distributes to its beneficiaries as follows: $500 to A, $250 to B, and $250 to C. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, T would have been required to recapture $500 of its overall foreign loss if it had accumulated all of such income. Therefore, under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, T must allocate $500 of its overall foreign loss to A, B, and C as follows: $250 to A ($500 x $500/$1,000), $125 to B ($500 x $250/$1,000), and $125 to C ($500 x $250/$1,000). Under paragraph (c) of this section and Sec. 1.904(f)-1(d)(4), A, B, and C must add the amounts of general limitation overall foreign loss allocated to them from T to their overall foreign loss accounts and treat such amounts as overall foreign losses incurred in 1984. A, B, and C must then apply the rules of Sec. Sec. 1.904(f)-1, 1.904(f)-2, 1.904(f)-3, 1.904(f)-4, and 1.904(f)-6 to recapture their overall foreign losses. T's overall foreign loss account is reduced in accordance with Sec. 1.904(f)-1(e)(1) by the $500 that is allocated to A, B, and C. At the end of 1985, T's general limitation overall foreign loss account has a balance of $700.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in example 2, including an overall foreign loss account at the end of 1984 of $1,200, except that in 1985 T's general limitation foreign source taxable income is $1,500 instead of $1,000, and T accumulates the additional $500. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, T would be required to recapture $750 of its overall foreign loss if it accumulated all of the $1,500. Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, T must allocate $500 of its overall foreign loss to A, B, and C as follows: $250 to A ($750 x $500/$1,500) and $125 each to B and C (750 x $250/$1,500). T must also recapture $250 of its overall foreign loss, which is the amount subject to recapture in 1985 that is not allocated to the beneficiaries ($750-$500 = $250). Under Sec. 1.904(f)-1(e)(1), T reduces its general limitation overall foreign loss account by

$500. Under Sec. 1.904(f)-1(e)(2), T reduces its general limitation overall foreign loss account by $250. At the end of 1985 there is a balance in the general limitation overall foreign loss account of $450 (($1,200-$500)-$250).

A taxpayer shall recapture a separate limitation loss account as provided in this section. If the taxpayer has a separate limitation loss account or accounts in any separate category (the ``loss category'') and the loss category has income in a subsequent taxable year, the income shall be recharacterized as income in that other category or categories. The amount of income recharacterized shall not exceed the aggregate balance in all separate limitation loss accounts for the loss category as determined under Sec. 1.904(f)-7. If the taxpayer has more than one separate limitation loss account in a loss category, and there is not enough income in the loss category to recapture all of the loss accounts, then separate limitation income in the loss category shall be recharacterized as separate limitation income in the other separate categories on a proportionate basis. This is determined by multiplying the total separate limitation income subject to recharacterization by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount in a particular separate limitation loss account and the denominator of which is the total amount in all separate limitation loss accounts for the loss category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Effect of recharacterization of separate limitation income on associated taxes.

X's overall foreign loss incurred during its 1986 taxable year is recaptured before the overall foreign loss incurred during its 1987 taxable year, as follows: $80 ($100 x 800/1000) of X's financial services income, $10 ($100 x 100/1000) of X's general limitation income, and $10 (100 x 100/1000) of X's shipping income will be treated as U.S. source income. The remaining $90 of X corporation's 1988 shipping income will be treated as U.S. source income for the purpose of recapturing X's 100 overall foreign loss attributable to the shipping loss incurred in 1987. $10 remains in X's shipping overall foreign loss account for recapture in subsequent taxable years.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that X has $800 of financial services income, $100 of general limitation income, a $100 dividend from a noncontrolled section 902 corporation and a ($100) shipping loss for its taxable year ending December 31, 1988. Separate limitation losses are allocated pursuant to the rules of section 904(f)(5) before the recapture of overall foreign losses. Therefore, the ($100) shipping loss incurred by X will be allocated to its separate limitation income as follows: $80 ($100 x 800/1000) will be allocated to X's financial services income, $10 ($100 x 100/1000) will be allocated to its general limitation income and $10 ($100 x 100/1000) will be allocated to X's dividend from the noncontrolled section 902 corporation. Accordingly, after allocation of the 1988 shipping loss, X has $720 of financial services income, $90 of general limitation income, and a $90 dividend from the noncontrolled section 902 corporation. Pursuant to section 904(f)(1), the full amount in each of X corporation's overall foreign loss accounts is subject to recapture since $200 (the sum of those amounts) is less than 50% of X's net foreign source taxable income for its 1988 taxable year, or $450. X's overall foreign loss incurred during its 1986 taxable year is recaptured as follows: $80 ($100 x 720/900) of X's financial services income, $10 ($100 x 90/900) of its general limitation income and $10 ($100 x 90/900) of its dividend from the noncontrolled section 902 corporation will be treated as U.S. source income. Accordingly, after application of section 904(f), X has $100 of U.S. source income, $640 of financial services income, $80 of general limitation income and a $80 dividend from the noncontrolled section 902 corporation for its 1988 taxable year. X must establish a separate limitation loss account for each portion of the 1988 shipping loss that was allocated to its financial services income, general limitation income and dividends from the noncontrolled section 902 corporation. X's overall foreign loss account for the 1986 general limitation loss is reduced to zero. X still has a $100 balance in its overall foreign loss account that resulted from the 1987 shipping loss.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Y is a domestic corporation which has a branch operation in Country Z. For its 1988 taxable year, Y has $5 of shipping income, $15 of general limitation income and $100 of financial services income. Y has a balance of $100 in its general limitation overall foreign loss account attributable to its 1986 taxable year. Y has no other overall foreign loss accounts. Pursuant to section 904(f)(1), $60 of the overall foreign loss is subject to recapture since 50% of Y's foreign source income for 1988 is less than the balance in its overall foreign loss account. Y can demonstrate that the entire $100 overall foreign loss was attributable to a shipping limitation loss incurred in 1986. Accordingly, only Y's $5 of shipping limitation income received in 1988 will be treated as U.S. source income, Because Y can demonstrate that the 1986 loss was entirely attributable to a shipping loss, none of Y's general limitation income or financial services income received in 1988 will be treated as U.S. source income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in Example 3 except that Y can only demonstrate that $50 of the 1986 overall foreign loss account was attributable to a shipping loss incurred in 1986. Accordingly, Y's $5 of shipping limitation income received in 1988 will be treated as U.S. source income. The remaining $50 of the 1986 overall foreign loss that Y cannot trace to a particular separate limitation will be recaptured and treated as U.S. source income as follows: $43 ($50 x 100/115) of Y's financial services income will be treated as U.S. source income and $7 ($50 x 15/115) of Y's general limitation income will be treated as U.S. source income.

An overall foreign loss that is part of a net operating loss incurred in a pre-effective date taxable year which is carried forward, pursuant to section 172, to a post-effective date taxable year will be carried forward under the rules of section 904(f)(5) and the regulations under that section. See also Notice 89-3, 1989-1 C.B. 623. For this purpose the loss

must be allocated to income in the category analogous to the income category set forth in section 904(d) as in effect for pre-effective date taxable years in which the loss occurred. The analogous category shall be determined under the rules of paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rule of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example. Z is a domestic corporation which has a branch operation in Country D. For its taxable year ending December 31, 1988, Z has $100 of passive income and $200 of general limitation income. Z also has a $60 net operating loss which was carried forward pursuant to section 172 from its 1986 taxable year. The net operating loss resulted from an overall foreign loss attributable to the general limitation income category. Z can demonstrate that the loss is a shipping loss. Therefore, the net operating loss will be treated as a shipping loss for Z's 1988 taxable year. Pursuant to section 904(f)(5), the shipping loss will be allocated as follows: $20 ($60 x 100/300) will be allocated to Z's passive income and $40 ($60 x 200/300) will be allocated to Z's general limitation income. Accordingly, after application of section 904(f), Z has $80 of passive income and $160 of general limitation income for its 1988 taxable year. Although no addition to Z's overall foreign loss account for shipping income will result from the NOL carry forward, shipping income earned by Z in subsequent taxable years, will be subject to recharacterization as a passive income and general limitation income pursuant to the rules set forth in section 904(f)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Treatment of overall foreign losses that are part of net operating losses incurred in post-effective date taxable years which are carried back to pre-effective date taxable years--(1) Allocation to analogous income category. An overall foreign loss that is part of a net operating loss incurred by the taxpayer in a post-effective date taxable year which is carried back, pursuant to section 172, to a pre-effective date taxable year shall be allocated first to income in the pre-effective date income category analogous to the income category set forth in section 904(d) as in effect for post-effective date taxable years in which the loss occurred. Except for the general limitation income category, the pre-effective date income category that is analogous to a post-effective date income category shall be determined under paragraphs (a)(1) (i) through (iv) of this section. The general limitation income category for pre-effective date years shall be treated as the income category that is analogous to the post-effective date categories for general limitation income, financial services income, shipping income, dividends from each noncontrolled section 902 corporation and high withholding tax interest income. If the net operating loss resulted from separate limitation losses in more than one post-effective date income category and more than one loss is carried back to pre-effective date general limitation income, then the losses shall be allocated to the pre-effective date general limitation income based on the following formula:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC07OC91.044</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Allocation to U.S. source income. If an overall foreign loss is carried back to a pre-effective date taxable year and the loss exceeds the foreign source income in the analogous category for the carry back year, the remaining loss shall be allocated against U.S. source income as set forth in Sec. 1.904(f)-3. The amount of the loss that offsets U.S. source income must be added to the taxpayer's overall foreign loss account. An addition to an overall foreign loss account resulting from the carry back of a net operating loss incurred by a

taxpayer in a post-effective date taxable year shall be treated as having been incurred by the taxpayer in the year in which the loss arose and shall be subject to recapture pursuant to section 904(f) as in effect for post-effective date taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Allocation to other separate limitation categories. To the extent that an overall foreign loss that is carried back as part of a net operating loss exceeds the separate limitation income to which it is allocated and the U.S. source income of the taxpayer for the taxable year to which the loss is carried, the loss shall be allocated pro rata to other separate limitation income of the taxpayer for the taxable year. However, there shall be no recharacterization of separate limitation income pursuant to section 904(f)(5) as a result of the alloction of such a net operating loss to other separate limitation income of the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. X is a domestic corporation which has a branch operation in Country A. For its taxable year ending December 31, 1987, X has a $60 net operating loss which is carried back pursuant to section 172 to its taxable year ending December 31, 1985. The net operating loss resulted from a shipping loss; X had no U.S. source income in 1987. X had $20 of general limitation income, $40 of DISC limitation income and $10 of U.S. source income for its 1985 taxable year. The $60 NOL is allocated first to X's 1985 general limitation income to the extent thereof ($20) since the general limitation income category of section 904(d) as in effect for pre-effective date taxable years is the income category that is analogous to shipping income for post-effective date taxable years. Therefore, X has no general limitation income for its 1985 taxable year. Next, pursuant to section 904(f) as in effect for pre-effective date taxable years, the remaining $40 of the NOL is allocated first to X's $10 of U.S. source income and then to $30 of X's DISC limitation income for its 1985 taxable year. Accordingly, X has no U.S. source income and $10 of DISC limitation income for its 1985 taxable year after allocation of the NOL. X has a $10 balance in its shipping overall foreign loss account which is subject to recapture pursuant to section 904(f) as in effect for post-effective date taxable years. X will not be required to recharacterize, pursuant to section 904(f)(5), subsequent shipping income as DISC limitation income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2.

The net operating loss resulted from a ($100) general limitation loss and a ($100) shipping loss. Y had $100 of general limitation income and $200 of U.S. source income for its taxable year ending December 31, 1986. The separate limitation losses for 1987 are allocated pro rata to Y's 1986 general limitation income as follows: $50 of the ($100) general limitation loss ($100 x 100/200) and $50 of the ($100) shipping loss ($100 x 100/200) is allocated to Y's $100 of 1986 general limitation income. The remaining $50 of Y's general limitation loss and the remaining $50 of Y's shipping loss are allocated to Y's 1986 U.S. source income. Accordingly, Y has no foreign source income and $100 of U.S. source income for its 1986 taxable year. Y has a $50 balance in its general limitation overall foreign loss account and a $50 balance in its shipping overall foreign loss account, both of which will be subject to recapture pursuant to section 904(f) as in effect for post-effective date taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Recapture of FORI and general limitation overall foreign losses incurred in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1983.

In addition, if a taxpayer that is a financial services entity (as defined in Sec. 1.904-4(e)(3)) chooses to apply 26 CFR 1.904(f)-12T(h) to taxable years ending before April 7, 2011, then as of the beginning of the taxpayer's first taxable year ending on or after April 7, 2011 any remaining balance in a passive category loss account that is attributable to a loss account in a pre-2007 separate category for high withholding tax interest shall be allocated to the general category or eliminated pursuant to Sec. 1.904(f)-12(h)(4), and any remaining balance in a separate limitation loss account with respect to passive category income that is attributable to a loss account with respect to a pre-2007 separate category for high withholding tax interest will be recaptured in such year and subsequent taxable years as general category income or eliminated pursuant to Sec. 1.904(f)-12(h)(4).

Sec. 1.904(g)-1  Overall domestic loss and the overall domestic lossaccount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Overview of regulations. This section provides rules for determining a taxpayer's overall domestic losses, for establishing overall domestic loss accounts, and for making additions to and reducing such accounts for purposes of section 904(g). Section 1.904(g)-2 provides rules for recapturing the balance in any overall domestic loss account under the general recharacterization rule of section 904(g)(1). Section 1.904(g)-3 provides ordering rules for the allocation of net operating losses, net capital losses, U.S. source losses, and separate limitation losses, and the recapture of separate limitation losses, overall foreign losses and overall domestic losses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Overall domestic loss accounts--(1) In general. Any taxpayer that sustains an overall domestic loss under paragraph (c) of this section must establish an overall domestic loss account for such loss with respect to each separate category, as defined in Sec. 1.904(f)-7(b)(1), of the taxpayer in which foreign source income is offset by the domestic loss. The balance in each overall domestic loss account represents the amount of such overall domestic loss subject to recapture in a given taxable year. From year to year, amounts may be added to or subtracted from the balances in such loss accounts as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Taxable year in which overall domestic loss is sustained. When a domestic loss is carried back or carried forward as part of a net operating loss, and offsets foreign source income in a carryover year, the resulting overall domestic loss is treated as sustained in the later of the year in which the domestic loss was incurred or the year to which the loss was carried. Accordingly, when a taxpayer incurs a domestic loss that is carried back as part of a net operating loss to offset foreign source income in a qualified taxable year, as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the resulting overall domestic loss is treated as sustained in the later year in which the domestic loss was incurred and not in the earlier year in which the loss offset foreign source income. In addition, when a taxpayer incurs a domestic loss that is carried forward as part of a net operating loss and applied to offset foreign source income in a later taxable year, the resulting overall domestic loss is treated as sustained in the later year in which the domestic loss offsets foreign source income and not in the earlier year in which the loss was incurred. For example, if a taxpayer incurs a domestic loss in the 2007 taxable year that is carried back to the 2006 qualified taxable year and offsets foreign source income in 2006, the resulting overall domestic loss is treated as sustained in the 2007 taxable year. If a taxpayer incurs a domestic loss in a pre-2007 taxable year that

is carried forward to a post-2006 qualified taxable year and offsets foreign source income in the post-2006 year, the resulting overall domestic loss is treated as sustained in the post-2006 year. An overall domestic loss account is established, or increased under paragraph (d) of this section, at the end of the taxable year in which the overall domestic loss is treated as sustained and will be recaptured from U.S. source income arising in subsequent taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Determination of a taxpayer's overall domestic loss--(1) Overall domestic loss defined. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006, a taxpayer sustains an overall domestic loss--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In any qualified taxable year in which its domestic loss for such taxable year offsets foreign source taxable income for the taxable year or for any preceding qualified taxable year by reason of a carryback; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In any other taxable year in which the domestic loss for such taxable year offsets foreign source taxable income for any preceding qualified taxable year by reason of a carryback.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Domestic loss defined. For purposes of this section and Sec. Sec. 1.904(g)-2 and 1.904(g)-3, the term domestic loss means the amount by which the U.S. source gross income for the taxable year is exceeded by the sum of the expenses, losses, and other deductions properly apportioned or allocated to such income, taking into account any net operating loss carried forward from a prior taxable year, but not any loss carried back. If a taxpayer has any capital gains or losses or qualified dividend income, as defined in section 1(h)(11), the amount of the taxpayer's domestic loss that offsets foreign source income must be determined taking into account adjustments under section 904(b)(2). See Sec. 1.904(g)-1(d)(3) for further guidance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Qualified taxable year defined. For purposes of this section and Sec. Sec. 1.904(g)-2 and 1.904(g)-3, the term qualified taxable year means any taxable year for which the taxpayer chooses the benefits of section 901.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Method of allocation and apportionment of deductions. In determining its overall domestic loss, a taxpayer shall allocate and apportion expenses, losses, and other deductions to U.S. source gross income in accordance with sections 861(b) and 865 and the regulations thereunder, including Sec. Sec. 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Additions to overall domestic loss accounts--(1) General rule. A taxpayer's overall domestic loss as determined under paragraph (c) of this section shall be added to the applicable overall domestic loss account at the end of its taxable year to the extent that the overall domestic loss either reduces foreign source income for the year (but only if such year is a qualified taxable year) or reduces foreign source income for a qualified taxable year to which the loss has been carried back.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Overall domestic loss of another taxpayer. If any portion of any overall domestic loss of another taxpayer is allocated to the taxpayer in accordance with Sec. 1.1502-9 (relating to consolidated overall domestic losses) the taxpayer shall add such amount to its applicable overall domestic loss account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Adjustments for capital gains and losses. If the taxpayer has capital gains or losses or qualified dividend income, the amount by which a domestic loss is considered to reduce foreign source income in a taxable year shall equal the section 904(f)(5)(D) amount determined under Sec. 1.904(b)-1(h)(1)(iii), regardless of the amount of domestic loss that was determined before taking any section 904(b)(2) adjustments into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Reductions of overall domestic loss accounts. The taxpayer shall subtract the following amounts from its overall domestic loss accounts at the end of its taxable year in the following order, as applicable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Pre-recapture reduction for amounts allocated to other taxpayers. An overall domestic loss account is reduced by the amount of any overall domestic loss which is allocated to another taxpayer in accordance with Sec. 1.1502-9 (relating to consolidated overall domestic losses).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reduction for amounts recaptured. An overall domestic loss account is reduced by the amount of any U.S. source income that is recharacterized in accordance with Sec. 1.904(g)-2(c) (relating to recapture under section 904(g)(1)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section applies to taxpayers that sustain an overall domestic loss for a taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2012. Taxpayers may choose to apply this section to overall domestic losses sustained in other taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006, including periods covered by 26 CFR Sec. 1.904(g)-1T (revised as of April 1, 2010).
[T.D. 9595, 77 FR 37580, June 22, 2012]


Sec. 1.904(g)-2  Recapture of overall domestic losses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. A taxpayer shall recapture an overall domestic loss as provided in this section. Recapture is accomplished by treating a portion of the taxpayer's U.S. source taxable income as foreign source income. The recharacterized income is allocated among and increases foreign source income in separate categories in proportion to the balances of the overall domestic loss accounts with respect to those separate categories. As a result, if the taxpayer chooses the benefits of section 901, the taxpayer's foreign tax credit limitation is increased. As provided in Sec. 1.904(g)-1(e)(2), the balance in a taxpayer's overall domestic loss account with respect to a separate category is reduced at the end of each taxable year by the amount of loss recaptured during that taxable year. Recapture continues until the amount of U.S. source income recharacterized as foreign source income equals the amount in the overall domestic loss account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Determination of U.S. source taxable income for purposes of recapture. For purposes of determining the amount of an overall domestic loss subject to recapture, the taxpayer's taxable income from U.S. sources shall be computed in accordance with the rules set forth in Sec. 1.904(g)-1(c)(4). U.S. source taxable income shall be determined by taking into account adjustments for capital gains and losses and qualified dividend income in a similar manner to the adjustments made to foreign source taxable income under section 904(b)(2) and Sec. 1.904(b)-1, following the principles of Sec. 1.904(b)-1(h)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Section 904(g)(1) recapture. The amount of any U.S. source taxable income subject to recharacterization in a taxable year in which paragraph (a) of this section applies is the lesser of the aggregate balance of the taxpayer's overall domestic loss accounts or 50 percent of the taxpayer's U.S. source taxable income (as determined under paragraph (b) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section applies to taxpayers that sustain an overall domestic loss for a taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2012. Taxpayers may choose to apply this section to overall domestic losses sustained in other taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006, including periods covered by 26 CFR 1.904(g)-2T (revised as of April 1, 2010).

Sec. 1.904(g)-3  Ordering rules for the allocation of net operatinglosses, net capital losses, U.S. source losses, and separate limitationlosses, and for the recapture of separate limitation losses, overallforeign losses, and overall domestic losses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. This section provides ordering rules for the allocation of net operating losses, net capital losses, U.S. source losses, and separate limitation losses, and for the recapture of separate limitation losses, overall foreign losses, and overall domestic losses. The rules must be applied in the order set forth in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Step One: Allocation of net operating loss and net capital loss carryovers--(1) In general. Net operating losses from a current taxable year are carried forward or back to a taxable year in the following manner. Net operating losses that are carried forward pursuant to section 172 are combined with income or loss in the carryover year in the manner described in this paragraph (b). The combined amounts are then subject to the ordering rules provided in paragraphs (c) through (i) of this section. Net operating losses that are carried back to a prior taxable year pursuant to section 172 are allocated to income in the carryback year in the manner set forth in paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), (c), (d), and (e) of this section. The income in the carryback year to which the net operating loss is allocated is the foreign source income in each separate category and the U.S.

source income after the application of sections 904(f) and 904(g) to income and loss in that previous year, including as a result of net operating loss carryovers or carrybacks from taxable years prior to the current taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Full net operating loss carryover. If the full net operating loss (that remains after carryovers to other taxable years) is less than or equal to the taxable income in a particular taxable year (carryover year), and so can be carried forward in its entirety to such carryover year, U.S. source losses and foreign source losses in separate categories that are part of a net operating loss from a particular taxable year that is carried forward in its entirety shall be combined with the U.S. source income or loss and the foreign source income or loss in the same separate categories in the carryover year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Partial net operating loss carryover. If the full net operating loss (that remains after carryovers to other taxable years) exceeds the taxable income in a carryover year, and so cannot be carried forward in its entirety to such carryover year, the following rules apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any U.S. source loss (not to exceed the net operating loss carryover) shall be carried over to the extent of any U.S. source income in the carryover year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the net operating loss carryover exceeds the U.S. source loss carryover determined under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, then separate limitation losses that are part of the net operating loss shall be tentatively carried over to the extent of separate limitation income in the same separate category in the carryover year. If the sum of the potential separate limitation loss carryovers determined under the preceding sentence exceeds the amount of the net operating loss carryover reduced by any U.S. source loss carried over under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, then the potential separate limitation loss carryovers shall be reduced pro rata so that their sum equals such amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the net operating loss carryover exceeds the sum of the U.S. and separate limitation loss carryovers determined under paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, then a proportionate part of the remaining loss from each separate category shall be carried over to the extent of such excess and combined with the foreign source loss, if any, in the same separate categories in the carryover year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If the net operating loss carryover exceeds the sum of all the loss carryovers determined under paragraphs (b)(3)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section, then any U.S. source loss not carried over under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section shall be carried over to the extent of such excess and combined with the U.S. source loss, if any, in the carryover year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Net capital loss carryovers. Rules similar to the rules of paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section apply for purposes of determining the components of a net capital loss carryover to a taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Step Two: Section 904(b) adjustments. The taxpayer shall make any required adjustments to capital gains and losses and qualified dividend income under section 904(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Step Three: Allocation of separate limitation losses. The taxpayer shall allocate separate limitation losses sustained during the taxable year (increased, if appropriate, by any losses carried over under paragraph (b) of this section), in the following manner--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The taxpayer shall allocate its separate limitation losses for the taxable year to reduce its separate limitation income in other separate categories on a proportionate basis, and increase its separate limitation loss accounts appropriately. To the extent a separate limitation loss in one separate category is allocated to reduce separate limitation income in a second separate category, and the second category has a separate limitation loss account from a prior taxable year with respect to the first category, the two separate limitation loss accounts shall be netted against each other.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the taxpayer's separate limitation losses for the taxable year exceed the taxpayer's separate limitation income for the year, so that the taxpayer has separate limitation losses remaining after the application of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the taxpayer shall allocate those losses to its U.S. source income for the taxable year, to the extent thereof, and shall increase its

overall foreign loss accounts to that extent in accordance with Sec. 1.904(f)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Step Four: Allocation of U.S. source losses. The taxpayer shall allocate U.S. source losses sustained during the taxable year (increased, if appropriate, by any losses carried over under paragraph (b) of this section) to separate limitation income on a proportionate basis, and shall increase its overall domestic loss accounts to the extent of such allocation in accordance with Sec. 1.904(g)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Step Five: Recapture of overall foreign loss accounts. If the taxpayer's separate limitation income for the taxable year (reduced by any losses carried over under paragraph (b) of this section) exceeds the sum of the taxpayer's U.S. source loss and separate limitation losses for the year, so that the taxpayer has separate limitation income remaining after the application of paragraphs (d)(1) and (e) of this section, then the taxpayer shall recapture prior year overall foreign losses, if any, and reduce overall foreign loss accounts in accordance with Sec. 1.904(f)-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Step Six: Recapture of separate limitation loss accounts. To the extent the taxpayer has remaining separate limitation income for the year after the application of paragraph (f) of this section, then the taxpayer shall recapture prior year separate limitation losses, if any, in accordance with Sec. 1.904(f)-8 and reduce separate limitation loss accounts in accordance with Sec. 1.904(f)-7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Step Seven: Recapture of overall domestic loss accounts. If the taxpayer's U.S. source income for the year (reduced by any losses carried over under paragraph (b) of this section or allocated under paragraph (d) of this section, but not increased by any recapture of overall foreign loss accounts under paragraph (f) of this section) exceeds the taxpayer's separate limitation losses for the year, so that the taxpayer has U.S. source income remaining after the application of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, then the taxpayer shall recapture its prior year overall domestic losses, if any, and reduce overall domestic loss accounts in accordance with Sec. 1.904(g)-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this section. Unless otherwise noted, all corporations use the calendar year as the U.S. taxable year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. (i) Facts. (A) Z Corporation is a domestic corporation with foreign branch operations in Country B. For 2009, Z has a net operating loss of ($500), determined as follows:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">General                  Passive                   U.S.------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>($300)</em>                       $0                  ($200)------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For 2008, Z had the following taxable income and losses after application of section 904(f) and (g) to income and loss in 2008:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">General                  Passive                   U.S.------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">$400                     $200                    $110------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Net operating loss allocation. Because Z's taxable income for 2008 exceeds its total net operating loss for 2009, the full net operating loss is carried back. Under Step 1, each component of the net operating loss is carried back and combined with its same category in 2008. See paragraph (b)(2) of this section. After allocation of the net operating loss, Z has the following taxable income and losses for 2008:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">General                  Passive                   U.S.------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">$100                     $200                   ($90)------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Loss allocation. Under Step 4, the ($90) of U.S. loss is allocated proportionately to reduce the general category and passive category income. Accordingly, $30 ($90 x $100/$300) of the U.S. loss is allocated to general category income and $60 ($90 x $200/$300) of the U.S. loss is allocated to passive category income, with a corresponding creation or increase to Z's overall domestic loss accounts.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. (i) Facts. (A) X Corporation is a domestic corporation with foreign branch operations in Country C. As of January 1, 2007, X has no loss accounts subject to recapture. For 2007, X has a net operating loss of ($1400), determined as follows:

For 2008, X has the following taxable income and losses:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">General                  Passive                   U.S.------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">$500                   ($100)                   $1200------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Net operating loss allocation. Under Step 1, because X's total taxable income for 2008 of $1600 ($1200 + $500 - $100) exceeds the total

2007 net operating loss, the full $1400 net operating loss is carried forward. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, each component of the net operating loss is carried forward and combined with its same category in 2008. After allocation of the net operating loss, X has the following taxable income and losses:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">General                  Passive                   U.S.------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">$100                   ($300)                    $400------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Loss allocation. Under Step 3, $100 of the passive category loss offsets the $100 of general category income, resulting in a passive category separate limitation loss account with respect to general category income, and the other $200 of passive category loss offsets $200 of the U.S. source taxable income, resulting in the creation of an overall foreign loss account in the passive category.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. (i) Facts. Assume the same facts as in Example 2, except that in 2008, X had the following taxable income and losses:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">General                  Passive                   U.S.------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">$200                   ($100)                   $1200------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Net operating loss allocation. Under Step 1, because the total net operating loss for 2007 of ($1400) exceeds total taxable income for 2008 of $1300 ($1200 + $200 - $100), X has a partial net operating loss carryover to 2008 of $1300. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, first, the $800 U.S. source component of the net operating loss is allocated to U.S. income for 2008. The tentative general category carryover under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section ($200) does not exceed the remaining net operating loss carryover amount ($500). Therefore, $200 of the general category component of the net operating loss is next allocated to the general category income for 2008. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, the remaining $300 of net operating loss carryover ($1300 - $800 - $200) is carried over proportionally from the remaining net operating loss components in the general category ($200, or $400 total general category loss -$200 general category loss already allocated) and passive category ($200). Therefore, $150 ($300 x $200/$400) of the remaining net operating loss carryover is carried over from the general category for 2007 and combined with the general category for 2008, and $150 ($300 x $200/$400) of the remaining net operating loss carryover is carried over from the passive category for 2007 and combined with the passive category for 2008. After allocation of the net operating loss carryover from 2007 to the appropriate categories for 2008, X has the following taxable income and losses:

Under Step 1, because the total net operating loss of ($1400) exceeds total taxable income for 2008 of $200 ($200 + $200 - $200), X has a partial net operating loss carryover to 2008 of $200. Because X has no U.S. source income in 2008, under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section no portion of the U.S. source component of the net operating loss is initially carried into 2008. Because the total tentative carryover under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section of $400 ($200 in each of the general and passive categories) exceeds the net operating loss carryover amount, the tentative carryover from each separate category is reduced proportionately by $100 ($200 x $200/$400). Accordingly, $100 ($200 - $100) of the general category component of the net operating loss is carried forward and $100 ($200 - $100) of the passive category component of the net operating loss is carried forward and combined with income in the same respective categories for 2008. After allocation of the net operating loss carryover from 2007, X has the following taxable income and losses:

Under Step 1, because X's total net operating loss in 2007 of ($1400) exceeds its total taxable income for 2008 of $800 ($100 + $800 - $100), X has a partial net operating loss carryover to 2008 of $800. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, $100 of the U.S. source component of the net operating loss is allocated to U.S. income for 2008. The tentative general category carryover under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section does not exceed the remaining net operating

loss carryover amount. Therefore, $400 of the general category component of the net operating loss is allocated to reduce general category income in 2008. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, of the remaining $300 of net operating loss carryover ($800 - $100 - $400), $200 is carried forward from the passive category component of the net operating loss and combined with the passive category for 2008. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, the remaining $100 ($300 - $200) of net operating loss carryover is carried forward from the U.S. source component of the net operating loss and combined with the U.S. source income (loss) for 2008.

(i) Facts. (A) Y Corporation is a domestic corporation with foreign branch operations in Country D. Y has no net operating losses and does not make an election to recapture more than the required amount of overall foreign losses. As of January 1, 2007, Y has a ($200) general category overall foreign loss (OFL) account and a ($200) general category separate limitation loss (SLL) account with respect to the passive category. For 2007, Y has $400 of passive category income that is fully offset by a ($400) domestic loss in that taxable year, giving rise to the creation of an overall domestic loss (ODL) account with respect to the passive category. As of January 1, 2008, Y has the following balances in its OFL, SLL, and ODL accounts:

Under Step 3, the $100 of passive category loss offsets $100 of the general category income, creating a passive category SLL account of $100 with respect to the general category.

Sec. 1.904(i)-1  Limitation on use of deconsolidation to avoid foreign tax credit limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. If two or more includible corporations are affiliates, within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, at any time during their taxable years, then, solely for purposes of applying the foreign tax credit provisions of section 59(a), sections 901 through 908, and section 960, the rules of this section will apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Determination of taxable income--(i) Each affiliate must compute its net taxable income or loss in each separate category (as defined in Sec. 1.904-5(a)(1), and treating U.S. source income or loss as a separate category) without regard to sections 904(f) and 907(c)(4). Only affiliates that are members of the same consolidated group use the consolidated return regulations (other than those under sections 904(f) and 907(c)(4)) in computing such net taxable income or loss. To the extent otherwise applicable, other provisions of the Code and regulations must be used in the determination of an affiliate's net taxable income or loss in a separate category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The net taxable income amounts in each separate category determined under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section are combined for all affiliates to determine one amount for the group of affiliates in each separate category. However, a net loss of an affiliate (first affiliate) in a separate category determined under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section will be combined under this paragraph (a) with net income or loss amounts of other affiliates in the same category only if, and to the extent that, the net loss offsets taxable income, whether U.S. or foreign source, of the first affiliate. The consolidated return regulations that apply the principles of sections 904(f) and 907(c)(4) to consolidated groups will then be applied to the combined amounts in each separate category as if all affiliates were members of a single consolidated group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Allocation. Any net taxable income in a separate category calculated under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section for purposes of the foreign tax credit provisions must then be allocated among the affiliates under any consistently applied reasonable method, taking into account all of the facts and circumstances. A method is consistently applied if used by all affiliates from year to year. Once chosen, an allocation method may be changed only with the consent of the Commissioner. This allocation will only affect the source and foreign tax credit separate limitation character of the income for purposes of the foreign tax credit separate limitation of each affiliate, and will not otherwise affect an affiliate's total net income or loss. This section applies whether the federal income tax consequences of its application favor, or are adverse to, the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions and special rules For purposes of this section only, the following terms will have the meanings specified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Affiliate--(i) Generally. Affiliates are includible corporations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> That are members of the same affiliated group, as defined in section 1504(a); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> That would be members of the same affiliated group, as defined in section 1504(a) if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any non-includible corporation meeting the ownership test of section 1504(a)(2) with respect to any such includible corporation was itself an includible corporation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The constructive ownership rules of section 1563(e) were applied for purposes of section 1504(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Rules for consolidated groups. Affiliates that are members of the same consolidated group are treated as a single affiliate for purposes of this section. The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply if the only affiliates under this definition are already members of the same consolidated group without operation of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exception for newly acquired affiliates--(A) With respect to acquisitions after December 7, 1995, an includible corporation acquired from unrelated third parties (First Corporation) will not be considered an affiliate of another includible corporation (Second Corporation) during the taxable year of the First Corporation beginning before the date on which the First Corporation originally becomes an affiliate with respect to the Second Corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> With respect to acquisitions on or before December 7, 1995, an includible corporation acquired from unrelated third parties will not be considered an affiliate of another includible corporation during its taxable year beginning before the date on which the first includible corporation first becomes an affiliate with respect to that other includible corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> This exception does not apply where the acquisition of an includible corporation is used to avoid the application of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Includible corporation. The term includible corporation has the same meaning it has in section 1504(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Taxable years. If all of the affiliates use the same U.S. taxable year, then that taxable year must be used for purposes of applying this section. If, however, the affiliates use more than one U.S. taxable year, then an appropriate taxable year must be used for applying this section. The determination whether a taxable year is appropriate must take into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances, including the U.S. taxable years used by the affiliates for general U.S. income tax purposes. The taxable year chosen by the affiliates for purposes of applying this section must be used consistently from year to year. The taxable year may be changed only with the prior consent of the Commissioner. Those affiliates that do not use the year determined under this paragraph (c) as their U.S. taxable year for general U.S. income tax purposes must, for purposes of this section, use their U.S. taxable year or years ending within the taxable year determined under this paragraph (c). If, however, the stock of an affiliate is disposed of so that it ceases to be an affiliate, then the taxable year of that affiliate will be considered to end on the disposition date for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Consistent treatment of foreign taxes paid. All affiliates must consistently either elect under section 901(a) to claim a credit for foreign income taxes paid or accrued, or deemed paid or accrued, or deduct foreign taxes paid or accrued under section 164. See also Sec. 1.1502-4(a); Sec. 1.905-1(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective date. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section (relating to newly acquired affiliates), this section is effective for taxable years of affiliates beginning after December 31, 1993.

Sec. 1.904(j)-1  Certain individuals exempt from foreign tax credit limitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Election available only if all foreign taxes are creditable foreign taxes. A taxpayer may elect to apply section 904(j) for a taxable year only if all of the taxes for which a credit is allowable to the taxpayer under section 901 for the taxable year (without regard to carryovers) are creditable foreign taxes (as defined in section 904(j)(3)(B)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Coordination with carryover rules--(1) No carryovers to or from election year. If the taxpayer elects to apply section 904(j) for any taxable year, then no taxes paid or accrued by the taxpayer during such taxable year may be deemed paid or accrued under section 904(c) in any other taxable year, and no taxes paid or accrued in any other taxable year may be deemed paid or accrued under section 904(c) in such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Carryovers to and from other years determined without regard to election years. The amount of the foreign taxes paid or accrued, and the amount of the foreign source taxable income, in any year for which the taxpayer elects to apply section 904(j) shall not be taken into account in determining the amount of any carryover to or from any other taxable year. However, an election to apply section 904(j) to any year does not extend the number of taxable years to which unused foreign taxes may be carried under section 904(c) and Sec. 1.904-2(b). Therefore, in determining the number of such carryover years, the taxpayer must take into account years to which a section 904(j) election applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Determination of amount of creditable foreign taxes. Otherwise allowable carryovers of foreign tax credits from other taxable years shall not be taken into account in determining whether the amount of creditable foreign taxes paid or accrued by an individual during a taxable year exceeds $300 ($600 in the case of a joint return) for purposes of section 904(j)(2)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In 2006, X, a single individual using the cash basis method of accounting for income and foreign tax credits, pays $100 of foreign taxes with respect to general limitation income that was earned and included in income for United States tax purposes in 2005. The foreign taxes would be creditable under section 901 but are not shown on a payee statement furnished to X. X's only income for 2006 from sources outside the United States is qualified passive income, with respect to which X pays $200 of creditable foreign taxes shown on a payee statement. X may not elect to apply section 904(j) for 2006 because some of X's foreign taxes are not creditable foreign taxes within the meaning of section 904(j)(3)(B).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. (i) In 2009, A, a single individual using the cash basis method of accounting for income and foreign tax credits, pays creditable foreign taxes of $250 attributable to passive income. Under section 904(c), A may also carry forward to 2009 $100 of unused foreign taxes paid in 2005 with respect to passive income, $300 of unused foreign taxes paid in 2005 with respect to general limitation income, $400 of unused foreign taxes paid in 2006 with respect to passive income, and $200 of unused foreign taxes paid in 2006 with respect to general limitation income. In 2009, A's only foreign source income is passive income described in section 904(j)(3)(A)(i), and this income is reported to A on a payee statement (within the meaning of section 6724(d)(2)). If A elects to apply section 904(j) for the 2009 taxable year, the unused foreign taxes paid in 2005 and 2006 are not deemed paid in 2009, and A therefore cannot claim a foreign tax credit for those taxes in 2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In 2010, A again is eligible for and elects the application of section 904(j). The carryforwards from 2005 expire in 2010. The carryforward period established under section 904(c) is not extended by A's election under section 904(j). In 2011, A does not elect the application of section 904(j). The $600 of unused foreign taxes paid in 2006 on passive and general limitation income are deemed paid in 2011, under section 904(c), without any adjustment for any portion of those taxes that might have been used as a foreign tax credit in 2009 or 2010 if A had not elected to apply section 904(j) to those years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effective date.

Sec. 1.905-1  When credit for taxes may be taken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. The credit for taxes provided in subpart A (section 901 and following), part III, subchapter N, chapter 1 of the Code, may ordinarily be taken either in the return for the year in which the taxes accrued or in which the taxes were paid, dependent

upon whether the accounts of the taxpayer are kept and his returns filed using an accrual method or using the cash receipts and disbursements method. Section 905(a) allows the taxpayer, at his option and irrespective of the method of accounting employed in keeping his books, to take such credit for taxes as may be allowable in the return for the year in which the taxes accrued. An election thus made under section 905(a) (or under the corresponding provisions of prior internal revenue laws) must be followed in returns for all subsequent years, and no portion of any such taxes accrued in a year in which a credit is claimed will be allowed as a deduction from gross income in any year. See also Sec. 1.905-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Foreign income subject to exchange controls. If, however, under the provisions of the regulations under section 461, an amount otherwise constituting gross income for the taxable year from sources without the United States is, owing to monetary, exchange, or other restrictions imposed by a foreign country, not includible in gross income of the taxpayer for such year, the credit for income taxes imposed by such foreign country with respect to such amount shall be taken proportionately in any subsequent taxable year in which such amount or portion thereof is includible in gross income.


Sec. 1.905-2  Conditions of allowance of credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Forms and information. (1) Whenever the taxpayer chooses, in accordance with paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.901-1, to claim the benefits of the foreign tax credit, the claim for credit shall be accompanied by Form 1116 in the case of an individual or by Form 1118 in the case of a corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The form must be carefully filled in with all the information called for and with the calculations of credits indicated. Except where it is established to the satisfaction of the district director that it is impossible for the taxpayer to furnish such evidence, the taxpayer must provide upon request the receipt for each such tax payment if credit is sought for taxes already paid or the return on which each such accrued tax was based if credit is sought for taxes accrued. The receipt or return must be either the original, a duplicate original, or a duly certified or authenticated copy. The preceding two sentences are applicable for returns whose original due date falls on or after January 1, 1988. Any additional information necessary for the determination under part I (section 861 and following), subchapter N, chapter 1 of the Code, of the amount of income derived from sources without the United States and from each foreign country shall, upon the request of the district director, be furnished by the taxpayer. If the taxpayer upon request fails without justification to furnish any such additional information which is significant, including any significant information which he is requested to furnish pursuant to Sec. 1.861-8(f)(5) as proposed in the Federal Register for November 8, 1976, the District Director may disallow the claim of the taxpayer to the benefits of the foreign tax credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Secondary evidence. Where it has been established to the satisfaction of the District Director that it is impossible to furnish a receipt for such foreign tax payment, the foreign tax return, or direct evidence of the amount of tax withheld at the source, the District Director, may, in his discretion, accept secondary evidence thereof as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Receipt for payment. In the absence of a receipt for payment of foreign taxes there shall be submitted a photostatic copy of the check, draft, or other medium of payment showing the amount and date thereof, with certification identifying it with the tax claimed to have been paid, together with evidence establishing that the tax was paid for taxpayer's account as his own tax on his own income. If credit is claimed on an accrual method, it must be shown that the tax accrued in the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Foreign tax return. If the foreign tax return is not available, the foreign tax has not been paid, and credit is claimed on an accrual method, there shall be submitted--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A certified statement of the amount shall be submitted--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Excerpts from the taxpayer's accounts showing amounts of foreign income and tax thereon accrued on its books.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A computation of the foreign tax based on income from the foreign country carried on the books and at current rates of tax to be established by data such as excerpts from the foreign law, assessment notices, or other documentary evidence thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A bond, if deemed necessary by the District Director, filed in the manner provided in cases where the foreign return is available, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> In case a bond is not required, a specific agreement wherein the taxpayer shall recognize its liability to report the correct amount of tax when ascertained, as required by the provisions of section 905 (c).

If at any time the foreign tax receipts or foreign tax returns become available to the taxpayer, they shall be promptly submitted to the district director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Tax withheld at source. In the case of taxes withheld at the source from dividends, interest, royalties, compensation, or other form of income, where evidence of withholding and of the amount withheld cannot be secured from those who have made the payments, the district director may, in his discretion, accept secondary evidence of such withholding and of the amount of the tax so withheld, having due regard to the taxpayer's books of account and to the rates of taxation prevailing in the particular foreign country during the period involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Credit for taxes accrued but not paid. In the case of a credit sought for a tax accrued but not paid, the district director may, as a condition precedent to the allowance of a credit, require a bond from the taxpayer, in addition to Form 1116 or 1118. If such a bond is required, Form 1117 shall be used by an individual or by a corporation. It shall be in such sum as the Commissioner may prescribe, and shall be conditioned for the payment by the taxpayer of any amount of tax found due upon any redetermination of the tax made necessary by such credit proving incorrect, with such further conditions as the district director may require. This bond shall be executed by the taxpayer, or the agent or representative of the taxpayer, as principal, and by sureties satisfactory to and approved by the Commissioner. See also 6 U.S.C. 15.

Sec. 1.905-3T  Adjustments to United States tax liability and to thepools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes as a result of a foreign tax redetermination (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Effective/applicability dates--(1) Currency translation. Except as provided in Sec. 1.905-5T, paragraph (b) of this section applies to taxes paid or accrued in taxable years of United States taxpayers beginning on or after November 7, 2007 and to taxes paid or accrued by a foreign corporation in its taxable years which end with or within a taxable year of the domestic corporate shareholder beginning on or after November 7, 2007. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1997, and before November 7, 2007, section 986(a), as amended by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 and the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, shall apply. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, and before January 1, 1998, Sec. 1.905-3T (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised as of April 1, 2007) shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Foreign tax redeterminations. Paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section apply to foreign tax redeterminations occurring in taxable years of United States taxpayers beginning on or after November 7, 2007 where the foreign tax redetermination affects the amount of foreign taxes paid or accrued by a United States taxpayer. Where the redetermination of foreign tax paid or accrued by a foreign corporation affects the computation of foreign taxes deemed paid under section 902 or 960 with respect to post-1986 undistributed earnings of the foreign corporation, paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section apply to foreign tax redeterminations occurring in taxable years of a foreign corporation which end with or within a taxable year of the domestic corporate shareholder beginning on or after November 7, 2007. For corresponding rules

applicable to foreign tax redeterminations occurring in taxable years beginning before November 7, 2007, see Sec. Sec. 1.905-3T and 1.905-5T (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised as of April 1, 2007).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Currency translation rules--(1) Translation of foreign taxes taken into account when accrued--(i) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, in the case of a taxpayer or a member of a qualified group (as defined in section 902(b)(2)) that takes foreign income taxes into account when accrued, the amount of any foreign taxes denominated in foreign currency that have been paid or accrued, additional tax liability denominated in foreign currency, taxes withheld in foreign currency, or estimated taxes paid in foreign currency shall be translated into dollars using the average exchange rate (as defined in Sec. 1.989(b)-1) for the United States taxable year to which such taxes relate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exceptions--(A) Taxes not paid within two years. Any foreign income taxes denominated in foreign currency that are paid more than two years after the close of the United States taxable year to which they relate shall be translated into dollars using the exchange rate as of the date of payment of the foreign taxes. To the extent any accrued foreign income taxes denominated in foreign currency remain unpaid two years after the close of the taxable year to which they relate, see paragraph (b)(3) of this section for translation rules for the required adjustments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Taxes paid before taxable year begins. Any foreign income taxes paid before the beginning of the United States taxable year to which such taxes relate shall be translated into dollars using the exchange rate as of the date of payment of the foreign taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Inflationary currency. Any foreign income taxes the liability for which is denominated in any inflationary currency shall be translated into dollars using the exchange rate as of the date of payment of the foreign taxes. For this purpose, the term inflationary currency means the currency of a country in which there is cumulative inflation during the base period of at least 30 percent, as determined by reference to the consumer price index of the country listed in the monthly issues of International Financial Statistics, or a successor publication, of the International Monetary Fund. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C), base period means, with respect to any taxable year, the thirty-six calendar months immediately preceding the last day of such taxable year (see Sec. 1.985-1(b)(2)(ii)(D)). Accrued but unpaid taxes denominated in an inflationary currency shall be translated into dollars at the exchange rate on the last day of the United States taxable year to which such taxes relate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Election to translate taxes using exchange rate for date of payment. A taxpayer that is otherwise required to translate foreign income taxes that are denominated in foreign currency using the average exchange rate may elect to translate foreign income taxes described in this paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(D) into dollars using the exchange rate as of the date of payment of the foreign taxes, provided that the liability for such taxes is denominated in nonfunctional currency. A taxpayer may make an election under this paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(D) for all foreign income taxes, or for only those foreign income taxes that are denominated in nonfunctional currency and are attributable to qualified business units with United States dollar functional currencies. The election must be made by attaching a statement to the taxpayer's timely filed return (including extensions) for the first taxable year to which the election applies. The statement must identify whether the election is made for all foreign taxes or only for foreign taxes attributable to qualified business units with United States dollar functional currencies. Once made, the election shall apply for the taxable year for which made and all subsequent taxable years unless revoked with the consent of the Commissioner. Accrued but unpaid taxes subject to an election under this paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(D) shall be translated into dollars at the exchange rate on the last day of the United States taxable year to which such taxes relate. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2004, and before November 7, 2007, the rules of Notice

2006-47, 2006-20 IRB 892 (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b)), shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Regulated investment companies. In the case of a regulated investment company (as defined in section 851 and the regulations under that section) which takes into account income on an accrual basis, foreign income taxes paid or accrued with respect to such income shall be translated into dollars using the exchange rate as of the date the income accrues.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Translation of foreign taxes taken into account when paid. In the case of a taxpayer that takes foreign income taxes into account when paid, the amount of any foreign tax liability denominated in foreign currency, additional tax liability denominated in foreign currency, or estimated taxes paid in foreign currency shall be translated into dollars using the exchange rate as of the date of payment of such foreign taxes. Foreign taxes withheld in foreign currency shall be translated into dollars using the exchange rate as of the date on which such taxes were withheld.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Refunds or other reductions of foreign tax liability. In the case of a taxpayer that takes foreign income taxes into account when accrued, a reduction in the amount of previously-accrued foreign taxes that is attributable to a refund of foreign taxes denominated in foreign currency, a credit allowed in lieu of a refund, the correction of an overaccrual, or an adjustment on account of accrued taxes denominated in foreign currency that were not paid by the date two years after the close of the taxable year to which such taxes relate, shall be translated into dollars using the exchange rate that was used to translate such amount when originally claimed as a credit or added to post-1986 foreign income taxes. In the case of foreign income taxes taken into account when accrued but translated into dollars on the date of payment, see paragraph (d) of this section for required adjustments to reflect a reduction in the amount of previously-accrued foreign taxes that is attributable to a difference in exchange rates between the date of accrual and date of payment. In the case of a taxpayer that takes foreign income taxes into account when paid, a refund or other reduction in the amount of foreign taxes denominated in foreign currency shall be translated into dollars using the exchange rate that was used to translate such amount when originally claimed as a credit. If a refund or other reduction of foreign taxes relates to foreign taxes paid or accrued on more than one date, then the refund or other reduction shall be deemed to be derived from, and shall reduce, the last payment of foreign taxes first, to the extent of that payment. See paragraphs (d)(1) (redetermination of United States tax liability for foreign taxes paid directly by a United States person) and (d)(2)(ii) (method of adjustment of a foreign corporation's pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Allocation of refunds of foreign tax. Refunds of foreign tax shall be allocated to the same separate category as foreign taxes to which the refunded taxes relate. Refunds are related to foreign taxes of a separate category if the foreign tax that was refunded was imposed with respect to that separate category. See section 904(d) and Sec. 1.904-6 concerning the allocation of taxes to separate categories of income. Earnings and profits of a foreign corporation in the separate category to which the refund relates shall be increased to reflect the foreign tax refund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Basis of foreign currency refunded--(i) In general. A recipient of a refund of foreign tax shall determine its basis in the currency refunded under the following rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> United States dollar functional currency. If the functional currency of the qualified business unit (QBU) (as defined in section 989 and the regulations under that section) that paid the tax and received the refund is the United States dollar or the person receiving the refund is not a QBU, then the recipient's basis in the foreign currency refunded shall be the dollar value of the refund determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section by using, as appropriate, either the average exchange rate for the taxable year to which such taxes relate or the other exchange rate that was used to translate such amount when originally claimed as a credit or

added to post-1986 foreign income taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Nondollar functional currency. If the functional currency of the QBU receiving the refund is not the United States dollar and is different from the currency in which the foreign tax was paid, then the recipient's basis in the foreign currency refunded shall be equal to the functional currency value of the non-functional currency refund translated into functional currency at the exchange rate between the functional currency and the non-functional currency. Such exchange rate is determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section by substituting the words ``functional currency'' for the word ``dollar'' and by using, as appropriate, either the average exchange rate for the taxable year to which such taxes relate or the other exchange rate that was used to translate such amount when originally claimed as a credit or added to post-1986 foreign income taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Functional currency tax liabilities. If the functional currency of the QBU receiving the refund is the currency in which the refund was made, then the recipient's basis in the currency received shall be the amount of the functional currency received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Foreign currency gain or loss. For purposes of determining foreign currency gain or loss on the initial payment of accrued foreign tax in a non-functional currency, see section 988. For purposes of determining subsequent foreign currency gain or loss on the disposition of non-functional currency the basis of which is determined under this paragraph (b)(5), see section 988(c)(1)(C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Foreign tax redetermination. For purposes of this section and Sec. 1.905-4T, the term foreign tax redetermination means a change in the foreign tax liability that may affect a taxpayer's foreign tax credit. A foreign tax redetermination includes: accrued taxes that when paid differ from the amounts added to post-1986 foreign income taxes or claimed as credits by the taxpayer (such as corrections to overaccruals and additional payments); accrued taxes that are not paid before the date two years after the close of the taxable year to which such taxes relate; any tax paid that is refunded in whole or in part; and, for taxes taken into account when accrued but translated into dollars on the date of payment, a difference between the dollar value of the accrued tax and the dollar value of the tax paid attributable to fluctuations in the value of the foreign currency relative to the dollar between the date of accrual and the date of payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Redetermination of United States tax liability--(1) Foreign taxes paid directly by a United States person. If a foreign tax redetermination occurs with respect to foreign tax paid or accrued by or on behalf of a United States taxpayer, then a redetermination of the United States tax liability is required for the taxable year for which the foreign tax was claimed as a credit. See Sec. 1.905-4T(b) which requires notification to the IRS of a foreign tax redetermination with respect to which a redetermination of United States liability is required, and see section 905(b) and the regulations under that section which require that a taxpayer substantiate that a foreign tax was paid and provide all necessary information establishing its entitlement to the foreign tax credit. However, a redetermination of United States tax liability is not required (and a taxpayer need not notify the IRS) if the foreign taxes are taken into account when accrued but translated into dollars as of the date of payment, the difference between the dollar value of the accrued tax and the dollar value of the tax paid is attributable to fluctuations in the value of the foreign currency relative to the dollar between the date of accrual and the date of payment, and the amount of the foreign tax redetermination with respect to each foreign country is less than the lesser of ten thousand dollars or two percent of the total dollar amount of the foreign tax initially accrued with respect to that foreign country for the United States taxable year. In such case, an appropriate adjustment shall be made to the taxpayer's United States tax liability in the taxable year during which the foreign tax redetermination occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Foreign taxes deemed paid under sections 902 or 960--(i) Redetermination of United States tax liability not required. Subject to the special rule of paragraph

(d)(3) of this section, a redetermination of United States tax liability is not required to account for the effect of a redetermination of foreign tax paid or accrued by a foreign corporation on the foreign taxes deemed paid by a United States corporation under section 902 or 960. Instead, appropriate upward or downward adjustments shall be made, in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, at the time of the foreign tax redetermination to the foreign corporation's pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes to reflect the effect of the foreign tax redetermination in calculating foreign taxes deemed paid with respect to distributions and inclusions (and the amount of such distributions and inclusions) that are includible in the United States taxable year in which the foreign tax redetermination occurred and subsequent taxable years. See Sec. 1.905-4T(b)(2) for notification requirements where a redetermination of foreign tax paid or accrued by a foreign corporation affects the computation of foreign taxes deemed paid under section 902 or 960, and the taxpayer is required to adjust the foreign corporation's pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes under this paragraph (d)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Adjustments to the pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes--(A) Reduction in foreign tax paid or accrued. A foreign corporation's pool of post-1986 foreign income taxes in the appropriate separate category shall be reduced by the United States dollar amount of a foreign tax refund or other reduction in the amount of foreign tax paid or accrued, translated into United States dollars as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. A foreign corporation's pool of post-1986 undistributed earnings in the appropriate separate category shall be increased by the functional currency amount of the foreign tax refund or other reduction in the amount of foreign tax paid or accrued. The allocation of the refund or other adjustment to the appropriate separate categories shall be made in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section and Sec. 1.904-6. If a foreign corporation receives a refund of foreign tax in a currency other than its functional currency, that refund shall be translated into its functional currency, for purposes of computing the increase to its pool of post-1986 undistributed earnings, at the exchange rate between the functional currency and the non-functional currency, as determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, by substituting the words ``functional currency'' for the word ``dollar'' and by using the same average or spot rate exchange rate convention that applies for purposes of translating such foreign taxes into United States dollars.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Additional foreign tax paid or accrued. A foreign corporation's pool of post-1986 foreign income taxes in the appropriate separate category shall be increased by the United States dollar amount of the additional foreign tax paid or accrued, translated in accordance with the rules of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section. A foreign corporation's pool of post-1986 undistributed earnings in the appropriate separate category shall be decreased by the functional currency amount of the additional foreign tax paid or accrued. The allocation of the additional amount of foreign tax among the separate categories shall be made in accordance with Sec. 1.904-6. If a foreign corporation pays or accrues foreign tax in a currency other than its functional currency, that tax shall be translated into its functional currency, for purposes of computing the decrease to its pool of post-1986 undistributed earnings, at the exchange rate between the functional currency and the non-functional currency, as determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, by substituting the words ``functional currency'' for the word ``dollar'' and by using the same average or spot rate exchange rate convention that applies for purposes of translating such foreign taxes into United States dollars.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Refunds of foreign taxes of lower tier foreign corporations that cause deficits in foreign tax pools. If a lower tier foreign corporation receives a refund of foreign tax after making a distribution to an upper tier foreign corporation and the refund would have the effect of reducing below zero the lower tier corporation's pool of foreign taxes in any separate category, then both the lower tier and upper tier corporations shall

adjust the appropriate pool of foreign taxes to reflect that refund. The upper tier foreign corporation shall adjust its pool of foreign taxes by the difference between the United States dollar amount of foreign tax deemed paid by the upper tier foreign corporation prior to the refund and the United States dollar amount of foreign tax recomputed as if the refund occurred prior to the distribution. The upper tier foreign corporation shall not make any adjustment to its earnings and profits because foreign taxes deemed paid by the upper tier corporation are not included in the upper tier corporation's earnings and profits. The lower tier foreign corporation shall adjust its pool of foreign taxes by the difference between the United States dollar amount of the refund and the United States dollar amount of the adjustment to the upper tier foreign corporation's pool of foreign taxes. The earnings and profits of the lower tier foreign corporation shall be adjusted to reflect the full amount of the refund. The provisions of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C) do not apply to distributions or inclusions to a United States person. See paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section for rules relating to actual or deemed distributions made to a United States person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (d)(2):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Controlled foreign corporation (CFC) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of its domestic parent, P. Both CFC and P are calendar year taxpayers. CFC has a functional currency, the u, other than the dollar and its pool of post-1986 undistributed earnings is maintained in that currency. CFC and P use the average exchange rate to translate foreign taxes. In 2008, CFC accrued and paid 100u of foreign income taxes with respect to non-subpart F income. The average exchange rate for 2008 was $1:1u. In 2009, CFC received a refund of 50u of foreign taxes with respect to its non-subpart F income in 2008. CFC made no distributions to P in 2008. In accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section and subject to paragraph (d)(3) of this section, in 2009 CFC's pool of post-1986 foreign income taxes must be reduced by $50 (because the refund must be translated into dollars using the exchange rate that was used to translate such amount when added to CFC's post-1986 foreign income taxes, that is, $1:1u, the average exchange rate for 2008) and the CFC's pool of post-1986 undistributed earnings must be increased by 50u (because the post-1986 undistributed earnings must be increased by the functional currency amount of the refund received). An income adjustment reflecting foreign currency gain or loss under section 988 with respect to the refund of foreign taxes received by CFC is not required because the foreign taxes are denominated and paid in CFC's functional currency.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that in 2008, CFC had general category post-1986 undistributed earnings attributable to non-subpart F income of 200u (net of foreign taxes), and CFC accrued and paid 160u in foreign income taxes with respect to those earnings. The average exchange rate for 2008 was $1:1u. Also in 2008, CFC made a distribution to P of 50u, and P was deemed to have paid $40 of foreign taxes with respect to that distribution (50u/200u x $160). In 2009, CFC received a refund of foreign taxes of 5u with respect to its nonsubpart F income in 2008. Also in 2009, CFC made a distribution to P of 50u. CFC had no income and paid no foreign taxes in 2009. In accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, CFC's pool of general category post-1986 foreign income taxes is reduced in 2009 by $5 to $115 (because the refund must be translated into dollars using the exchange rate that was used to translate such amount when added to CFC's post-1986 foreign income taxes, that is, $1:1u, the average exchange rate for 2008), and CFC's pool of general category post-1986 undistributed earnings must be increased in 2009 by 5u to 155u (because the post-1986 undistributed earnings must be increased by the functional currency amount of the refund received). (An income adjustment reflecting foreign currency gain or loss under section 988 with respect to the refund of foreign taxes received by CFC is not required because the foreign taxes are denominated and paid in CFC's functional currency.) A redetermination of P's deemed paid credit and U.S. tax for 2008 is not required, because the 5u refund, if taken into account in 2008, would have reduced P's deemed paid taxes by less than 10% (50u/205u x $155 = $37.80). See paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. P is deemed to pay $37.10 of foreign taxes with respect to the distribution in 2009 of 50u (50u/155u x $115).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. (i) CFC1 is a foreign corporation that is wholly-owned by P, a domestic corporation. CFC2 is a foreign corporation that is wholly-owned by CFC1. The functional currency of CFC1 and CFC2 is the u, and the pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings of CFC1 and CFC2 are maintained in that currency. CFC1, CFC2, and P use the average exchange rate to translate foreign income taxes. In 2008, CFC2 had post-1986 undistributed earnings attributable to non-subpart F income of 100u (net of foreign taxes) and paid 100u in foreign income taxes with respect to those earnings. The average exchange rate for 2008 was $1:1u. CFC1 had no income and

no earnings and profits other than those resulting from distributions from CFC2, as provided in either Situation 1 or Situation 2. CFC1 paid no foreign taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Situation 1. In 2009, CFC2 received a refund of foreign taxes of 25u with respect to its 2008 taxable year. As of the close of 2009, CFC2 had 125u of post-1986 undistributed earnings (100u + 25u) and $75 of post-1986 foreign income taxes ($100-$25). In 2010, CFC2 made a distribution to CFC1 of 50u. CFC1 was deemed to have paid $30 of foreign taxes with respect to that distribution (50u/125u x $75). (An income adjustment reflecting foreign currency gain or loss under section 988 with respect to the refund of foreign taxes received by CFC1 is not required because the foreign taxes are denominated and paid in CFC1's functional currency.) At the end of 2010, CFC2 had 75u of post-1986 undistributed earnings (125u-50u) and $45 of post-1986 foreign income taxes ($75-$30).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Situation 2. The facts are the same as in Example 3(ii), Situation 1, except that CFC2 made a distribution of 50u in 2009 and received a refund of 75u of foreign tax in 2010. In 2009, the amount of foreign taxes deemed paid by CFC1 is $50 (50u/100u x $100). In accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the pools of post-1986 foreign income taxes of CFC1, as well as CFC2, must be adjusted in 2010, because the 2010 refund would otherwise have the effect of reducing below zero CFC2's pool of post-1986 foreign income taxes. Under paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section, the pools would have to be adjusted in 2009, and a redetermination of P's United States tax liability would be required, if P had received or accrued a distribution or inclusion from CFC1 or CFC2 in 2009 and computed an amount of foreign taxes deemed paid. CFC1's pool of post-1986 foreign income taxes must be reduced in 2010 by $42.86, determined as follows: $50 (foreign taxes deemed paid on the distribution from CFC2) minus $7.14 (the foreign taxes that would have been deemed paid had the refund occurred prior to the distribution (50u/175u x $25)). CFC2's pool of foreign taxes must be reduced in 2010 by $32.14, determined as follows: $75 (75u refund translated into dollars using the exchange rate that was used to translate such amount when originally added to post-1986 foreign income taxes, that is, $1:1u, the average exchange rate for 2008) minus $42.86 (the adjustment to CFC1's pool of post-1986 foreign income taxes). (An income adjustment reflecting foreign currency gain or loss under section 988 with respect to the refund of foreign taxes received by CFC1 is not required because the foreign taxes are denominated and paid in CFC1's functional currency.) The following reflects the pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes of CFC1 and CFC2.

The term ``hyperinflationary currency'' means the currency of a country in which there is cumulative inflation during the base period of at least 100% as determined by reference to the consumer price index of the country listed in the monthly issues of International Financial Statistics, or a successor publication, of the International Monetary Fund. ``Base period'' means, with respect to any taxable year, the thirty-six calendar months immediately preceding the last day of such taxable year (see Sec. 1.985-2T(b)(2)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Deemed paid foreign tax adjustment of ten percent or more. A redetermination of United States tax liability is required if a foreign tax redetermination occurs with respect to foreign taxes paid by a foreign corporation and such foreign tax redetermination, if taken into account in the taxable year of the foreign corporation to which the foreign tax redetermination relates, has the effect of reducing by ten percent or

more the domestic corporate shareholder's foreign taxes deemed paid under section 902 or 960 with respect to a distribution or inclusion from the foreign corporation in any taxable year of the domestic corporate shareholder. If a redetermination of United States tax is required under the preceding sentence for any taxable year, a redetermination of United States tax is also required for all subsequent taxable years in which the domestic corporate shareholder received or accrued a distribution or inclusion from the foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example. (i) Facts. Controlled foreign corporation (CFC) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of its domestic parent, P. Both CFC and P use the calendar year as their taxable year. CFC has a functional currency, the u, other than the dollar, and its pool of post-1986 undistributed earnings is maintained in that currency. CFC and P use the average exchange rate to translate foreign income taxes. As of January 1, 2008, CFC had 500u of general category post-1986 undistributed earnings and $200 of general category post-1986 foreign income taxes. In 2008, when the average exchange rate for the year was $1:1u, CFC earned general category income of 600u, accrued 100u of foreign income tax with respect to that income, and made a distribution to P of 100u, 10% of CFC's post-1986 undistributed earnings of 1,000u. P was deemed to have paid $30 of foreign income taxes in 2008 with respect to that distribution (100u/1,000u x $300). In 2009, CFC paid its actual foreign tax liability for 2008 of 80u. Also in 2009, for which the average exchange rate was $1:1.5u, CFC earned 500u of general category income, accrued 150u of tax with respect to that income, and distributed 100u to P. In 2010, CFC incurred a general category loss of (500u) and accrued no foreign tax. The loss was carried back to 2008 for foreign tax purposes, and CFC received a refund in 2011 of all 80u of foreign taxes paid for its 2008 taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Result in 2009. If the 20u overaccrual of tax for 2008 were taken into account in 2008, CFC's general category post-1986 undistributed earnings would be 1,020u, CFC's general category post-1986 foreign income taxes would be $280, and P would be deemed to pay $27.45 of tax with respect to the 2008 distribution of 100u (100u/1020u x $280 = $27.45). Because $2.55 is less than 10% of the $30 of foreign taxes deemed paid as originally calculated in 2008, P is not required to redetermine its deemed paid credit and U.S. tax liability for 2008 in 2009. Instead, CFC's general category post-1986 foreign income taxes are reduced by $20 in 2009 (because the overaccrual for 2008 is translated into dollars using the exchange rate that was used to translate such amount when originally added to post-1986 foreign income taxes, that is, $1:1u, the average exchange rate for 2008), and the corresponding pool of general category post-1986 undistributed earnings is increased by 20u in 2009 (because the post-1986 undistributed earnings pool is increased by the functional currency amount of the overaccrual). CFC's general category post-1986 undistributed earnings are also increased in 2009 to 1270u by the 350u earned in 2009 (900u + 20u + 350u = 1270u), and CFC's general category post-1986 foreign income taxes are increased by $100 to $350 ($270 - $20 + $100). P is deemed to pay $27.56 of foreign income taxes in 2009 with respect to the 100u distribution from CFC in that year (100u/1270u x $350).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Result in 2011. If the 80u refund of tax for 2008 were taken into account in 2008, CFC's general category post-1986 undistributed earnings would be 1,100u, CFC's general category post-1986 foreign income taxes would be $200, and P would be deemed to pay $18.18 of tax with respect to the 2008 distribution of 100u (100u/1,100u x $200 = $18.18). Because $11.82 is more than 10% of the $30 of foreign taxes deemed paid as originally calculated in 2008, under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, P is required to redetermine its deemed paid credit and U.S. tax liability for 2008 and 2009 in 2011. As determined in 2011, CFC's post-1986 undistributed earnings for 2009 are 1350u (1,100u as revised for 2008, less 100u distributed in 2008, plus 350u earned in 2009), and its post-1986 foreign income taxes for 2009 are $281.82 ($200 as revised for 2008, less $18.18 deemed paid in 2008, plus $100 accrued for 2009). As redetermined in 2011, P's deemed paid credit with respect to the 100u distribution from CFC in 2009 is $20.88 (100u/1350u x $281.82).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Deficit in foreign tax pool. A redetermination of United States tax liability is required if a foreign tax redetermination occurs with respect to foreign taxes deemed paid with respect to a subpart F inclusion or an actual distribution which has the effect of reducing below zero the distributing foreign corporation's pool of foreign taxes in any separate category. Whether a foreign corporation's pool of foreign taxes is reduced below zero shall be determined at the close of the taxable year of the foreign corporation in which the foreign tax redetermination occurred. In no case shall taxes paid or accrued with respect to one separate category

be applied to offset a negative balance in any other separate category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Controlled foreign corporation (CFC) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of its domestic parent, P. Both CFC and P are calendar year taxpayers. CFC has a functional currency, the u, other than the dollar, and its pool of post-1986 undistributed earnings is maintained in that currency. CFC and P use the average exchange rate to translate foreign taxes. The average exchange rate for both 2008 and 2009 was $1:1u. In 2008, CFC earned 200u of general category income, accrued and paid 100u of foreign taxes with respect to that income, and made a distribution to P of 50u, half of CFC's post-1986 undistributed earnings of 100u. P is deemed to have paid $50 of foreign taxes with respect to that distribution (50u/100u x $100). In 2009, CFC received a refund of all 100u of foreign taxes related to the general category income for 2008. In 2009, CFC earned an additional 290u of income, 200u of which was passive category income and 90u of which was general category income, and accrued and paid 95u of foreign tax, 40u of which was with respect to the passive category income and 45u of which was with respect to the general category income. In accordance with paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section, P is required to redetermine its United States tax liability for 2008 to account for the foreign tax redetermination occurring in 2009 because, if an adjustment to CFC's pool of post-1986 foreign income taxes in the general category were made, the pool would be ($5). A deficit is not permitted to be carried in CFC's pool of post-1986 foreign income taxes in any separate category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Reduction of corporate level tax on distribution of earnings and profits. If a United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation receives a distribution out of previously taxed earnings and profits and a foreign country has imposed tax on the income of the controlled foreign corporation, which tax is reduced on distribution of the earnings and profits of the corporation, then the United States shareholder shall redetermine its United States tax liability for the year or years affected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Foreign tax imposed on foreign refund. If the redetermination of foreign tax for a taxable year or years is occasioned by the refund to the taxpayer of taxes paid to a foreign country or possession of the United States and the foreign country or possession imposed tax on the refund, then the amount of the refund shall be considered to be reduced by the amount of any tax described in section 901 imposed by the foreign country or possession of the United States with respect to such refund. In such case, no other credit under section 901, and no deduction under section 164, shall be allowed for any taxable year with respect to such tax imposed on such refund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Expiration date.

Sec. 1.905-4T  Notification of foreign tax redetermination (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Application of this section. The rules of this section apply if, as a result of a foreign tax redetermination (as defined in Sec. 1.905-3T(c)), a redetermination of United States tax liability is required under section 905(c) and Sec. 1.905-3T(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Time and manner of notification--(1) Redetermination of United States tax liability--(i) In general. Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(iv), (v), and (b)(3) of this section, any taxpayer for which a redetermination of United States tax liability is required must notify the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the foreign tax redetermination by filing an amended return, Form 1118 (Foreign Tax Credit--Corporations) or Form 1116 (Foreign Tax Credit), and the statement required under paragraph (c) of this section for the taxable year with respect to which a redetermination of United States tax liability is required. Such notification must be filed within the time prescribed by this paragraph (b) and contain the information described in paragraph (c) of this section. Where a foreign tax redetermination requires an individual to redetermine the individual's United States tax liability, and as a result of such foreign tax redetermination the amount of creditable taxes paid or accrued by such individual during the taxable year does not exceed the applicable dollar limitation in section 904(k), the individual shall not be required to file Form 1116 with

the amended return for such taxable year if the individual satisfies the requirements of section 904(k).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reduction in amount of foreign tax liability. Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(iv), (v), and (b)(3) of this section, for each taxable year of the taxpayer with respect to which a redetermination of United States tax liability is required by reason of a foreign tax redetermination that reduces the amount of foreign taxes paid or accrued, or included in the computation of foreign taxes deemed paid, the taxpayer must file a separate notification for each such taxable year by the due date (with extensions) of the original return for the taxpayer's taxable year in which the foreign tax redetermination occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Increase in amount of foreign tax liability. Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(iv), (v), and (b)(3) of this section, for each taxable year of the taxpayer with respect to which a redetermination of United States tax liability is required by reason of a foreign tax redetermination that increases the amount of foreign taxes paid or accrued, or included in the computation of foreign taxes deemed paid, the taxpayer must notify the Internal Revenue Service within the period provided by section 6511(d)(3)(A). Filing of such notification within the prescribed period shall constitute a claim for refund of United States tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Multiple redeterminations of United States tax liability for same taxable year. Where more than one foreign tax redetermination requires a redetermination of United States tax liability for the same taxable year of the taxpayer and those redeterminations occur within two consecutive taxable years of the taxpayer, the taxpayer may file for such taxable year one amended return, Form 1118 or 1116, and the statement required under paragraph (c) of this section that reflect all such foreign tax redeterminations. If the taxpayer chooses to file one notification for such redeterminations, the taxpayer must file such notification by the due date (with extensions) of the original return for the taxpayer's taxable year in which the first foreign tax redetermination that reduces foreign tax liability occurred. Where a foreign tax redetermination with respect to the taxable year for which a redetermination of United States tax liability is required occurs after the date for providing such notification, more than one amended return may be required with respect to that taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Carryback and carryover of unused foreign tax. Where a foreign tax redetermination requires a redetermination of United States tax liability that would otherwise result in an additional amount of United States tax due, but such amount is eliminated as a result of a carryback or carryover of an unused foreign tax under section 904(c), the taxpayer may, in lieu of applying the rules of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, notify the IRS of such redetermination by attaching a statement to the original return for the taxpayer's taxable year in which the foreign tax redetermination occurs. Such statement must be filed by the due date (with extensions) of the original return for the taxpayer's taxable year in which the foreign tax redetermination occurred and contain the information described in Sec. 1.904-2(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (b)(1):</p><p class="depth0">Example. (i) X, a domestic corporation, is an accrual basis taxpayer and uses the calendar year as its United States taxable year. X conducts business through a branch in Country M, the currency of which is the m, and also conducts business through a branch in Country N, the currency of which is the n. X uses the average exchange rate to translate foreign income taxes. Assume that X is able to claim a credit under section 901 for all foreign taxes paid or accrued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In 2008, X accrued and paid 100m of Country M taxes with respect to 400m of foreign source general category income. The average exchange rate for 2008 was $1:1m. Also in 2008, X accrued and paid 50n of Country N taxes with respect to 150n of foreign source general category income. The average exchange rate for 2008 was $1:1n. X claimed a foreign tax credit of $150 ($100 (100m at $1:1m) + $50 (50n at $1:1n)) with respect to its foreign source general category income on its United States tax return for 2008.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In 2009, X accrued and paid 100n of Country N taxes with respect to 300n of foreign source general category income. The average exchange rate for 2009 was $1.50:1n. X claimed a foreign tax credit of $150 (100n at $1.5:1n) with respect to its foreign source

general category income on its United States tax return for 2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> On June 15, 2012, when the spot exchange rate was $1.40:1n, X received a refund of 10n from Country N, and, on March 15, 2013, when the spot exchange rate was $1.20:1m, X was assessed by and paid Country M an additional 20m of tax. Both payments were with respect to X's foreign source general category income in 2008. On May 15, 2013, when the spot exchange rate was $1.45:1n, X received a refund of 5n from Country N with respect to its foreign source general category income in 2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> X must redetermine its United States tax liability for both 2008 and 2009. With respect to 2008, X must notify the IRS of the June 15, 2012, refund of 10n from Country N that reduced X's foreign tax liability by filing an amended return, Form 1118, and the statement required in paragraph (c) of this section for 2008 by the due date of the original return (with extensions) for 2012. The amended return and Form 1118 must reduce the amount of foreign taxes claimed as a credit under section 901 by $10 (10n refund translated at the average exchange rate for 2008, or $1:1n (see Sec. 1.905-3T(b)(3)). X will recognize foreign currency gain or loss under section 988 in or after 2012 on the conversion of the 10n refund into dollars. With respect to the March 15, 2013, additional assessment of 20m by Country M, X must notify the IRS within the time period provided by section 6511(d)(3)(A), increasing the foreign taxes available as a credit by $24 (20m translated at the exchange rate on the date of payment, or $1.20:1m). See sections 986(a)(1)(B)(i) and 986(a)(2)(A) and Sec. 1.905-3T(b)(1)(ii)(A). X may so notify the IRS by filing a second amended return, Form 1118, and the statement required in paragraph (c) of this section for 2008, within the time period provided by section 6511(d)(3)(A). Alternatively, when X redetermines its United States tax liability for 2008 to take into account the 10n refund from Country N which occurred in 2012, X may also take into account the 20m additional assessment by Country M which occurred on March 15, 2013. See Sec. 1.905-4T(b)(1)(iv). Where X reflects both foreign tax redeterminations on the same amended return, Form 1118, and in the statement required in paragraph (c) of this section for 2008, the amount of X's foreign taxes available as a credit would be:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Reduced by $10 (10n refund translated at $1:1n) and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Increased by $24 (20m additional assessment translated at the exchange rate on the date of payment, March 15, 2013, or $1.20:1m). The foreign taxes available as a credit therefore would be increased by $14 ($24 (additional assessment) - $10 (refund)). The due date of the 2008 amended return, Form 1118, and the statement required in paragraph (c) of this section reflecting foreign tax redeterminations in both years would be the due date (with extensions) of X's original return for 2012.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> With respect to 2009, X must notify the IRS by filing an amended return, Form 1118, and the statement required in paragraph (c) of this section for 2009 that is separate from that filed for 2008. The amended return, Form 1118, and the statement required in paragraph (c) of this section for 2009 must be filed by the due date (with extensions) of X's original return for 2013. The amended return and Form 1118 must reduce the amount of foreign taxes claimed as a credit under section 901 by $7.50 (5n refund translated at the average exchange rate for 2009, or $1.50:1n). X will recognize foreign currency gain or loss under section 988 in or after 2013 on the conversion of the 5n refund into dollars.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Pooling adjustment in lieu of redetermination of United States tax liability. Where a redetermination of foreign tax paid or accrued by a foreign corporation affects the computation of foreign taxes deemed paid under section 902 or 960, and the taxpayer is required to adjust the foreign corporation's pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes under Sec. 1.905-3T(d)(2), the taxpayer is required to notify the IRS of such redetermination by reflecting the adjustments to the foreign corporation's pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes on a Form 1118 for the taxpayer's first taxable year with respect to which the redetermination affects the computation of foreign taxes deemed paid. Such Form 1118 must be filed by the due date (with extensions) of the original return for such taxable year. In the case of multiple redeterminations that affect the computation of foreign taxes deemed paid for the same taxable year and that are required to be reported under this paragraph (b)(2), a taxpayer may file one notification for all such redeterminations in lieu of filing a separate notification for each such redetermination. See section 905(b) and the regulations under that section which require that a taxpayer substantiate that a foreign tax was paid and provide all necessary information establishing its entitlement to the foreign tax credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Taxpayers under the jurisdiction of the Large and Mid-Size Business Division. The rules of this paragraph (b)(3) apply where a redetermination of United States tax liability is required by reason of a foreign tax redetermination

that results in a reduction in the amount of foreign taxes paid or accrued, or included in the computation of foreign taxes deemed paid, and such foreign tax redetermination occurs while a taxpayer is under the jurisdiction of the Large and Mid-Size Business Division (or similar program). The taxpayer must, in lieu of applying the rules of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section (requiring the filing of an amended return, Form 1118, and a statement described in paragraph (c) of this section by the due date (with extensions) of the original return for the taxpayer's taxable year in which the foreign tax redetermination occurred), notify the IRS of such redetermination by providing to the examiner the statement described in paragraph (c) of this section during an examination of the return for the taxable year for which a redetermination of United States tax liability is required by reason of such foreign tax redetermination. The taxpayer must provide the statement to the examiner no later than 120 days after the latest of the date the foreign tax redetermination occurs, the opening conference of the examination, or the hand-delivery or postmark date of the opening letter concerning the examination. If, however, the foreign tax redetermination occurs more than 180 days after the latest of the opening conference or the hand-delivery or postmark date of the opening letter, the taxpayer may, in lieu of applying the rules of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, provide the statement to the examiner within 120 days after the date the foreign tax redetermination occurs, and the IRS, in its discretion, may accept such statement or require the taxpayer to comply with the rules of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section. A taxpayer subject to the rules of this paragraph (b)(3) must satisfy the rules of this paragraph (b)(3) (in lieu of the rules of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section) in order not to be subject to the penalty relating to the failure to file notice of a foreign tax redetermination under section 6689 and the regulations under that section. This paragraph (b)(3) shall not apply where the due date specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section for providing notice of the foreign tax redetermination precedes the latest of the opening conference or the hand-delivery or postmark date of the opening letter concerning an examination of the return for the taxable year for which a redetermination of United States tax liability is required by reason of such foreign tax redetermination. In addition, any statement that would otherwise be required to be provided under this paragraph (b)(3) on or before May 5, 2008 will be considered timely if provided on or before May 5, 2008.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (b)(3) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example. X, a taxpayer under the jurisdiction of the Large and Mid-Size Business Division, uses the calendar year as its United States taxable year. On October 15, 2009, X receives a refund of foreign tax that constitutes a foreign tax redetermination that necessitates a redetermination of United States tax liability for X's 2008 taxable year. Under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, X is required to notify the IRS of the foreign tax redetermination by filing an amended return, Form 1118, and the statement required in paragraph (c) of this section for its 2008 taxable year by September 15, 2010 (the due date (with extensions) of the original return for X's 2009 taxable year). On December 15, 2010, the IRS hand delivers an opening letter concerning the examination of the return for X's 2008 taxable year, and the opening conference for such examination is scheduled for January 15, 2011. Because the date for notifying the IRS of the foreign tax redetermination under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section precedes the date of the opening conference concerning the examination of the return for X's 2008 taxable year, paragraph (b)(3) of this section does not apply, and X must notify the IRS of the foreign tax redetermination by filing a amended return, Form 1118, and the statement required in paragraph (c) of this section for the 2008 taxable year by September 15, 2010.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Notification contents--(1) In general. In addition to satisfying the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the taxpayer must furnish a statement that contains information sufficient for the IRS to redetermine the taxpayer's United States tax liability where such a redetermination is required under section 905(c), and to verify adjustments to the pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes where such adjustments are required under Sec. 1.905-

3T(d)(2). The information must be in a form that enables the IRS to verify and compare the original computations with respect to a claimed foreign tax credit, the revised computations resulting from the foreign tax redetermination, and the net changes resulting therefrom. The statement must include the taxpayer's name, address, identifying number, and the taxable year or years of the taxpayer that are affected by the foreign tax redetermination. In addition, the taxpayer must provide the information described in paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, as appropriate. If the statement is submitted to the IRS under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, which provides requirements with respect to reporting by taxpayers under the jurisdiction of the Large and Mid-Size Business Division, the statement must also include the following declaration signed by a person authorized to sign the return of the taxpayer: ``Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this written statement, and to the best of my knowledge and belief, this written statement is true, correct, and complete.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Foreign taxes paid or accrued. Where a redetermination of United States tax liability is required by reason of a foreign tax redetermination as defined in Sec. 1.905-3T(c), in addition to the information described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the taxpayer must provide the following: the date or dates the foreign taxes were accrued, if applicable; the date or dates the foreign taxes were paid; the amount of foreign taxes paid or accrued on each date (in foreign currency) and the exchange rate used to translate each such amount, as provided in Sec. 1.905-3T(b)(1) or (b)(2); and information sufficient to determine any interest due from or owing to the taxpayer, including the amount of any interest paid by the foreign government to the taxpayer and the dates received. In addition, in the case of any foreign tax that is refunded in whole or in part, the taxpayer must provide the date of each such refund; the amount of such refund (in foreign currency); and the exchange rate that was used to translate such amount when originally claimed as a credit (as provided in Sec. 1.905-3T(b)(3)) and the exchange rate for the date the refund was received (for purposes of computing foreign currency gain or loss under section 988). In addition, in the case of any foreign taxes that were not paid before the date two years after the close of the taxable year to which such taxes relate, the taxpayer must provide the amount of such taxes in foreign currency, and the exchange rate that was used to translate such amount when originally added to post-1986 foreign income taxes or claimed as a credit. Where a redetermination of United States tax liability results in an amount of additional tax due, but the carryback or carryover of an unused foreign tax under section 904(c) only partially eliminates such amount, the taxpayer must also provide the information required in Sec. 1.904-2(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Foreign taxes deemed paid. Where a redetermination of United States tax liability is required under Sec. 1.905-3T(d)(3) to account for the effect of a redetermination of foreign tax paid or accrued by a foreign corporation on foreign taxes deemed paid under section 902 or 960, in addition to the information described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, the taxpayer must provide the balances of the pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes before and after adjusting the pools in accordance with the rules of Sec. 1.905-3T(d)(2), the dates and amounts of any dividend distributions or other inclusions made out of earnings and profits for the affected year or years, and the amount of earnings and profits from which such dividends were paid for the affected year or years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Payment or refund of United States tax. The amount of tax, if any, due upon a redetermination of United States tax liability shall be paid by the taxpayer after notice and demand has been made by the IRS. Subchapter B of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code (relating to deficiency procedures) shall not apply with respect to the assessment of the amount due upon such redetermination. In accordance with sections 905(c) and 6501(c)(5), the amount of additional tax due shall be assessed and collected without regard to the provisions of section 6501(a) (relating to limitations on assessment

and collection). The amount of tax, if any, shown by a redetermination of United States tax liability to have been overpaid shall be credited or refunded to the taxpayer in accordance with the provisions of section 6511(d)(3)(A) and Sec. 301.6511(d)-3 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Interest and penalties--(1) In general. If a redetermination of United States tax liability is required by reason of a foreign tax redetermination, interest shall be computed on the underpayment or overpayment in accordance with sections 6601 and 6611 and the regulations under these sections. No interest shall be assessed or collected on any underpayment resulting from a refund of foreign tax for any period before the receipt of the refund, except to the extent interest was paid by the foreign country or possession of the United States on the refund for the period. In no case, however, shall interest assessed and collected pursuant to the preceding sentence for any period before receipt of the foreign tax refund exceed the amount that otherwise would have been assessed and collected under section 6601 and the regulations under this section for that period. Interest shall be assessed from the time the taxpayer (or the foreign corporation of which the taxpayer is a shareholder) receives a refund until the taxpayer pays the additional tax due the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Adjustments to pools of foreign taxes. No underpayment or overpayment of United States tax liability results from a redetermination of foreign tax unless a redetermination of United States tax liability is required. Consequently, no interest shall be paid by or to a taxpayer as a result of adjustments to a foreign corporation's pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes made in accordance with Sec. 1.905-3T(d)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Imposition of penalty. Failure to comply with the provisions of this section shall subject the taxpayer to the penalty provisions of section 6689 and the regulations under that section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective/applicability date--(1) In general. This section applies to foreign tax redeterminations (defined in Sec. 1.905-3T(c)) occurring in taxable years of United States taxpayers beginning on or after November 7, 2007, where the foreign tax redetermination affects the amount of foreign taxes paid or accrued by a United States taxpayer. Where the redetermination of foreign tax paid or accrued by a foreign corporation affects the computation of foreign taxes deemed paid under section 902 or 960 with respect to pre-1987 accumulated profits or post-1986 undistributed earnings of the foreign corporation, this section applies to foreign tax redeterminations occurring in a taxable year of the foreign corporation which ends with or within a taxable year of its domestic corporate shareholder beginning on or after November 7, 2007. In no case, however, shall this paragraph (f)(1) operate to extend the statute of limitations provided by section 6511(d)(3)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Foreign tax redeterminations occurring in taxable years beginning before November 7, 2007--(i) Scope. This paragraph (f)(2) applies to any foreign tax redetermination (as defined in Sec. 1.905-3T(c)) which occurred in any of the three taxable years of a United States taxpayer immediately preceding the taxpayer's first taxable year beginning on or after November 7, 2007; reduced the amount of foreign taxes paid or accrued by the taxpayer; and requires a redetermination of United States tax liability for any taxable year. This paragraph (f)(2) also applies to any redetermination of foreign tax paid or accrued by a foreign corporation which occurred in a taxable year of the foreign corporation which ends with or within any of the three taxable years of a domestic corporate shareholder immediately preceding such shareholder's first taxable year beginning on or after November 7, 2007; reduced foreign taxes included in the computation of foreign taxes deemed paid by such shareholder under section 902 or 960; and requires a redetermination of United States tax liability under Sec. 1.905-3T(d)(3) for any taxable year. For corresponding rules applicable to foreign tax redeterminations occurring in taxable years beginning before the third taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year beginning on or after November 7, 2007, see 26 CFR 1.905-4T and 1.905-5T (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised as of April 1, 2007).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Notification required.

Such notification must be filed no later than the due date (with extensions) of the original return for the taxpayer's first taxable year following the taxable year in which these regulations are first applicable. Where the foreign tax redetermination requires an individual to redetermine the individual's United States tax liability, and as a result of such foreign tax redetermination the amount of creditable taxes paid or accrued by such individual during the taxable year does not exceed the applicable dollar limitation in section 904(k), the individual shall not be required to file Form 1116 with the amended return for such taxable year if the individual satisfies the requirements of section 904(k). The rules of paragraphs (b)(1)(iv) and (v) of this section (concerning multiple redeterminations of United States tax liability for the same taxable year, and the carryback and carryover of unused foreign tax) shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Taxpayers under the jurisdiction of the Large and Mid-Size Business Division. If a taxpayer under the jurisdiction of the Large and Mid-Size Business Division is otherwise required under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section to notify the IRS of a foreign tax redetermination described in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section by filing an amended return, Form 1118, and the statement required in paragraph (c) of this section, such taxpayer may, in lieu of applying the rules of paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, provide to the examiner the information described in paragraph (c) of this section during an examination of the return for the taxable year for which a redetermination of United States tax liability is required by reason of such foreign tax redetermination.

However, if November 7, 2007 is more than 180 days after the latest of the opening conference or the hand-delivery or postmark date of the opening letter, the IRS, in its discretion, may accept such statement or require the taxpayer to comply with the rules of paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section.

For this purpose, a disposition includes only a sale or exchange. FOGEI and FORI may also include taxable income from the performance of related services or from the lease of related property and certain dividends, interest, or amounts described in section 951(a).

M, a U.S. corporation, uses the accrual method of accounting and the calendar year as its taxable year. For 1984, M has $20,000 of FOGEI, derived from operations in foreign countries X and Y, and has accrued $11,500 of foreign taxes with respect to FOGEI. The highest tax rate specified in section 11(b) for M's 1984 taxable year is 46 percent. Pursuant to section 907(a), M's FOGEI taxes limitation level for 1984 is $9,200 (46% x $20,000). The foreign taxes in excess of this limitation level ($2,300) may be carried

back or forward. See section 907(f) and Sec. 1.907(f)-1 and section 907(e) and Sec. 1.907(e)-1.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2.

The total amount of foreign taxes accrued by A and B with respect to their distributive shares of M's FOGEI is $11,500 ($5,750 accrued by A and $5,750 accrued by B). A and B have no other FOGEI. A's only taxable income for 1984 is his 50% distributive share ($10,000) of M's FOGEI and A has a preliminary U.S. tax liability of $1,079. B has $112,130 of taxable income for 1984 (including his 50% distributive share ($10,000) of M's FOGEI) and has a preliminary U.S. tax liability of $44,000. Pursuant to section 907(a), A's FOGEI taxes limitation level for 1984 is $1,079 (($1,079/$10,000) x $10,000) and B's FOGEI taxes limitation level for 1984 is $3,924 (($44,000/$112,130) x $10,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effect on other provisions--(1) Deduction denied.

Sec. 1.907(b)-1  Reduction of creditable FORI taxes (for taxable yearsbeginning after December 31, 1982).</p><p class="depth0">If the foreign law imposing a FORI tax (as defined in Sec. 1.907(c)-3) is either structured in a manner, or operates in a manner, so that the amount of tax imposed on FORI is generally materially greater than the tax imposed by the foreign law on income that is neither FORI nor FOGEI (``described manner''), section 907(b) provides a special rule which limits the amount of FORI taxes paid or accrued by a person to a foreign country which will be considered income, war profits, or excess profits taxes. Section 907(b) will apply to a person regardless of whether that person is a dual capacity taxpayer as defined in Sec. 1.901-2(a)(2)(ii)(A). (In general, a dual capacity taxpayer is a person who pays an amount to a foreign country part of which is attributable to an income tax and the remainder of which is a payment for a specific economic benefit derived from that country.) Foreign law imposing a tax on FORI will be considered either to be structured in or to operate in the described manner only if, under the facts and circumstances, there has been a shifting of tax by the foreign country from a tax on FOGEI to a tax on FORI.

Sec. 1.907(c)-1  Definitions relating to FOGEI and FORI (for taxableyears beginning after December 31, 1982).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section explains the meaning to be given certain terms and items in section 907(c) (1), (2), and (4). See also Sec. Sec. 1.907(a)-0(b) and 1.907(c)-2 for further definitions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> FOGEI--(1) General rule. Under section 907(c)(1), FOGEI means taxable income (or loss) derived from sources outside the United States and its possessions from the extraction (by the taxpayer or any other person) of minerals from oil or gas wells located outside the United States and its possessions or from the sale or exchange of assets used by the taxpayer in the trade or business of extracting those minerals. Extraction of minerals from oil or gas wells will result in gross income from extraction in every case in which that person has an economic interest in the minerals in place. For other circumstances in which gross income from extraction may arise, see paragraph (b)(3) of this section. For determination of the amount of gross income from extraction, see paragraph (b)(2) of this section. For definition of the phrase ``assets used by the taxpayer in the trade or business'' and for rules relating to that type of FOGEI, see paragraph (e)(1) of this section. The

term ``minerals'' is defined in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. For determination of taxable income, see paragraph (f)(2) of this section. FOGEI includes, in addition, items listed in section 907(c)(3) (relating to dividends, interest, partnership distributions, etc.) and explained in Sec. 1.907(c)-2. For the reduction of what would otherwise be FOGEI by losses incurred in a prior year, see section 907(c)(4) and paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Amount. The gross income from extraction is determined by reference to the fair market value of the minerals in the immediate vicinity of the well. Fair market value is determined under paragraph (b)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Other circumstances. Gross income from extraction or the sale or exchange of assets described in section 907(c)(1)(B) includes income from any arrangement, or a combination of arrangements or transactions, to the extent the income is in substance attributable to the extraction of minerals or such a sale or exchange. For instance, a person may have gross income from such a sale or exchange if the person purchased minerals from a foreign government at a discount and the discount reflects an arm's-length amount in consideration for the government's nationalization of assets that person owned and used in the extraction of minerals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Income directly related to extraction. Gross income from extraction includes directly related income under paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Income not included. FOGEI as otherwise determined under this paragraph (b), nevertheless, does not include income to the extent attributable to marketing, distributing, processing or transporting minerals or primary products. Income from the purchase and sale of minerals is not ordinarily FOGEI. If the foreign taxes paid or accrued in connection with income from a purchase and sale are not creditable by reason of section 901(f), that income is not FOGEI. A taxpayer to whom section 901(f) applies is not a producer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Fair market value. For purposes of this paragraph (b), the fair market value of oil or gas in the immediate vicinity of the well depends on all of the facts and circumstances as they exist relative to a party in any particular case. The facts and circumstances that may be taken into account include, but are not limited to, the following--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts and circumstances pertaining to an independent market value (if any) in the immediate vicinity of the well,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The facts and circumstances pertaining to the relationships between the taxpayer and the foreign government. If an independent fair market value in the immediate vicinity of the well cannot be determined but fair market value at the port, or a similar point, in the foreign country can be determined (port price), an analysis of the arrangement between the taxpayer and the foreign government that retains a share of production could be evidence of the appropriate, arm's-length difference between the port price and the field price, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The other facts and circumstances pertaining to any difference in the producing country between the field and port prices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Economic interest. For purposes of this paragraph (b), the term ``economic interest'' means an economic interest as defined in Sec. 1.611-1(b)(1), whether or not a deduction for depletion is allowable under section 611.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Carryover of foreign oil extraction losses--(1) In general. Pursuant to section 907(c)(4), the determination of FOGEI for a particular taxable year takes into account a foreign oil extraction loss incurred in prior taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982. There is no time limitation on this carryover of foreign oil extraction losses. Section 907(c)(4) does not provide for any carryback of these losses. Section 907(c)(4) operates solely for purposes of determining FOGEI and thus operates independently of section 904(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reduction. That portion of the income of the taxpayer for the taxable year which but for this paragraph (c) would be treated as FOGEI is reduced (but not below zero) by the excess of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The aggregate amount of foreign oil extraction losses for preceding taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982, over</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The aggregate amount of reductions under this paragraph (c) for preceding taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Foreign oil extraction loss defined--(i) In general. For purposes of this paragraph (c), the term ``foreign oil extraction loss'' means the amount by which the gross income for the taxable year that is taken into account in determining FOGEI for that year is exceeded by the sum of the deductions properly allocated and apportioned to that gross income as determined under paragraph (f)(2) of this section). A person can have a foreign oil extraction loss for a taxable year even if the person has not chosen the benefits of section 901 for that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Items not taken into account. For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, the following items are not taken into account--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The net operating loss deduction allowable for the taxable year under section 172(a),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any foreign expropriation loss (as defined in section 172(h)) for the taxable year, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any loss for the taxable year which arises from fire, storm, shipwreck, or other casualty, or from theft.

A loss mentioned in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) (B) or (C) of this section is taken into account, however, to the extent compensation (for instance by insurance) for the loss is included in gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Affiliated groups. The foreign oil extraction loss of an affiliated group of corporations (within the meaning of section 1504(a)) that files a consolidated return is determined on a group basis. If the group does not have a foreign oil extraction loss, the foreign oil extraction loss of a member of that group will not reduce on a separate basis that member's FOGEI for a later taxable year. For special rules affecting the foreign oil extraction loss in the case of certain related domestic corporations that are not members of the same affiliated group, see section 904(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> FOGEI taxes. If FOGEI is reduced pursuant to this paragraph (c) (and thereby recharacterized as non-FOGEI income), any foreign taxes imposed on the FOGEI that is recharacterized as other income retain their character as FOGEI taxes. See section 907(c)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (c) may be illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. (i) Facts. X, a U.S. corporation using the accrual method of accounting and the calendar year as its taxable year, is engaged in extraction activities in three foreign countries. X has only the following combined foreign tax items for the three countries (prior to the application of this paragraph (c)) for 1983, 1984, and 1985:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">1983     1984    1985------------------------------------------------------------------------FOGEI.........................................    $(700)    $100    $450FOGEI taxes...................................       10       60     200Net operating loss deduction..................

Because X's FOGEI for 1983 is a loss of $(700), X's section 907(a) limitation for 1983 is $0 (.46 x $0). Thus, none of the FOGEI taxes paid or accrued in 1983 ($10) can be credited in 1983. They can, however, be carried back to 1981 or 1982 pursuant to the provisions of section 907(e)(2) and Sec. 1.907(e)-1 and carried forward pursuant to the provisions of section 907(f) and Sec. 1.907(f)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> 1984. X's FOGEI for 1984, prior to the application of this paragraph (c), is $100. X has a foreign oil extraction loss for 1983 of $(500). This loss must be applied against X's preliminary FOGEI of $100 for 1984. Thus, X's FOGEI for 1984 is $0 and X has $(400) ($500-$100) of foreign oil extraction loss from 1983 to be carried to 1985. Since X's FOGEI for 1984 is $0, its section 907(a) limitation is $0 (.46 x $0). Therefore, none of the FOGEI taxes paid or accrued in 1984 ($60) can be credited in 1984. They can, however, be carried back pursuant to the provisions of section 907(e)(2) and Sec. 1.907(e)-1 and carried forward pursuant to the provisions of section 907(f) and Sec. 1.907(f)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> 1985. X's FOGEI for 1985, prior to the application of this paragraph (c), is $450. X's remaining foreign oil extraction loss carryover from 1983 is $(400) and this must be applied against X's preliminary FOGEI of $450 for 1985. Thus, X's FOGEI for 1984 is $50 ($450-$400). X's section 907 (a) limitation is $23 (.46 x $50). Therefore, $23 of the FOGEI taxes paid or accrued in 1985, together with the other $230 of general limitation taxes, can be credited in 1985, subject to the general limitation of section 904(d)(1)(E) (as in effect prior to 1987). The excess of FOGEI taxes, $177 ($200-$23), can be carried back pursuant to the provisions of section 907(e)(2) and Sec. 1.907(e)-1 and carried forward pursuant to

the provisions of section 907(f) and Sec. 1.907(f)-1.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. (i) Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that X's paragraph (c)(3)(ii) items for 1983 allocable to FOGEI are $(800) instead of $(200). FOGEI remains a loss of $(700). Thus, X does not have a foreign oil extraction loss for 1983 because it has $100 of FOGEI when its paragraph (c)(3)(ii) items are not taken into account ($(700) + $800).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 1983. The results are the same as in Example 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> 1984. Although X had FOGEI loss of $(700) in 1983, there is not a loss that can be carried forward after adjustment for paragraph (c)(3)(ii) items. Thus, X's FOGEI for 1984 is not reduced by the 1983 loss. X's section 907(a) limitation for 1984 is $46 (.46 x $100). Therefore, $46 of the FOGEI taxes paid or accrued in 1984, together with the other $90 of general limitation taxes, can be credited in 1984, subject to the general limitation of section 904(d)(1)(E) (as in effect prior to 1987). The excess of $14 ($60-$46) can be carried back to 1982 pursuant to the provisions of section 907(e)(2) and Sec. 1.907(e)-1 and carried forward pursuant to the provisions of section 907(f) and Sec. 1.907(f)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> 1985. Since there is no foreign oil extraction loss for either 1983 or 1984 to be applied in 1985, X's FOGEI for 1985 is $450. Thus, its section 907(a) limitation for 1985 is $207 (.46 x $450) and all of its FOGEI taxes paid or accrued in 1985 ($200), together with the other $230 of general limitation taxes, can be credited in 1985, subject to the general limitation of section 904(d)(1)(E) (as in effect prior to 1987). FOGEI taxes in the amount of $10 from 1983 and $14 from 1984 may be carried forward to 1985 if they have not been used in carryback years. However, because the excess section 907(a) limitation for 1985 is only $7, that is the maximum potential FOGEI taxes from 1983 or 1984 that may be used in 1985.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. (i) Facts. Y, a U.S. corporation using the accrual method of accounting and the calendar year as its taxable year, is engaged in extraction activities in three foreign countries. Y's only foreign taxable income is income subject to the general limitation of section 904(d)(1)(E) (as in effect prior to 1987). Y has no paragraph (c)(3)(ii) items. Y has the following foreign tax items for 1983 and 1984:

Because Y's FOGEI for 1983 is a loss of $(400), Y's section 907(a) limitation for 1983 is $0. Thus, none of the FOGEI taxes paid or accrued in 1983 ($10) can be credited in 1983. They can, however, be carried back to 1981 or 1982 pursuant to the provisions of section 907(e)(2) and Sec. 1.907(e)-1 and carried forward pursuant to the provisions of section 907(f) and Sec. 1.907(f)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Section 904(d) fraction. Y has a foreign loss of $(150) ($(400 + $250) for 1983. Thus, its fraction for purposes of determining its general limitation of section 904(d)(1)(E) is $0/$850.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> 1984--(A) Section 907(a) limitation. Y's foreign oil extraction loss for 1983 is $(400). Applying this loss to its preliminary FOGEI for 1984 ($300) eliminates all of Y's FOGEI for 1984. Because Y's FOGEI for 1984 is $0, its section 907(a) limitation is also $0. Thus, none of the FOGEI taxes paid or accrued in 1984 ($180) can be credited in 1984. They can, however, be carried back to 1982 pursuant to the provisions of section 907(e)(2) and Sec. 1.907(e)-1 and carried forward pursuant to the provisions of section 907(f) and Sec. 1.907(f)-1. Y has a remaining foreign oil extraction loss of $(100) from 1983 to be carried to 1985.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Section 904(d) fraction. Y's preliminary foreign taxable income for purposes of determining its general limitation of section 904(d)(1)(E) is $500 ($300 + $200). However, Y has an overall foreign loss from 1983 of $(150) ($(400) + $250) and thus, pursuant to section 904(f), Y must recharacterize $150 (lesser of $150 or 50% of $500) of its 1984 foreign taxable income as U.S. taxable income. Thus, Y's fraction for purposes of determining its general limitation of section 904(d)(1)(E) for 1984 is $350/$1,600.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. (i) Facts.

For 1983, Y has a section 904(d)(1)(E) overall foreign loss account of $50; see section 904(f) and Sec. 1.904(f)-1(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> 1984. Because Y's FOGEI for 1984 is a loss of $(100), Y's section 907(a) limitation for 1984 is $0. Thus, none of the FOGEI taxes paid or accrued in 1984 ($10) can be credited in 1984. They can, however, be carried back under the provisions of section 907(e)(2) and Sec. 1.907(e)-1 and carried forward under the provisions of section 907(f) and Sec. 1.907(f)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> 1985. Y's FOGEI loss of $(100) for 1984 is carried forward to 1985 and offsets FOGEI income in that amount in 1985. The entire section 904(d)(1)(E) overall foreign loss account of $50 is recaptured in 1985; therefore, Y has $75 of foreign source income and $50 of U.S. source income. However, Y has $125 of FOGEI since, for purposes of section 907(a), the $50 resourced by section 904(f) will be treated as income from sources outside the United States; see Sec. 1.907(a)-1(c)(4)(iii). Accordingly, Y's section 907(a) limitation is $57.50 (.46 x $125). Y's section 904(d)(1)(E) limitation is, however, only $34.50 (.46 x $75). Thus, Y may claim a foreign tax credit of $34.50 in 1985. Y may carry back or carry forward $23 ($57.50-$34.50) and that amount is not subject to the section 907(a) limitation in the carry to year. In addition, $67.50 ($125-$57.50) may be carried back pursuant to the provisions of section 907(e)(2) and Sec. 1.907(e)-1 and carried forward pursuant to the provisions of section 907(f) and Sec. 1.907(f)-1. This amount is subject to the section 907(a) limitation in the carry to year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> FORI--(1) In general. Section 907(c)(2) defines FORI to include taxable income from the processing of oil and gas into their primary products, from the transportation or distribution and sale of oil and gas and their primary products, from the disposition of assets used in these activities and from the performance of any other related service. FORI may also include, under section 907(c)(3), certain dividends, interest, or amounts described in section 951(a). This paragraph (d) defines certain terms and items applicable to FORI.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transportation. Gross income from transportation of minerals or primary products (``gross transportation income'') is gross income arising from carrying minerals or primary products between two places (including time or voyage charter hires) by any means of transportation, such as a vessel, pipeline, truck, railroad, or aircraft. Except for directly related income under paragraphs (d)(7) and (g) of this section, gross transportation income does not include gross income received by a lessor from a bareboat charter hire of a means of transportation, certain other rental income, or income from the performance of certain services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Distribution or sale. The term ``distribution or sale'' means the sale or exchange of minerals or primary products to processors, users who purchase, store, or use in bulk quantities, other persons for further distribution, retailers, or consumers. Gross income from distribution or sale includes interest income attributable to the distribution of minerals or primary products on credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Processing. The term ``processing'' means the destructive distillation, or a process similar in effect to destructive distillation, of crude oil and the processing of natural gas into their primary products including processes used to remove pollutants from crude oil or natural gas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Primary product from oil. The term ``primary product'' (in the case of oil) means all products derived from the processing of crude oil, including volatile products, light oils (such as motor fuel and kerosene), distillates (such as naphtha), lubricating oils, greases and waxes, and residues (such as fuel oil).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Primary product from gas. The term ``primary product'' (in the case of gas) means all gas and associated hydrocarbon components from gas wells or oil wells, whether recovered at the lease or upon further processing, including natural gas, condensates, liquefiable petroleum gases (such as ethane, propane, and butane), and liquid products (such as natural gasoline).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Directly related income. FORI also includes directly related income under paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Assets used in a trade or business--(1) In general. The term ``assets used by the taxpayer in the trade or business'' in section 907(c) (1)(B) and (2)(D) means property primarily used in one or more of the trades or businesses that are section 907(c) activities. For purposes of this paragraph (e), assets used in a trade or business are assets described in section 1231(b) (applied without regard to any holding period or the character of the asset as being subject to the allowance for depreciation under section 167).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Section 907(c) activities. Section 907(c) activities are those described in section 907(c)(1)(A) (for FOGEI) or (c)(2) (A) through (C) (for FORI). If an asset is used primarily in one or more section 907(c) activities, then the entire gain (or loss) will be considered attributable to those activities. For example, if a person uses a service station primarily to distribute primary products

from oil, then all of the gain (or loss) on the sale of the station is FORI even though the person uses the station to distribute products that are not primary products (such as tires or batteries). If an asset is not primarily used in one or more section 907(c) activities, then the entire gain or loss will not be FOGEI or FORI.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Stock. Stock of any corporation (whether foreign or domestic) will not be treated as an asset used by a person in section 907(c) activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Losses on sale of stock. If, under Sec. 1.861-8(e)(7), a loss on the sale, exchange, or disposition of stock is considered a deduction which is definitely related and allocable to FOGEI or FORI, then notwithstanding Sec. 1.861-8 (e)(7) and paragraph (f)(2) of this section, this loss shall be allocated and apportioned to the same class of income that would have been produced if there were capital gain from the sale, exchange or disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Character of gain or loss. Except in the case of stock, gain or loss from the sale, exchange or disposition of assets used in the trade or business may be FORI or FOGEI to the extent taken into account in computing taxable income for the taxable year, whether or not the gain or loss is ordinary income or ordinary loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Allocation of amount realized. The amount realized from the sale, exchange or disposition of several assets in one transaction is allocated among them in proportion to their respective fair market values. This allocation is made under the principles set forth in Sec. 1.1245-1(a)(5) (relating to allocation between section 1245 property and non-section 1245 property).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Interest. Gross income from the sale, exchange or disposition of an asset used in a section 907(c) activity includes interest income from such a sale, exchange or disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Terms and items common to FORI and FOGEI--(1) Minerals. The term ``minerals'' means hydrocarbon minerals extracted from oil and gas wells, including crude oil or natural gas (as defined in section 613A(e)). The term includes incidental impurities from these wells, such as sulphur, nitrogen, or helium. The term does not include hydrocarbon minerals derived from shale oil or tar sands.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Taxable income. Deductions to be taken into account in computing taxable income or net operating loss attributable to FOGEI or FORI are determined under the principles of Sec. 1.861-8. For an exception with regard to losses, see paragraph (e)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Interest on working capital. FORI and FOGEI may include interest on bank deposits or on any other temporary investment which is not in excess of funds reasonably necessary to meet the working capital requirements and the specifically anticipated business needs of the person that is engaged in the conduct of the activities described in section 907(c) (1) or (2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Exchange gain or loss. Exchange gain (and loss) may be FORI and FOGEI. For taxable years beginning after 1986, exchange gain or loss from a section 988 transaction may be FORI or FOGEI only if directly related to the business needs (under the principles of section 954(c)(1)(D)) attributable to the conduct of the section 907(c) activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Allocation. Interest income and exchange gain (or loss) described, respectively, in paragraph (f) (3) and (4) of this section are allocated among FORI, FOGEI, and any other class of income relevant for purposes of the foreign tax credit limitations under any reasonable method which is consistently applied from year-to-year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Facts and circumstances. Income not described elsewhere in this section may be FOGEI or FORI if, under the facts and circumstances in the particular case, the income is in substance directly attributable to the activities described in section 907(c) (1) or (2). For example, assume that a producer in the North Sea suffers a casualty caused by an explosion, fire, and resulting destruction of a drilling platform. Insurance proceeds received for the platform's destruction in excess of the producer's basis is extraction income if the excess constitutes income from sources outside the United States. In addition, income from an insurance policy for business interruption may be extraction income to the extent the payments under the policy are geared directly to the loss of income from production and are treated as income from

sources outside the United States. Also, if an oil company's oil concession or assets used in extraction activities described in section 907(c)(1)(A) and located outside the United States are nationalized or expropriated by a foreign government, or instrumentality thereof, income derived from that nationalization or expropriation (including interest on the income paid pursuant to the nationalization or expropriation) is FOGEI. Likewise, if a company's assets used in the activities described in section 907(c)(2) (A) through (C) and located outside the United States are nationalized or expropriated by a foreign government, or instrumentality thereof, income (including interest on the income paid pursuant to the nationalization or expropriation) derived from the nationalization or expropriation will be FORI. Nationalization or expropriation is deemed to be a sale or exchange for purposes of section 907(c)(1)(B) and a disposition for purposes of section 907(c)(2)(D). In further example, assume that an oil company has an exclusive right to buy all the oil in country X from Y, an instrumentality of the foreign sovereign which owns all of the oil in X. The oil company does not have an economic interest in any oil in country X. Y has a temporary cash-flow problem and demands that the oil company make advance deposits for the purchase of oil not yet delivered. In return, Y grants the oil company a discount on the price of the oil when delivered. Income represented by the discount on the later disposition of the oil is FORI described in section 907(c)(2)(C). The result would be the same if Y credited the oil company with interest on the advance deposits, which had to be used to purchase oil (the interest income would be FORI).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Directly related income--(1) In general. Section 907(c)(2)(E) and this paragraph (g) include in FORI, and this paragraph (g) includes in FOGEI, income from the performance of directly related services (as defined in paragraph (g)(2) of this section). This paragraph (g) also includes in FORI and FOGEI income from the lease or license of related property (as defined in paragraph (g)(3) of this section). Section 907(c)(2)(E) with regard to FORI and this paragraph (g) with regard to both FORI and FOGEI do not apply to a person if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Neither that person nor a related person (as defined in paragraph (g)(4) of this section) has FOGEI described in paragraph (b) of this section (other than paragraph (b)(4) of this section relating to directly related income) or FORI described in paragraph (d) of this section (other than paragraph (d)(7) of this section relating to directly related income), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Less than 50 percent of that person's gross income from sources outside the United States which is related exclusively to the performance of services and from the lease or license of property described in paragraph (g) (2) and (3) of this section, respectively, is attributable to services performed for (or on behalf of), leases to, or licenses with, related persons, but</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section will not apply to a person if 50 percent or more of that person's total gross income from sources outside the United States is FOGEI and FORI (as both are described in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section).

A person described in paragraph (g)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section will, however, have directly related services income which is FOGEI if the income is so classified by reason of the income based on output test set forth in paragraph (g)(2)(i)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Directly related services--(i) FOGEI. (A) Income from directly related services will be FOGEI, as that term is defined in paragraph (b) (1) and (3) of this section, if those services are directly related to the active conduct of extraction (including exploration) of minerals from oil and gas wells. Paragraph (b)(1) of this section provides that, in order to have extraction income, a person must have an economic interest in the minerals in place. However, paragraph (b)(3) of this section recognizes that income arising from ``other circumstances'' is extraction income if that income is in substance attributable to the extraction of minerals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An example of ``other circumstances'' under paragraph (b)(3) of this section is the ``income based on output test.'' This income based on output test provides that, if the

amount of compensation paid or credited to a person for services is dependent on the amount of minerals discovered or extracted, the income of the person from the performance of the services will be directly related services income which is FOGEI. This test will apply whether or not the person performing the services has, or had, an economic interest in the minerals discovered or extracted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> FORI. With regard to the determination of directly related services income which is FORI, directly related services are those services directly related to the active conduct of the operations described in section 907(c)(2) (A) through (C). Those services include, for example, services performed in relation to the distribution of minerals or primary products or in connection with the operation of a refinery, or the types of services described in Sec. 1.954-6(d) (other than Sec. 1.954-6(d)(4) which relate to foreign base company shipping income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Recipient of the services. Directly related services described in paragraph (g)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section may be performed for any person without regard to whether that person is a related person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Excluded services--(A) FOGEI. Directly related services which produce FOGEI do not include insurance, accounting or managerial services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> FORI. Directly related services which produce FORI do not, generally, include insurance, accounting or managerial services. These services will, however, produce FORI if they are performed by the person performing the operations described in section 907(c)(2) (A) through (C). For these purposes, insurance income which is FORI means taxable income as defined in section 832(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Leases and licenses. A lease or license of related property is the lease or license of assets used (or held for use) by the lessor, licensor, or another person (including the lessee or a sublessee) in the active conduct of the activities described in section 907 (c)(1)(A) or (c)(2) (A) through (C). The leases or licenses described in this paragraph (g)(3) include, for example, a lease of a means of transportation under a bareboat charter hire, of drilling equipment used in extraction operations, or the license of a patent, know-how, or similar intangible property used in extracting, transporting, distributing or processing minerals or primary products. This paragraph (g)(3) applies without regard to whether the parties are related persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Related person. A person will be treated as a related person for purposes of this paragraph (g) if that person would be so treated within the meaning of section 954(d)(3) (as applied by substituting the word ``corporation'' for the word ``controlled foreign corporation'') or that person is a partnership or partner described in section 707(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Gross income. A foreign corporation shall be treated as a domestic corporation for the purpose of applying the gross-income rules in paragraph (g)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Coordination with other provisions--(1) Certain adjustments. The character of income as FOGEI or FORI is determined before making any adjustment under section 482 or section 907(d). For example, assume that X and Y are related parties, Y's only income is from the sale of oil that Y purchased from X, and FOGEI from X is diverted to Y through an arrangement described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Accordingly, Y has FOGEI. If under section 482 the Commissioner reallocates the FOGEI from Y to X, then Y's remaining income represents only a profit from distributing the oil, and thus is FORI. If the foreign taxes paid by Y on this income are otherwise creditable under section 901, the foreign taxes that are not refunded to Y retain their characterization as FOGEI taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Section 901(f). Section 901(f) (relating to certain payments with respect to oil and gas not considered as taxes) applies before section 907. Taxes disallowed by section 901(f) are added to the cost or inventory amount of oil or gas.

Sec. 1.907(c)-2  Section 907(c)(3) items (for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section provides rules relating to certain items listed in section 907(c)(3). The rules of this section

are expressed in terms of FORI but apply for determining FOGEI by substituting ``FOGEI'' for ``FORI'' whenever appropriate. FOGEI does not include interest described in section 907(c)(3)(A). Dividends paid prior to January 1, 1987, and described in section 907(c)(3)(B), as in effect prior to amendment by the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, are included in FORI and not FOGEI.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Dividend--(1) Section 1248 dividend. A section 1248 dividend is a dividend described in section 907(c)(3)(A). Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(1), gain (or loss) from the disposition of stock in any corporation is not FOGEI or FORI. See Sec. 1.907(c)-1(e) (3) and (4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Section 78 dividend. A section 78 dividend is FORI to the extent it arises from a dividend described in section 907(c)(3)(A), or an amount described in section 907(c)(3)(C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Taxes deemed paid--(1) Voting stock test. Items described in section 907(c)(3) (A) or (C) are FORI only if a deemed-paid-tax test is met under the criteria of section 902 or 960. The purpose of this test is to require minimum direct or indirect ownership by a domestic corporation in the voting stock of a foreign corporation as a prerequisite for the item to qualify as FORI in the hands of the domestic corporation. The test is whether a domestic corporation would be deemed to pay any taxes of a foreign corporation when a dividend or an amount described in section 907(c)(3) (A) or (C), respectively, is included in the domestic corporation's gross income. In the case of interest described in section 907(c)(3)(A), the test is whether any taxes would be deemed paid if there were a hypothetical dividend.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Dividends and interest. For purposes of section 907(c)(3)(A), a domestic corporation is deemed under section 902 to pay taxes in respect of dividends and interest received from a foreign corporation whether or not the foreign corporation:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Actually pays or is deemed to pay taxes, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of interest, actually pays dividends.

This paragraph (c)(2) also applies to dividends received by a foreign corporation from a second-tier or third-tier foreign corporation (as defined in Sec. 1.902-1(a) (3)(i) and (4), respectively). In the case of interest received by a foreign corporation from another foreign corporation, this paragraph (c)(2) applies if the taxes of both foreign corporations would be deemed paid under section 902 (a) or (b) for purposes of applying section 902(a) to the same taxpayer which is a domestic corporation. In the case of interest received by any corporation (whether foreign or domestic), all members of an affiliated group filing a consolidated return will be treated as the same taxpayer under section 907(c)(3)(A) if the foreign taxes of the payor and (if the recipient is a foreign corporation) the foreign taxes of the recipient would be deemed paid under section 902 by at least one member. The term ``member'' is defined in Sec. 1.1502-1(b). Thus, for example, assume that P owns all of the stock of D1 and D2 and P. D1, and D2 are members of an affiliated group filing a consolidated return. Assume further that D1 owns all of the stock of F1 and D2 owns all of the stock of F2, where F1 and F2 are foreign corporations. Interest paid by F1 to P, D2, or F2 may be FORI.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Amounts included under section 951(a). For purposes of section 907(c)(3)(C), a domestic corporation is deemed under section 960 to pay taxes in respect of a foreign corporation, whether or not the foreign corporation actually pays taxes on the amounts included in gross income under section 951(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Amount attributable to certain items--(1) Certain dividends--(i) General rule. The portion of a dividend described in section 907(c)(3)(A) that is FORI equals--
Amount of dividend x a/b
a = FORI accumulated profits in excess of FORI taxes paid or accrued,</p><p class="depth0">andb = Total accumulated profits in excess of total foreign taxes paid or</p><p class="depth0">accrued.

This paragraph (d)(1)(i) applies even though the FORI accumulated profits arose in a taxable year of a foreign corporation beginning before January 1, 1983. Determination of the FORI amount of dividends under this paragraph (d)(1)(i) must be made separately for FORI accumulated profits and total

accumulated profits that arose in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987, and for FORI accumulated profits and total accumulated profits that arose in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986. Dividends are deemed to be paid first out of FORI and total accumulated profits that arose in table years beginning after December 31, 1986. With regard to FORI accumulated profits and total accumulated profits that arose in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, the portion of a dividend that is FORI equals--
Amount of dividend x a/b
a = Post-1986 undistributed FORI earnings determined under the</p><p class="depth0">principles of section 902(c)(1), andb = Post-1986 undistributed earnings determined under the principles of</p><p class="depth0">section 902(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Cross-references. See Sec. 1.902-1(g) for the determination of a foreign corporation's earnings and profits and of those out of which a dividend is paid. See Sec. 1.1248-2 or 1.1248-3 for the determination of the earnings and profits attributable to the sale or exchange of stock in certain foreign corporations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interest received from certain foreign corporations. Interest described in section 907(c)(3)(A) is FORI to the extent the corresponding interest expense of the paying corporation is properly allocable and apportionable to the gross income of the paying corporation that would be FORI were that corporation a domestic corporation. This allocation and apportionment is made in a manner consistent with the rules of section 954(b)(5) and Sec. 1.861-8(e)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Dividends from domestic corporation. The amount of a dividend from a corporation described in section 907(c)(3)(B), as in effect prior to amendment by the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, paid in a taxable year of that corporation beginning before December 31, 1986, that is FORI is determined under the principles of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section with respect to its current earnings and profits under section 316(a)(2) or its accumulated earnings and profits under section 316(a)(1), as the case may be.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Amounts with respect to which taxes are deemed paid under section 906(a)--(i) Portion attributable to FORI. The portion of an amount described in section 907(c)(3)(C) that is FORI equals:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC07OC91.045
A = Amount described in section 907(c)(3)(C)B = FORI earnings and profitsC = Total earnings and profits

For taxable years ending after January 23, 1989, the facts and circumstances will be used to determined what part of the amount of the section 907(c)(3)(C) amount is directly attributable to FOGEI, FORI and other income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Earnings and profits. Total earnings and profits are those of the foreign corporation for a taxable year under section 964 and the regulations under that section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Section 78 dividend. The portion of a section 78 dividend that will be considered FORI will equal the amount of taxes deemed paid under either section 902(a) or section 960(a)(1) with respect to the dividend to the extent the taxes deemed paid are FORI taxes under Sec. 1.907(c)-3 (b) or (c). See Sec. 1.907(c)-3(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Special rule.

In a taxable year in which a foreign corporation described in section 907(c)(3)(A) pays a dividend or has income that is subject to inclusion under section 951, if the foreign corporation has positive post--1986 undistributed earnings in a separate category but within that separate category there is a deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings attributable to earnings other than FOGEI and FORI, that deficit shall be allocated ratably between the FOGEI and FORI post-1986

undistributed earnings within that separate category. Any deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings attributable to either FOGEI or FORI shall be allocated first to FOGEI or FORI post-1986 undistributed earnings (as the case may be) to the extent thereof. Post-1986 undistributed FORI earnings are the post-1986 undistributed earnings (as defined in section 902 and the regulations under that section) attributable to FORI as defined in section 907(c) (2) and (3). Post-1986 undistributed FOGEI earnings are the post-1986 undistributed earnings (as defined in section 902 and the regulations under that section) attributable to FOGEI as defined in section 907(c) (1) and (3).</p><p class="depth0">Example. Foreign corporation X for years 1987 and 1988 had the following undistributed earnings (none of which is income that is subject to inclusion under section 951) and foreign taxes:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Earnings   Taxes------------------------------------------------------------------------FOGEI.................................................     $800     $400FORI..................................................

On December 31, 1988, X paid a dividend of all of its post-1986 undistributed earnings to its sole shareholder Y. Under paragraph (d)(5) and (7)(i) of this section and Sec. 1.907 (c)-2 (d)(5), $450 of Y's dividend is attributable to FOGEI ($50 from undistributed earnings plus a $400 section 78 dividend) and $950 is attributable to other earnings ($700 from undistributed earnings plus a $250 section 78 dividend).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Deficits allocated among separate categories. If a deficit in a separate category (``first separate category'') is allocated to another separate category (``second separate category'') under sections 902 and 960 pursuant to notice 88-71, 1988-2 CB 374 and the regulations under those sections, the following rules shall apply. Any deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings attributable to either FOGEI (or FORI) from the first separate category shall be allocated to post-1986 undistributed earnings in the second separate category to the extent thereof in the following order:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> FOGEI (or FORI),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> FORI (or FOGEI), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Other income.

Any deficit in post-1986 undistributed earnings attributable to other income from the first separate category shall be allocated first to other post-1986 undistributed earnings and then ratably to FOGEI and FORI post--1986 undistributed earnings in the second separate category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Pre-1987 deficits. The amount of a dividend paid by a foreign corporation described in section 907(c)(3)(A) out of positive pre-1987 earnings that is attributable to FOGEI and FORI shall be determined in a manner similar to that used in paragraph (d)(7) (i) and (ii) of this section except that the determinations shall be made on an annual basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Illustrations. The application of this paragraph (d) is illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. X, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of Y, a foreign corporation organized in country S. Y owns all of the stock of Z, a foreign corporation also organized in country S. Each corporation uses the calendar year as its taxable year. In 1983, Z has $150 of FOGEI earnings and profits and $250 of earnings and profits other than FOGEI or FORI. Assume that Z paid no taxes to S and X must include $100 in its gross income under section 951(a) with respect to Z. Under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, $37.50 of the amount described in section 951(a) is FOGEI ($100 x $150/$400). the remaining $62.50 of the section 951(a) amount represents other income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that the taxable year in question is 1988. In addition, under the facts and circumstances, it is determined that of the $100 section 951(a) amount included in X's gross income, $30 is directly attributable to Z's FOGEI activity, $60 is directly attributable to Z's FORI activity and $10 is directly attributable to Z's other activity. Accordingly, under paragraph (d)(4)(i), $30 will be FOGEI and $60 will be FORI to X.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. (i) Assume the same facts as in Example 1. Assume further that, in 1983, Z distributes its entire earnings and profits ($400) to Y which consists of a dividend of $300 and a section 959(a)(1) distribution of $100. Y has no other earnings and profits during 1983. Assume that the dividend and distribution are not foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c). Y pays no taxes to S. In 1983, Y distributes its entire earnings and profits to X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraphs (c)(2) and (d)(1)(i) of this section, Y has FOGEI of $112.50, i.e., the amount of the dividend received by Y ($300) multiplied by the fraction described in paragraph (d)(1)(i). The numerator of the fraction is Z's FOGEI accumulated profits in excess

of the FOGEI taxes paid ($112.50) and the denominator is Z's total accumulated profits in excess of total foreign taxes paid ($400) minus the amount excluded from Y's gross income under section 959(a)(1) ($100). The rule of paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of this section does not apply since X does not include any amount in its gross income under section 951(a) with respect to Y. If Y paid taxes to S, this paragraph (d) would apply to characterize those taxes as FOGEI taxes or other taxes.

The numerator of the fraction is $112.50, i.e., the FOGEI accumulated profits of Y in excess of FOGEI taxes paid ($150) minus the FOGEI accumulated profits of Y in excess of FOGEI taxes paid excluded from X's gross income under section 959(a)(1) ($37.50).

Assume the same facts as in Example 1 with the following modifications: In 1983, Z's only earnings and profits are FORI earnings and profits which are included in X's gross income under section 951(a). Z distributes its entire earnings and profits to Y. In 1983, Y has total earnings and profits of $100 without regard to the dividend from Z, $60 of which are FORI earnings and profits. Y also has $40 which is included in X's gross income under section 951(a). Under paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of this section, the dividend from Z is disregarded for purposes of applying paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section to the $40 included in X's gross income under section 951(a) with respect to Y. Accordingly, $24 of the amount described in section 951(a) is FORI ($40 x $60/$100).

For taxable years beginning after 1986, the principles of Sec. 1.904-5 (h) and (i) shall be applied to determine whether (and to what extent) a person's distributive share is FORI and FOGEI. Thus, for example, a less-than-10 percent corporate partner's share of income of the partnership would generally be treated as passive income to the partner, and not as FORI or FOGEI, unless an exception under Sec. 1.904-5 (h) and (i) applies.

Sec. 1.907(c)-3  FOGEI and FORI taxes (for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Tax characterization, allocation and apportionment--(1) Scope. Paragraphs (a) (2) through (6) of this section provides rules for the characterization, allocation, and apportionment of the income taxes (other than withholding taxes) paid or accrued to a foreign country among FOGEI, FORI, and other income relevant for purposes of sections 907 and 904. Some of the rules in this section are expressed in terms of FOGEI taxes but they apply to FORI taxes by substituting ``FORI taxes'' for ``FOGEI taxes'' whenever appropriate. For the treatment of withholding taxes, see paragraph (a)(8) of this section. FOGEI taxes are determined without any reduction under section 907(a). In addition, determination of FOGEI taxes will not be affected by recharacterization of FOGEI by section 907(c)(4). See Sec. 1.907(c)-1(c)(5). Foreign taxes will not be characterized as creditable FORI taxes if section 907(b) and Sec. 1.907(b)-1 apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Three classes of income. There are three classes of income: FOGEI, FORI, and other income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> More than one class in a foreign tax base. If more than one class of income is taxed under one tax base under the law of a foreign country, the amount of pre-credit foreign tax for each base must be determined. This amount is the foreign taxes paid or accrued to that country for the base as increased

by the tax credits (if any) which reduced those taxes and were allowed in the country for that tax. More than one class of income is taxed under the same base, if, under a foreign country's law, deductions from one class of income may reduce the income of any other class and the classes are subject to foreign tax at the same rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Allocation of tax within a base. If more than one class of income is taxed under the same base under a foreign country's law, the pre-credit foreign tax for the base is apportioned to each class of income in proportion to the income of each class. Tax credits are than allocated (under paragraph (a)(6) of this section) to the apportioned pre-credit tax. Income of a class over the deductions allowed under foreign law for, and which are attributable to, that class.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Modified gross income. Modified gross income is not necessarily the same as gross income as defined for purposes of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code. Modified gross income is determined with reference to the foreign tax base for gross income (or its equivalent). However, the characterization of the base as a particular class of income is governed by general principles of U.S. tax law. Thus, for example--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Gross income from extraction is the fair market value of oil or gas in the immediate vicinity of the well (as determined under Sec. 1.907(c)-1(b)(6) (without any deductions)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Whether cost of goods sold (or any other deduction) is a deduction from modified gross income and the amount of such a deduction is determined under foreign law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Modified gross income includes items that are part of the foreign tax base even though they are not gross income under U.S. law so long as the foreign taxes paid on the base constitute creditable taxes under section 901 (including taxes described in section 903). For example, if a foreign country imposes a tax (creditable under section 901) on a tax base that includes in small part a percentage of the value of a company's oil reserves in place, modified gross income from extraction includes such a percentage of value solely for purposes of making the tax allocation in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Modified gross income from extraction is increased for purposes of this paragraph (a)(5) by the entire excess of the posted price over fair market value if the foreign country uses a posted price system or other pricing arrangement described in section 907(d) in imposing its income tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Modified gross income from FORI is that income attributable to the activities in sections 907(c)(2) (A) through (C) and (E).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Modified gross income for any class may not include gross income that is not subject to taxation by the foreign country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Allocation of tax credits. The foreign taxes paid or accrued on a particular class of income equals the precredit tax on the class reduced (but not below zero) by the credits allowed under foreign law against the foreign tax on the particular class. Any tax credit attributable to a class that is not allocated to that class is allocated to the other class in the base or, if there are three classes in the base, is apportioned ratably among the taxes paid or accrued on the other two classes (as reduced in accordance with the preceding sentence).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Withholding taxes. Paragraph (a) (2) through (6) of this section does not apply to withholding taxes imposed by a foreign country. FOGEI taxes may include withholding taxes imposed with respect to a distribution from a corporation. The portion of the total withholding taxes on a distribution that constitutes FOGEI taxes is determined by the portion of the distribution that is FOGEI. In addition, FOGEI taxes may include taxes imposed on a distribution described in section 959(a)(1) or on amounts described in section 959(b). The portion of the total withholding taxes imposed on a distribution described in section 959(a)(1) or on amounts described in section 959(b) is determined by reference to the portion of the amount included in gross income under section 951(a) that was FOGEI.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Dividenss--In general.

Taxes in the fraction in this paragraph (c)(2) include only those foreign taxes that may be deemed paid under section 960(a) by reason of such inclusion. See Sec.

A partner's distributive share of the partnership's FOGEI taxes is determined under the principles of section 704.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Illustrations. The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. X, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of Y, a foreign corporation organized in country S. Y owns all of the stock of Z, a foreign corporation organized in country T. Each corporation used the calendar year as its taxable year. In 1983, X includes in its gross income an amount described in section 951(a) with respect to Z. Assume that the taxes deemed paid under section 902(a) by X by reason of such an inclusion is $70. Assume further that Z paid total taxes of $120, $80 of which is FOGEI tax. Under paragraph (c) of this section, the FOGEI tax deemed paid is $46.67 (i.e., $70 x $80/$120). This $46.67 is also FOGEI under Sec. 1.907(c)-2(d)(5) because it must be included in X's gross income under section 78.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. (i) Assume the same facts as in Example 1. Assume further that in 1983, Z distributes its entire earnings and profits to Y. Y has no earnings and profits during 1983 other than this dividend. Y paid a tax of $50 to S. Assume that Y is deemed under section 902(b)(1) to pay $50 of the tax paid by Z which was not deemed paid by X under section 960(a)(1) in 1983. In 1983, Y distributes its entire earnings and profits to X. Assume that X is deemed under section 902(a) to pay $100 of the taxes actually paid, and deemed paid, by Y.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies to characterize the $50 tax of Z that Y is deemed to pay under section 902(b)(1). Y is deemed to pay $33.33 of FOGEI tax, i.e., the amount of the tax deemed paid by Y ($50) multiplied by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the amount of Z's FOGEI tax ($80) and the denominator is the total taxes paid by Z ($120).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under paragraph (a)(8) of this section, a portion of the $50 tax actually paid by Y on the earnings and profits received from Z is FOGEI tax. The amount of tax actually paid by Y that is FOGEI tax depends on the amount of the distribution from Z that is FOGEI (see Sec. 1.907(c)-2(d)(1) (i) and Example 2 (ii) under Sec. 1.907(c)-2(d)(8)). This result does not depend upon whether a portion of the distribution from Z is described in section 959(b) and it follows even though a portion of Y's earnings and profits will be excluded from X's gross income under section 959(a)(1) when distributed by Y. Assume that $12.50 of the $50 tax actually paid by Y is FOGEI tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, X is deemed to pay $45.83 of FOGEI tax by reason of the distribution from Y. This amount is determined by multiplying the total taxes deemed paid by X by reason of such distribution ($100) by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the FOGEI tax paid, and deemed paid, by Y ($45.83, i.e., $33.33 under paragraph (ii) of this example plus $12.50 under paragraph (iii) of this example). The denominator of the fraction is the total taxes paid, and deemed paid, by Y ($100). This $45.83 is FOGEI under Sec. 1.907(c)-2(d)(5) because it is included in X's gross income as a section 78 dividend.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. (i) X, a domestic corporation, has a concession with foreign country Y that gives it the exclusive right to extract and export the crude oil and natural gas owned by Y. The concession agreement and location of the oil and gas wells mandate that X construct a system of pipelines to transport the minerals that are extracted to a port where they are loaded onto tankers for export. X owns the transportation facilities. Y has an income tax system under which income from mineral operations is subject to a 50 percent tax rate. The taxation by Y of the mineral operations is a separate tax base under paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Under this system, Y imposes the tax at the port prior to export and it establishes a posted price of $12 per barrel. Y also collects royalties of $1.44 per barrel (i.e., 12 percent of this posted price) which is deductible in computing the petroleum tax. Y also allows X deductible lifting costs of $.20 per barrel and deductible transporting costs of $.80 per barrel. Y does not allow any credits against the mineral tax. Assume that X does not have any income in Y other than the mineral income. (In 1983, X extracts, transports, and exports 10,000,000 barrels of crude oil, but for convenience, all computations are in terms of one barrel). X pays foreign taxes of $4.78 per barrel, computed as follows:

Thus, at the port, the excess of posted price ($12) over fair market value ($10) is $2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The $4.78 foreign tax paid to Y is allocated to FOGEI and FORI in accordance with the rules in paragraph (a) (2) through (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, FOGEI and FORI are subject to foreign taxation under one tax base. This foreign tax is allocated between FOGEI tax and FORI tax in accordance with paragraph (a) (4) and (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The modified gross income for FOGEI is $11, i.e., fair market value in the immediate vicinity of the well ($9) plus the excess at the port of posted price over fair market value ($2).

The calculation is as follows:
FOGEI tax = $4.78 x $9.36/$9.56 = $4.68FORI tax = $4.78 x $0.20/$9.56 = $0.10
Thus, for the 10,000,000 barrels, the FOGEI tax is $46,800,000 and the FORI tax is $1,000,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> The allocation under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, rather than the direct application of stated foreign tax rates to foreign-law taxable income in each class of income (which would produce the same results in the facts of this example), is necessary when a foreign country taxes more than one class of income under a progressive rate structure. See Example 4 in this paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Assume the same facts as in Example 3 except that Y's tax is imposed at 40 percent for the first $20,000,000 of income and at 60 percent for all other income.

Assume the same facts as in Example 3. Assume further that X refines the crude oil into primary products prior to export and Y imposes its tax on the basis of crude oil equivalences of $12 per barrel, rather than the value of the primary products, to establish port prices. Assume that this arrangement is a pricing arrangement described in section 907(d). Thus, Y does not tax the refinery income. The results are the same as in Example 3 even if $12 per barrel is equal to, more than, or less than, the value of the primary products at the port. See paragraph (a)(5)(vi) of this section.

X has unused 1983 FOGEI taxes of $600. Since the excess section 907(a) limitation for 1984 is zero, the unused FOGEI taxes are carried to 1985. Of the $600 carryover, $400 is deemed accrued in 1985 and the balance of $200 is carried to following years (but not to a year after 1988). After the carryover from 1983 to 1985, the excess section 904 general limitation for 1985 (line 8(b)) is reduced by $400 to $1,600 to reflect the amount of 1983 FOGEI taxes deemed accrued in 1985 under section 907(f).
