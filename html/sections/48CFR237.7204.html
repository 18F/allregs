In the event of termination, the Government shall have the right, at its option, to continue to receive educational services for those students already enrolled in the contractor's institution under this agreement until such time that the students complete their courses or curricula or the Government withdraws them from the Contractor's institution. The terms and conditions of this agreement in effect on the effective date of the termination shall continue to apply to such students remaining in the Contractor's institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Withdrawal of students under Schedule provision 4 shall not be considered a termination within the meaning of this provision 7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Termination by either party shall not be the basis for any special charge or claim by the Contractor, other than as provided by the Contractor's standard procedures.</p><p class="depth0">General Provisions</p><p class="depth0">Use the following clauses in educational service agreements:</p><p class="depth0">1.
