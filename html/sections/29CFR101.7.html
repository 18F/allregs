                            <p class="depth0">Before any complaint is issued or other formal action taken, the  Regional Director affords an opportunity to all parties for the  submission and consideration of facts, argument, offers of settlement,  or proposals of adjustment, except where time, the nature of the  proceeding, and the public interest do not permit. Normally prehearing   conferences are held, the principal purpose of which is to discuss and  explore such submissions and proposals of adjustment. The Regional  Office provides Board-prepared forms for such settlment agreements, as  well as printed notices for posting by the respondent. These agreements,  which are subject to the approval of the Regional Director, provide for  an appeal to the General Counsel, as described in Sec. 101.6, by a  complainant who will not join in a settlement or adjustment deemed  adequate by the Regional Director. Proof of compliance is obtained by  the Regional Director before the case is closed. If the respondent fails  to perform the obligations under the informal agreement, the Regional  Director may determine to institute formal proceedings.</p>
