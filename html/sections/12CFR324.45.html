                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. (1) An originating FDIC-supervised institution that has obtained a credit risk mitigant to hedge its exposure to a synthetic or traditional securitization that satisfies the operational criteria provided in Sec. 324.41 may recognize the credit risk mitigant under Sec. Sec. 324.36 or 324.37, but only as provided in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An investing FDIC-supervised institution that has obtained a credit risk mitigant to hedge a securitization exposure may recognize the credit risk mitigant under Sec. Sec. 324.36 or 324.37, but only as provided in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Mismatches. An FDIC-supervised institution must make any applicable adjustment to the protection amount of an eligible guarantee or credit derivative as required in Sec. 324.36(d), (e), and (f) for any hedged securitization exposure. In the context of a synthetic

securitization, when an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative covers multiple hedged exposures that have different residual maturities, the FDIC-supervised institution must use the longest residual maturity of any of the hedged exposures as the residual maturity of all hedged exposures.
