                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope of opt-out--(1) In general. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the consumer's election to opt out prohibits any affiliate covered by the opt-out notice from using eligibility information received from another affiliate as described in the notice to make solicitations to the consumer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the consumer's election to opt out prohibits any affiliate covered by the opt-out notice from using eligibility information received from another affiliate as described in the notice to make solicitations to the consumer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Continuing relationship. (i) In general. If the consumer establishes a continuing relationship with you or your affiliate, an opt-out notice may apply to eligibility information obtained in connection with:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. If the consumer establishes a continuing relationship with you or your affiliate, an opt-out notice may apply to eligibility information obtained in connection with:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A single continuing relationship or multiple continuing relationships that the consumer establishes with you or your affiliates, including continuing relationships established subsequent to delivery of the opt-out notice, so long as the notice adequately describes the continuing relationships covered by the opt-out; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Any other transaction between the consumer and you or your affiliates as described in the notice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Examples of continuing relationships. A consumer has a continuing relationship with you or your affiliate if the consumer:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Opens a deposit or investment account with you or your affiliate;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Obtains a loan for which you or your affiliate owns the servicing rights;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Purchases an insurance product from you or your affiliate;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Holds an investment product through you or your affiliate, such as when you act or your affiliate acts as a custodian for securities or for assets in an individual retirement arrangement;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Enters into an agreement or understanding with you or your affiliate whereby you or your affiliate undertakes to arrange or broker a home mortgage loan for the consumer;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Enters into a lease of personal property with you or your affiliate; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Obtains financial, investment, or economic advisory services from you or your affiliate for a fee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No continuing relationship. (i) In general. If there is no continuing relationship between a consumer and you or your affiliate, and you or your affiliate obtain eligibility information about a consumer in connection with a transaction with the consumer, such as an isolated transaction or a credit application that is denied, an opt-out notice provided to the consumer only applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with that transaction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. If there is no continuing relationship between a consumer and you or your affiliate, and you or your affiliate obtain eligibility information about a consumer in connection with a transaction with the consumer, such as an isolated transaction or a credit application that is denied, an opt-out notice provided to the consumer only applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with that transaction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Examples of isolated transactions. An isolated transaction occurs if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The consumer uses your or your affiliate's ATM to withdraw cash from an account at another financial institution; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> You or your affiliate sells the consumer a cashier's check or money order, airline tickets, travel insurance, or traveler's checks in isolated transactions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Menu of alternatives. A consumer may be given the opportunity to choose from a menu of alternatives when electing to prohibit solicitations, such as by electing to prohibit solicitations from certain types of affiliates covered by the opt-out notice but not other types of affiliates covered by the notice, electing to prohibit solicitations based on certain types of eligibility information but not other types of eligibility information, or electing to prohibit solicitations by certain methods of delivery but not other methods of delivery. However, one of the alternatives must allow the consumer to prohibit all solicitations from all of the affiliates that are covered by the notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Special rule for a notice following termination of all continuing relationships--(i) In general. A consumer must be given a new opt-out notice if, after all continuing relationships with you or your affiliate(s) are terminated, the consumer subsequently establishes another continuing relationship with you or your affiliate(s) and the consumer's eligibility information is to be used to make a solicitation. The new opt-out notice must apply, at a minimum, to eligibility information obtained in connection with the new continuing relationship. Consistent with paragraph (b) of this section, the consumer's decision not to opt out after receiving the new opt-out notice would not override a prior opt-out election by the consumer that applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with a terminated relationship, regardless of whether the new opt-out notice applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with the terminated relationship.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. A consumer must be given a new opt-out notice if, after all continuing relationships with you or your affiliate(s) are terminated, the consumer subsequently establishes another continuing relationship with you or your affiliate(s) and the consumer's eligibility information is to be used to make a solicitation. The new opt-out notice must apply, at a minimum, to eligibility information obtained in connection with the new continuing relationship. Consistent with paragraph (b) of this section, the consumer's decision not to opt out after receiving the new opt-out notice would not override a prior opt-out election by the consumer that applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with a terminated relationship, regardless of whether the new opt-out notice applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with the terminated relationship.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Example. A consumer has a checking account with a financial institution that is part of an affiliated group. The consumer closes the checking account. One year after closing the checking account, the consumer opens a savings account with the same financial institution. The consumer must be given a new notice and opportunity to opt out before the financial institution's affiliates may make solicitations to the consumer using eligibility information obtained by the financial institution in connection with the new savings account relationship, regardless of whether the consumer opted out in connection with the checking account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Duration of opt-out. The election of a consumer to opt out must be effective for a period of at least five years (the ``opt-out period'') beginning when the consumer's opt-out election is received and implemented, unless the

consumer subsequently revokes the opt-out in writing or, if the consumer agrees, electronically. An opt-out period of more than five years may be established, including an opt-out period that does not expire unless revoked by the consumer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time of opt-out. A consumer may opt out at any time.</p>
