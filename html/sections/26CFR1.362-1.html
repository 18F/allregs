(See also Sec. 1.362-2.) See Sec. 1.460-4(k)(3)(iv)(B)(2) for rules relating to adjustments to the basis of certain contracts accounted for using a long-term contract method of accounting that are acquired in certain transfers described in section 351 and certain reorganizations described in section 368(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions.
