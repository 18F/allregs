                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This guideline is intended for use in developing data  on the acute toxicity of chemical substances and mixtures  (``chemicals'') subject to environmental effects test regulations under  the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) (Pub. L. 94-469, 90 Stat. 2003,  15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.). This guideline prescribes a test using mysid  shrimp as test organisms to develop data on the acute toxicity of  chemicals. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will  use data from these tests in assessing the hazard of a chemical to the  aquatic environment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. The definitions in section 3 of the Toxic  Substances Control Act (TSCA) and in part 792--Good Laboratory Practice  Standards of this chapter, apply to this test guideline. The following  definitions also apply to this guideline.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ``Death'' means the lack of reaction of a test organism to  gentle prodding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ``Flow-through'' means a continuous or an intermittent passage  of test solution or dilution water through a test chamber or a holding  or acclimation tank, with no recycling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ``LC50'' means that experimentally derived  concentration of test substance that is calculated to kill 50 percent of  a test population during continuous exposure over a specified period of  time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> ``Loading'' means the ratio of test organisms biomass (grams,  wet weight) to the volume (liters) of test solution in a test chamber.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> ``Retention chamber'' means a structure within a flow-through  test chamber which confines the test organisms, facilitating observation  of test organisms and eliminating loss of organisms in outflow water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> ``Static system'' means a test chamber in which the test  solution is not renewed during the period of the test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Test procedures--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Summary of the test. In preparation for the  test, test chambers are filled with appropriate volumes of dilution  water. If a flow-through test is performed, the flow of dilution water  through each chamber is adjusted to the rate desired. The test substance  is introduced into each test chamber. In a flow-through test, the rate  at which the test substance is added is adjusted to establish and  maintain the desired concentration of test substance in each test  chamber. The test is started by randomly introducing mysids acclimated  in accordance with the test design into the test chambers. Mysids in the  test chambers are observed periodically during the test, the dead mysids  removed and the findings recorded. Dissolved oxygen concentration, pH,  temperature, salinity, the concentration of test substance, and other  water quality characteristics are measured at specified intervals in  test chambers. Data collected during the test are used to develop  concentration-response curves and LC50 values for the test  substance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Range-finding test. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A range-finding test should be conducted  to determine:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Which life stage (juvenile or young adult) is to be utilized in  the definitive test.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The test solution concentrations for the definitive test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The mysids should be exposed to a series of widely spaced  concentrations of test substance (e.g., 1, 10, 100 mg/l, etc.), usually  under static conditions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> This test should be conducted with both newly hatched juvenile  (<24 hours old) and young adult (5 to 6 days old) mysids. For each age  class (juvenile or young adult), a minimum of 10 mysids should be  exposed to each concentration of test substance for up to 96 hours. The  exposure period may be shortened if data suitable for the purpose of the  range-finding test can be obtained in less time. The age class which is  most sensitive to the test substance in the range-finding test shall be  utilized in the definitive test. When no apparent difference in  sensitivity of the two life stages is found, juveniles shall be utilized  in the definitive test. No replicates are required, and nominal  concentrations of the chemical are acceptable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Definitive test. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The purpose of the definitive test is to  determine the concentration-response curves and the 48- and 96-hour  LC50 values with the minimum amount of testing beyond the  range-finding test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The definitive test shall be conducted on the mysid life stage  (juveniles or young adults) which is most sensitive to the test  substance being evaluated.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A minimum of 20 mysids per concentration shall be exposed to  five or more concentrations of the chemical chosen in a geometric series  in which the ratio is between 1.5 and 2.0 (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64  mg/l). An equal number of mysids shall be placed in two or more  replicates. If solvents, solubilizing agents or emulsifiers have to be  used, they shall be commonly used carriers and shall not possess a  synergistic or antagonistic effect on the toxicity of the test  substance. The concentration of solvent shall not exceed 0.1 ml/1. The  concentration ranges shall be selected to determine the concentration- response curves and LC50 values at 48 and 96 hours.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Every test shall include controls consisting of the same  dilution water, conditions, procedures, and mysids from the same  population or culture container, except that none of the chemical is  added.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The dissolved oxygen concentration temperature, salinity, and pH  shall be measured at the beginning and end of the test in each chamber.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The test duration is 96 hours. The test is unacceptable if more  than 10 percent of the control organisms die or exhibit abnormal  behavior during the 96 hour test period. Each test chamber should be  checked for dead mysids at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after the beginning  of the test. Concentration-response curves and 24-, 48-, 72- and 96-hour  LC50 values should be determined along with their 95 percent  confidence limits.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> In addition to death, any abnormal behavior or appearance  shall also be reported.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Test organisms shall be impartially distributed among test  chambers in such a manner that test results show no significant bias  from the distributions. In addition, test chambers within the testing  area shall be positioned in a random manner or in a way in which  appropriated statistical analyses can be used to determine the variation  due to placement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> The concentration of the test substance in the chambers should  be measured as often as is feasible during the test. At a minimum,  during static tests the concentration of test substance shall be  measured at each concentration at the beginning and at the end of the  test. During the flow-through test, the concentration of test substance  should be measured at the beginning and end of the test and in at least  one appropriate chamber whenever a malfunction is detected in any part  of the test substance delivery system. Equal aliquots of test solution  may be removed from each replicate chamber and pooled for analysis.  Among replicate test chambers of a treatment concentration, the measured  concentration of the test substance should not vary more than 20  percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Analytical measurements--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Test chemical. Deionized water  should be used in making stock solutions of the test substance. Standard  analytical methods should be used whenever available in performing the  analyses. The analytical method used to measure the amount of test  substance in a sample shall be validated before beginning the test by  appropriate laboratory practices. An analytical method is not acceptable  if likely degradation products of the test substance, such as hydrolysis  and oxidation products, give positive or negative interferences which  cannot be systematically identified and corrected mathematically.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Numerical. The number of dead mysids shall be counted during  each definitive test. Appropriate statistical analyses should provide a  goodness-of-fit determination for the concentration-response curves. A  48- and 96-hour LC50 and corresponding 95 percent interval  shall be calculated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Test conditions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Test species--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Selection. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The mysid  shrimp, Mysidopsis bahia, is the organism specified for these tests.  Either juvenile (<24 hours old) or young adult (5 to 6 days old) mysids  are to be used to start the test.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Mysids to be used in chronic toxicity tests should originate  from laboratory cultures in order to ensure the individuals are of  similar age and experimental history. Mysids used for establishing  laboratory cultures may be purchased commercially or collected from  appropriate natural areas. Because of similarities with other mysids  species, taxonomic verification should be obtained from the commercial  supplier by experienced laboratory personnel or by an outside expert.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Mysids used in a particular test shall be of similar age and be  of normal size and appearance for their age. Mysids shall not be used  for a test if they exhibit abnormal behavior or if they have been used  in a previous test, either in a treatment or in a control group.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Acclimation. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Any change in the temperature and chemistry of  the dilution water used for holding or culturing the test organisms to  those of the test shall be gradual. Within a 24-hour period, changes in  water temperature shall not exceed 1 [deg]C, while salinity changes  shall not exceed 5 percent.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> During acclimation mysids should be maintained in facilities  with background colors and light intensities similar to those of the  testing areas.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Care and handling. Methods for the care and handling of mysids  such as those described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section can be used  during holding, culturing and testing periods.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Feeding. Mysids should be fed during testing. Any food utilized  should support survival, growth and reproduction of the mysids. A  recommended food is live Artemia spp. (48-hour-old nauplii).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Facilities--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Apparatus. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Facilities which may be needed to  perform this test include: (1) flow-through or recirculating tanks for  holding and acclimating mysids; (2) a mechanism for controlling and  maintaining the water temperature during the holding, acclimation and  test periods; (3) apparatus for straining particulate matter, removing  gas bubbles, or aerating the water, as necessary; and (4) an apparatus  for providing a 14-hour light and 10-hour dark photoperiod with a 15 to  30 minute transition period. In addition, for flow-through tests, flow- through chambers and a test substance delivery system are required.  Furthermore, it is recommended that mysids be held in retention chambers  within test chambers to facilitate observations and eliminate loss of  test organisms through outflow water. For static tests, suitable  chambers for exposing test mysids to the test substance are required.  Facilities should be well ventilated and free of fumes and disturbances  that may affect the test organisms.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Test chambers shall be loosely covered to reduce the loss of  test solution or dilution water due to evaporation and to minimize the  entry of dust or other particulates into the solutions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Cleaning. Test substance delivery systems and test chambers  shall be cleaned before each test following standard laboratory  practices.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Construction materials. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Materials and equipment that  contact test solutions should be chosen to minimize   sorption of test chemicals from dilution water and should not contain  substances that can be leached into aqueous solution in quantities that  can affect test results.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For use in the flow-through test, retention chambers utilized  for confinement of test organisms can be constructed with netting  material of appropriate mesh size.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Dilution water. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Natural or artificial seawater is  acceptable as dilution water if mysids will survive and successfully  reproduce in it for the duration of the holding, acclimating and testing  periods without showing signs of stress, such as reduced growth and  fecundity. Mysids shall be cultured and tested in dilution water from  the same origin.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Natural seawater shall be filtered through a filter with a pore  size of <20 microns prior to use in a test.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Artificial seawater can be prepared by adding commercially  available formulations or by adding specific amounts of reagent-grade  chemicals to deionized water. Deionized water with a conductivity less  than 1 [micro]ohm/cm at 12 [deg]C is acceptable for making artificial  seawater. When deionized water is prepared from a ground or surface  water source, conductivity and total organic carbon (or chemical oxygen  demand) shall be measured on each batch.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Test substance delivery system. In flow-through tests,  proportional diluters, metering pumps, or other suitable systems should  be used to deliver test substance to the test chambers. The system used  shall be calibrated before each test. Calibration includes determining  the flow rate through each chamber and the concentration of the test  substance in each chamber. The general operation of the test substance  delivery system should be checked twice daily during a test. The 24-hour  flow through a test chamber shall be equal to at least 5 times the  volume of the test chamber. During a test, the flow rates should not  vary more than 10 percent among test chambers or across time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Test parameters. Environmental parameters of the water contained  in test chambers shall be maintained as specified below:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The test temperature shall be 25 [deg]C. Excursions from the  test temperature shall be not greater than 2  [deg]C.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Dissolved oxygen concentration between 60 and 105 percent  saturation. Aeration, if needed to achieve this level, shall be done  before the addition of the test substance. All treatment and control  chambers shall be given the same aeration treatment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The number of mysids placed in a test solution shall not be so  great as to affect results of the test. Loading shall not exceed 30  mysids per liter for a static test. Loading requirements for the flow- through test will vary depending on the flow rate of dilution water. The  loading shall not cause the dissolved oxygen concentration to fall below  the recommended levels.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Photoperiod of 14 hours light and 10 hours darkness, with a 15  to 30 minute transition period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Salinity of 20 parts per thousand 3  percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Reporting. The sponsor shall submit to the EPA all data  developed during the test that are suggestive or predictive of acute  toxicity and all concomitant toxicologic manifestations. In addition to  the general reporting requirements prescribed in part 792--Good  Laboratory Practice Standards of this chapter, the reporting of test  data shall include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The source of the dilution water, its chemical characteristics  (e.g., salinity, pH, etc.) and a description of any pretreatment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Detailed information about the test organisms, including the  scientific name and method of verification, age, source, history,  abnormal behavior, acclimation procedures and food used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of the test chambers, the depth and volume of  solution in the chamber, the way the test was begun (e.g., conditioning,  test substance additions, etc.), the number of organisms per treatment,  the number of replicates, the loading, the lighting, the test substance  delivery system and the flow rate expressed as volume additions per 24  hours.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The measured concentration of test substance in test chambers at  the times designated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The number and percentage of organisms that died or showed any  other   adverse effects in the control and in each treatment at each observation  period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Concentration-response curves shall be fitted to mortality data  collected at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. A statistical test of goodness- of-fit shall be performed and the results reported.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The 96-hour LC50 and when sufficient data have been  generated, the 24-, 48-, and 72-hour LC50's and the  corresponding 95-percent confidence limits and the methods used to  calculate the values. These calculations shall be made using the average  measured concentration of the test substance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Methods and data records of all chemical analyses of water  quality and test substance concentrations, including method validations  and reagent blanks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The data records of the holding, acclimation and test  temperature and salinity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> References. For additional background information on this test  guideline the following references should be consulted:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, ``Bioassay Procedures for  the Ocean Disposal Permit Program,'' EPA Report No. 600-9-78-010 (Gulf  Breeze, Florida, 1978).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]  [50 FR 39321, Sept. 27, 1985, as amended at 52 FR 19068, May 20, 1987;  52 FR 26150, July 13, 1987]</p>
