                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The provisions of this section apply to the control of air pollutant emissions from tanks for which Sec. 261.1082(b) of this subpart references the use of this section for such air emission control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material shall control air pollutant emissions from each tank subject to this section in accordance with the following requirements as applicable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For a tank that manages hazardous secondary material that meets all of the conditions specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, the remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material shall control air pollutant emissions from the tank in accordance with the Tank Level 1 controls specified in paragraph (c) of this section or the Tank Level 2 controls specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The hazardous secondary material in the tank has a maximum organic vapor pressure which is less than the maximum organic vapor pressure limit for the tank's design capacity category as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For a tank design capacity equal to or greater than 151 m\3\, the maximum organic vapor pressure limit for the tank is 5.2 kPa.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For a tank design capacity equal to or greater than 75 m\3\ but less than 151 m\3\, the maximum organic vapor pressure limit for the tank is 27.6 kPa.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For a tank design capacity less than 75 m\3\, the maximum organic vapor pressure limit for the tank is 76.6 kPa.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The hazardous secondary material in the tank is not heated by the remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material to a temperature that is greater than the temperature at which the maximum organic vapor pressure of the hazardous secondary material is determined for the purpose of complying with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For a tank that manages hazardous secondary material that does not meet all of the conditions specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, the remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material shall control air pollutant emissions from the tank by using Tank Level 2 controls in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section. An example of tanks required to use Tank Level 2 controls is a tank for

which the hazardous secondary material in the tank has a maximum organic vapor pressure that is equal to or greater than the maximum organic vapor pressure limit for the tank's design capacity category as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Remanufacturers or other persons that store or treats the hazardous secondary material controlling air pollutant emissions from a tank using Tank Level 1 controls shall meet the requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats that hazardous secondary material shall determine the maximum organic vapor pressure for a hazardous secondary material to be managed in the tank using Tank Level 1 controls before the first time the hazardous secondary material is placed in the tank. The maximum organic vapor pressure shall be determined using the procedures specified in Sec. 261.1083(c) of this subpart. Thereafter, the remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material shall perform a new determination whenever changes to the hazardous secondary material managed in the tank could potentially cause the maximum organic vapor pressure to increase to a level that is equal to or greater than the maximum organic vapor pressure limit for the tank design capacity category specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, as applicable to the tank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The tank shall be equipped with a fixed roof designed to meet the following specifications:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The fixed roof and its closure devices shall be designed to form a continuous barrier over the entire surface area of the hazardous secondary material in the tank. The fixed roof may be a separate cover installed on the tank (e.g., a removable cover mounted on an open-top tank) or may be an integral part of the tank structural design (e.g., a horizontal cylindrical tank equipped with a hatch).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The fixed roof shall be installed in a manner such that there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open spaces between roof section joints or between the interface of the roof edge and the tank wall.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Each opening in the fixed roof, and any manifold system associated with the fixed roof, shall be either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Equipped with a closure device designed to operate such that when the closure device is secured in the closed position there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open spaces in the closure device or between the perimeter of the opening and the closure device; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Connected by a closed-vent system that is vented to a control device.

Following completion of the activity, the remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material shall promptly secure the closure device in the closed position or reinstall the cover, as applicable, and resume operation of the control device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> During periods of routine inspection, maintenance, or other activities needed for normal operations, and for removal of accumulated sludge or other residues from the bottom of the tank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The fixed roof and its closure devices shall be made of suitable materials that will minimize exposure of the hazardous secondary material to the atmosphere, to the extent practical, and will maintain the integrity of the fixed roof and closure devices throughout their intended service life. Factors to be considered when selecting the materials for and designing the fixed roof and closure devices shall include: organic vapor permeability, the effects of any contact with the hazardous secondary material or its vapors managed in the tank; the effects of outdoor exposure to wind, moisture, and sunlight; and the operating practices used for

the tank on which the fixed roof is installed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Whenever a hazardous secondary material is in the tank, the fixed roof shall be installed with each closure device secured in the closed position except as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Opening of closure devices or removal of the fixed roof is allowed at the following times:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> To provide access to the tank for performing routine inspection, maintenance, or other activities needed for normal operations.

Following completion of the activity, the remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material shall promptly secure the closure device in the closed position or reinstall the cover, as applicable, to the tank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> To remove accumulated sludge or other residues from the bottom of tank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Opening of a spring-loaded pressure-vacuum relief valve, conservation vent, or similar type of pressure relief device which vents to the atmosphere is allowed during normal operations for the purpose of maintaining the tank internal pressure in accordance with the tank design specifications. The device shall be designed to operate with no detectable organic emissions when the device is secured in the closed position. The settings at which the device opens shall be established such that the device remains in the closed position whenever the tank internal pressure is within the internal pressure operating range determined by the remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material based on the tank manufacturer recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of flammable, ignitable, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials. Examples of normal operating conditions that may require these devices to open are during those times when the tank internal pressure exceeds the internal pressure operating range for the tank as a result of loading operations or diurnal ambient temperature fluctuations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Opening of a safety device, as defined in Sec. 261.1081, is allowed at any time conditions require doing so to avoid an unsafe condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material shall inspect the air emission control equipment in accordance with the following requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The fixed roof and its closure devices shall be visually inspected by the remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material to check for defects that could result in air pollutant emissions. Defects include, but are not limited to, visible cracks, holes, or gaps in the roof sections or between the roof and the tank wall; broken, cracked, or otherwise damaged seals or gaskets on closure devices; and broken or missing hatches, access covers, caps, or other closure devices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material shall perform an initial inspection of the fixed roof and its closure devices on or before the date that the tank becomes subject to this section. Thereafter, the remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material shall perform the inspections at least once every year except under the special conditions provided for in paragraph (l) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the event that a defect is detected, the remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material shall repair the defect in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (k) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material shall maintain a record of the inspection in accordance with the requirements specified in Sec. 261.1089(b) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Remanufacturers or other persons that store or treat the hazardous secondary material controlling air pollutant emissions from a tank using Tank
