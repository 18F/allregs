                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Collecting carriers shall establish and maintain a financial  management system to account for PFC's in accordance with the Department  of Transportation's Uniform System of Accounts and Reports (14 CFR part  241). For carriers not subject to 14 CFR part 241, such carriers shall  establish and maintain an accounts payable system to handle PFC revenue  with subaccounts   for each public agency to which such carrier remits PFC revenue.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Collecting carriers must account for PFC revenue separately. PFC  revenue may be commingled with the air carrier's other sources of  revenue except for covered air carriers discussed in paragraph (c) of  this section. PFC revenues held by an air carrier or an agent of the air  carrier after collection are held in trust for the beneficial interest  of the public agency imposing the PFC. Such air carrier or agent holds  neither legal nor equitable interest in the PFC revenues except for any  handling fee or interest collected on unremitted proceeds as authorized  in Sec. 158.53.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A covered air carrier must segregate PFC revenue in a  designated separate PFC account. Regardless of the amount of PFC revenue  in the covered air carrier's account at the time the bankruptcy petition  is filed, the covered air carrier must deposit into the separate PFC  account an amount equal to the average monthly liability for PFCs  collected under this section by such air carrier or any of its agents.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The covered air carrier is required to create one PFC account to  cover all PFC revenue it collects. The designated PFC account is solely  for PFC transactions and the covered air carrier must make all PFC  transactions from that PFC account. The covered air carrier is not  required to create separate PFC accounts for each airport where a PFC is  imposed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The covered air carrier must transfer PFCs from its general  accounts into the separate PFC account in an amount equal to the average  monthly liability for PFCs as the ``PFC reserve.'' The PFC reserve must  equal a one-month average of the sum of the total PFCs collected by the  covered air carrier, net of any credits or handling fees allowed by law,  during the past 12-month period of PFC collections immediately before  entering bankruptcy.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The minimum PFC reserve balance must never fall below the  fixed amount defined in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A covered air carrier may continue to deposit the PFCs it  collects into its general operating accounts combined with ticket sales  revenue. However, at least once every business day, the covered air  carrier must remove all PFC revenue (Daily PFC amount) from those  accounts and transfer it to the new PFC account. An estimate based on  \1/30\ of the PFC reserve balance is permitted in substitution of the  Daily PFC amount.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In the event a covered air carrier ceases operations while still  owing PFC remittances, the PFC reserve fund may be used to make those  remittances. If there is any balance in the PFC reserve fund after all  PFC remittances are made, that balance will be returned to the covered  air carrier's general account.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In the event a covered air carrier emerges from bankruptcy  protection and ceases to be a covered air carrier, any balance remaining  in the PFC reserve fund after any outstanding PFC obligations are met  will be returned to the air carrier's general account.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If the covered air carrier uses an estimate rather than the  daily PFC amount, the covered air carrier shall reconcile the estimated  amount with the actual amount of PFCs collected for the prior month  (Actual Monthly PFCs). This reconciliation must take place no later than  the 20th day of the month (or the next business day if the date is not a  business day). In the event the Actual Monthly PFCs are greater than the  aggregate estimated PFC amount, the covered air carrier will, within one  business day of the reconciliation, deposit the difference into the PFC  account. If the Actual Monthly PFCs are less than the aggregate  estimated PFC amount, the covered air carrier will be entitled to a  credit in the amount of the difference to be applied to the daily PFC  amount due.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The covered air carrier is permitted to recalculate and reset  the PFC reserve and daily PFC amount on each successive anniversary date  of its bankruptcy petition using the methodology described above.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a covered air carrier or its agent fails to segregate PFC  revenue in violation of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the trust fund  status of such revenue shall not be defeated by an inability of any  party to identify and trace   the precise funds in the accounts of the air carrier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A covered air carrier and its agents may not grant to any third  party any security or other interest in PFC revenue.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A covered air carrier that fails to comply with any requirement  of paragraph (c) of this section, or causes an eligible public agency to  spend funds to recover or retain payment of PFC revenue, must compensate  that public agency for those cost incurred to recover the PFCs owed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The provisions of paragraph (b) of this section that allow the  commingling of PFCs with other air carrier revenue do not apply to a  covered air carrier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All collecting air carriers must disclose the existence and  amount of PFC funds regarded as trust funds in their financial  statements.
