                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The arrangement of each steering station, other than in the  steering-gear compartment, must be such that the helmsman is abaft the  wheel. The rim of the wheel must be plainly marked with arrows and  lettering for right and left rudder, or a suitable notice indicating  these directions must be posted directly in the helmsman's line of  sight.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each steering wheel must turn clockwise for ``right rudder'' and  counterclockwise for ``left rudder.'' When the vessel is running ahead,  after clockwise movement of the wheel the vessel's heading must change  to the right.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a lever-type control is provided, it must be installed and  marked so that its movement clearly indicates both the direction of the  rudder's movement and, if followup control is also provided, the amount  of the rudder's movement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Markings in the pilothouse must not interfere with the  helmsman's vision, but must be clearly visible at night.</p><p class="depth2">Note: See Sec. 113.40-10 of this chapter for the arrangement of  rudder-angle indicators at steering stations.</p>
