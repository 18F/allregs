                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applications tendered for filing are dated upon receipt and  then forwarded to the Media Bureau, where an administrative examination  is made to ascertain whether the applications are   complete. Except for applications for minor modifications of facilities  in the non-reserved FM band, as defined in Sec.  73.3573(a)(2), long  form applications subject to the provisions of Sec.  73.5005 found to be  complete or substantially complete are accepted for filing and are given  file numbers. In the case of minor defects as to completeness, a  deficiency letter will be issued and the applicant will be required to  supply the missing or corrective information. Applications that are not  substantially complete will not be considered and will be returned to  the applicant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of minor modifications of facilities in the non- reserved FM band, applications will be placed on public notice if they  meet the following two-tiered minimum filing requirements as initially  filed in first-come/first-serve proceedings:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The application must include:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Applicant's name and address,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Applicant's signature,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Principal community,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Channel or frequency,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Class of station, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Transmitter site coordinates; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The application must not omit more than three of the following  second-tier items:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A list of the other media interests of the applicant and its  principals,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Certification of compliance with the alien ownership provisions  contained in 47 U.S.C. 310(b),</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Tower/antenna heights,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Effective radiated power,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Whether the antenna is directional or omnidirectional, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> An exhibit demonstrating compliance with the contour protection  requirements of 47 CFR 73.215, if applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Applications found not to meet minimum filing requirements will  be returned to the applicant. Applications found to meet minimum filing  requirements, but that contain deficiencies in tender and/or acceptance  information, shall be given an opportunity for corrective amendment  pursuant to 73.3522 of this part. Applications found to be substantially  complete and in accordance with the Commission's core legal and  technical requirements will be accepted for filing. Applications with  uncorrected tender and/or acceptance defects remaining after the  opportunity for corrective amendment will be dismissed with no further  opportunity for amendment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Acceptance of an application for filing merely means that it has  been the subject of a preliminary review by the FCC's administrative  staff as to completeness. Such acceptance will not preclude the  subsequent dismissal of the application if it is found to be patently  not in accordance with the FCC's rules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> At regular intervals, the FCC will issue a Public Notice listing  all long form applications which have been accepted for filing. Pursuant  to Sec. Sec.  73.3571(h), 73.3572, and 73.3573(f), such notice shall  establish a cut-off date for the filing of petitions to deny. With  respect to reserved band FM applications, the Public Notice shall also  establish a cut-off date for the filing of mutually exclusive  applications pursuant to Sec.  73.3573(e). However, no application will  be accepted for filing unless certification of compliance with the local  notice requirements of Sec.  73.3580(h) has been made in the tendered  application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The FCC will specify by Public Notice, pursuant to Sec.   73.5002, a period for filing applications for new stations or for major  modifications in the facilities of an existing station. Except for  reserved band FM stations and TV stations on reserved noncommercial  educational channels, applications for new and major modifications in  facilities will be accepted only during these window filing periods  specified by the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Applications for minor modification of facilities may be  tendered at any time, unless restricted by the FCC. These applications  will be processed on a ``first come/first served'' basis and will be  treated as simultaneously tendered if filed on the same day. Any  applications received after the filing of a lead application will be  grouped according to filing date, and placed in a queue behind the lead  applicant. The FCC will periodically release a Public Notice listing  those minor modification of facilities applications accepted for filing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If a non-reserved band FM channel allotment becomes vacant,  after the   grant of a construction permit becomes final, because of a lapsed  construction permit or for any other reason, the FCC will, by Public  Notice, announce a subsequent filing window for the acceptance of new  applications for such channels.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Applications for operation in the 1605-1705 kHz band will be  accepted only if filed pursuant to the terms of Sec.  73.30(b).
