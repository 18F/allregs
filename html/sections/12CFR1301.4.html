                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Subject to the application of the FOIA exemptions and exclusions (5 U.S.C. 552(b) and (c)), the Council shall, in conformance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2), make available for public inspection and copying, or, in the alternative, promptly publish and offer for sale:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, and orders, made in the adjudication of cases;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Those statements of policy and interpretations which have been adopted by the Council but which are not published in the Federal Register;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Its administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Copies of all records, regardless of form or format, which have been released previously to any person under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3) and Sec. Sec. 1301.5 through 1301.12, and which the Council determines have become or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records. When the Council receives three (3) or more requests for substantially the same records, then the Council shall place those requests in front of any existing processing backlog and make the released records available in the Council's public reading room and in the electronic reading room on the Council's Web site.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A general index of the records referred to in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Information made available online. For records required to be made available for public inspection and copying pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) and paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section, the Council shall make such records available on its Web site as soon as practicable but in any case no later than one year after such records are created.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Redaction. Based upon applicable exemptions in 5 U.S.C. 552(b), the Council may redact certain information contained in any matter described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section before making such information available for inspection or publishing it. The justification for the redaction shall be explained in writing, and the extent of such redaction shall be indicated on the portion of the record which is made available or published, unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) under which the redaction is made. If technically feasible, the extent of the redaction shall be indicated at the place in the record where the redaction was made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Public reading room. The Council shall make available for public inspection and copying, in a reading room or otherwise, the material described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section. Fees for duplication shall be charged in accordance with Sec. 1301.12. The location of the Council's reading room is the Department of the Treasury's Library. The Library is located in the Main Treasury Building, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20220. For building security purposes, visitors are required to make an appointment by calling (202) 622-0990.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Indices. (1) The Council shall maintain and make available for public inspection and copying current indices identifying any material described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section. In addition, the Council shall promptly publish, quarterly or more frequently, and distribute (by sale or otherwise) copies of each index or supplement unless the Council determines by order published in the Federal Register that the publication would be unnecessary and impractical, in which case the Council shall nonetheless provide copies of the index on request at a cost not to exceed the direct cost of duplication.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Council shall maintain and make available for public inspection and copying current indices identifying any material described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.
