                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Commission may, upon application by any interested person or  upon its own initiative, grant exemptions from the requirements of the  regulations of this part, which are--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Authorized by law, will not present an undue risk to the public  health and safety, and are consistent with the common defense and  security.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Commission will not consider granting an exemption unless  special circumstances are present. Special circumstances are present  whenever--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Application of the regulation in the particular circumstances  conflicts with other rules or requirements of the Commission; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Application of the regulation in the particular circumstances  would not serve the underlying purpose of the rule or is not necessary  to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Compliance would result in undue hardship or other costs that  are significantly in excess of those contemplated when the regulation  was adopted, or that are significantly in excess of those incurred by  others similarly situated; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The exemption would result in benefit to the public health and  safety that compensates for any decrease in safety that may result from  the grant of the exemption; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The exemption would provide only temporary relief from the  applicable regulation and the licensee or applicant has made good faith  efforts to comply with the regulation; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> There is present any other material circumstance not considered  when the regulation was adopted for which it would be in the public  interest to grant an exemption. If such condition is relied on  exclusively for satisfying paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the  exemption may not be granted until the Executive Director for Operations  has consulted with the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any person may request an exemption permitting the conduct of  activities prior to the issuance of a construction permit prohibited by  Sec. 50.10. The Commission may grant such an exemption upon considering  and balancing the following factors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether conduct of the proposed activities will give rise to a  significant adverse impact on the environment and the nature and extent  of such impact, if any;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether redress of any adverse environment impact from conduct  of the proposed activities can reasonably be effected should such  redress be necessary;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether conduct of the proposed activities would foreclose  subsequent adoption of alternatives; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The effect of delay in conducting such activities on the public  interest, including the power needs to be used by the proposed facility,  the availability of alternative sources, if any, to meet those needs on  a timely basis and delay costs to the applicant and to consumers.  Issuance of such an exemption shall not be deemed to constitute a  commitment to issue a construction permit. During the period of any  exemption granted pursuant to this paragraph (b),   any activities conducted shall be carried out in such a manner as will  minimize or reduce their environmental impact.
