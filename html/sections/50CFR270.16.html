Funds eligible to be collected or received by a Council must be limited to those authorized under the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Pending disbursement, under an approved marketing plan and budget, funds collected through assessments authorized by the Act must be deposited in any interest-bearing account or certificate of deposit of a bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System, or in obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Council may, however, pending disbursement of these funds, invest in risk-free, short-term, interest-bearing instruments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Risk-free. All investments must be insured or fully collateralized with Federal Government securities. In the absence of collateral, accounts established at financial institutions should, in aggregate, total less than $100,000 to assure both principal and interest are federally insured in full.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Short-term. Generally, all investments should be for a relatively short time period (one year or less) to assure that the principal is maintained and readily convertible to cash.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Collateralization.
