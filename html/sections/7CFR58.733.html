A representative sample of cheese used in the manufacture of pasteurized process cheese products shall have been tested prior to usage to determine its moisture and fat content.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pasteurized process cheese products. As many samples shall be taken of the finished product direct from the cooker, hopper, filler, or other location as is necessary to assure compliance with composition requirements. Spot checks should be made on samples from the cooker as frequently as is necessary to indicate pasteurization by means of the phosphatase test, as well as any other tests necessary to assure good quality control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Examination of physical characteristics. As many samples shall be taken as is necessary to assure meeting the required physical characteristics of the products. Representative samples shall be taken from production for examination of physical characteristics. The samples shall be examined at approximately 70 F. the first day of operation after the date of processing for the following characteristics: (1) Finish and appearance, (2) flavor, (3) color, (4) body and texture, and (5) slicing or spreading properties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Keeping quality. During processing or preferably from the cooled stock select sufficient samples at random from the production run. The samples should be stored at approximately 50 F. for 3 months for evaluation of physical characteristics as in paragraph (b) of this section. Additional samples may be selected and held at different temperatures or time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Weight control. During the filling operation as many samples shall be randomly selected and weighed from each production run as is necessary to assure accuracy of the net weight established for the finished products.</p><p class="depth2">Requirements for Processed Cheese Products Bearing USDA Official</p><p class="depth2">Identification</p>
