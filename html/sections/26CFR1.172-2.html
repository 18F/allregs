                                Sec. 1.172-2  Net operating loss in case of a corporation.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Modification of deductions. A net operating loss is sustained by  a corporation in any taxable year if and to the extent that, for such  year, there is an excess of deductions allowed by chapter 1 of the Code  over gross income computed thereunder. In determining the excess of  deductions over gross income for such purpose--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Items not deductible. No deduction shall be allowed under--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Section 172 for the net operating loss deduction, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Section 922 in respect of Western Hemisphere trade  corporations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Dividends received. The 85-percent limitation provided by  section 246(b) shall not apply to the deductions otherwise allowed  under--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Section 243(a) in respect of dividends received from domestic  corporations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Section 244 in respect of dividends received on preferred stock  of public utilities, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Section 245 in respect of dividends received from foreign  corporations; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Dividends paid. The deduction granted by section 247 in respect  of dividends paid on the preferred stock of public utilities shall be  computed without regard to subsection (a)(1)(B) of Section 247.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of  paragraph (a):</p><p class="depth2">Example. For the calendar year 1981, the X corporation has a gross  income of $400,000 and total deductions allowed by chapter 1 of the Code  of $375,000 exclusive of any net operating loss deduction and exclusive  of any deduction for dividends received or paid. Corporation X in 1981  received $100,000 of dividends entitled to the benefits of section  243(a). These dividends are included in Corporation X's $400,000 gross  income. Corporation X has no other deductions to which section 172(d)  applies. On the basis of these facts, Corporation X has a net operating  loss for the year 1981 of $60,000, computed as follows:  Deductions for 1981..........................................   $375,000 Plus: Deduction for dividends received, computed without          85,000</p><p class="depth2">regard to the limitation provided in section 246(b) (85% of</p><p class="depth2">$100,000)...................................................</p><p class="depth2">----------</p><p class="depth2">Total..................................................    460,000 Less: Gross income for 1981 (including $100,000 dividends)...    400,000</p><p class="depth2">----------</p><p class="depth2">Net operating loss for 1981............................     60,000</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Qualified real estate investment trusts. For taxable years  ending after October 4, 1976, the net operating loss of a qualified real  estate investment trust (as defined in Sec. 1.172-10(b)) is computed by  taking into account the adjustments described in section 857(b)(2)  (other than the deduction for dividends paid, as defined in section  561), as well as the modifications required by paragraph (a)(1) of this  section. Thus, for example, the special deductions for dividends  received, etc., provided in part VIII of subchapter B (other than  section 248), as well as the net operating loss deduction under section  172, are not allowed in computing the net operating loss of a qualified  real estate investment trust.
