                            <p class="depth0">ICDBG funds may be used for the following activities:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Acquisition. Acquisition in whole or in part by the grantee, or  other public or private nonprofit entity, by purchase, long-term lease,  donation, or otherwise, of real property (including air rights, water  rights, rights-of-way, easements, and other interests therein) for any  public purpose, subject to the limitations of Sec. 1003.207.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disposition. Disposition, through sale, lease, donation, or  otherwise, of any real property acquired with ICDBG funds or its  retention for public purposes, including reasonable costs of temporarily  managing such property or property acquired under urban renewal,  provided that the proceeds from any such disposition shall be program  income subject to the requirements set forth in Sec. 1003.503.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(3)</em> of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Special policies governing facilities. The following special  policies apply to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Facilities containing both eligible and ineligible uses. A  public facility otherwise eligible for assistance under the ICDBG  program may be provided with ICDBG funds even if it is part of a  multiple use building containing ineligible uses, if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The facility which is otherwise eligible and proposed for  assistance will occupy a designated and discrete area within the larger  facility; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The grantee can determine the costs attributable to the facility  proposed for assistance as separate and distinct from the overall costs  of the multiple-use building and/or facility. Allowable costs are  limited to those attributable to the eligible portion of the building or  facility.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Equipment purchase. As stated in Sec. 1003.207(b)(1), the  purchase of equipment with ICDBG funds is generally ineligible. However,  the purchase of construction equipment for use as part of a solid waste  facility is eligible. In addition, the purchase of fire protection  equipment is considered to be an integral part of a public facility,  and, therefore, the purchase of such equipment is also eligible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fees for use of facilities. Reasonable fees may be charged for  the use of the facilities assisted with ICDBG funds, but charges such as  excessive membership fees, which will have the effect of precluding low  and moderate income persons from using the facilities, are not  permitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Special assessments under the ICDBG program. The following  policies relate to special assessments under the ICDBG program:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Definition of special assessment. The term special assessment  means the recovery of the capital costs of a public improvement, such as  streets, water or sewer lines, curbs, and gutters, through a fee or  charge levied or filed as a lien against a parcel of real estate as a  direct result of benefit derived from the installation of a public  improvement, or a one-time charge made as a condition of access to a  public improvement. This term does not relate to taxes, or the  establishment of the value of real estate for the purpose of levying  real estate, property, or ad valorem taxes, and does not include  periodic charges based on the use of a public improvement, such as water  or sewer user charges, even if such charges include the recovery of all  or some portion of the capital costs of the public improvement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Special assessments to recover capital costs. Where ICDBG funds  are used to pay all or part of the cost of a public improvement, special  assessments may be imposed as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Special assessments to recover the ICDBG funds may be made only  against properties owned and occupied by persons not of low and moderate  income. Such assessments constitute program income.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Special assessments to recover the non-ICDBG portion may be made  provided that ICDBG funds are used to pay the special assessment on  behalf of all properties owned and occupied by low and moderate income  persons; except that ICDBG funds need not be used to pay the special  assessments on behalf of properties owned and occupied by moderate  income persons if the   grantee certifies that it does not have sufficient ICDBG funds to pay  the assessments in behalf of all of the low and moderate income owner- occupant persons. Funds collected through such special assessments are  not program income.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Public improvements not initially assisted with ICDBG funds.  The payment of special assessments with ICDBG funds constitutes ICDBG  assistance to the public improvement. Therefore, ICDBG funds may be used  to pay special assessments provided:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The installation of the public improvements was carried out in  compliance with requirements applicable to activities assisted under  this part including environmental and citizen participation  requirements; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The installation of the public improvement meets a criterion for  the primary objective in Sec. 1003.208; and,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The requirements of Sec. 1003.201(c)(3)(ii))(B) are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Clearance activities. Clearance, demolition, and removal of  buildings and improvements, including movement of structures to other  sites. Demolition of HUD-assisted housing units may be undertaken only  with the prior approval of HUD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Public services. Provision of public services (including labor,  supplies, materials, and the purchase of personal property and  furnishings) which are directed toward improving the community's public  services and facilities, including but not limited to those concerned  with employment, crime prevention, child care, health, drug abuse,  education, fair housing counseling, energy conservation, welfare (but  excluding the provision of income payments identified under Sec.  1003.207(b)(4)), homebuyer downpayment assistance or recreational needs.  To be eligible for ICDBG assistance, a public service must be either a  new service, or a quantifiable increase in the level of an existing  service above that which has been provided by or on behalf of the  grantee through funds raised by the grantee, or received by the grantee  from the Federal government in the twelve calendar months before the  submission of the application for ICDBG assistance. (An exception to  this requirement may be made if HUD determines that any decrease in the  level of a service was the result of events not within the control of  the grantee.) The amount of ICDBG funds used for public services shall  not exceed 15 percent of the grant. Such projects must therefore be  submitted with one or more other projects, which must comprise at least  85 percent of the total requested ICDBG grant amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Interim assistance. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The following activities may be  undertaken on an interim basis in areas exhibiting objectively  determinable signs of physical deterioration where the grantee has  determined that immediate action is necessary to arrest the  deterioration and that permanent improvements will be carried out as  soon as practicable:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The repairing of streets, sidewalks, parks, playgrounds,  publicly owned utilities, and public buildings; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The execution of special garbage, trash, and debris removal,  including neighborhood cleanup campaigns, but not the regular curbside  collection of garbage or trash in an area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In order to alleviate emergency conditions threatening the  public health and safety in areas where the chief executive officer of  the grantee determines that such an emergency condition exists and  requires immediate resolution, ICDBG funds may be used for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The activities specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section,  except for the repair of parks and playgrounds;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The clearance of streets, including snow removal and similar  activities; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The improvement of private properties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All activities authorized under paragraph (f)(2) of this section  are limited to the extent necessary to alleviate emergency conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Payment of non-Federal share. Payment of the non-Federal share  required in connection with a Federal grant-in-aid program undertaken as  part of ICDBG activities, provided, that such payment shall be limited  to activities otherwise eligible and in compliance with applicable  requirements under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Relocation. Relocation payments and other assistance for  permanently   and temporarily relocated individuals families, businesses, nonprofit  organizations, and farm operations where the assistance is:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Required under the provisions of Sec. 1003.602 (b) or (c); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determined by the grantee to be appropriate under the provisions  of Sec. 1003.602(d).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Loss of rental income. Payments to housing owners for losses of  rental income incurred in holding, for temporary periods, housing units  to be used for the relocation of individuals and families displaced by  program activities assisted under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Housing services.

ICDBG funds may be used to acquire,  construct, reconstruct, rehabilitate, or install the distribution lines  and facilities of privately owned utilities, including the placing  underground of new or existing distribution facilities and lines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> The provision of assistance to facilitate economic development.  </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The provision of assistance either through the grantee directly or  through public and private organizations, agencies, and other  subrecipients (including nonprofit and for-profit subrecipients) to  facilitate economic development by:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Providing credit, including, but not limited to, grants, loans,  loan guarantees, and other forms of financial support, for the  establishment, stabilization, and expansion of microenterprises;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Providing technical assistance, advice, and business support  services to owners of microenterprises and persons developing  microenterprises; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Providing general support, including, but not limited to, peer  support programs, counseling, child care, transportation, and other  similar services, to owners of microenterprises and persons developing  microenterprises.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Services provided under paragraph (l)(1) of this section shall  not be subject to the restrictions on public services contained in Sec.  1003.201(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (l), persons developing  microenterprises means such persons who have expressed interest and who  are, or after an initial screening process are expected to be, actively  working toward developing businesses, each of which is expected to be a  microenterprise at the time it is formed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Technical assistance. Provision of technical assistance to  public or nonprofit entities to increase the capacity of such entities  to carry out eligible neighborhood revitalization or economic  development activities. Capacity building for private or public entities  (including grantees) for other purposes may be eligible as a planning  cost under Sec. 1003.205.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Assistance to institutions of higher education. Provision of  assistance by the grantee to institutions of higher education where the  grantee determines that such an institution has demonstrated a capacity  to carry out eligible activities under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Homeownership assistance. ICDBG funds may be used to provide  direct homeownership assistance to low- and moderate-income households  to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Subsidize interest rates and mortgage principal amounts for low- and moderate-income homebuyers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Finance the acquisition by low-and moderate-income homebuyers of  housing that is occupied by the homebuyers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Acquire guarantees for mortgage financing obtained by low-and  moderate-income homebuyers form private lenders (except that ICDBG funds  may not be used to guarantee such mortgage financing directly, and  grantees may not provide such guarantees directly);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Provide up to 50 percent of any downpayment required from a low- and moderate-income homebuyer; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Pay reasonable closing costs (normally associated with the  purchase of a home) incurred by a low-or moderate-income homebuyer.</p>
