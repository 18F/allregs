                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Housing plan requirement. If the Director determines that a Bank  has failed to meet any housing goal and that the achievement of the  housing goal was feasible, the Director may require the Bank to submit a  housing plan for approval by the Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nature of plan. If the Director requires a housing plan, the  housing plan shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be feasible;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be sufficiently specific to enable the Director to monitor  compliance periodically;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Describe the specific actions that the Bank will take to achieve  the housing goal for the next calendar year; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Address any additional matters relevant to the plan as required,  in writing, by the Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Deadline for submission. The Bank shall submit the housing plan  to the Director within 45 days after issuance of a notice requiring the  Bank to submit a housing plan. The Director may extend the deadline for  submission of a plan, in writing and for a time certain, to the extent  the Director determines an extension is necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Review of housing plan. The Director shall review and approve or  disapprove a housing plan as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Approval. The Director shall review each submission by a Bank,  including a housing plan submitted under this section and, not later  than 30 days after submission, approve or disapprove the plan or other  action. The Director may extend the period for approval or disapproval  for a single additional 30-day period if the Director determines it  necessary. The Director shall approve any plan that the Director  determines is likely to succeed, and conforms with the Bank Act, this  part, and any other applicable provision of law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notice of approval and disapproval. The Director shall provide  written notice to a Bank submitting a housing plan of the approval or  disapproval of the plan, which shall include the reasons for any  disapproval of the plan, and of any extension of the period for approval  or disapproval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Resubmission. If the Director disapproves an initial housing  plan submitted by a Bank, the Bank shall submit an amended plan  acceptable to the Director not later than 15 days after the Director's  disapproval of the initial plan; the Director may extend the deadline if  the Director determines an extension is in the public interest. If the  amended plan is not acceptable to the Director, the Director may afford  the Bank 15 days to submit a new plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Enforcement of housing plan. If the Director finds that a Bank  has failed to meet any housing goal, and that the achievement of the  housing goal was feasible, and has required the Bank to submit a housing  plan under this section, the Director may issue a cease and desist  order, or impose civil money penalties, if the Bank refuses to submit  such a plan, fails to submit an acceptable plan, or fails to comply with  the approved plan. In taking such action, the Director shall follow  procedures consistent with those provided in 12 U.S.C. 4581 through 4588  with respect to actions to enforce the housing goals.</p>
