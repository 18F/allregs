                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Overview. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> This test procedure is a combined procedure to  test various performance parameters under variations in power line  voltage and ambient temperature. Tests shall be conducted in a  temperature-controlled environment over four 6-hour time periods during  which reference temperature and flow rate measurements shall be made at  intervals not to exceed 5 minutes. Specific parameters to be evaluated  at line voltages of 105 and 125 volts and temperatures of -20 C and +40  C are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Sample flow rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Flow rate regulation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Flow rate measurement accuracy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Coefficient of variability measurement accuracy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Ambient air temperature measurement accuracy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Proper operation of the sampler when exposed to power line  voltage and ambient temperature extremes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The performance parameters tested under this procedure, the  corresponding minimum performance specifications, and the applicable  test conditions are summarized in table E-1 of this subpart. Each  performance parameter tested, as described or determined in the test  procedure, must meet or exceed the associated performance specification  given. The candidate sampler must meet all specifications for the  associated PM 2.5 or PM 10-2.5 method (as  applicable) to pass this test procedure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Technical definition. Sample flow rate means the quantitative  volumetric flow rate of the air stream caused by the sampler to enter  the sampler inlet and pass through the sample filter, measured in actual  volume units at the temperature and pressure of the air as it enters the  inlet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Required test equipment. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Environmental chamber or other  temperature-controlled environment or environments, capable of obtaining  and maintaining temperatures at -20 C and =40 C as required for the  test with an accuracy of [2 C. The test environment(s) must be capable  of maintaining these temperatures within the specified limits  continuously with the additional heat load of the operating test sampler  in the environment. Henceforth, where the test procedures specify a test  or environmental ``chamber,'' an alternative temperature-controlled  environmental area or areas may be substituted, provided the required  test temperatures and all other test requirements are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Variable voltage AC power transformer, range 100 Vac to 130 Vac,  with sufficient current capacity to operate the test sampler  continuously under the test conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Flow rate meter, suitable for measuring and recording the actual  volumetric sample flow rate at the sampler downtube, with a minimum  range of 10 to 25 actual L/min, 2 percent certified, NIST-traceable  accuracy. Optional capability for continuous (analog) recording  capability or digital recording at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes is  recommended. While a flow meter which provides a direct indication of  volumetric flow rate is preferred for this test, an alternative  certified flow measurement device may be used as long as appropriate  volumetric flow rate corrections are made based on measurements of  actual ambient temperature and pressure conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Ambient air temperature recorder, range -30 C to =50 C, with a  resolution of 0.1 C and certified accurate to within 0.5 C. Ambient  air temperature measurements must be made using continuous (analog)  recording capability or digital recording at intervals not to exceed 5  minutes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Barometer, range 600 mm Hg to 800 mm Hg, certified accurate to 2  mm Hg. If the certified flow rate meter does not provide direct  volumetric flow rate readings, ambient pressure measurements must be  made using continuous (analog) recording capability or digital recording  at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Flow measurement adaptor (40 CFR part 50, appendix L, figure L- 30) or equivalent adaptor to facilitate measurement of sampler flow rate  at the sampler downtube.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Means for creating an additional pressure drop of 55 mm Hg in  the sampler to simulate a heavily loaded filter,   such as an orifice or flow restrictive plate installed in the filter  holder or a valve or other flow restrictor temporarily installed in the  flow path near the filter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> AC RMS voltmeter, accurate to 1.0 volt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Teflon sample filter, as specified in section 6 of 40 CFR part  50, appendix L (if required).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Calibration of test measurement instruments. Submit  documentation showing evidence of appropriately recent calibration,  certification of calibration accuracy, and NIST-traceability (if  required) of all measurement instruments used in the tests. The accuracy  of flow rate meters shall be verified at the highest and lowest  pressures and temperatures used in the tests and shall be checked at  zero and at least one flow rate within [3 percent of 16.7 L/min within 7  days prior to use for this test. Where an instrument's measurements are  to be recorded with an analog recording device, the accuracy of the  entire instrument-recorder system shall be calibrated or verified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Test setup. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Setup of the sampler shall be performed as  required in this paragraph (e) and otherwise as described in the  sampler's operation or instruction manual referred to in  Sec. 53.4(b)(3). The sampler shall be installed upright and set up in  the temperature-controlled chamber in its normal configuration for  collecting PM samples. A sample filter and (or) the device for creating  an additional 55 mm Hg pressure drop shall be installed for the duration  of these tests. The sampler's ambient temperature, ambient pressure, and  flow measurement systems shall all be calibrated per the sampler's  operating manual within 7 days prior to this test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The inlet of the candidate sampler shall be removed and the flow  measurement adaptor installed on the sampler's downtube. A leak check as  described in the sampler's operation or instruction manual shall be  conducted and must be properly passed before other tests are carried  out.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The inlet of the flow measurement adaptor shall be connected to  the outlet of the flow rate meter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The ambient air temperature recorder shall be installed in the  test chamber such that it will accurately measure the temperature of the  air in the vicinity of the candidate sampler without being unduly  affected by the chamber's air temperature control system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Procedure. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Set up the sampler as specified in paragraph (e)  of this section and otherwise prepare the sampler for normal sample  collection operation as directed in the sampler's operation or  instruction manual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The test shall consist of four test runs, one at each of the  following conditions of chamber temperature and electrical power line  voltage (respectively):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> -20 C [2 C and 105 [1 Vac.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> -20 C [2 C and 125 [1 Vac.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> =40 C [2 C and 105 [1 Vac.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> =40 C [2 C and 125 [1 Vac.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For each of the four test runs, set the selected chamber  temperature and power line voltage for the test run. Upon achieving each  temperature setpoint in the chamber, the candidate sampler and flow  meter shall be thermally equilibrated for a period of at least 2 hours  prior to the test run. Following the thermal conditioning time, set the  sampler to automatically start a 6-hour sample collection period at a  convenient time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> During each 6-hour test period:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Measure and record the sample flow rate with the flow rate meter  at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes. If ambient temperature and  pressure corrections are necessary to calculate volumetric flow rate,  ambient temperature and pressure shall be measured at the same frequency  as that of the certified flow rate measurements. Note and record the  actual start and stop times for the 6-hour flow rate test period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determine and record the ambient (chamber) temperature  indicated by the sampler and the corresponding ambient (chamber)  temperature measured by the ambient temperature recorder specified in  paragraph (c)(4) of this section at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Measure the power line voltage to the sampler at intervals not  greater than 1 hour.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> At the end of each test run, terminate the sample period (if not  automatically terminated by the sampler) and download all archived  instrument data from the test sampler.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Test results. For each of the four test runs, examine the  chamber temperature measurements and the power line voltage  measurements. Verify that the temperature and line voltage met the  requirements specified in paragraph (f) of this section at all times  during the test run. If not, the test run is not valid and must be  repeated. Determine the test results as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Mean sample flow rate. (i) From the certified measurements  (Qref) of the test sampler flow rate, tabulate each flow rate  measurement in units of L/min. If ambient temperature and pressure  corrections are necessary to calculate volumetric flow rate, each  measured flow rate shall be corrected using its corresponding  temperature and pressure measurement values. Calculate the mean flow  rate for each sample period (Qref,ave) as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Equation 11 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.073  where:  n equals the number of discrete certified flow rate measurements over</p><p class="depth0">each 6-hour test period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Calculate the percent difference between this mean flow rate  value and the design value of 16.67 L/min, as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Equation 12 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.074</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> To successfully pass this test, the percent difference  calculated in Equation 12 of this paragraph (g)(1)(ii) must be within [5  percent for each test run.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sample flow rate regulation. (i) From the certified measurements  of the test sampler flow rate, calculate the sample coefficient of  variation of the discrete measurements as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Equation 13 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.075</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To successfully pass this test, the calculated coefficient of  variation for the certified flow rates must not exceed 2 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Flow rate measurement accuracy. (i) Using the mean volumetric  flow rate reported by the candidate test sampler at the completion of  each 6-hour test (Qind,ave), determine the accuracy of the  reported mean flow rate as:</p><p class="depth0">Equation 14 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.076</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To successfully pass this test, the percent difference  calculated in Equation 14 of this paragraph (g)(3) shall not exceed 2  percent for each test run.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Flow rate coefficient of variation measurement accuracy. (i)  Using the flow rate coefficient of variation indicated by the candidate  test sampler (%CVind), determine the accuracy of the reported  coefficient of variation as:</p><p class="depth0">Equation 15 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JY97.077</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To successfully pass this test, the absolute difference  calculated in Equation 15 of this paragraph (g)(4) must not exceed 0.3  (CV%) for each test run.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Ambient temperature measurement accuracy. (i) Calculate the  absolute value of the difference between the mean ambient air  temperature indicated by the test sampler and the mean ambient (chamber)  air temperature measured with the ambient air temperature recorder as: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC06.037  Where:  Tind,ave = The mean ambient air temperature indicated by the</p><p class="depth0">test sampler, C; and   Tref,ave = The mean ambient air temperature measured by the</p><p class="depth0">reference temperature instrument, C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The calculated temperature difference must be less than 2 C  for each test run.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Sampler functionality. To pass the sampler functionality test,  the following two conditions must both be met for each test run:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The sampler must not shutdown during any portion of the 6-hour  test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An inspection of the downloaded data from the test sampler  verifies that all the data are consistent with normal operation of the  sampler.
