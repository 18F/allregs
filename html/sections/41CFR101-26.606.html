                            <p class="depth0">Federal civil agencies may obtain items of supply which are procured  and managed by the inventory control points (ICP) of the Army, Navy, and  Air Force and are available in the United States, provided that a  national stock number has been assigned to the items. A list of ICP's  and their corresponding commodity areas is in the FEDSTRIP operating  Guide. Agencies should also refer to the FEDSTRIP operating Guide for  additional information concerning supply support from the ICP's and for  instructions on obtaining items from these sources.
