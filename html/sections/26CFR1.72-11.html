                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introductory. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This section applies to amounts received under  a contract to which section 72 applies if either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.72-2 is inapplicable to such amounts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.72-2 is applicable but the annuity  payments received differ either in amount, duration, or both, from those  originally provided under the contract, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> of this subparagraph  are annuity payments which are made to a beneficiary after   the death of annuitant (or annuitants) in full discharge of the  obligations under a contract because of a provision in the contract  requiring the payment of a guaranteed amount or minimum number of  payments for a fixed period; see paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The principles of this section apply, to the extent appropriate  thereto, to amounts paid which are taxable under section 72 (except, for  taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, section 72(e)(3)) in  accordance with sections 402 and 403 and the regulations thereunder.  However, if contributions used to purchase the contract include amounts  for which a deduction was allowed under section 404 as contributions on  behalf of an owner-employee, the rules of this section are modified by  the rules of paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.72-17. Further, in applying the  provisions of this section, the aggregate premiums or other  consideration paid shall not include contributions on behalf of self- employed individuals to the extent that deductions were allowed under  section 404 for such contributions. Nor, shall the aggregate of premiums  or other consideration paid include amounts used to purchase life,  accident, health, or other insurance protection for an owner-employee.  See paragraph (b)(4) of Sec. 1.72-16 and paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.72- 17. The principles of this section also apply to payments made in the  manner described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of Sec. 1.72-2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amounts received in the nature of dividends or similar  distributions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If dividends (or payments in the nature of dividends  or a return of premiums or other consideration) are received under a  contract to which section 72 applies and such payments are received  before the annuity starting date or before the date on which an amount  is first received as an annuity, whichever is the later, such payments  are includible in the gross income of the recipient only to the extent  that they, taken together with all previous payments received under the  contract which were excludable from the gross income of the recipient  under the applicable income tax law, exceed the aggregate of premiums or  other consideration paid or deemed to have been paid by the recipient.  Such payments shall also be subtracted from the consideration paid (or  deemed paid) both for the purpose of determining an exclusion ratio to  be applied to subsequent amounts paid as an annuity and for the purpose  of determining the applicability of section 72(d) and Sec. 1.72-13,  relating to employee contributions recoverable in three years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If dividends or payments in the nature of dividends are paid  under a contract to which section 72 applies and such payments are  received on or after the annuity starting date or the date on which an  amount is first received as an annuity, whichever is later, such  payments shall be fully includible in the gross income of the recipient.  The receipt of such payments shall not affect the aggregate of premiums  or other consideration paid nor the amounts contributed or deemed to  have been contributed by an employee as otherwise calculated for  purposes of section 72. Since the investment in the contract and the  expected return are not affected by a payment which is fully includible  in the gross income of the recipient under this rule, the exclusion  ratio will not be affected by such payment and will continue to be  applied to amounts received as annuity payments in the future as though  such payment had not been made. This subparagraph shall apply to amounts  received under a contract described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of Sec.  1.72-2 to the extent that the amounts received exceed the portion of the  investment in the contract allocable to each taxable year in accordance  with paragraph (d)(3) of Sec. 1.72-4. Hence, such excess is fully  includible in the gross income of the recipient.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Amounts received in the nature of a refund of the consideration  under a contract and in full discharge of the obligation thereof. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Any amount received under a contract to which section 72 applies, if it  is at least in part a refund of the consideration paid, including  amounts payable to a beneficiary after the death of an annuitant by  reason of a provision in the contract for a life annuity with minimum  period of payments certain or with a minimum amount which must be paid  in any event, shall be considered an amount received in the nature of a  refund of   the consideration paid for such contract. If such an amount is in full  discharge of an obligation to pay a fixed amount (whether in a lump sum  or otherwise) or to pay amounts for a fixed number of years (including  amounts described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of Sec. 1.72-2), it shall be  included in the gross income of the recipient only to the extent that  it, when added to amounts previously received under the contract which  were excludable from gross income under the law applicable at the time  of receipt, exceeds the aggregate of premiums or other consideration  paid. See section 73(e)(2)(A). This paragraph shall not apply if the  total of the amounts to be paid in discharge of the obligation can in  any event exceed the total of the annuity payments which would otherwise  fully discharge the obligation. For rules to be applied in such a case,  see paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The principles of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. A, a male employee, retired on December 31, 1954, at the  age of 60. A life annuity of $75 per month was payable to him beginning  January 31, 1955. The annuity contract guaranteed that if A did not live  for at least ten years after his retirement his beneficiary, B, would  receive the monthly payments for any balance of such ten-year period  which remained at the date of A's death. Under section 72, A was deemed  to have paid $3,600 toward the cost of the annuity. A lived for five  years after his retirement receiving a total of $4,500 in annuity  payments. After A's death, B began receiving the monthly payments of $75  beginning with the January 31, 1960 payment. B will exclude such  payments from his gross income throughout 1960, 1961, and 1962, and will  exclude only $18 of the first payment in 1963 from his gross income for  that year. Thereafter, B will include the entire amount of all such  payments in his gross income for the taxable year of receipt. This  result is determined as follows:  A's investment in the contract (unadjusted)....................   $3,600 Multiple from Table III of Sec. 1.72-9 for male, age       11  .......</p><p class="depth3">60, where duration of guaranteed amount is 10 years</p><p class="depth3"><em>(percent)</em>............................................ Subtract value of the refund feature to the nearest dollar (11       396</p><p class="depth3">percent of $3,600)............................................</p><p class="depth3">-------- Investment in the contract adjusted for the present value of       3,204</p><p class="depth3">the refund feature without discount for interest..............</p><p class="depth3">-------- Aggregate of premiums or other consideration paid..............    3,600 A's exclusion ratio ($3,204/$16,380 [$900x18.2])           19.6</p><p class="depth3"><em>(percent)</em>............................................ Subtract amount excludable during five years A received              882</p><p class="depth3">payments (19.6 percent of $4,500 [$900x5]).................... Remainder of aggregate of premiums or other consideration paid     2,718</p><p class="depth3">excludable from gross income of B under section 72(e).........</p><p class="depth3">As a result of the above computation, the number of payments to B which  will exhaust the remainder of consideration paid which is excludable  from gross income of the recipient is 36\6/25\ ($2,718/$75) and B will  exclude the payments from his gross income for three years, then exclude  only $18 of the first payment for the fourth year from his gross income,  and thereafter include the entire amount of all payments he receives in  his gross income.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example (1), except that B,  the beneficiary, elects to receive $50 per month for his life in lieu of  the payments guaranteed under the original contractual obligation. Since  such amounts will be received as an annuity and may, because of the  length of time B may live, exceed the amount guaranteed, they are not  amounts to which this paragraph applies. See paragraph (e) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. The facts are the same as in example (1), except that B,  the beneficiary, elects to receive the remaining guaranteed amount in  installments which are larger or smaller than the $75 per month provided  until, under the terms of the contract, the guaranteed amount is  exhausted. The rule of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph and the  computation illustrated in example (1) apply to such installments since  the total of such installments will not exceed the original amount  guaranteed to be paid at A's death in any event.</p><p class="depth3">Example 4. C pays $12,000 for a contract providing that he is to be  paid an annuity of $1,000 per year for 15 years. His exclusion ratio is  therefore 80 percent ($12,000/$15,000). He directs that the annuity is  to be paid to D, his beneficiary, if he should die before the full 15- year period has expired. C dies after 5 years and D is paid $1,000 in  1960. D will include $200 ($1,000-$800 [80 percent of $1,000]) in his  gross income for the taxable year in which he receives the $1,000 since  section 72(e) and this section do not apply to the annuity payments made  in accordance with the provisions and during the term of the contract. D  will continue with the same exclusion ratio used by C (80 percent).</p><p class="depth3">Example 5. In 1954, E paid $50,000 into a fund and was promised an  annual income for life the amount of which would depend in part upon the  earnings realized from the investment of the fund in accordance with an  agreed formula. The contract also specified that if E should die before  ten years had elapsed, his beneficiary, F, would be paid the   amounts determined annually under the formula until ten payments had  been received by E and F together. E died in 1960, having received five  payments totaling $30,000. Assuming that $22,000 of this amount was  properly excludable from E's gross income prior to his death, F will  exclude from his gross income the payments he receives until the taxable  year in which his total receipts from the fund exceed $28,000 ($50,000- $22,000). F will include any excess over the $28,000 in his gross income  for that taxable year. Thereafter, F will include in his gross income  the entire amount of any payments made to him from the fund.</p><p class="depth3">Example 6. Assume the facts are the same as in example (1), except  that the total investment in the contract is made after June 30, 1986,  that A is to receive payments under the life annuity contract beginning  on January 31, 1987, and that B will begin to receive the monthly  payments on January 31, 1992. B will exclude the $75 monthly payments  from gross income throughout 1992, 1993, and 1994. B will exclude only  the first two monthly payments and $21 of the third monthly payment in  1995. This is determined as follows:  A's investment in the contract (unadjusted).................      $3,600 Multiple from Table VII, age 60, 10 years (percent).........           4</p><p class="depth3">Subtract value of the refund feature (4 percent of            $144</p><p class="depth3">$3,600...............................................</p><p class="depth3">----------- Investment in the contract adjusted for the present value of      $3,456</p><p class="depth3">the refund feature without discount for interest........... Aggregate of premiums or other consideration paid...........   $3,600.00</p><p class="depth3">A's exclusion ratio ($3,456/$21,780 [$900x24.2]) (percent)        15.9</p><p class="depth3">Subtract amount excludable during five years A received        $715.50</p><p class="depth3">payments (15.9 percent of $4,500 [$900x5])...............</p><p class="depth3">-----------</p><p class="depth3">Remainder of aggregate of premiums or other consideration    $2,884.50</p><p class="depth3">paid excludable from gross income of B under section</p><p class="depth3">72(e)....................................................</p><p class="depth3">As a result of the above computation, the number of payments to B which  will exhaust the remainder of consideration paid which is excludable  from gross income of the recipient is 38\23/50\ ($2,884.50/75) and B  will exclude the payments from gross income for three years, then  exclude only the first two monthly payments and $34.50 of the third.  Thereafter B shall include the entire amount of all payments received in  gross income.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For the purpose of applying the rule contained in subparagraph  (1) of this paragraph, it is immaterial whether the recipient of the  amount received in full discharge of the obligation is the same person  as the recipient of amounts previously received under the contract which  were excludable from gross income, except in the case of a contract  transferred for a valuable consideration, with respect to which see  paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.72-10. For the limit on the tax, for taxable  years beginning before January 1, 1964, attributable to the receipt of a  lump sum to which this paragraph applies, see paragraph (g) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Amounts received upon the surrender, redemption, or maturity of  a contract. (1) Any amount received upon the surrender, redemption, or  maturity of a contract to which section 72 applies, which is not  received as an annuity under the regulations of paragraph (b) of Sec.  1.72-2, shall be included in the gross income of the recipient to the  extent that it, when added to amounts previously received under the  contract and which were excludable from the gross income of the  recipient under the law applicable at the time of receipt, exceeds the  aggregate of premiums or other consideration paid. See section  72(e)(2)(B). If amounts are to be received as an annuity, whether in  lieu of or in addition to amounts described in the preceding sentence,  such amounts shall be included in the gross income of the recipient in  accordance with the provisions of paragraph (e) or (f) of this section,  whichever is applicable. The rule stated in the first sentence of this  paragraph shall not apply to payments received as an annuity or  otherwise after the date of the first receipt of an amount as an annuity  subsequent to the maturity, redemption, or surrender of the original  contract. If amounts are so received and are other than amounts received  as an annuity, they are includible in the gross income of the recipient.  See section 72(e)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(A)</em> and paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the purpose of applying the rule contained in subparagraph  (1) of this paragraph, it is immaterial whether the recipient of the  amount received upon the surrender, redemption, or maturity of the  contract is the same as the recipient of amounts previously received  under the contract which were excludable from gross income, except in  the case of a contract transferred for a valuable consideration, with  respect to which see paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.72-10. For the limit on  the amount of tax, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964,  attributable to the receipt of   certain lump sums to which this paragraph applies, see paragraph (g) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> and paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (f) of this section are  inapplicable for the purpose of determining the includibility of such  payments in gross income and the general principles of section 72 with  respect to the use of an exclusion ratio shall be applied to such  payments as if they were provided under a new contract received in  exchange for the contract providing the original annuity payments. If  such payments are received as the result of the surrender, redemption,  or discharge of a contract to which section 72 applies, they shall be  considered to be received as an annuity under a contract exchanged for  the contract whose redemption, surrender, or discharge was involved. For  the purpose of determining the extent to which the payments so received  are to be included in the gross income of the recipient, an exclusion  ratio shall be determined for such contract as of the later of January  1, 1954, or the first day of the first period for which an amount is  received as an annuity thereunder, whichever is the later. See paragraph  (b) of Sec. 1.72-4. In determining the investment in the contract for  this purpose, any lump sum amount received at the time of the exchange  shall not be considered an amount to which paragraph (a)(2) of Sec.  1.72-6 applies. However, such lump sum shall be subtracted from the  aggregate of premiums or other consideration paid to the extent it is  excludable as an amount not received as an annuity under this section as  if it were an amount received before the annuity starting date of the  contract obtained in exchange.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Periodic payments received for the same term after a lump sum  withdrawal. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If, after the date of the first receipt of a payment as  an annuity, the annuitant receives a lump sum and is thereafter to  receive annuity payments in a reduced amount under the contract for the  same term, life, or lives as originally specified in the contract, a  portion of the contract shall be considered to have been surrendered or  redeemed in consideration of the payment of such lump sum and the  exclusion ratio originally determined for the contract shall continue to  apply to the amounts received as an annuity without regard to the fact  that such amounts are less than the original amounts which were to be  paid periodically. The lump sum shall be includible in the gross income  of the recipient in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (2)  of this paragraph. However, except in the case of amounts to which  sections 402 and 403 apply, the tax, for taxable years beginning before  January 1, 1964, attributable to the inclusion of all or part of the  lump sum in gross income shall not exceed the amount determined under  section 72(e)(3) and paragraph (g) of this section. For taxable years  beginning after December 31, 1963, such amounts may be taken into  account in computations under sections 1301 through 1305 (relating to  income averaging).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There shall be excluded from gross income that portion of the  lump sum which bears the same ratio to the aggregate premiums or other  consideration paid for the contract, as reduced by all amounts  previously received under the contract and excludable from the gross  income of the recipient under the applicable income tax law, as:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of payments to be made in the manner described in  paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 1.72-2, the amount of the reduction in the  annuity payments to be made thereafter bears to the annuity payments  originally provided under the contract, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a contract providing for payments to be made in  the manner described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of Sec. 1.72-2, the amount  of the reduction in the number of units per period to be   paid thereafter bears to the number of units per period payable under  the contract immediately before the lump sum withdrawal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> This paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. Taxpayer A pays $20,000 for an annuity contract providing  for payments to him of $100 per month for his life. At the annuity  starting date he has a life expectancy of 20 years. His expected return  is therefore $24,000 and the exclusion ratio is five-sixths. He  continues to receive the original annuity payments for 5 years,  receiving a total of $6,000, and properly excludes a total of $5,000  from his gross income in his income tax returns for those years. At the  beginning of the next year, A agrees with the insurer to take a reduced  annuity of $75 per month and a lump sum payment of $4,000 in cash. Of  the lump sum he receives, he will include $250 and exclude $3,750 from  his gross income for his taxable year of receipt, determined as follows:  Aggregate of premiums or other consideration paid..........      $20,000 Less amounts received as an annuity to the extent they were       $5,000</p><p class="depth3">excludable from A's income................................</p><p class="depth3">------------ Remainder of the consideration.............................      $15,000</p><p class="depth3">============ Ratio of the reduction in the amount of the annuity           25/$100 or</p><p class="depth3">payments to the original annuity payments.................        \1/4\ Lump sum received..........................................       $4,000 Less one-fourth of the remainder of the consideration (\1/        $3,750</p><p class="depth3">4\ of $15,000)............................................</p><p class="depth3">------------ Portion of the lump sum includible in gross income.........         $250</p><p class="depth3">For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, the limit on tax of  section 72(e)(3), as in effect before such date, applies to the portion  of the lump sum includible in gross income. For taxable years beginning  after December 31, 1963, such portion may be taken into account in  computations under sections 1301 through 1305 (relating to income  averaging). If, in this example, the annuity were a pension payable to A  as a retired employee, but the facts were otherwise the same (assuming  that, for instance, the $20,000 aggregate of premiums or other  consideration paid were A's contributions as determined under section  72(f) and Sec. 1.72-8) the result would be the same except that the tax  attributable to the inclusion of the $250 in A's gross income, for  taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, would not be limited by  section 72(e)(3), as in effect before such date. If such a lump sum is  received in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963, the  portion of such sum includible in gross income may be taken into account  in computations under sections 1301 through 1305 (relating to income  averaging).</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Taxpayer B pays $30,000 for a contract providing for  monthly payments to be made to him for 15 years with respect to the  principal and earnings of 10 units of an investment fund. B receives  $12,000 during the first 5 years of participation and of this amount he  has properly excluded a total of $10,000 from his gross income in his  income returns for the taxable years, since $2,000 of $2,400 he received  in each such year represented his investment divided by the term of the  annuity ($30,000/15). At the beginning of the 6th year, B agrees to take  $11,000 in a lump sum and thereafter to accept the payments arising with  respect to five units for the remaining 10 years of payments in full  discharge of the original obligations of the contract. B shall include  $1,000 in his gross income for the 6th year as the result of the lump  sum he receives and allocates $1,000 of his original investment in the  contract to each of the remaining 10 years with respect to the payments  which will continue, determined as follows:  Aggregate of premiums or other consideration paid.............   $30,000 Total amount received and excludable from gross income........   $10,000</p><p class="depth3">--------- Remainder of the consideration................................   $20,000</p><p class="depth3">========= Ratio of units discontinued to the total units originally         \5/10\</p><p class="depth3">provided.....................................................  or \1/2\ Lump sum received at the time of reduction in the number of      $11,000</p><p class="depth3">units to be paid.............................................
