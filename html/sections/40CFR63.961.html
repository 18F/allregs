                            <p class="depth0">All terms used in this subpart shall have the meaning given to them  in the Act and in this section. If a term is defined in both this  section and in another subpart that references the use of this subpart,  then the definition in this subpart shall take precedence when  implementing this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Closure device means a cap, cover, hatch, lid, plug, seal, valve, or  other type of fitting that, when the device is secured in the closed  position, prevents or reduces air emissions to the atmosphere by  blocking an opening to the individual drain system. Closure devices  include devices that are detachable (e.g., a plug or manhole cover),  manually operated (e.g., a hinged access lid or hatch), or automatically  operated (e.g., a spring-loaded pressure relief valve).</p><p class="depth0">Hard-piping means pipe or tubing that is manufactured and properly  installed in accordance with relevant standards (e.g., ANSI B31-3) and  good engineering practices.</p><p class="depth0">Individual drain system means a stationary system used to convey  regulated-material to a waste management unit or to discharge or  disposal. The   term includes hard-piping, all drains and junction boxes, together with  their associated sewer lines and other junction boxes (e.g., manholes,  sumps, and lift stations) conveying regulated-material. For the purpose  of this subpart, an individual drain system is not a drain and  collection system that is designed and operated for the sole purpose of  collecting rainfall runoff (e.g., stormwater sewer system) and is  segregated from all other individual drain systems.</p><p class="depth0">Junction box means a sump, manhole, or access point to a sewer line  or a lift station.</p><p class="depth0">Regulated-material means the wastewater streams, residuals, and any  other materials specified by the referencing subpart to be managed in  accordance with the standards under this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Sewer line means a lateral, trunk line, branch line, or other  conduit used to convey regulated-material to a downstream waste  management unit. Sewer lines include pipes, grates, and trenches.</p><p class="depth0">Waste management unit means the equipment, structure, or device used  to convey, store, treat, or dispose of regulated-material. Examples of  waste management units include: wastewater tanks, surface impoundments,  individual drain systems, and biological wastewater treatment units.  Examples of equipment that may be waste management units include  containers, air flotation units, oil-water separators or organic-water  separators, or organic removal devices such as decanters, strippers, or  thin-film evaporation units.</p><p class="depth0">Water seal means a seal pot, p-leg trap, or other type of trap  filled with water (e.g., flooded sewers that maintain liquid levels  adequate to prevent air flow through the system) that creates a liquid  barrier between the sewer line and the atmosphere. The liquid level of  the seal must be maintained in the vertical leg of a drain in order to  be considered a water seal.  [61 FR 34193, July 1, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 38989, July 20, 1999]</p>
