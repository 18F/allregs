                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">A school makes AYP if each group of students identified in Sec. 30.107(b)(6) meets or exceeds the annual measurable objectives and participation rate identified in Sec. Sec. 30.107(b)(9) and 30.107(b)(12) respectively, and the school meets the other academic indicators identified in Sec. 30.107(b)(11). If a school fails to achieve its annual measurable objectives for any group identified in Sec. 30.107(b)(6), there are two other methods it may use to determine whether it made AYP:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Method A--``Safe Harbor.'' Under ``safe harbor,'' the following requirements must be met for each group referenced under Sec. 30.107(b)(6) that does not achieve the school's annual measurable objectives:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In each group that does not achieve the school's annual measurable objectives, the percentage of students who were below the ``proficient'' level of academic achievement decreased by at least 10 percent from the preceding school year; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The students in that group made progress on one or more of the other academic indicators; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Not less than 95 percent of the students in that group participated in the assessment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Method B--Uniform Averaging Procedure. A school may use uniform averaging. Under this procedure, the school may average data from the school year with data from one or two school years immediately preceding that school year and determine if the resulting average makes AYP.</p>
