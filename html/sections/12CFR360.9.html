                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose and scope. This section is intended to allow the deposit and other operations of a large insured depository institution (defined as a ``Covered Institution'') to continue functioning on the day following failure. It also is intended to permit the FDIC to fulfill its legal mandates regarding the resolution of failed insured institutions to provide liquidity to depositors promptly, enhance market discipline, ensure equitable treatment of depositors at different institutions and reduce the FDIC's costs by preserving the franchise value of a failed institution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. (1) A covered Institution means an insured depository institution which, based on items as defined in Reports of Income and Condition or Thrift Financial Reports filed with the applicable federal regulator, has at least $2 billion in deposits and at least either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A covered Institution means an insured depository institution which, based on items as defined in Reports of Income and Condition or Thrift Financial Reports filed with the applicable federal regulator, has at least $2 billion in deposits and at least either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 250,000 deposit accounts; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> $20 billion in total assets, regardless of the number of deposit accounts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Deposits, number of deposit accounts and total assets are as defined in the instructions for the filing of Reports of Income and Condition and Thrift Financial Reports, as applicable to the insured depository institution for determining whether it qualifies as a covered institution. A foreign deposit means an uninsured deposit liability maintained in a foreign branch of an insured depository institution. An international banking facility deposit is as defined by the Board of Governors of

the Federal Reserve System in Regulation D (12 CFRSec. 204.8(a)(2)). A demand deposit account, NOW account, money market deposit account, savings deposit account and time deposit account are as defined in the instructions for the filing of Reports of Income and Condition and Thrift Financial Reports.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sweep account arrangements consist of a deposit account linked to an interest-bearing investment vehicle whereby funds are swept to and from the deposit account according to prearranged rules, usually on a daily basis, where the sweep investment vehicle is not a deposit and is reflected on the books and records of the Covered Institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Automated credit account arrangements consist of a deposit account into which funds are automatically credited from an interest-bearing investment vehicle where the funds in the interest-bearing investment vehicle were not invested by prearranged rules.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Non-covered institution means an insured depository institution that does not meet the definition of a covered institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Provisional hold means an effective restriction on access to some or all of a deposit or other liability account after the failure of an insured depository institution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Posting and removing provisional holds. (1) A covered institution shall have in place an automated process for implementing a provisional hold on deposit accounts, foreign deposit accounts and sweep and automated credit account arrangements immediately following the determination of the close-of-business account balances, as defined in Sec. 360.8(b)(3), at the failed covered institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A covered institution shall have in place an automated process for implementing a provisional hold on deposit accounts, foreign deposit accounts and sweep and automated credit account arrangements immediately following the determination of the close-of-business account balances, as defined in Sec. 360.8(b)(3), at the failed covered institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The system requirements under paragraph (c)(1) must have the capability of placing the provisional holds prescribed under that provision no later than 9 a.m. local time the day following the FDIC cutoff point, as defined in Sec. 360.8(b)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Pursuant to instructions to be provided by the FDIC, a covered institution must notify the FDIC of the person(s) responsible for producing the standard data download and administering provisional holds, both while the functionality is being constructed and on an on-going basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For deposit accounts held in domestic offices of an insured depository institution, the provisional hold algorithm must be designed to exempt accounts below a specific account balance threshold, as determined by the FDIC. The account balance threshold could be any amount, including zero. For accounts above the account balance threshold determined by the FDIC, the algorithm must be designed to calculate and place a hold equal to the dollar amount of funds in excess of the account balance threshold multiplied by the provisional hold percentage determined by the FDIC. The provisional hold percentage could be any amount, from zero to one hundred percent. The account balance threshold as well as the provisional hold percentage could vary for the following four categories, as the covered institution customarily defines consumer accounts:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Consumer demand deposit, NOW and money market deposit accounts;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Other consumer deposit accounts (time deposit and savings accounts, excluding NOW and money market deposit accounts);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Non-consumer demand deposit, NOW and money market deposit accounts; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Other non-consumer deposit accounts (time deposit and savings accounts, excluding NOW and money market deposit accounts).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For deposit accounts held in foreign offices of an insured depository institution, other than those connected to a sweep or automated credit arrangement, the provisional hold algorithm will apply a provisional hold percentage to the entire account balance. For deposit accounts held in foreign offices the provisional hold percentage may differ from that applied to deposit accounts. Also, the provisional hold percentage would not vary by account category (i.e., consumer versus non-consumer and transaction versus non-transaction) as is the case with deposit accounts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For international banking facility deposits, other than those connected to a sweep or automated credit arrangements, the provisional hold algorithm

will apply a provisional hold percentage to the entire account balance. For IBF deposits the provisional hold percentage may differ from that applied to deposit or foreign deposit accounts. Also, the provisional hold percentage would not vary by account category (i.e., consumer versus non-consumer, and transaction versus non-transaction) as is the case with deposit accounts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> For the interest-bearing investment vehicle of a sweep arrangement, the provisional hold algorithm must be designed with the capability to place a provisional hold on the interest-bearing investment vehicle with possibly a different account balance threshold and a different hold percentage according to the type of interest-bearing investment vehicle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> For the interest-bearing investment vehicle of an automated credit account arrangement, the provisional hold algorithm must be designed with the capability to place a provisional hold on the interest-bearing investment vehicle with possibly a different account balance threshold and a different hold percentage according to the type of interest-bearing investment vehicle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> A covered institution may submit a request to the FDIC, using the address indicated in Sec. 360.9(g): to develop a provisional hold process involving memo holds or alternative account mechanisms; or to exempt from the provisional hold requirements of this section those account systems servicing a relatively small number of accounts where the manual application of provisional holds is feasible. Such requests may be in the form of a letter and must include a justification for the request and address the relative effectiveness of the alternative for posting provisional holds in the event of failure. The FDIC will consider such requests on a case-by-case basis in light of the objectives of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The automated process for provisional holds required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section must include the capability of removing provisional holds in batch mode and, during the same processing cycle, applying debits, credits or additional holds on the deposit or other accounts from which the provisional holds were removed, as determined by the FDIC. The FDIC will provide files listing the accounts subject to: removal of provisional holds or additional holds (file format as specified in appendix A); application of debits or credits (file format as specified in appendix B); and application of additional holds (file format as specified in appendix A). In addition to the batch process used to remove provisional holds, the Covered Institution is required to have in place a mechanism for manual removal of provisional holds on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Providing a standard data format for generating deposit account and customer data. (1) A covered institution must have in place practices and procedures for providing the FDIC in a standard format upon the close of any day's business with required depositor and customer data for all deposit accounts held in domestic and foreign offices and interest-bearing investment accounts connected with sweep and automated credit arrangements. Such standard data files are to be created through a mapping of pre-existing data elements and internal institution codes into standard data formats. Deposit account and customer data provided must be current as of the close of business for that day.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A covered institution must have in place practices and procedures for providing the FDIC in a standard format upon the close of any day's business with required depositor and customer data for all deposit accounts held in domestic and foreign offices and interest-bearing investment accounts connected with sweep and automated credit arrangements. Such standard data files are to be created through a mapping of pre-existing data elements and internal institution codes into standard data formats. Deposit account and customer data provided must be current as of the close of business for that day.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be provided in five separate files, as indicated in the appendices C through G to this part 360.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon request by the FDIC, a covered institution must submit the data required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section to the FDIC, in a manner prescribed by the FDIC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In providing the data required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section to the FDIC, the Covered Institution must be able to reconcile the total deposit balances and the number of deposit accounts to the institution's subsidiary system control totals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Implementation requirements. (1) A covered institution must comply with the requirements of this section no later than February 18, 2010.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A covered institution must comply with the requirements of this section no later than February 18, 2010.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An insured depository institution not within the definition of a covered institution on the effective date of this

section must comply with the requirements of this section no later than eighteen months following the end of the second calendar quarter for which it meets the criteria for a covered institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon the merger of two or more non-covered institutions, if the resulting institution meets the criteria for a covered institution, that covered institution must comply with the requirements of this section no later than eighteen months after the effective date of the merger.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Upon the merger of two or more covered institutions, the merged institution must comply with the requirements of this section within eighteen months following the effective date of the merger. This provision, however, does not supplant any preexisting implementation date requirement, in place prior to the date of the merger, for the individual covered institution(s) involved in the merger.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Upon the merger of one or more covered institutions with one or more non-covered institutions, the merged institution(s) must comply with the requirements of this section within eighteen months following the effective date of the merger. This provision, however, does not supplant any preexisting implementation date requirement for the individual covered institution(s) involved in the merger.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Notwithstanding the general requirements of this paragraph (e), on a case-by-case basis, the FDIC may accelerate, upon notice, the implementation timeframe of all or part of the requirements of this section for a covered institution that: Has a composite rating of 3, 4, or 5 under the Uniform Financial Institution's Rating System, or in the case of an insured branch of a foreign bank, an equivalent rating; is undercapitalized, as defined under the prompt corrective action provisions of 12 CFR part 325 or 12 CFR part 324, as applicable; or is determined by the appropriate Federal banking agency or the FDIC in consultation with the appropriate Federal banking agency to be experiencing a significant deterioration of capital or significant funding difficulties or liquidity stress, notwithstanding the composite rating of the institution by its appropriate Federal banking agency in its most recent report of examination. In implementing this paragraph (e)(6), the FDIC must consult with the covered institution's primary federal regulator and consider the: Complexity of the institution's deposit systems and operations, extent of the institution's asset quality difficulties, volatility of the institution's funding sources, expected near-term changes in the institution's capital levels, and other relevant factors appropriate for the FDIC to consider in its roles as insurer and possible receiver of the institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Notwithstanding the general requirements of this paragraph (e), a covered institution may request, by letter, that the FDIC extend the deadline for complying with the requirements of this section. A request for such an extension is subject to the FDIC's rules of general applicability under 12 CFR. 303.251.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A covered institution may apply to the FDIC for an exemption from the requirements of thisSec. 360.9 if it has a high concentration of deposits incidental to credit card operations. The FDIC will consider such applications on a case-by-case basis in light of the objectives of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Requests for exemptions from the requirements of this section, for flexibility in the use of provisional holds or for extensions of the implementation requirements of this section and the submission of point-of-contact information should be submitted in writing to: Office of the Director, Division of Resolutions and Receiverships, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 550 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20429-0002.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Testing requirements. Covered institutions must provide appropriate assistance to the FDIC in its testing of the systems required by this section. The FDIC will provide testing details to covered institutions through the issuance of subsequent procedures and/or guidelines.
