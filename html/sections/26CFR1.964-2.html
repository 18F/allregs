                                Sec. 1.964-2  Treatment of blocked earnings and profits.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a))</em> stock of such corporation, such  amount shall not be included in earnings and profits for purposes of  sections 952, 955 (as in effect both before and after the enactment of  the Tax Reduction Act of 1975), and 956 for such taxable year. For rules  governing the treatment of amounts with respect to which such  restriction or limitation is removed, see paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Rules of application. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this  section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Period of restriction or limitation. An amount of earnings and  profits of a controlled foreign corporation for any taxable year shall  not be included in earnings and profits for purposes of sections 952,  955 (as in effect both before and after the enactment of the Tax  Reduction Act of 1975), and 956 only if such amount of earnings and  profits is subject to a currency or other restriction or limitation  (within the meaning of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) throughout  the 150-day period beginning 90 days before the close of the taxable  year and ending 60 days after the close of such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Restriction or limitation defined. Whether earnings and profits  of a controlled foreign corporation are subject to a currency or other  restriction or limitation imposed under the laws of a foreign country  must be determined on the basis of all the facts and circumstances in  each case. Generally, such a restriction or limitation must prevent--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The ready conversion (directly or indirectly) of such currency  into United States dollars, or into property of a type normally owned by  such corporation in the operation of its business or other money which  is readily convertible into United States dollars; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The distribution of dividends by such corporation to its United  States shareholders.  For purposes of this subparagraph, if a United States shareholder owns  (within the meaning of section 958(a)), or is considered as owning by  applying the rules of ownership of section 958(b), 80 percent or more of  the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of a foreign  corporation in a chain of ownership described in section 958(a), the  distribution of dividends by such corporation to such shareholder will  not be considered prevented solely by reason of the existence of a  currency or other restriction or limitation at an intermediate tier in  such chain if dividends may be distributed directly to such  shareholders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Foreign laws. A currency or other restriction or limitation on  the distribution of earnings and profits may be imposed in a foreign  country by express statutory provisions, executive orders or decrees,  rules or regulations of a governmental agency, court decisions, the  actions of appropriate officials who are acting within the scope of  their authority, or by any similar official action. A currency  restriction will not be considered to exist unless export restrictions  are also imposed which prevent the exportation of property of a type  normally owned by the controlled foreign corporation in the operation of  its business which could be readily converted into United States  dollars.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Voluntary restriction or limitation. A currency or other  restriction or limitation arising from the voluntary act of the  controlled foreign corporation or its United States shareholders during  a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1962, will not be taken into  account. For example, if a controlled foreign corporation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Issues a stock dividend which has the effect of capitalizing  earnings and profits;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Elects to restrict its earnings and profits or to make certain  investments as a means of avoiding current tax or securing a reduced  rate of tax; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Allocates earnings and profits to an optional or arbitrary  reserve; such restriction is voluntary and will not be taken into  account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Treatment of earnings and profits in cases of certain mandatory  reserves--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If a controlled foreign corporation is  required under the laws of a foreign country to establish a reserve out  of earnings and profits for the taxable year, such earnings and profits  shall be considered subject to a restriction or limitation by reason of  such requirement only to the extent that the amount required to be  included in such reserve at the close of the taxable year exceeds the  accumulated earnings and profits (determined in accordance with  subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph) of such corporation at the close  of the preceding taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determination of earnings and profits. For purposes of  determining the accumulated earnings and profits of a controlled foreign  corporation under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph,   such earnings and profits shall not include any amounts which are  attributable to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> and  have not been distributed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> and have not been distributed; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Amounts which become subject to a voluntary restriction or  limitation (within the meaning of subparagraph (4) of this paragraph)  during a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1963.  The rules of this subdivision apply only in determining the accumulated  earnings and profits of a controlled foreign corporation for purposes of  this subparagraph. See section 959 and the regulations thereunder for  limitations on the exclusion from gross income of previously taxed  earnings and profits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Exhaustion of procedures for distributing earnings and profits.  Earnings and profits of a controlled foreign corporation for a taxable  year will not be considered subject to a currency or other restriction  or limitation on their distribution unless the United States  shareholders of such corporation demonstrate either that the available  procedures for distributing such earnings and profits have been  exhausted or that the use of such procedures will be futile. As a  general rule, such procedures will be considered to have been exhausted  if the foreign corporation applies for dollars (or foreign currency  readily convertible into dollars) at the appropriate rate of exchange  and complies with the applicable laws and regulations governing the  acquisition and transfer of such currency including submission of the  necessary documentation to the exchange authority. The fact that  available procedures for distributing earnings and profits were  exhausted without success with respect to a prior year is not, of  itself, sufficient evidence that such procedures would not be successful  with respect to the current taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Removal of restriction or limitation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If, during  any taxable year, a currency or other restriction or limitation (within  the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section) imposed under the laws of  a foreign country on the distribution of earnings and profits of a  controlled foreign corporation to its United States shareholders is  removed--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> shall not exceed his pro rata share of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The earnings and profits upon which the restriction was removed  determined on the basis of his stock ownership on the last day of the  immediately preceding taxable year, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> of Sec. 1.956-1, determined as of the last day of the  immediately preceding taxable year, taking into account the provisions  of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Treatment of earnings and profits. For purposes of sections  952, 955 (as in effect both before and after the enactment of the Tax  Reduction Act of 1975), and 956, the earnings and profits which are no  longer subject to a currency or other restriction or limitation shall be  treated as included in the corporation's earnings and profits for the  year in which such earnings and profits were derived.  Amounts with respect to which a currency or other restriction or  limitation is removed shall be translated into United States dollars at  the appropriate exchange rate for the translation period during which  such currency or other restriction or limitation is removed. See  paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.964-1. Amounts with respect to which a currency  or other restriction or limitation is removed shall not be taken into   account in determining whether a deficiency distribution (within the  meaning of Sec. 1.963-6 (applied as if section 963 had not been repealed  by the Tax Reduction Act of 1975)) is required to be made for the year  in which such earnings and profits were derived.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Removal of restriction or limitation defined. An amount of  earnings and profits shall be considered no longer subject to a  limitation or restriction if and to the extent that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Money or property in such foreign country is readily convertible  into United States dollars, or into other money or property of a type  normally owned by such corporation in the operation of its business  which is readily convertible into United States dollars;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Notwithstanding the existence of any laws or regulations  forbidding the exchange of money or property into United States dollars,  conversion is actually made into United States dollars, or other money  or property of a type normally owned by such corporation in the  operation of its business which is readily convertible into United  States dollars; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A mandatory reserve requirement (described in paragraph (b)(5)  of this section) is removed either by a change in law of the foreign  country imposing such requirement or by an accumulation of earnings and  profits not subject to such requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Distribution in foreign country. If, during any taxable year,  earnings and profits previously subject to a currency or other  restriction or limitation are distributed in a foreign country to one or  more United States shareholders of a controlled foreign corporation  directly, or indirectly through a chain of ownership described in  section 958(a), such earnings and profits shall be considered no longer  subject to a restriction or limitation. However, distributed amounts may  be excluded from such shareholder's gross income for the taxable year of  receipt if such shareholder elects a method of accounting under which  the reporting of blocked foreign income is deferred until the income  ceases to be blocked.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Source of distribution. If, during any taxable year, earnings  and profits previously subject to a currency or other restriction or  limitation is distributed to one or more United States shareholders of a  controlled foreign corporation directly, or indirectly through a chain  of ownership described in section 958(a), the source of such  distribution shall be determined in accordance with the rules of  Sec. 1.959-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Illustration. The provisions of this paragraph may be  illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> M, a United States person, owns all of the only class  of stock of A Corporation, a foreign corporation incorporated under the  laws of foreign country X on January 1, 1963. Both M and A Corporations  use the calendar year as a taxable year and A Corporation is a  controlled foreign corporation throughout the period here involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> During 1963, A Corporation derives income of $100,000 all of  which is subpart F income and has earnings and profits of $100,000.  Under the laws of X Country, currency cannot be exported without a  license. During the last 90 days of 1963 and the first 60 days of 1964,  A Corporation can obtain a license to distribute only an amount  equivalent to $10,000. M must include $10,000 in his gross income for  1963 under section 951(a)(1)(A)(i) and $90,000 of A Corporation's  earnings and profits for 1963 are not taken into account for purposes of  sections 952, 955, and 956.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> During 1964, A Corporation has no income and no earnings and  profits. On June 1, 1964, A Corporation converts an amount equivalent to  $20,000 into property of a type normally owned by such corporation in  the operation of its business which is readily convertible into United  States dollars but does not distribute such amount. Corporation A must  include $20,000 in its earnings and profits for 1963 for purposes of  sections 952, 955, and 956. M must include $20,000 in his gross income  for 1964.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> During 1965, A Corporation has no income and no earnings and  profits. On December 15, 1965, A Corporation distributes an amount  equivalent to $15,000 to M in X Country. Neither M nor A Corporation can  obtain a license to export currency from X Country. In his return for  the taxable year 1965, M elects a method of accounting under which the  reporting of blocked foreign income is deferred until the income ceases  to be blocked. Accordingly, M does not include the $15,000 in his gross  income for 1965.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> During 1966, A Corporation has no income and no earnings and  profits. On February 1, 1966, notwithstanding the laws and regulations  of X Country which forbid the exchange of X Country's currency into  United States dollars, M converts an amount equivalent to $15,000 into a  currency which is readily convertible into United States dollars. Since  the income has ceased to be   blocked, M must include $15,000 in his gross income for 1966.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Manner of claiming existence of restriction or limitation on  distribution of earnings and profits. A United States shareholder  claiming that an amount of the earnings and profits of a controlled  foreign corporation for the taxable year was subject to a currency or  other restriction or limitation imposed under the laws of a foreign  country on its distribution shall file a statement with his return for  the taxable year with or within which the taxable year of the foreign  corporation ends which shall include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The name and address of the foreign corporation,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A description of the classes of stock of the foreign corporation  and a statement of the number of shares of each class owned (within the  meaning of section 958(a)) or considered as owned (by applying the rules  of ownership of section 958(b)) by the United States shareholder,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A description of the currency or other restriction or limitation  on the distribution of earnings and profits,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The total earnings and profits of the foreign corporation for  the taxable year (before any amount is excluded from earnings and  profits under this section) and the United States shareholder's pro rata  share of such total earnings and profits,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The United States shareholder's pro rata share of the amount of  earnings and profits subject to a restriction or limitation on  distribution,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The amounts which would be includible in the United States  shareholder's gross income under section 951(a) but for the existence of  the currency or other restriction or limitation,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> A description of the available procedures for distributing  earnings and profits and a statement setting forth the steps taken to  exhaust such procedures or a statement setting forth the reasons that  the use of such procedures would be futile, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The amount of distributions made in a foreign country and a  statement as to whether a method of accounting has been elected under  which the reporting of blocked income is deferred until such income  ceases to be blocked, including an identification of the taxable year  and place of filing of such election.  In addition, such United States shareholder shall furnish to the  district director such other information as he may require to verify the  status of a currency or other restriction or limitation.  [T.D. 6892, 31 FR 11142, Aug. 23, 1966, as amended by T.D. 7545, 43 FR  19652, May 8, 1978; T.D. 7893, 48 FR 22510, May 19, 1983]</p>
