                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Written procedures. The Owner shall adopt written tenant  selection procedures that ensure nondiscrimination in the selection of  tenants and that are consistent with the purpose of improving housing  opportunities for very low-income elderly persons and persons with  disabilities (as applicable); and reasonably related to program  eligibility and an applicant's ability to perform the obligations of the  lease. Owners shall promptly inform in writing any rejected applicant of  the grounds for any rejection. Additionally, Owners shall maintain a  written, chronological waiting list showing the name, race, gender,  ethnicity, and date of each person applying for the program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application for admission. The Owner must accept applications  for admission to the project in the form prescribed by HUD, and (under  the Section 202 Program only) is obligated to confirm all information  provided by applicant families on the application. Applicant households  applying for assisted units (or residential spaces in a group home) must  complete a certification of eligibility as part of the application for  admission. Applicant households must meet the disclosure and  verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24  CFR part 5, subpart B. Applicant families must sign and submit consent  forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage  Information Collection Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart  B. Both the Owner and the applicant household must complete and sign the  application for admission. On request, the Owner must furnish copies of  all applications for admission to HUD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determination of eligibility and selection of tenants. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The  Owner is responsible for determining whether applicants are eligible for  admission and for the selection of households. To be eligible for  admission, an applicant must be an elderly person or a person with  disabilities, as applicable (as defined in Sec. Sec. 891.205 and  891.305, respectively); must meet the disclosure and verification  requirements for Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5,  subpart B; must sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage  and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies,  as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B; and must be a very low-income  family, as defined in Sec. 891.105.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Under the Section 811 Program:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In order to be eligible for admission, the applicant must also  meet any project occupancy requirements approved by HUD.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Owners shall make selections in a nondiscriminatory manner  without regard to considerations such as race, religion, color, sex,  national origin, familial status, or disability. An Owner may, with the  approval of the Secretary, limit occupancy within housing developed  under this part 891 to persons with disabilities who have similar  disabilities and require a similar set of supportive services in a  supportive housing environment. However, the Owner must permit occupancy  by any qualified person with a disability who could benefit from the  housing and/or services provided regardless of the person's disability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Unit assignment. If the Owner determines that the household is  eligible and is otherwise acceptable and units (or residential spaces in  a group home) are available, the Owner will assign the household a unit  or residential space in a group home. If the household will occupy an  assisted unit, the Owner will assign the household a unit of the  appropriate size in accordance with HUD's general occupancy guidelines.  If no suitable unit (or residential space in a group home) is available,  the Owner will place the household on a waiting list for the project and  notify the household when a suitable unit or residential space may  become available. If the waiting list is so long that the applicant  would not be likely to be admitted for the next 12 months, the Owner may  advise the applicant that no additional applications for admission are  being considered for that reason.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Ineligibility determination. If the Owner determines that an  applicant is ineligible for admission or the Owner is not selecting the  applicant for other reasons, the Owner will promptly notify the  applicant in writing of the determination, the reasons for the  determination, and the applicant's right to request a meeting to review  the rejection, in accordance with HUD requirements. The review, if  requested, may not be conducted by a member of the Owner's staff who  made the initial decision to reject the applicant. The applicant may  also exercise other rights (e.g., rights granted under Federal, State or  local civil rights laws) if the applicant believes he or she is being  discriminated against on a prohibited basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Records. Records on applicants and approved eligible households,  which provide racial, ethnic, gender and place of previous residency  data required by HUD, must be retained for three years. See Sec.  891.410(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section, the Owner must require the  household to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for  Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B. For  requirements regarding the signing and submitting of consent forms by  families for obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage  Information Collection Agencies, see 24 CFR part 5, subpart B.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Interim reexaminations. The household must comply with the  provisions in its lease regarding interim reporting of changes in  income. If the Owner receives information concerning a change in the  household's income or other circumstances between regularly scheduled  reexaminations, the Owner must consult with the household and make any  adjustments determined to be appropriate. See 24 CFR part 5, subpart B  for the requirements for the disclosure and verification of Social  Security Number at interim reexaminations involving new household  members. For requirements regarding the signing and submitting of  consent forms by families for the obtaining of wage and claim  information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, see 24 CFR  part 5, subpart B. Any change in the   household's income or other circumstances that result in an adjustment  in the total tenant payment, tenant payment, and project rental  assistance payment must be verified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Continuation of project rental assistance payment. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A  household shall remain eligible for project rental assistance payment  until the total tenant payment equals or exceeds the gross rent (or a  pro rata share of the gross rent in a group home). The termination of  subsidy eligibility will not affect the household's other rights under  its lease. Project rental assistance payment may be resumed if, as a  result of changes in income, rent or other relevant circumstances during  the term of the PRAC, the household meets the income eligibility  requirements of 24 CFR part 813 (as modified in Sec. 891.105) and  project rental assistance is available for the unit or residential space  under the terms of the PRAC. The household will not be required to  establish its eligibility for admission to the project under the  remaining requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A household's eligibility for project rental assistance payment  may be terminated in accordance with HUD requirements for such reasons  as failure to submit requested verification information, including  information related to disclosure and verification of Social Security  Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B or failure to sign and  submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information  from State Wage Information Collection Agencies (as provided by 24 CFR  part 5, subpart B).  [61 FR 11956, Mar. 22, 1996, as amended at 65 FR 16724, Mar. 29, 2000]</p>
