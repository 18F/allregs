                            <p class="depth0">You may ask us to provide a temporary exemption to allow you to complete production of your engines at different facilities, as long as you maintain control of the engines until they are in their certified configuration. We may require you to take specific steps to ensure that such engines are in their certified configuration before reaching the ultimate purchaser. You may request an exemption under this section in your application for certification, or in a separate submission.
