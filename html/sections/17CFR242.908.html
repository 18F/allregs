Notwithstanding any other provision of Secs. 242.900 through 242.909, a person shall not incur any obligation under Secs. 242.900 through 242.909 unless it is:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A U.S. person; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A registered security-based swap dealer or registered major security-based swap participant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Substituted compliance--(1) General. Compliance with the regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements in sections 13(m) and 13A of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78m(m) and 78m-1), and the rules and regulations thereunder, may be satisfied by compliance with the rules of a foreign jurisdiction that is the subject of a Commission order described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, provided that at least one of the direct counterparties to the security-based swap is either a non-U.S. person or a foreign branch.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General.

(i) The Commission may, conditionally or unconditionally, by order, make a substituted compliance determination regarding regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-based swaps with respect to a foreign jurisdiction if that jurisdiction's requirements for the regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-based swaps are comparable to otherwise applicable requirements. The Commission may, conditionally or unconditionally, by order, make a substituted compliance determination regarding regulatory reporting of security-based swaps that are subject to Sec. 242.908(a)(2) with respect to a foreign jurisdiction if that jurisdiction's requirements for the regulatory reporting of security-based swaps are comparable to otherwise applicable requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Commission may, conditionally or unconditionally, by order, make a substituted compliance determination regarding regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-based swaps with respect to a foreign jurisdiction if that jurisdiction's requirements for the regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-based swaps are comparable to otherwise applicable requirements.

The Commission shall not make such a substituted compliance determination unless it finds that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The data elements that are required to be reported pursuant to the rules of the foreign jurisdiction are comparable to those required to be reported pursuant to Sec. 242.901;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The rules of the foreign jurisdiction require the security-based swap to be reported and publicly disseminated

in a manner and a timeframe comparable to those required by Secs. 242.900 through 242.909 (or, in the case of transactions that are subject to Sec. 242.908(a)(2) but not to Sec. 242.908(a)(1), the rules of the foreign jurisdiction require the security-based swap to be reported in a manner and a timeframe comparable to those required by Secs. 242.900 through 242.909);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The Commission has direct electronic access to the security-based swap data held by a trade repository or foreign regulatory authority to which security-based swaps are reported pursuant to the rules of that foreign jurisdiction; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Any trade repository or foreign regulatory authority in the foreign jurisdiction that receives and maintains required transaction reports of security-based swaps pursuant to the laws of that foreign jurisdiction is subject to requirements regarding data collection and maintenance; systems capacity, integrity, resiliency, availability, and security; and recordkeeping that are comparable to the requirements imposed on security-based swap data repositories by the Commission's rules and regulations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Before issuing a substituted compliance order pursuant to this section, the Commission shall have entered into memoranda of understanding and/or other arrangements with the relevant foreign financial regulatory authority or authorities under such foreign financial regulatory system addressing supervisory and enforcement cooperation and other matters arising under the substituted compliance determination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The Commission may, on its own initiative, modify or withdraw such order at any time, after appropriate notice and opportunity for comment.</p>
