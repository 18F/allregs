                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Technical and coordination responsibilities. In carrying out the  provisions of this part, NRCS shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Oversee the development and application of criteria to identify  hydric soils in consultation with the National Technical Committee for  Hydric Soils and make available to the public an approved county list of  hydric soil map units, which is based upon the National List of Hydric  Soils;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Coordinate with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and others in  updating the National List of Plant Species that Occur in Wetlands;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Make or approve wetland determinations, delineations and  certifications, functional assessments, mitigation plans, categorical  minimal effects, and other technical determinations relative to the  implementation of the wetland conservation provisions of this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Develop and utilize off-site and on-site wetland identification  procedures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Assure quality of service and determinations through procedures  developed by NRCS in consultation with other Federal agencies that have  wetland responsibilities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Investigate complaints and make technical determinations  regarding potential violations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Develop a process at the state level, in coordination with the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to ensure that these provisions are  carried out in a technically defensible and timely manner, seek  assistance as appropriate, and annually review the progress being made  on implementation; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Technical assistance from others In carrying out the provisions  of this part, NRCS may request technical assistance from the U.S. Fish  and Wildlife Service, State or local agencies,   conservation districts, or qualified private entities when NRCS  determines that additional staff resources or technical expertise are  needed to address adequately the requirements of this part or to enhance  the quality of implementation of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Certification of wetland determinations and wetland  delineations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Certification of a wetland determination means that  the wetland determination is of sufficient quality to make a  determination of ineligibility for program benefits under Sec. 12.4 of  this part. NRCS may certify a wetland determination without making a  field investigation. NRCS will notify the person affected by the  certification and provide an opportunity to appeal the certification  prior to the certification becoming final. All wetland determinations  made after July 3, 1996, will be done on a tract basis and will be  considered certified wetland determinations. A not-inventoried  designation within a certified wetland is subject to change when the  soil, hydrology, and vegetation evaluation is completed and identified  as to type of wetland or as a non-wetland. This change from a not- inventoried designation to an approved wetland designation will be done  at the request of the landowner or during a formal investigation of a  potential violation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The wetland determination and wetland delineation shall be  certified as final by the NRCS official 30 days after providing the  person notice of certification or, if an appeal is filed with USDA,  after the administrative appeal procedures are exhausted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the case of an appeal, NRCS will review and certify the  accuracy of the determination of all lands subject to the appeal to  ensure that the subject lands have been accurately delineated. Prior to  a decision being rendered on the appeal, NRCS will conduct an on-site  investigation of the subject land.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Before any benefits are withheld, an on-site investigation of a  potential wetland violation will be made by NRCS. The affected person  will be provided an opportunity to appeal the on-site determination to  USDA if the on-site determination differs from the original  determination. Such action by NRCS shall be considered a review of the  prior determination and certification of the delineation. If the prior  determination was a certified wetland determination, an appeal of the  NRCS on-site determination shall be limited to the determination that  the wetland was converted in violation of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A copy of the information from the final certified wetland  determination and the wetland delineation shall be recorded on official  USDA aerial photography, digital imagery, or other graphic  representation of the area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> As long as the affected person is in compliance with the wetland  conservation provision of this part, and as long as the area is devoted  to the use and management of the land for production of food, fiber, or  horticultural crops, a certification made under this section will remain  valid and in effect until such time as the person affected by the  certification requests review of the certification by NRCS. A person may  request review of a certification only if a natural event alters the  topography or hydrology of the subject land to the extent that the final  certification is no longer a reliable indication of site conditions, or  if NRCS concurs with an affected person that an error exists in the  current wetland determination  [61 FR 47025, Sept. 6, 1996; 61 FR 53491, Oct. 11, 1996; 76 FR 22785,  Apr. 25, 2011]</p>
