                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Personal Property Disposition. The general guidelines and procedures for property disposition are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 41 CFR chapters 101 and 102 implements 40 U.S.C. subtitle I and section 101 which established the Personal Property Disposition Program. 41 CFR chapter 101 and other laws and regulations apply to the disposition of FEPP, excess, and surplus property. In the event of conflicting guidance, 41 CFR chapters 101 and 102 takes precedence. 41 CFR chapter 102 is the successor regulation to 41 CFR chapter 101, the ``Federal Property Management Regulation''. It updates regulatory policies of 41 CFR chapter 101.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All references to ``days'' are calendar days unless otherwise specified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Department of Defense provides guidance for budgeting for the disposal of excess, surplus, and FEPP property through DoD 7000.14-R, ``Department of Defense Financial Management Regulations (FMRs): Volume 12, `Special Accounts Funds and Programs'; Chapter 7, `Financial Liability for Government Property Lost, Damaged, Destroyed, or Stolen' '' (http://comptroller.defense.gov/fmr/current/12/12_07.pdf), with updates via program budget decisions. The Service level billing is based on the services turn-in percentage of the Disposition Services workload. As an example, if the Army constitutes 40 percent of the workload the Army will pay 40 percent of the Disposition Services Service-level bill.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Billings are addressed to each Military Department, Defense Agency, and FCA.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Billing for disposition of excess property depends on decisions made between DLA and the customer: the Military Department, Defense Agency, those sponsoring DoD-related organizations (e.g., Civil Air Patrol, MARS) or FCA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope and Relevancy. (1) In conjunction with DoD 4160.28-M Volumes 1-3, the provisions of this part apply to service providers, whether they are working at a government facility or at a commercial site, and to contractors to the extent it is stipulated in the performance work statement of the contracts. DoD 4160.28-M and 10 U.S.C. 2576 contain additional specific guidance for property identified as MLI or CCLI.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In conjunction with DoD 4160.28-M Volumes 1-3, the provisions of this part apply to service providers, whether they are working at a government facility or at a commercial site, and to contractors to the extent it is stipulated in the performance work statement of the contracts. DoD 4160.28-M and 10 U.S.C. 2576 contain additional specific guidance for property identified as MLI or CCLI.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The procedures in this subpart will be used to the extent possible in all contingency operations. As appropriate, the ASD(L&MR;) will modify policy guidance to support the mission requirements and operational tempo of contingency operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> This subpart does not govern the disposal of the property described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section. However, once property in these categories has been altered to remove the inherently sensitive characteristics, it may be processed through a DLA Disposition Services site using an appropriate FSC code for the remaining components.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Items Under Management Control of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency in Federal Supply Group (FSG) 11. These items include Department of Energy special design and quality controlled items and all DoD items designed specifically for use on or with nuclear weapons. These items are identified by manufacturers' codes 57991, 67991, 77991, and 87991 in the DLA Logistics Information Service FLIS.
