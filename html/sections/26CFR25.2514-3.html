                                Sec. 25.2514-3  Powers of appointment created after October 21, 1942.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The exercise, release, or lapse (except as provided  in paragraph (c) of this section) of a general power of appointment  created after October 21, 1942, is deemed to be a transfer of property  by the individual possessing the power. The exercise of a power of  appointment that is not a general power is considered to be a transfer  if it is exercised to create a further power under certain circumstances  (see paragraph (d) of this section). See paragraph (c) of Sec. 25.2514- 1 for the definition of various terms used in this section. See  paragraph (b) of this section for the rules applicable to determine the  extent to which joint powers created after October 21, 1942, are to be  treated as general powers of appointment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Joint powers created after October 21, 1942. The treatment of a  power of appointment created after October 21, 1942, which is  exercisable only in conjuction with another person is governed by  section 2514(c)(3), which provides as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Such a power is not considered as a general power of appointment  if it is not exercisable by the possessor except with the consent or  joinder of the creator of the power.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Such power is not considered as a general power of appointment  if it is not exercisable by the possessor except with the consent or  joinder of a person having a substantial interest in the property  subject to the power which is adverse to the exercise of the power in  favor of the possessor, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of  his estate. An interest adverse to the exercise of a power is considered  as substantial if its value in relation to the total value of the  property subject to the power is not insignificant. For this purpose,  the interest is to be valued in accordance with the actuarial principles  set forth in Sec. 25.2512-5 or, if it is not susceptible to valuation  under those provisions, in accordance with the general principles set  forth in Sec. 25.2512-1. A taker in default of appointment under a  power has an interest which is adverse to an exercise of the power. A  coholder of the power has no adverse interest merely because of his  joint possession of the power nor merely because he is a permissible  appointee under a power. However, a coholder of a power is considered as  having an adverse interest where he may possess the power after the  possessor's death and may exercise it at that time in favor of himself,  his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his estate. Thus, for  example, if X, Y, and Z held a power jointly to appoint among a group of  persons which includes themselves and if on the death of X the power  will pass to Y and Z jointly, then Y and Z are considered to have  interests adverse to the exercise of the power in favor of X. Similarly,  if on Y's death the power will pass to Z, Z is considered to have an  interest adverse to the exercise of the power in favor of Y. The  application of this subparagraph may be further illustrated by the  following examples in each of which it is assumed that the value of the  interest in question is substantial:</p><p class="depth3">Example (1). The taxpayer and R are trustees of a trust under which  the income is to be paid to the taxpayer for life and then to M for  life, and R is remainderman. The trustees have power to distribute  corpus to the taxpayer. Since R's interest is substantially adverse to  an exercise of the power in favor of the taxpayer, the latter does not  have a general power of appointment. If M and the taxpayer were  trustees, M's interest would likewise be adverse.</p><p class="depth3">Example (2). The taxpayer and L are trustees of a trust under which  the income is to be paid to L for life and then to M for life, and the  taxpayer is remainderman. The trustees have power to distribute corpus  to the taxpayer during L's life. Since L's interest is adverse to an  exercise of the power in favor of the taxpayer, the taxpayer does not  have a general power of appointment. If the taxpayer and M were  trustees, M's interest would likewise be adverse.</p><p class="depth3">Example (3). The taxpayer and L are trustees of a trust under which  the income is to be paid to L for life. The trustees can designate  whether corpus is to be distributed to the taxpayer or to A after L's  death. L's interest is not adverse to an exercise of the power in favor  of the taxpayer, and the taxpayer therefore has a general power of  appointment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A power which is exercisable only in conjunction with another  person, and which after application of the rules set forth in  subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph, constitutes a general power  of appointment, will be treated as though the holders of the power who   are permissible appointees of the property were joint owners of property  subject to the power. The possessor, under this rule, will be treated as  possessed of a general power of appointment over an aliquot share of the  property to be determined with reference to the number of joint holders,  including the possessor, who (or whose estates or creditors) are  permissible appointees. Thus, for example, if X, Y, and Z hold an  unlimited power jointly to appoint among a group of persons, including  themselves, but on the death of X the power does not pass to Y and Z  jointly, then Y and Z are not considered to have interests adverse to  the exercise of the power in favor of X. In this case, X is considered  to possess a general power of appointment as to one-third of the  property subject to the power.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Partial releases, lapses, and disclaimers of general powers of  appointment created after October 21, 1942--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Partial release of  power. The general principles set forth in Sec. 25.2511-2 for  determining whether a donor of property (or of a property right or  interest) has divested himself of all or any portion of his interest  therein to the extent necessary to effect a completed gift are  applicable in determining whether a partial release of a power of  appointment constitutes a taxable gift. Thus, if a general power of  appointment is partially released so that thereafter the donor may still  appoint among a limited class of persons not including himself the  partial release does not effect a complete gift, since the possessor of  the power has retained the right to designate the ultimate beneficiaries  of the property over which he holds the power and since it is only the  termination of such control which completes a gift.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Power partially released before June 1, 1951. If a general power  of appointment created after October 21, 1942, was partially released  prior to June 1, 1951, so that it no longer represented a general power  of appointment, as defined in paragraph (c) of Sec. 25.2514-1, the  subsequent exercise, release, or lapse of the partially released power  at any time thereafter will not constitute the exercise or release of a  general power of appointment. For example, assume that A created a trust  in 1943 under which B possessed a general power of appointment. By an  instrument executed in 1948 such general power of appointment was  reduced in scope by B to an excepted power. The inter vivos exercise in  1955, or in any ``calendar period'' (as defined in Sec. 25.2502- 1(c)(1)) thereafter, of such excepted power is not considered an  exercise or release of a general power of appointment for purposes of  the gift tax.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Power partially released after May 31, 1951. If a general power  of appointment created after October 21, 1942, was partially released  after May 31, 1951, the subsequent exercise, release or a lapse of the  power at any time thereafter, will constitute the exercise or release of  a general power of appointment for gift tax purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Release or lapse of power. A release of a power of appointment  need not be formal or express in character. For example, the failure to  exercise a general power of appointment created after October 21, 1942,  within a specified time so that the power lapses, constitutes a release  of the power. In any case where the possessor of a general power of  appointment is incapable of validly exercising or releasing a power, by  reason of minority, or otherwise, and the power may not be validly  exercised or released on his behalf, the failure to exercise or release  the power is not a lapse of the power. If a trustee has in his capacity  as trustee a power which is considered as a general power of  appointment, his resignation or removal as trustee will cause a lapse of  his power. However, section 2514(e) provides that a lapse during any  calendar year is considered as a release so as to be subject to the gift  tax only to the extent that the property which could have been appointed  by exercise of the lapsed power of appointment exceeds the greater of  (i) $5,000, or (ii) 5 percent of the aggregate value, at the time of the  lapse, of the assets out of which, or the proceeds of which, the  exercise of the lapsed power could be satisfied. For example, if an  individual has a noncumulative right to withdraw $10,000 a year from the  principal of a trust fund, the failure to exercise this right of  withdrawal in a particular year will not constitute a gift if the fund  at the end of the year equals or exceeds $200,000. If, however, at the  end of the   particular year the fund should be worth only $100,000, the failure to  exercise the power will be considered a gift to the extent of $5,000,  the excess of $10,000 over 5 percent of a fund of $100,000. Where the  failure to exercise a power, such as a right of withdrawal, occurs in  more than a single year, the value of the taxable transfer will be  determined separately for each year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Disclaimer of power created after December 31, 1976. A  disclaimer or renunciation of a general power of appointment created in  a transfer made after December 31, 1976, is not considered a release of  the power for gift tax purposes if the disclaimer or renunciation is a  qualified disclaimer as described in section 2518 and the corresponding  regulations. For rules relating to when a transfer creating the power  occurs, see Sec. 25.2518-2(c)(3). If the disclaimer or renunciation is  not a qualified disclaimer, it is considered a release of the power.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Disclaimer of power created before January 1, 1977. A disclaimer  or renunciation of a general power of appointment created in a taxable  transfer before January 1, 1977, in the person disclaiming is not  considered a release of the power. The disclaimer or renunciation must  be unequivocal and effective under local law. A disclaimer is a complete  and unqualified refusal to accept the rights to which one is entitled.  There can be no disclaimer or renunciation of a power after its  acceptance. In the absence of facts to the contrary, the failure to  renounce or disclaim within a reasonable time after learning of the  existence of a power shall be presumed to constitute an acceptance of  the power. In any case where a power is purported to be disclaimed or  renounced as to only a portion of the property subject to the power, the  determination as to whether there has been a complete and unqualified  refusal to accept the rights to which one is entitled will depend on all  the facts and circumstances of the particular case, taking into account  the recognition and effectiveness of such a disclaimer under local law.  Such rights refer to the incidents of the power and not to other  interests of the possessor of the power in the property. If effective  under local law, the power may be disclaimed or renounced without  disclaiming or renouncing such other interests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The first and second sentences of paragraph (c)(5) of this  section are applicable for transfers creating the power to be disclaimed  made on or after December 31, 1997.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>, if the exercise of the second power can validly postpone the  vesting of any estate or interest in the property or can suspend the  absolute ownership or power of alienation of the property for   a period ascertainable without regard to the date of the creation of the  first power.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The application of this section may be further  illustrated by the following examples in each of which it is assumed,  unless otherwise stated, that S has transferred property in trust after  October 21, 1942, with the remainder payable to R at L's death, and that  neither L nor R has any interest in or power over the enjoyment of the  trust property except as is indicated separately in each example:</p><p class="depth2">Example (1). The income is payable to L for life. L has the power to  cause the income to be paid to R. The exercise of the right constitutes  the making of a transfer of property under section 2511. L's power does  not constitute a power of appointment since it is only a power to  dispose of his income interest, a right otherwise possessed by him.</p><p class="depth2">Example (2). The income is to be accumulated during L's life. L has  the power to have the income distributed to himself. If L's power is  limited by an ascertainable standard (relating to health, etc.) as  defined in paragraph (c)(2) of Sec. 25.2514-1, the lapse of such power  will not constitute a transfer of property for gift tax purposes. If L's  power is not so limited, its lapse or release during L's lifetime may  constitute a transfer of property for gift tax purposes. See especially  paragraph (c)(4) of Sec. 25.2514-3.</p><p class="depth2">Example (3). The income is to be paid to L for life. L has a power,  exercisable at any time, to cause the corpus to be distributed to  himself. L has a general power of appointment over the remainder  interest, the release of which constitutes a transfer for gift tax  purposes of the remainder interest. If in this example L had a power to  cause the corpus to be distributed only to X, L would have a power of  appointment which is not a general power of appointment, the exercise or  release of which would not constitute a transfer of property for  purposes of the gift tax. Although the exercise or release of the  nongeneral power is not taxable under this section, see Sec. 25.2514- 1(b)(2) for the gift tax consequences of the transfer of the life income  interest.</p><p class="depth2">Example (4). The income is payable to L for life. R has the right to  cause the corpus to be distributed to L at any time. R's power is not a  power of appointment, but merely a right to dispose of his remainder  interest, a right already possessed by him. In such a case, the exercise  of the right constitutes the making of a transfer of property under  section 2511 of the value, if any, of his remainder interest. See  paragraph (e) of Sec. 25.2511-1.</p><p class="depth2">Example (5). The income is to be paid to L. R has the right to  appoint the corpus to himself at any time. R's general power of  appointment over the corpus includes a general power to dispose of L's  income interest therein. The lapse or release of R's general power over  the income interest during his life may constitute the making of a  transfer of property. See especially paragraph (c)(4) of Sec. 25.2514- 3.
