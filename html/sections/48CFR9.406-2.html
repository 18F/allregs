The liability is  finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally  determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.  In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is  not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been  exhausted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is  delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full  payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases  where enforced collection action is precluded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Examples. (1) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of  deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek  Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent  tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek  Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the  taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to  an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice  under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with  the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further  appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien  filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to  contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no  prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax  because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax  court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer  has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant  to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in  full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent  because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer  is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11  U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Knowing failure by a principal, until 3 years after final  payment on any Government contract awarded to the contractor, to timely  disclose to the Government, in connection with the award, performance,  or closeout of the contract or a subcontract thereunder, credible  evidence of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Violation of Federal criminal law involving fraud, conflict of  interest, bribery, or gratuity violations found in Title 18 of the  United States Code;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Violation of the civil False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729-3733);  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Significant overpayment(s) on the contract, other than  overpayments resulting from contract financing payments as defined in  32.001.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A contractor, based on a determination by the Secretary of  Homeland Security or the Attorney General of the United States, that the  contractor is not in compliance with Immigration and Nationality Act  employment provisions (see Executive Order 12989, as amended by  Executive Order 13286). Such determination is not reviewable in the  debarment proceedings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A contractor or subcontractor based on any other cause of so  serious or compelling a nature that it affects the present  responsibility of the contractor or subcontractor.
