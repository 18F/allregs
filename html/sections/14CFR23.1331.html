                            <p class="depth0">For each instrument that uses a power source, the following apply:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each instrument must have an integral visual power annunciator  or separate power indicator to indicate when power is not adequate to  sustain proper instrument performance. If a separate indicator is used,  it must be located so that the pilot using the instruments can monitor  the indicator with minimum head and eye movement. The power must be  sensed at or near the point where it enters the instrument. For electric  and vacuum/pressure instruments, the power is considered to be adequate  when the voltage or the vacuum/pressure, respectively, is within  approved limits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The installation and power supply systems must be designed so  that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The failure of one instrument will not interfere with the proper  supply of energy to the remaining instrument; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The failure of the energy supply from one source will not  interfere with the proper supply of energy from any other source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For certification for Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations  and for the heading, altitude, airspeed, and attitude, there must be at  least:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Two independent sources of power (not driven by the same engine  on multiengine airplanes), and a manual or an automatic means to select  each power source; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A separate display of parameters for heading, altitude,  airspeed, and attitude that has a power source independent from the  airplane's primary electrical power system.
