                            <p class="depth0">Small containers of hazardous waste in overpacked drums (lab packs) may be placed in a landfill if the following requirements are met:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Hazardous waste must be packaged in non-leaking inside containers. The inside containers must be of a design and constructed of a material that will not react dangerously with, be decomposed by, or be ignited by the contained waste. Inside containers must be tightly and securely sealed. The inside containers must be of the size and type specified in the Department of Transportation (DOT) hazardous materials regulations (49 CFR parts 173, 178, and 179), if those regulations specify a particular inside container for the waste.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The inside containers must be overpacked in an open head DOT-specification metal shipping container (49 CFR parts 178 and 179) of no more than 416-liter (110 gallon) capacity and surrounded by, at a minimum, a sufficient quantity of sorbent material, determined to be nonbiodegradable in accordance with Sec. 264.314(d), to completely sorb all of the liquid contents of the inside containers. The metal outer container must be full after it has been packed with inside containers and sorbent material.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The sorbent material used must not be capable of reacting dangerously with, being decomposed by, or being ignited by the contents of the inside containers, in accordance with Sec. 264.17(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Incompatible wastes, as defined in Sec. 260.10 of this chapter, must not be placed in the same outside container.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Reactive wastes, other than cyanide- or sulfide-bearing waste as defined in Sec. 261.23(a)(5) of this chapter, must be treated or rendered non-reactive prior to packaging in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. Cyanide- and sulfide-bearing reactive waste may be packed in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section without first being treated or rendered non-reactive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Such disposal is in compliance with the requirements of part 268. Persons who incinerate lab packs according to the requirements in 40 CFR 268.42(c)(1) may use fiber drums in place of metal outer containers. Such fiber drums must meet the DOT specifications in 49 CFR 173.12 and be overpacked according to the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section.
