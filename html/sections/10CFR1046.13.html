                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> PF medical certification standards. All applicant and incumbent PF personnel must satisfy the applicable Medical Certification Standards set forth in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Requirements of the medical evaluation to determine medical certification. (1) The medical evaluation must be made by the Designated Physician without delegation (e.g., to a physician's assistant or nurse practitioner).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The medical evaluation must be made by the Designated Physician without delegation (e.g., to a physician's assistant or nurse practitioner).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Evaluations of incumbent security police officers must include a medical history, the results of the examination, and a formal written determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A site standard form approved by the Chief Medical Officer must be used, and pertinent negatives must be documented on the form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The Medical Certification Standards are the minimum medical standards to be used in determining whether applicants and incumbent PF personnel can effectively perform, with or without reasonable accommodation, all essential functions of normal and emergency duties without imposing an undue hardship on the employer or posing a direct threat to the PF member or others, the facility, or the general public. All reasonable accommodations as defined in this part must be approved in writing by the PF contractor with a determination that the use of the device is compatible with all actions associated with emergency and protective equipment without creating a hardship for the contractor. The Designated Physician and PPMD must determine that the reasonable accommodation is consistent with the medical standard without creating a direct threat to the individual or to others.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> General medical standards for PF personnel. The examinee must possess the mental, sensorial, and motor skills to perform, safely and efficiently, all applicable essential job functions described in Sec. 1046.11 and those designated in the current job analysis submitted by PF management to the Designated Physician/PPMD. Specific qualifications for SOs and SPOs are set forth in paragraphs (d) and (e), respectively, of this section. Reasonable accommodations shall be provided pursuant to the requirements of the ADAAA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Specific medical standards for SOs--(1) Head, face, neck, and scalp. Configuration suitable for fitting and effective use of personal protective equipment when the use of such equipment is required by assigned normal or emergency job duties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Head, face, neck, and scalp. Configuration suitable for fitting and effective use of personal protective equipment when the use of such equipment is required by assigned normal or emergency job duties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sense of smell. Ability to detect the odor of combustion products and of tracer or marker gases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Speech. Capacity for clear and audible speech as required for effective communications of the job.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Hearing. Hearing loss with or without aids not to exceed 30 decibels (db) average at 500, 1000, and 2000 Hertz (Hz), with no loss greater than 40 db at any one of these frequencies and the ability to localize sounds with a difference of not more than 15 db average loss between the two ears. If hearing aids are necessary, suitable testing procedures shall be used to ensure auditory acuity equivalent to the above requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Vision. Near and distant visual acuity, with or without correction, of at least 20/25 in one eye and no worse than 20/40 in the other eye.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Color vision. Ability to distinguish red, green, and yellow. Acceptable measures of color discrimination include the Ishihara; Hardy, Rand, & Rittler; and Dvorine pseudoisochromatic plates (PIP) when administered and scored according to the manufacturer's instructions. Tinted lenses such as the X-Chrom contact lenses or tinted spectacle lenses effectively alter the standard illumination required for all color vision tests, thereby invalidating the results and are not permitted during color vision testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Cardiorespiratory. Capacity to use a respirator other than self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) when required by local assignment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Nutritional/metabolic. Ability to accommodate to changing work and meal schedules without potential or actual incapacity. Status adequate to meet the stresses and demands of assigned normal and emergency job duties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Specific medical standards for SPOs.

Capacity for clear and audible speech as required for effective communications on the job.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Hearing. Hearing loss without aids not to exceed 30 db average at 500, 1000, 2000 Hz, with no loss greater than 40 db at any of these frequencies and the ability to localize sounds with a difference of not more than 15 db average loss between the two ears. Hearing loss beyond indicated level would interfere with ability to function and respond to commands in emergency situations. Use of a hearing aid is allowed for one ear only with the remaining ear qualifying for no more than an average of 30 db loss at frequencies of 500, 1000 and 2000 Hz. If a hearing aid is necessary, suitable testing procedures must be used to assure auditory acuity equivalent to the above requirement for the difference between two ears.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Vision. (i) Near and distant vision. Near and distant visual acuity sufficient to effectively perform emergency-related essential functions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Near and distant vision.

The use of hypertensive medications is acceptable if there are no side effects present that would preclude adequate functions as herein specified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If an examination reveals significant evidence of cardiovascular abnormality or significantly increased risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) as determined by the examining physician (e.g., by using the Framingham Point System), an evaluation by a specialist in internal medicine or cardiology may be required and evaluated by the Designated Physician. An electrocardiogram is required at entry, at age 40, and annually thereafter, which must be free from significant abnormality. If such abnormalities are detected, then a stress electrocardiogram with non-ischemic results must be provided, or the individual must be referred to a cardiologist for a fitness for duty examination. A stress electrocardiogram must be performed every other year beginning at age 50 with the results reviewed by the Designated Physician.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Neurological, mental, and emotional. Absence of central and peripheral nervous system conditions that could adversely affect ability to perform normal and emergency duties or to handle firearms safely. A test for peripheral neuropathy at fingers and toes is required annually. Absence of neurotic or psychotic conditions which would adversely affect the ability to handle firearms safely or to act safely and efficiently under normal and emergency conditions. Psychologists and psychiatrists identified to conduct evaluations, assessments, testing, and/or diagnoses associated with medical qualifications of this part must meet standards established by DOE.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Musculoskeletal. Absence of conditions that could reasonably be expected to interfere with the safe and effective performance of essential physical activities such as running, walking, crawling, climbing stairs, and standing for prolonged periods of time.

Have no known significant abnormal intolerance to chemical, mechanical, and other physical agent exposures to the skin that may be encountered during routine and emergency duties, as specified at the site. Capability to tolerate use of personal protective covering and decontamination procedures when required by assigned job duties. Facial hair cannot be allowed to interfere with respirator fitting, and any such growth or a skin condition which could preclude respirator fit is not acceptable and must be documented.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Endocrine/nutritional/metabolic. Ability to accommodate to changing work and meal schedules without potential or actual incapacity. Status adequate to meet the stresses and demands of assigned normal and emergency job duties. A full evaluation and approval of reasonable accommodation by the PPMD is required for hiring and retention when metabolic syndrome is identified and/or when diabetes is controlled by other than diet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Additional medical or physical tests. For those facilities where it is necessary to determine the medical qualification of SPOs or SPO applicants to perform special assignment duties which might require exposure to unusually high levels of stress or physical exertion, Field Elements may develop more stringent medical qualification requirements or additional medical or physical tests, in collaboration with the PPMD, as necessary for such determinations. All such additional qualification requirements must be coordinated with the Office of Health, Safety and Security prior to application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Medical examination procedures and requirements. (1) The medical examinations required for certification must be performed at the following intervals:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The medical examinations required for certification must be performed at the following intervals:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Applicants for PF member positions must undergo a comprehensive medical examination, as specified herein.
