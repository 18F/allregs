                            <p class="depth0">This section sets forth the Tribal Transportation Allocation Methodology (TTAM) that BIA uses to allocate IRR Program funds. After appropriate statutory and regulatory set-asides, as well as other takedowns, the remaining funds are allocated as follows:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19JY04.001</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A statutorily determined percentage to a tribal transportation planning program (under 23 U.S.C. 204(j)); and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The remainder to a pool of funds designated as ``Remaining funding available for distribution.'' This ``Remaining funding available for distribution'' pool is further allocated as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 5 percent to a discretionary pool for IRR High Priority Projects (IRRHPP); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 95 percent to pool for distribution by the following Relative Need Distribution Factor (RNDF) as defined in Sec. 170.223:
(50 percent Cost to Construct + 30 percent Vehicle Miles Traveled + 20 percent Population)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the annual authorization is greater than $275 million, then the amount above $275 million, after appropriate statutory and regulatory set-asides, as well as other takedowns are applied, will be allocated as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 12.5 percent to the IRRHPP (Sec. 170.205);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 12.5 percent to the Population Adjustment Factor (PAF) (Sec. 170.220); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> 75 percent to the RNDF (Sec. 170.223).</p>
