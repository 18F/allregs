Written comments will be solicited from ad hoc reviewers when required, and individual written comments and in-depth discussions will be provided by peer review group members prior to recommending applications for funding. Applications will be ranked and support levels recommended within the limitation of total available funding for each research program area as announced in the applicable request for proposals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No awarding official will make a research project grant based upon an application covered by this part unless the application has been reviewed by a
