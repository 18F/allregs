If we have released a record, or a part of a record, to others in the past, we will ordinarily release it to you also. However, we will not release it to you if a statute forbids this disclosure, and we will not necessarily release it to you if an exemption applies in your situation and did not apply, or applied differently, in the previous situations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unauthorized disclosure. The principle stated in paragraph (a) of this section, does not apply if the previous release was unauthorized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Poor copy. If we cannot make a legible copy of a record to be released, we do not attempt to reconstruct it. Instead, we furnish the best copy possible and note its poor quality in our reply.</p>
