                                Sec. 19.18  How does a debtor request a special review based on a death, or disability?

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Material change in circumstances. A debtor who owes a Commerce  debt may, at any time, request a special review by the applicable  Commerce entity of the amount of any offset, administrative wage  garnishment, or voluntary payment, based on materially changed  circumstances beyond the control of the debtor such as, but not limited  to, catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Inability to pay. For purposes of this section, in determining  whether an involuntary or voluntary payment would prevent the debtor  from meeting essential subsistence expenses (e.g., costs incurred for  food, housing, clothing, transportation, and medical care), the debtor  shall submit a detailed statement and supporting documents for the  debtor, his or her spouse, and dependents, indicating:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Income from all sources;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assets;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Liabilities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Number of dependents;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Expenses for food, housing, clothing, and transportation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Medical expenses;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Exceptional expenses, if any; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Any additional materials and information that the Commerce  entity may request relating to ability or inability to pay the amount(s)  currently required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Alternative payment arrangement. If the debtor requests a  special review under this section, the debtor shall submit an  alternative proposed payment schedule and a statement to the Commerce  entity collecting the Commerce debt, with supporting documents, showing  why the current offset, garnishment or repayment schedule imposes an  extreme financial hardship on the debtor. The Commerce entity will  evaluate the statement and documentation and determine whether the  current offset, garnishment, or repayment schedule imposes extreme  financial hardship on the debtor. The Commerce entity shall notify the  debtor in writing of such determination, including, if appropriate, a  revised offset, garnishment, or payment schedule. If the special review  results in a revised offset, garnishment, or repayment schedule, the  Commerce entity will notify the appropriate Federal agency or other  persons about the new terms.</p>
