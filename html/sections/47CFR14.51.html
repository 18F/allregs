                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All papers filed in any formal complaint proceeding must be  drawn in conformity with the requirements of Secs. 1.49 and 1.50 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All averments of claims or defenses in complaints and answers  shall be made in numbered paragraphs. The contents of each paragraph  shall be limited as far as practicable to a statement of a single set of  circumstances. Each claim founded on a separate transaction or  occurrence and each affirmative defense shall be separately stated to  facilitate the clear presentation of the matters set forth.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The original of all pleadings and other submissions filed by any  party shall be signed by the party, or by the party's attorney. The  signing party shall include in the document his or her address,  telephone number, facsimile number and the date on which the document  was signed. Copies should be conformed to the original. Unless  specifically required by rule or statute, pleadings need not be  verified. The signature of an attorney or party shall be a certificate  that the attorney or party has read the pleading, motion, or other  paper; that to the best of his or her knowledge, information, and belief  formed after reasonable inquiry, it is well grounded in fact and is  warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension,  modification, or reversal of existing law; and that it is not interposed  solely for purposes of delay or for any other improper purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All proposed orders shall be submitted both as hard copies and  on computer disk formatted to be compatible with the Commission's  computer system and using the Commission's current word processing  software. Each disk should be submitted in ``read only'' mode. Each disk  should be clearly labeled with the party's name, proceeding, type of  pleading, and date of submission. Each disk should be accompanied by a  cover letter. Parties who have submitted copies of tariffs or reports  with their hard copies need not include such tariffs or reports on the  disk. Upon showing of good cause, the Commission may waive the  requirements of this paragraph.</p>
