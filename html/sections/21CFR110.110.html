                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Some foods, even when produced under current good manufacturing  practice, contain natural or unavoidable defects that at low levels are  not hazardous to health. The Food and Drug Administration establishes  maximum levels for these defects in foods produced under current good  manufacturing practice and uses these levels in deciding whether to  recommend regulatory action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Defect action levels are established for foods whenever it is  necessary and feasible to do so. These levels are subject to change upon  the development of new technology or the availability of new  information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Compliance with defect action levels does not excuse violation  of the requirement in section 402(a)(4) of the act that food not be  prepared, packed, or held under unsanitary conditions or the  requirements in this part that food manufacturers, distributors, and  holders shall observe current good manufacturing practice. Evidence  indicating that such a violation exists causes the food to be  adulterated within the meaning of the act, even though the amounts of  natural or unavoidable defects are lower than the currently established  defect action levels. The manufacturer, distributor, and holder of food  shall at all times utilize quality control operations that reduce  natural or unavoidable defects to the lowest level currently feasible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The mixing of a food containing defects above the current defect  action level with another lot of food is not permitted and renders the  final food adulterated within the meaning of the act, regardless of the  defect level of the final food.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A compilation of the current defect action levels for natural or  unavoidable defects in food for human use that present no health hazard  may be obtained upon request from the Center for Food Safety and Applied  Nutrition (HFS-565), Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch  Pkwy., College Park, MD 20740.
