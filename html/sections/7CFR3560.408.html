                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Borrowers must obtain Agency approval prior to entering  into a lease agreement related to any property serving as security for  Agency loans. An environmental review must be completed in accordance  with 7 CFR part 1940, subpart G, before the Agency can give lease  approval for real property serving as security for Agency loans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Leases to public housing authorities. Borrowers may not lease  all or part of their housing facilities to a housing authority. Lease  agreements in place prior to the effective date of this regulation may  be continued provided that leases are in a form acceptable to the  housing authority and are on terms that will enable the borrower to  comply with Agency program requirements, to meet Agency program  objectives, and make loan and other required payments to the Agency on  an Agency approved schedule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Lease of a portion of the security property. The Agency may,  subject to the applicable provisions governing loan purposes found in of  Sec. 3560.53, Sec. 3560.553 and Sec. 3560.603, approve the leasing of  facilities related to a housing project (e.g., central kitchens,  recreation facilities, laundry rooms, and community rooms) when the  borrower will continue to operate the facilities for the purposes for  which the loan was made. Agency approval is not required for leases with  a term of less than 30 days. The Agency will only approve a lease with a  term over 30 days if the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The lease is in the best interest of the borrower, the tenants,  and the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount of the consideration agreed to in the lease is  adequate to pay all prorated operating and maintenance expenses, a  prorated share of the annual reserve deposit, and the prorated part of  the loan amortization at the note rate of interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All compensation and considerations, whether payments, a share  of proceeds, or improvements to the property paid for by the lessee,  must be disclosed to the Agency. No payments or   compensation for entering into a lease shall flow to the borrower or any  identity-of-interest related to the borrower.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The lease provides at its termination for the restoration of the  leased space to its original condition or a condition acceptable to the  owner and the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Consent to the lease will not exceed 3 years at a time unless  the Agency determines that a longer lease is advantageous to the  borrower, the tenants, and the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> When another lienholder's mortgage requires that lienholder's  consent to a lease, the borrower must obtain written consent from the  lienholder before the Agency will consider approving the lease.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Mineral leases. Mineral leases will be handled according to 7  CFR 3550.159 except that all references to County Supervisor will be  construed to mean District Director when applied to the MFH Programs.</p>
