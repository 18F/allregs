In any case in which a bidder or prospective contractor or proposed subcontractor who has participated in a previous contract or subcontract subject to the equal opportunity clause has not filed a compliance report due under applicable instructions, such bidder, prospective contractor or proposed subcontractors shall submit a compliance report prior to the award of the proposed contract or subcontract. When a determination has been made to award a contract to a specific contractor, such contractor shall, prior to award, furnish such other pertinent information regarding his own employment policies and practices as well as those of his proposed subcontractors as the FAA, the sponsor, or the Director of the Office of Federal Contract compliance may require.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The sponsor or his contractors shall give express notice of the requirements of this paragraph (d) in all invitations for bids or negotiations for contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Enforcement.

The term ``applicant'' in the provisions of part 60-1 incorporated by reference in this section means the sponsor, except where part 60-1 refers to an applicant for employment, and the term ``administering agency'' therein means the FAA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Applicability to existing agreements and contracts. This section applies to grant agreements made after December 20, 1964, and before July 1, 1968.
