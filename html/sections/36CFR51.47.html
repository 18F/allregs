                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this section, any person may appeal to the Director a determination that a concessioner is or is not a preferred offeror for the purposes of a right of preference in renewal, including, without limitation, whether the applicable new concession contract is or is not a qualified concession contract as described in this part. This appeal must specify the grounds for the appeal and be received by the Director in writing no later than 30 days after the date of the determination. If applicable, the Director may extend the submission date for an appeal under this section upon request

by the concessioner if the Director determines that good cause for an extension exists.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The appeal provided by this section will not apply to determinations that a concessioner is not a preferred offeror as a consequence of two or more less than satisfactory annual evaluations as described in this part as the concessioner is given an opportunity to appeal those evaluations after they are made in accordance with applicable administrative guidelines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Director must consider an appeal under this section personally or must authorize a Deputy Director or Associate Director to consider the appeal. The deciding official must prepare a written decision on the appeal, taking into account the content of the appeal, other written information available, and the requirements of this part. The written decision on the appeal must be issued by the date of selection of the best proposal submitted in response to a prospectus. If the appeal results in a concessioner being determined a preferred offeror, then the concessioner will have a right of preference to the qualified concession contract as described in and subject to the conditions of this part, including, but not limited to, the obligation to submit a responsive proposal pursuant to the terms of the related prospectus. If the appeal results in a determination that a concessioner is not a preferred offeror, no right of preference will apply to the award of the related concession contract and the award will be made in accordance with the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No person will be considered as having exhausted administrative remedies with respect to a determination by the Director that a concessioner is or is not a preferred offeror until the Director issues a written decision in response to an appeal submitted pursuant to this section, or, where applicable, pursuant to an appeal provided by the administrative guidelines described in paragraph (b) of this section. The decision of the Director is final agency action.</p>
