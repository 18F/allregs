The Corporation may in its discretion also include a copy of a concise statement of its reasons for not making the requested amendment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The General Counsel (or designee) may on his or her own motion refer an appeal to the Board of Directors for a determination, and the Board of Directors on its own motion may consider an appeal.
