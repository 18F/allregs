This is determined by calculating  the ratio of the total activity of each radionuclide to the category 1  threshold for that radionuclide and adding the ratios together. If the  sum is equal to or exceeds 1, the quantity would be considered a  category 1 quantity. Category 1 quantities of radioactive material do  not include the radioactive material contained in any fuel assembly,  subassembly, fuel rod, or fuel pellet.</p><p class="depth0">Category 2 quantity of radioactive material means a quantity of  radioactive material meeting or exceeding the category 2 threshold but  less than the category 1 threshold in Table 1 of Appendix A to this  part. This is determined by calculating the ratio of the total activity  of each radionuclide to the category 2 threshold for that radionuclide  and adding the ratios together. If the sum is equal to or exceeds 1, the  quantity would be considered a category 2 quantity. Category 2  quantities of radioactive material do not include the radioactive  material contained in any fuel assembly, subassembly, fuel rod, or fuel  pellet.</p><p class="depth0">Commission means the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission or its duly  authorized representatives.</p><p class="depth0">Curie means that amount of radioactive material which disintegrates  at the rate of 37 billion atoms per second.</p><p class="depth0">Diversion means the unauthorized movement of radioactive material  subject to this part to a location different from the material's  authorized destination inside or outside of the site at which the  material is used or stored.</p><p class="depth0">Escorted access means accompaniment while in a security zone by an  approved individual who maintains continuous direct visual surveillance  at all times over an individual who is not approved for unescorted  access.</p><p class="depth0">Fingerprint orders means the orders issued by the U.S. Nuclear  Regulatory Commission or the legally binding requirements issued by  Agreement States that require fingerprints and criminal history records  checks for individuals with unescorted access to category 1 and category  2 quantities of radioactive material or safeguards information-modified  handling.</p><p class="depth0">Government agency means any executive department, commission,  independent establishment, corporation, wholly or partly owned by the  United States of America which is an instrumentality of the United  States, or any board, bureau, division, service, office, officer,  authority, administration, or other establishment in the executive  branch of the Government.</p><p class="depth0">License, except where otherwise specified, means a license for  byproduct material issued pursuant to the regulations in parts 30  through 36 and 39 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth0">License issuing authority means the licensing agency that issued the  license, i.e. the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission or the appropriate  agency of an Agreement State;</p><p class="depth0">Local law enforcement agency (LLEA) means a public or private  organization that has been approved by a federal, state, or local  government to carry firearms and make arrests, and is authorized and has  the capability to provide an armed response in the jurisdiction where  the licensed category 1 or category 2 quantity of radioactive material  is used, stored, or transported.</p><p class="depth0">Lost or missing licensed material means licensed material whose  location is unknown.
