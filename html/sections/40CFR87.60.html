                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Use the equipment and procedures specified in Appendix 3, Appendix 5, and Appendix 6 of ICAO Annex 16 (incorporated by reference in Sec. 87.8), as applicable, to demonstrate whether engines meet the gaseous emission standards specified in subpart C of this part. Measure the emissions of all regulated gaseous pollutants. Similarly, use the equipment and procedures specified in Appendix 2 and Appendix 6 of ICAO Annex 16 to determine whether engines meet the smoke standard specified in subpart C of this part. The compliance demonstration consists of establishing a mean value from testing some number of engines, then calculating a ``characteristic level'' by applying a set of statistical factors that take into account the number of engines tested. Round each characteristic level to the same number of decimal places as the corresponding emission standard. For turboprop engines, use the procedures specified for turbofan engines, consistent with good engineering judgment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Use a test fuel meeting the specifications described in Appendix 4 of ICAO Annex 16 (incorporated by reference in Sec. 87.8). The test fuel must not have additives whose purpose is to suppress smoke, such as organometallic compounds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Prepare test engines by including accessories that are available with production engines if they can reasonably be expected to influence emissions. The test engine may not extract shaft power or bleed service air to provide power to auxiliary gearbox-mounted components required to drive aircraft systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Test engines must reach a steady operating temperature before the start of emission measurements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In consultation with the EPA, the FAA may approve alternate procedures for measuring emissions as specified in this paragraph (e). This might include testing and sampling methods, analytical techniques, and equipment specifications that differ from those specified in this part. Manufacturers and operators may request this approval by sending a written request with supporting justification to the FAA and to the Designated EPA Program Officer. Such a request may be approved only if one of the following conditions is met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The engine cannot be tested using the specified procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The alternate procedure is shown to be equivalent to or better (e.g., more accurate or precise) than the specified procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The following landing and take-off (LTO) cycles apply for emission testing and calculating weighted LTO values:</p><p class="depth2">Table 1 to Sec.  87.60--LTO Test Cycles--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Turboprop                   Subsonic turbofan              Supersonic turbofan</p><p class="depth2">------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Mode                             Percent of     Time in mode     Percent of     Time in mode     Percent of      Time in mode</p><p class="depth2">rated output      (minutes)     rated output      (minutes)     rated output      (minutes)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Take-off...............................................             100             0.5             100             0.7             100              1.2Climb..................................................              90             2.5              85             2.2              65              2.0Descent................................................  ..............  ..............  ..............  ..............              15              1.2Approach...............................................              30             4.5              30             4.0              34              2.3Taxi/ground idle.......................................               7            26.0               7            26.0             5.8             26.0--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Engines comply with an applicable standard if the testing results show that the engine type certificate family's characteristic level does not exceed the numerical level of that standard, as described in Sec. 87.60.
