                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> SBA has entered into a Master Servicing Agreement designating a  Central Servicing Agent (CSA) to support the orderly flow of funds among  Borrowers, CDCs, and SBA. The CDC and Borrower must enter into an  individual Servicing Agent Agreement with the CSA for each 504 loan,  constituting acceptance by the CDC and the Borrower of the terms of the  Master Servicing Agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The CSA has established a master reserve account. All funds  related to the 504 loans and Debentures flow through the master reserve  account under the provisions of the Master Servicing Agreement. The  master reserve account will be funded by a guarantee fee, a funding fee  to be published from time to time in the Federal Register, and by  principal and interest payments of 504 loans. At SBA's direction, the  CSA may use funds in the master reserve account to defray program  expenses. In the event a Borrower defaults and its 504 note is  accelerated, SBA shall add funds under its guarantee to ensure the full  and timely payment of the Debenture which funded the 504 loan. At SBA's  direction, the CSA must pay to the CDC servicing each loan the interest  accruing in the master reserve account on loan payments made by each  Borrower between   the date of receipt of each monthly payment and the date of disbursement  to investors. The CSA may disburse such interest periodically to CDCs on  a pro rata basis. SBA may use interest accruals in the master reserve  account earned prior to October 1991 (not previously distributed to the  CDCs) for the costs of 504 program administration.</p>
