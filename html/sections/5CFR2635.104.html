Except as provided in paragraph (d)  of this section, an employee on detail, including a uniformed officer on  assignment, from his employing agency to another agency for a period in  excess of 30 calendar days shall be subject to any supplemental agency  regulations of the agency to which he is detailed rather than to any  supplemental agency regulations of his employing agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Details to the legislative or judicial branch. An employee on  detail, including a uniformed officer on assignment, from his employing  agency to the legislative or judicial branch for a period in excess of  30 calendar days shall be subject to the ethical standards of the branch  or entity to which detailed. For the duration of any such detail or  assignment, the employee shall not be subject to the provisions of this  part, except this section, or, except as provided in paragraph (d) of  this section, to any supplemental agency regulations of his employing  agency, but shall remain subject to the conflict of interest  prohibitions in title 18 of the United States Code.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Details to non-Federal entities. Except to the extent exempted  in writing pursuant to this paragraph, an employee detailed to a non- Federal entity remains subject to this part and to any supplemental  agency regulation of his employing agency. When an employee is detailed  pursuant to statutory authority to an international organization or to a  State or local government for a period in excess of six months, the  designated agency ethics official may grant a written exemption from  subpart B of this part based on his determination that the entity has  adopted written ethical standards covering solicitation and acceptance  of gifts which will apply to the employee during the detail and which  will be appropriate given the purpose of the detail.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Applicability of special agency statutes. Notwithstanding  paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, an employee who is subject to an  agency statute which restricts his activities or financial holdings  specifically because of his status as an employee of that agency shall  continue to be subject to any provisions in the supplemental agency  regulations of his employing agency that implement that statute.</p>
