                            <p class="depth0">When an application results in a grant, the application and  supporting information become part of the record of NIFA transactions,  and available to the public upon specific request. Information that the  Secretary determines to be of a confidential, privileged, or proprietary  nature will be held in confidence to the extent permitted by law.  Therefore, any information that the applicant wishes to have considered  as confidential, privileged, or proprietary should be clearly marked  within the application. The original copy of an application that does  not result in a grant will be retained by the Agency for a period of one  year. Other copies will be destroyed. Such an application will be  released only with the consent of the applicant or to the extent  required by law. An application may be withdrawn at any time prior to  the final action thereon.</p>
