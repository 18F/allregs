                                Sec. 301.6011-7  Specified tax return preparers required to file
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Individual income tax return. The term individual income tax  return means any return of tax imposed by subtitle A on individuals,  estates, and trusts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Specified tax return preparer. The term specified tax return  preparer means any person who is a tax return preparer, as defined in  section 7701(a)(36) and Sec. 301.7701-15, unless that person reasonably  expects to file 10 or fewer individual income tax returns in a calendar  year. If a person who is a tax return preparer is a member of a firm,  that person is a specified tax return preparer unless the person's firm  members in the aggregate reasonably expect to file 10 or fewer  individual income tax returns in a calendar year. Solely for the 2011  calendar year, a person will not be considered a specified tax return   preparer if that person reasonably expects, or if the person is a member  of a firm, the firm's members in the aggregate reasonably expect, to  file fewer than 100 individual income tax returns in the 2011 calendar  year. Solely for purposes of this section, a person is considered a  member of a firm if the person is an employee, agent, member, partner,  shareholder, or other equity holder of the firm.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> File or Filed. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of section 6011(e)(3) and these  regulations only, an individual income tax return is considered to be  ``filed'' by a tax return preparer or a specified tax return preparer if  the preparer submits the individual income tax return to the IRS on the  taxpayer's behalf, either electronically (by e-file or other magnetic  media) or in non-electronic (paper) form. Submission of an individual  income tax return by a tax return preparer or a specified tax return  preparer in non-electronic form includes the transmission, sending,  mailing or otherwise delivering of the paper individual income tax  return to the IRS by the preparer, any member, employee, or agent of the  preparer, or any member, employee, or agent of the preparer's firm.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An individual income tax return will not be considered to be  filed, as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, by a tax  return preparer or specified tax return preparer if the tax return  preparer or specified tax return preparer who prepared the return  obtains, on or prior to the date the individual income tax return is  filed, a hand-signed and dated statement from the taxpayer (by either  spouse if a joint return) that states the taxpayer chooses to file the  individual income tax return in paper format, and that the taxpayer, and  not the preparer, will submit the paper individual income tax return to  the IRS. The IRS may provide guidance through forms, instructions or  other appropriate guidance regarding how tax return preparers and  specified tax return preparers can document a taxpayer's choice to file  an individual income tax return in paper format.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The rules contained in this section do not alter or affect a  taxpayer's obligation to file returns under any other provision of law.  The definition of file or filed by a tax return preparer or specified  tax return preparer contained in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section  applies only for the purposes of section 6011(e)(3) and these  regulations and does not apply for any other purpose under any other  provision of law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Magnetic media filing requirement. Except as provided in  paragraphs (a)(4)(ii) and (c) of this section, any individual income tax  return prepared by a specified tax return preparer in a calendar year  must be filed on magnetic media if the return is filed by the specified  tax return preparer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Exclusions. The following exclusions apply to the magnetic media  filing requirement in this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Undue hardship waiver. The IRS may grant a waiver of the  requirement of this section in cases of undue hardship. An undue  hardship waiver may be granted upon application by a specified tax  return preparer consistent with instructions provided in published  guidance and as prescribed in relevant forms and instructions. A  determination of undue hardship will be based upon all facts and  circumstances. The undue hardship waiver provided to a specified tax  return preparer may apply to a series or class of individual income tax  returns or for a specified period of time, subject to the terms and  conditions regarding the method of filing prescribed in such waiver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Administrative exemptions. The IRS may provide administrative  exemptions from the requirement of this section for certain classes of  specified tax return preparers, or regarding certain types of individual  income tax returns, as the IRS determines necessary to promote effective  and efficient tax administration. The IRS may provide administrative  exemptions and any criteria or procedures necessary to claim an  administrative exemption through forms, instructions, or other  appropriate guidance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Reasonably expect to file--(1) In general. The determination of  whether a tax return preparer reasonably expects, or if the preparer is  a member of a firm, the firm's members in the aggregate reasonably  expect, to file 10 or fewer individual income tax returns (or, in the  case of the 2011 calendar   year, fewer than 100 individual income tax returns) is made by adding  together all of the individual income tax returns the tax return  preparer and, if the preparer is a member of a firm, the firm's members  reasonably expect to prepare and file in the calendar year. In making  this determination, individual income tax returns that the tax return  preparer reasonably expects will not be subject to the magnetic media  filing requirement under paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section or are  excluded from the requirement under (c)(2) of this section are not to be  counted. Individual income tax returns excluded from the magnetic media  filing requirement under paragraph (c)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section are to be  counted for purposes of making this determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Time for making determination of reasonable expectations. The  determination regarding reasonable expectations is made separately for  each calendar year in order to ascertain whether the magnetic media  filing requirement applies to a tax return preparer for that year. For  each calendar year, the determination of whether a tax return preparer  and the preparer's firm reasonably expect to file 10 or fewer individual  income tax returns (or, in the case of the 2011 calendar year, fewer  than 100 individual income tax returns) is made based on all relevant,  objective, and demonstrable facts and circumstances prior to the time  the tax return preparer and the preparer's firm first file an individual  income tax return during the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of  paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Tax Return Preparer A is an accountant who recently  graduated from college with an accounting degree and has opened his own  practice. A has not prepared individual income tax returns for  compensation in the past and does not plan to focus his practice on  individual income tax return preparation. A intends instead to focus his  practice on providing specialized accounting services to certain health  care service providers. A has no plans to, and does not, employ or  engage any other tax return preparers. A estimates that he may be asked  by some clients to prepare and file their individual income tax returns  for compensation, but A expects that the number of people who do ask him  to provide this service will be no more than seven in 2012. In fact, A  actually prepares and files six paper Forms 1040 (U.S. Individual Income  Tax Return) in 2012. Due to a growing client base, and based upon his  experience in 2012, A expects that the number of individual income tax  returns he will prepare and file in 2013 will at least double,  estimating he will prepare and file 12 Form 1040 returns in 2013. A does  not qualify as a specified tax return preparer for 2012 because A  reasonably expects to file 10 or fewer returns (seven) in 2012.  Consequently, A is not required to electronically file the individual  income tax returns he prepares and files in 2012. A's expectation is  reasonable based on his business projections, individual income tax  return filing history, and staffing decisions. A is a specified tax  return preparer in 2013, however, because based on those same factors A  reasonably expects to file more than 10 individual income tax returns  (12) during that calendar year. A, therefore, must electronically file  all individual income tax returns that A prepares and files in 2013 that  are not otherwise excluded from the electronic filing requirement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Same facts as in Example 1, except three of Tax Return  Preparer A's clients specifically chose to have A prepare their  individual income tax returns in paper format in 2012 with the clients  mailing their respective returns to the IRS. A expects that these three  clients will similarly choose to have him prepare their returns in paper  format in 2013, with the clients being responsible for mailing their  returns to the IRS. A is not required to electronically file these three  returns in 2013 because the taxpayers chose to file their returns in  paper format. A obtained a hand-signed and dated statement from each of  those taxpayers, indicating that they chose to file their returns in  paper format. These three individual income tax returns are not counted  in determining how many individual income tax returns A reasonably  expects to file in 2013. Because the total number of individual income  tax returns A reasonably expects to file in 2013 (nine) does not exceed  10, A is not a specified tax return preparer for calendar year 2013, and  A is not required to electronically file any individual income tax  return that he prepares and files in 2013.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Tax Return Preparer B is a solo general practice attorney  in a small county. Her practice includes the preparation of wills and  assisting executors in administering estates. As part of her practice, B  infrequently prepares and files Forms 1041 (U.S. Income Tax Return for  Estates and Trusts) for executors. In the past three years, she prepared  and filed an average of five Forms 1041 each year and never exceeded  more than seven Forms 1041 in any year. Based on B's prior experience  and her estimate for 2012, made prior to the time she first files an  individual income tax return in 2012, she reasonably expects to prepare  and   file no more than five Forms 1041 in 2012. Due to the unforeseen deaths  of several of her clients in late 2011, B actually prepares and files 12  Forms 1041 in 2012. B does not find out about these deaths until after  she has already filed the first Form 1041 in 2012 for another client. B  is not required to electronically file these returns in 2012. She does  not qualify as a specified tax return preparer for calendar year 2012  because prior to the time she filed the first Form 1041 in 2012, she  reasonably expected to file 10 or fewer individual income tax returns in  2012.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Same facts as Example 3, except, in addition to the five  Forms 1041 that she expects to prepare and file in 2012, Tax Return  Preparer B also expects to prepare and file 10 paper Forms 1040 (U.S.  Individual Income Tax Return) in 2012, based upon the requests that she  has received from some of her clients. Because the total number of  individual income tax returns B reasonably expects to file in 2012  (fifteen) exceeds 10, B is a specified tax return preparer for calendar  year 2012, and B must electronically file all individual income tax  returns that B prepares and files in 2012 that are not otherwise  excluded from the electronic filing requirement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Firm X consists of two tax return preparers, Tax Return  Preparer C who owns Firm X, and Tax Return Preparer D who is employed by  C in Firm X. Based upon the firm's experience over the past three years,  C and D reasonably expect to file nine and ten individual income tax  returns for compensation, respectively, in 2012. Both C and D must  electronically file the individual income tax returns that they prepare  in 2012, unless the returns are otherwise excluded from the electronic  filing requirement, because they are members of the same firm and the  aggregated total of individual income tax returns that they reasonably  expect to file in 2012 (nineteen), exceeds 10 individual income tax  returns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Additional guidance. The IRS may implement the requirements of  this section through additional guidance, including by revenue  procedures, notices, publications, forms and instructions, including  those issued electronically.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em>-1  Disclosure by taxable party to the tax-exempt entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Requirement of disclosure--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as provided in  paragraph (d)(2) of this section, any taxable party (as defined in  paragraph (c) of this section) to a prohibited tax shelter transaction  (as defined in section 4965(e) and Sec. 53.4965-3 of this chapter) must  disclose by statement to each tax-exempt entity (as defined in section  4965(c) and Sec. 53.4965-2 of this chapter) that the taxable party  knows or has reason to know is a party to such transaction (as defined  in paragraph (b) of this section) that the transaction is a prohibited  tax shelter transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determining whether a taxable party knows or has reason to know.  Whether a taxable party knows or has reason to know that a tax-exempt  entity is a party to a prohibited tax shelter transaction is based on  all the facts and circumstances. If the taxable party knows or has  reason to know that a prohibited tax shelter transaction involves a tax- exempt, tax indifferent or tax-favored entity, relevant factors for  determining whether the taxable party knows or has reason to know that a  specific tax-exempt entity is a party to the transaction include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The extent of the efforts made to determine whether a tax-exempt  entity is facilitating the transaction by reason of its tax-exempt, tax  indifferent or tax-favored status (or is identified in published  guidance, by type, class or role, as a party to the transaction); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a tax-exempt entity is facilitating the transaction by  reason of its tax-exempt, tax indifferent or tax-favored status (or is  identified in published guidance, by type, class or role, as a party to  the transaction), the extent of the efforts made to determine the  identity of the tax-exempt entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definition of tax-exempt party to a prohibited tax shelter  transaction. For purposes of section 6011(g), a tax-exempt entity is a  party to a prohibited tax shelter transaction if the entity is defined  as such under Sec. 53.4965-4 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definition of taxable party--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of  this section, the term taxable party means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(A)</em>,  (B), or (C), 20.6011-4, 25.6011-4, 31.6011-4, 53.6011-4, 54.6011-4, or  56.6011-4 of this chapter; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A person who is designated as a taxable party by the Secretary  in published guidance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Certain listed transactions. If a transaction  that was otherwise not a prohibited tax shelter transaction becomes a  listed transaction after the filing of a person's tax return (including  an amended return) reflecting either tax consequences or a tax strategy  described in the published guidance listing the transaction (or a tax  benefit derived from tax consequences or a tax strategy described in the  published guidance listing the transaction), the person is a taxable  party beginning on the date the transaction is described as a listed  transaction in published guidance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Persons designated as non-parties. Published guidance may  identify which persons, by type, class or role, will not be treated as a  party to a prohibited tax shelter transaction for purposes of section  6011(g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Time for providing disclosure statement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A  taxable party to a prohibited tax shelter transaction must make the  disclosure required by this section to each tax-exempt entity that the  taxable party knows or has reason to know is a party to the transaction  within 60 days after the last to occur of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The date the person becomes a taxable party to the transaction  within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The date the taxable party knows or has reason to know that the  tax-exempt entity is a party to the transaction within the meaning of  paragraph (b) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> July 6, 2010.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Termination of a disclosure obligation. A person shall not be  required to provide the disclosure otherwise required by this section if  the person does not know or have reason to know that the tax-exempt  entity is a party to the transaction within the meaning of paragraph (b)  of this section on or before the first date on which the transaction is  required to be disclosed by the person under Sec. Sec. 1.6011-4,  20.6011-4, 25.6011-4, 31.6011-4, 53.6011-4, 54.6011-4, or 56.6011-4 of  this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Disclosure is not required with respect to any prohibited tax  shelter transaction entered into by a tax-exempt entity on or before May  17, 2006.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Frequency of disclosure. One disclosure statement is required  per tax-exempt entity per transaction. See paragraph (h) of this section  for rules relating to designation agreements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Form and content of disclosure statement. The statement  disclosing to the tax-exempt entity that the transaction is a prohibited  tax shelter transaction must be a written statement that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Identifies the type of prohibited tax shelter transaction  (including the published guidance citation for a listed transaction);  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> States that the tax-exempt entity's involvement in the  transaction may subject either it or its entity manager(s) or both to  excise taxes under section 4965 and to disclosure obligations under  section 6033(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> To whom disclosure is made. The disclosure statement must be  provided--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the case of a non-plan entity as defined in Sec. 53.4965- 2(b) of this chapter, to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any entity manager of the tax-exempt entity with authority or  responsibility similar to that exercised by an officer, director or  trustee of an organization; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a person described in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section is  not known, to the primary contact on the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a plan entity as defined in Sec. 53.4965-2(c) of  this chapter, including a fully self-directed qualified plan, IRA, or  other savings arrangement, to any entity manager of the plan entity who  approved or otherwise caused the entity to become a party to the  prohibited tax shelter transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Designation agreements. If more than one taxable party is  required to disclose a prohibited tax shelter transaction under this  section, the taxable parties may designate by written agreement a single  taxable party to disclose the transaction. The transaction must then be  disclosed in accordance with this section. The designation of one  taxable party to disclose the transaction does not relieve the other  taxable parties of their obligation to disclose the transaction to a   tax-exempt entity that is a party to the transaction in accordance with  this section, if the designated taxable party fails to disclose the  transaction to the tax-exempt entity in a timely manner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Penalty for failure to provide disclosure statement. See section  6707A for the penalty applicable to the failure to disclose a prohibited  tax shelter transaction in accordance with this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Effective date/applicability date. This section will apply with  respect to transactions entered into by a tax-exempt entity after May  17, 2006.  [T.D. 9492, 75 FR 38709, July 6, 2010]</p><p class="depth0">Income Tax Returns</p>
