                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The effective date for a new waiver of Medicaid requirements to  provide home and community-based services approved under this subpart is  established by CMS prospectively on or after the date of approval and  after consultation with the State agency. The initial approved waiver  continues for a 3-year period from the effective date. If the agency  requests it, the waiver may be extended for additional periods unless--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> CMS's review of the prior waiver period shows that the  assurances required by Sec.  441.302 were not met; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> CMS is not satisfied with the assurances and documentation  provided by the State in regard to the extension period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(6))</em>, CMS will consider it to be two  requests: One as an extension request for the existing group, and the  other as a new waiver request for the new group. Waivers may be extended  for additional 5-year periods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> CMS may grant a State an extension of its existing waiver for up  to 90 days to permit the State to document more fully the satisfaction  of statutory and regulatory requirements needed to approve a new waiver  request. CMS will consider this option when it requests additional  information on a new waiver request submitted by a State to extend its  existing waiver or when CMS disapproves a State's request for extension.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The agency may request that waiver modifications be made  effective retroactive to the first day of a waiver year, or another date  after the first day of a waiver year, in which the amendment is  submitted, unless the amendment involves substantive changes as  determined by CMS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Substantive changes include, but are not limited to, revisions  to services available under the waiver including elimination or  reduction of services, or reduction in the scope, amount, and duration  of any service, a change in the qualifications of service providers,  changes in rate methodology or a constriction in the eligible  population.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A request for an amendment that involves a substantive change as  determined by CMS, may only take effect on or after the date when the  amendment is approved by CMS, and must be accompanied by information on  how the State has assured smooth transitions and minimal effect on  individuals adversely impacted by the change.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The agency must provide public notice of any significant  proposed change in its methods and standards for setting payment rates  for services   in accordance with Sec.  447.205 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The agency must establish and use a public input process, for  any changes in the services or operations of the waiver.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This process must be described fully in the State's waiver  application and be sufficient in light of the scope of the changes  proposed, to ensure meaningful opportunities for input for individuals  served, or eligible to be served, in the waiver.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This process must be completed at a minimum of 30 days prior to  implementation of the proposed change or submission of the proposed  change to CMS, whichever comes first.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> This process must be used for both existing waivers that have  substantive changes proposed, either through the renewal or the  amendment process, and new waivers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> This process must include consultation with Federally-recognized  Tribes, and in accordance with section 5006(e) of the American Recovery  and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5), Indian health programs and  Urban Indian Organizations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If CMS finds that the Medicaid agency is not meeting one or  more of the requirements for a waiver contained in this subpart, the  agency is given a notice of CMS' findings and an opportunity for a  hearing to rebut the findings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If CMS determines that the agency is substantively out of  compliance with this subpart after the notice and any hearing, CMS may  employ strategies to ensure compliance as described in paragraph (g)(3)  of this section or terminate the waiver.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Strategies to ensure compliance may include the imposition of  a moratorium on waiver enrollments, other corrective strategies as  appropriate to ensure the health and welfare of waiver participants, or  the withholding of a portion of Federal payment for waiver services  until such time that compliance is achieved, or other actions as  determined by the Secretary as necessary to address non-compliance with  1915(c) of the Act, or termination. When a waiver is terminated, the  State must comport with Sec.  441.307.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> CMS will provide states with a written notice of the impending  strategies to ensure compliance for a waiver program. The notice of CMS'  intent to utilize strategies to ensure compliance would include the  nature of the noncompliance, the strategy to be employed, the effective  date of the compliance strategy, the criteria for removing the  compliance strategy and the opportunity for a hearing.
