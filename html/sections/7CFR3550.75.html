                            <p class="depth0">Persons interested in applying for a section 502 loan may, but are not required to, submit an application through the certified loan application packaging process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The certified loan application packaging process involves individuals who have been designated as an Agency-certified loan application packager, their qualified employers, and, if required by the State Director, Agency-approved intermediaries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Process requirements. To package section 502 loan applications under this process, each of the following conditions must be met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Agency-certified loan application packager. An individual who wishes to

acquire RHS certification as a loan application packager must meet all of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Have at least one year of affordable housing loan origination and/or affordable housing counseling experience;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Be employed (either as an employee or as an independent contractor) by a qualified employer as outlined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Complete an Agency-approved loan application packaging course and successfully pass the corresponding test as specified in paragraph (c) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Submit applications to the Agency via an intermediary if determined necessary by a State Director.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Qualified employer. Individuals who have been designated as an Agency-certified loan application packager must be employed (either as an employee or as an independent contractor) by a qualified employer. To be considered a qualified employer, the packager's employer must meet each of the conditions specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (v) of this section. Tribal housing authorities and the States' Housing Finance Agencies are eligible and are exempt from the conditions specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Be a nonprofit organization or public agency in good standing in the State(s) of its operation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Be tax exempt under the Internal Revenue Code and be engaged in affordable housing per their regulations, articles of incorporation, or bylaws.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Notify the Agency and the applicant if they or their Agency-certified packager(s) are the developer, builder, seller of, or have any other such financial interest in the property for which the application package is submitted. The Agency may disallow a particular qualified employer and/or Agency-certified packager from receiving part or all of a packaging fee if the Agency determines that the financial interest is improper or the qualified employer or Agency-certified packager has a history of improperly using its position when there has been a financial interest in the property.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Prepare an affirmative fair housing marketing plan for Agency approval as outlined in RD Instruction 1901-E (or in any superseding guidance provided in the impending RD Instruction 1940-D).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Submit applications to the Agency via an intermediary if determined necessary by a State Director.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Agency-approved intermediaries. To become an Agency-approved intermediary, an interested party must apply and demonstrate to the Agency's satisfaction that they meet each of the conditions specified below. The States' Housing Finance Agencies, however, are exempt from the conditions specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (v). After the initial application process, the Agency may require intermediaries to periodically demonstrate that they still meet the following criteria.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Be a section 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization or public agency in good standing in the State(s) of its operation with the capacity to serve multiple qualified employers and their Agency-certified loan application packagers throughout an entire State or preferably throughout entire States and with the capacity to perform quality assurance reviews on a large volume of packaged loan applications within an acceptable period of time as determined by the Agency;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Be engaged in affordable housing in accordance with their regulations, articles of incorporation, or bylaws;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Be financially viable and demonstrate positive operating performance as evidenced by an independent audit paid for by the applicant seeking to be an intermediary;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Have at least five years of verifiable experience with the Agency's direct single family housing loan programs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Demonstrate that their quality assurance staff has experience with packaging, originating, or underwriting affordable housing loans.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Develop and implement quality control procedures designed to prevent submission of incomplete or ineligible application packages to the Agency;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Ensure that their quality assurance staff complete an Agency-approved loan application packaging course and successfully pass the corresponding test;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Not be the developer, builder, seller of, or have any other such financial interest in the property for which the application package is submitted; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Provide supplemental training, technical assistance, and support to certified loan application packagers and qualified employers to promote quality standards and accountability; and to address areas for improvement and any changes in program guidance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Loan application packaging courses. Prospective loan application packagers must successfully complete an Agency-approved course that covers the material identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Prospective intermediaries must also successfully complete an Agency-approved course as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Loan application packagers. At a minimum, the certification course for individuals who wish to become Agency-certified loan application packagers will provide:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An in-depth review of the section 502 direct single family housing loan program and the regulations and laws that govern the program (including civil rights lending laws such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Fair Housing Act, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A detailed discussion on the program's application process and borrower/property eligibility requirements;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An examination of the Agency's loan underwriting process which includes the use of payment subsidies; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The roles and responsibilities of a loan application packager and the Agency staff.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Intermediaries. The required course for an intermediary's quality assurance staff will cover the components described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and other information relevant to undertaking quality assurance, technical assistance, and training functions in support of the qualified employers and their Agency-certified loan application packagers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Non-Agency trainers. Prior to offering the required course to packagers and intermediaries, non-Agency trainers must obtain approval from designated Agency staff. Non-Agency trainers, who will generally be limited to housing nonprofit organizations but may in rare cases include public bodies such as public universities, must provide proof of relevant experience and resources for delivery; present evidence that their individual trainers are competent and knowledgeable on all subject areas; submit course materials for Agency review; agree to maintain attendance records, test results, and updated course materials; and bear the cost of providing the training though a reasonable tuition fee may be charged the course participants. The course content, schedule, and tuition must be approved by RHS and a designated Agency staff member will typically participate in each training session to ensure accuracy of the program information and to serve as a program resource. A list of eligible non-Agency trainers, which is subject to change based on non-Agency trainers' performance, will be published by the Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Confidentiality. The Agency-certified loan application packager, qualified employer, Agency-approved intermediary and their agents must safeguard each applicant's personal and financial information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Retaining designation. The Agency will meet with the Agency-certified loan application packager, their qualified employer, and Agency-approved intermediary (if applicable) at least annually to maintain open lines of communication; discuss their packaging activities; identify and resolve deficiencies in the packaging process; and stipulate any training requirements for retaining designation (including but not limited to civil rights refresher training).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Revocation. The designation as an Agency-certified loan application packager or Agency-approved intermediary is subject to revocation by the Agency under any of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The rate of submitted packaged loan applications that receive RHS approval is below the acceptable limit as determined by the Agency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The rate of submitted packaged loan applications from very low-income applicants is below the acceptable level as determined by the Agency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Violation of applicable regulations, statutes and other guidance; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> No viable packaged loan applications are submitted to the Agency in any consecutive 12-month period.
