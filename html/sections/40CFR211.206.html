                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The value of sound attenuation to be used in the calculation of the Noise Reduction Rating must be determined according to the ``Method for the Measurement of Real-Ear Protection of Hearing Protectors and Physical Attenuation of Earmuffs.'' This standard is approved as the American National Standards Institute Standard (ANSI STD) S3.19-1974. The provisions of this standard, with the modifications indicated below, are included by reference in this section. Copies of this standard may be obtained from: American National Standards Institute, Sales Department, 1430 Broadway, New York, New York 10018.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For the purpose of this subpart only, sections 1, 2, 3 and appendix A of the standard, as modified below, shall be applicable. These sections describe the ``Real Ear Method.'' Other portions of the standard are not applicable in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The sound field characteristics described in paragraph 3.1.1.3 are ``required.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3 shall be accomplished in this order during the same testing session. Any breaks in testing should not allow the subject to engage in any activity that may cause a Temporary Threshold Shift.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Section 3.3.3.1(1) shall not apply. Only ``Experimenter fit'' described in Section 3.3.3.1(2) is permitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Section 3.3.3.3 applies to all devices except custom-molded devices. When testing custom-molded devices, each test subject must receive his own device molded to fit his ear canal.

Sec. 211.206-2  Alternative test data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In lieu of testing according to Sec. 211.206-1, manufacturers may use the latest available test data obtained according to ANSI STD Z24.22-1957 or ANSI STD S3.19-1974 to determine the mean attenuation and standard deviation for each test frequency and the NRR calculated from those values. Manufacturers whose data is based on the ANSI STD Z24.22-1957 measurement procedure must state in the supporting information required by Sec. 211.204-4 that the mean attenuation and standard deviation values used to calculate the NRR are based on ANSI STD Z24.22-1957.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Manufacturers who initially use available data based on ANSI STD Z24.22-1957 must retest within one year of the effective date of this regulation (by September 27, 1981) the affected categories of hearing protectors in accordance with Sec. 211.206-1 of the regulation, and must relabel those categories as necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Manufacturers who use available data based on ANSI STD S3.19-1974 are not required to retest the affected categories of hearing protectors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a manufacturer has both ANSI STD S3.19-1974 test data and ANSI STD Z24.22-1957 test data on a hearing protector category, that manufacturer

must use the data obtained according to ANSI STD S3.19-1974.
