L. 99-486, 100  Stat. 1229) substantially revised those provisions of the Fair Labor  Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201) (FLSA) permitting the employment  of individuals disabled for the work to be performed (workers with  disabilities) at special minimum wage rates below the rate that would  otherwise be required by statute. These provisions are codified at  section 14(c) of the FLSA and:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Provide for the employment under certificates of individuals  with disabilities at special minimum wage rates which are commensurate  with those paid to workers not disabled for the work to be performed  employed in the vicinity for essentially the same type, quality, and  quantity of work;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Require employers to provide written assurances that wage rates  of individuals paid on an hourly rate basis be reviewed at least once  every six months and that the wages of all employees be reviewed at  least annually to reflect changes in the prevailing wages paid to  experienced individuals   not disabled for the work to be performed employed in the locality for  essentially the same type of work;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Prohibit employers from reducing the wage rates prescribed by  certificate in effect on June 1, 1986, for two years;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Permit the continuance or establishment of work activities  centers; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Provide that any employee receiving a special minimum wage rate  pursuant to section 14(c), or the parent or guardian of such an  employee, may petition for a review of that wage rate by an  administrative law judge.</p>
