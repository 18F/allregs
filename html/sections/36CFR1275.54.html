                            <p class="depth0">The Archivist periodically will assign archivists to review materials placed under restriction by Sec. 1275.50 or Sec. 1275.52 and to make available for public access those materials which, with the passage of time or other circumstances, no longer require restriction. If the archivists are unable to determine whether certain materials should remain restricted, the archivists shall submit the pertinent materials, or representative examples of them, to the Senior Archival Panel described in Sec. 1275.44(d), which shall then have the responsibility for determining if the materials should remain restricted. The Senior Archival Panel may seek the recommendations of the Presidential Materials Review Board, in the manner prescribed in paragraph (e) and (h) of Sec. 1275.46, in making its determination. Before opening previously restricted materials, the Archivist will comply with the notice requirements of Sec. 1275.42(b).
