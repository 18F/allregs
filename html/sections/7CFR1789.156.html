If RUS concludes that the projected review period will not  result in timely action on the Application, and after being so notified  in writing by RUS the Borrower wishes to fund consultant services to  facilitate RUS review, the Borrower shall submit to the same Director a  funding proposal. The proposal shall set forth the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identification in the heading or caption as a Notice of Proposal  to Fund Consulting Services;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Borrower's REA/RUS designation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Borrower's legal name and address;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A description of the Application, critical issues and concerns  relating to the Application, time deadlines, and the consequences of any  delays in RUS review;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A description of the consulting service(s) that would facilitate  timely RUS review of the Application; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Such additional documents and information as RUS may request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> RUS will review the Notice of Proposal to Fund and any  additional information RUS deems relevant in determining whether to  proceed with procuring Borrower funded Consultants.
