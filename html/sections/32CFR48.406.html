                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">A retired member who is participating in the Plan may revoke his election and withdraw from participation, or he may reduce the amount of the survivor annuity; however, an approved withdrawal or reduction will not be effective earlier than the first day of the seventh month beginning after the date his application is received by the Finance Center controlling his pay record. (For special rules covering participating members retired before Aug. 13, 1968, without option 4, see Sec. 48.604.)

No application for reduction will be approved which requests a change in options. A request to reduce an annuity or to withdraw from the Plan is irrevocable, and a retired member who withdraws may never again participate in the Plan. Approval of a request for a reduction will not be made when such reduction results in an annuity of less than 12\1/2\ per centum of the member's retired pay or less than a $25 monthly annuity. The new cost, after such reduction in survivor annuity, will be computed from the applicable cost table at the time of retirement. No amounts by which a member's retired pay is reduced may be refunded to, or credited on behalf of, the member by virtue of an application made by him under this section.</p>
