                            <p class="depth0">Yes. Under USERRA, an employer includes not only the person or  entity that pays an employee's salary or wages, but also includes a  person or entity that has control over his or her employment  opportunities, including a person or entity to whom an employer has  delegated the performance of employment-related responsibilities. For  example, if the employee is a security guard hired by a security company  and he or she is assigned to a work site, the employee may report both  to the security company and to the site owner. In such an instance, both  employers share responsibility for compliance with USERRA. If the  security company declines to assign the employee to a job because of a  uniformed service obligation (for example, National Guard duties), then  the security company could be in violation of the reemployment  requirements and the anti-discrimination provisions of USERRA.  Similarly, if the employer at the work site causes the employee's  removal from the job position because of his or her uniformed service  obligations, then the work site employer could be in violation of the  reemployment requirements and the anti-discrimination provisions of  USERRA.</p>
