                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> We may conduct or require you to conduct emission tests on your production engines/equipment in a selective enforcement audit. This requirement is independent of any requirement for you to routinely test production-line engines/equipment. For products subject to equipment-based standards, but tested using engine-based test procedures, this subpart applies to the engines and/or the equipment, as applicable. Otherwise this subpart applies to engines for products subject to engine-based standards and to equipment for products subject to equipment-based standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If we send you a signed test order, you must follow its directions and the provisions of this subpart. We may tell you where to test the engines/equipment. This may be where you produce the engines/equipment or any other emission testing facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If we select one or more of your families for a selective enforcement audit, we will send the test order to the person who signed the application for certification or we will deliver it in person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If we do not select a testing facility, notify the Designated Compliance Officer within one working day of receiving the test order where you will test your engines/equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You must do everything we require in the audit without delay.</p>
