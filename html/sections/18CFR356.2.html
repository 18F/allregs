                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope of this part. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The regulations in this part apply to  all books of account and other records prepared by or on behalf of the  oil pipeline companies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The regulations in this part must not be construed as excusing  compliance with other lawful requirements of any other governmental  body, Federal or State, prescribing other record keeping requirements or  for preservation of records longer than those prescribed in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To the extent that any Commission regulations may provide for a  different retention period, the records should be retained for the  longer of the retention periods.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Unless otherwise specified in the schedule in Sec. 356.3,  duplicate copies of records may be destroyed at any time. Provided,  however, that such duplicate copies must not contain significant  information not shown on the originals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Records other than those listed in the schedule may be destroyed  at the option of the oil pipeline company. Provided, however, that  records which are used in lieu of those listed must be preserved for the  periods prescribed for the records used for substantially similar  purposes and that retention of records pertaining to added services,  functions, plant, etc., the establishment of which cannot be presently  foreseen, must conform to the principles embodied herein.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Notwithstanding the provision of the records retention schedule,  the Commission may, upon request of the oil pipeline company, authorize  shorter retention periods for any records listed in Sec. 356.3. The oil  pipeline companies must show that the longer retention periods are no  longer necessary or appropriate to protect the public interest,  investors, or consumers. A waiver from any provision of these  regulations may be made by the Commission upon its own initiative or  upon submission of a written request by the company. Each request for  waiver must demonstrate that unusual circumstances warrant a departure  from prescribed retention periods, procedures, or techniques, or that  compliance with such prescribed requirements would impose an  unreasonable burden on the company.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Designation of supervisory official. Each oil pipeline company  subject to the provision of this part must designate one or more persons  to supervise the oil pipeline company's program for preservation and  authorized destruction of records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Protection and storage of records. Each oil pipeline company  subject to these regulations must provide reasonable protection for  records. The records must have protections from fire, floods, and other  hazards. Storage spaces, will also prevent unnecessary exposure to  deterioration from excessive humidity, dryness, or lack of proper  ventilation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Record storage media. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each oil pipeline company has the  flexibility to select its own storage media.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The storage media must have a life expectancy at least equal to  the applicable record retention period provided in Sec. 356.3 unless  there is a quality   transfer from one media to another with no loss of data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each oil pipeline company is required to implement internal  control procedures that assure the reliability of and ready access to  data stored on machine readable media. Internal control procedures must  be documented by a responsible supervisory official.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Destruction of records. Oil pipeline companies may use any  appropriate method to destroy permitted records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Premature destruction or loss of records. When records are  destroyed or lost before the expiration of the prescribed period of  retention, a certified statement listing, as far as may be determined,  the records destroyed, and describing the circumstances of accidental or  other premature destruction or loss must be filed with the Commission  within ninety (90) days from the date of discovery of such destruction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Retention periods designated ``Destroy at option''. ``Destroy at  option'' constitutes authorization for destruction of records at  managements' discretion if it does not conflict with other legal  retention requirements or usefulness of such records in satisfying  pending regulatory action or directives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Records of services performed by associated companies. Oil  pipeline companies must assure the availability of records of services  performed by associated companies for the periods indicated in Sec.  356.3 as necessary to be able to readily furnish detailed information as  to the nature of transaction, the involved, and the accounts used to  record the transactions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Index of records. Oil pipeline companies must arrange, file, and  index records so they may be readily identified and made available to  Commission representatives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Rate case. The schedule of records in Sec. 356.3 shows the  periods of time that designated records must be preserved. However, not  withstanding the minimum retention periods provided in this regulation,  if an oil pipeline company intends to reflect costs in a current,  pending, or future rate case, or if an oil pipeline company has  abandoned or retired plant subsequent to the test period of its last  rate case, it must retain the appropriate records to support the costs,  and adjustments proposed in the next or current rate case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Pending complaint litigation or governmental proceeding.  Notwithstanding the minimum requirements, if an oil pipeline company is  involved in pending litigation, complaint proceedings, proceedings  remanded by the court, or governmental proceedings, it must retain all  relevant records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Companies going out of business. The records referred to in  these regulations may be destroyed after business is discontinued and  the company is completely liquidated. The records may not be destroyed  until dissolution is final and all transactions are completed. When a  company is merged with another company under jurisdiction of the  Commission, the successor company must preserve records of the merged  company in accordance with these regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Life or mortality study data. Life or mortality study data for  depreciation purposes must be retained for 25 years or for 10 years  after plant is retired.</p>
