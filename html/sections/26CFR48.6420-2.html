                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. A claim for credit or payment described in Sec. 48.6420-1 with respect to gasoline used after June 30, 1965, on a farm for farming purposes, shall cover only gasoline used during the taxable year on a farm for farming purposes. Therefore, gasoline on hand at the end of a taxable year as, for example, in fuel supply tanks of farm machinery or in storage tanks or drums, must be excluded from a claim filed for that taxable year (but may be included in a claim filed for a later taxable year if used during that later year on a farm for farming purposes). Gasoline used during a taxable year may be covered by a claim filed for that taxable year although the gasoline was not paid for at the time the claim is filed. For purposes of applying this section, a governmental unit or exempt organization described in Sec. 48.6420-1 (c) is considered to have as its taxable year, the calendar year or fiscal year on the basis of which it regularly keeps its books; see paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Time for filing.

Not more than one claim may be filed under section 6420 by any person with respect to gasoline used during the same taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Form and content of claim--(1) Claim for credit. (i) The claim for credit with respect to gasoline used on a farm for farming purposes must be made by attaching a Form 4136 to the income tax return of an individual or a corporation.
