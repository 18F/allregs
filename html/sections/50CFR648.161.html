                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Bluefish Monitoring Committee shall identify and review the  relevant sources of management uncertainty to recommend ACTs for the  commercial and recreational fishing sectors as part of the bluefish  specification process. The Bluefish Monitoring Committee recommendations  shall identify the specific sources of management uncertainty that were  considered, technical approaches to mitigating these sources of  uncertainty, and any additional relevant information considered in the  ACT recommendation process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sectors. The sum of the commercial and recreational sector- specific ACTs shall be less than or equal to the fishery level ACL. The  Bluefish Monitoring Committee shall recommend any reduction in catch  necessary to address management uncertainty, consistent with paragraph  (a) of this section. A total of 83 percent of the fishery-level ACT will  be allocated to the recreational fishery. A total of 17 percent of the  fishery-level ACT will be allocated to the commercial fishery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Periodicity. ACTs may be established on an annual basis for up  to 3 years at a time, dependent on whether the SSC provides single or  multiple-year ABC recommendations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> through (3).
