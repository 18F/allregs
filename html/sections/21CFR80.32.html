Whenever, the Commissioner learns  that any certificate   has been obtained through fraud or material misrepresentation, he shall  notify the holder of the certificate that it is of no effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If between the time a sample of color additive accompanying a  request for certification is taken and the time a certificate covering  the batch of such color additive is received by the person to whom it is  issued, any such color additive becomes changed in composition, such  certificates shall not be effective with respect to such changed color  additive and such changed color additive shall be considered to be from  a batch that has not been certified in accordance with the regulations  in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If at any time after a certificate is received by the person to  whom it is issued any color additive from the batch covered by such  certificate becomes changed in composition, such certificate shall  expire with respect to such changed color additive. After such  expiration, such color additive shall be considered to be from a batch  that has not been certified in accordance with this part; except that  such color additive shall not be so considered when used for coloring a  food, drug, or cosmetic, or for the purpose of certifying a batch of a  mixture in which such color additive was used as an ingredient, or for  use in preparing a batch of a mixture for which exemption from  certification has been authorized, if such change resulted solely from  such use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A certificate shall expire with respect to any color additive  covered thereby if the package in which such color additive was closed  for shipment or delivery is opened. After such expiration such color  additive shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been  certified, except that such color additive shall not be so considered  when the package is opened;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> and such color additive is used, subject to the restrictions  prescribed by paragraphs (f), (g), and (h) of this section, in coloring  a food, drug, or cosmetic;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> for the purpose of certifying a batch made by repacking such  color;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> for the purpose of certifying a batch of a mixture in which such  color is used as an ingredient; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> for the purpose of preparing a batch of a mixture for which  exemption from certification has been authorized; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> when the package is reopened solely for repackaging by the  person to whom such certificate was issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A certificate shall not be effective with respect to a package  of color additive and such color additive shall be considered to be from  a batch that has not been certified if such package is shipped or  delivered under a label which does not bear all words, statements, and  other information required by Sec. 70.25 of this chapter to appear  thereon.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A certificate shall not be effective with respect to a package  of color additive, and such color additive shall be considered to be  from a batch that has not been certified if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Such package has not been sealed in accordance with Sec. 70.20  of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Such package has been sealed in accordance with Sec. 70.20 of  this chapter and the seal has been broken, intentionally or  accidentally, unless such seal has been broken for the purpose of using  color additive in accordance with Sec. 80.38, or, such package has been  opened by a duly authorized representative of the Administration or  Department in the performance of his official duties, and he has  immediately resealed the package in conformance with Sec. 70.20 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A certificate shall not be effective with respect to a package  of color additive and such color additive shall be considered to be from  a batch that has not been certified if such color additive is used in  any manner other than that for which it was certified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> When the listing or the specifications for a color additive are  revoked or amended, the final order effecting the revocation or  amendment may specify, in addition to its own effective date, a date on  which all certificates for existing batches and portions of batches of  such a color additive theretofore issued under such revoked or amended  regulations shall cease to be effective; and any such lots of the color  additive shall be regarded as   uncertified after the date specified unless a new certificate can be and  is obtained in conformance with the new regulations. When a certificate  thus ceases to be effective for a color additive, any certificates  previously issued for a color additive mixture containing that color  additive shall cease to be effective on the same date. Use of such color  additive or color additive mixture after such specified date without the  new certificate in preparing foods, drugs, or cosmetics will result in  such food, drugs, or cosmetics being adulterated. When a certified color  additive has been used in food, drugs, or cosmetics and the status of  the color additive is thereafter changed by amendment or revocation of  its listing or specification regulations, such food, drugs, and  cosmetics will not be regarded as adulterated by reason of the use of  such color additive, unless the hazard to health is such that existing  stocks of the foods, drugs, or cosmetics cannot be safely used, in which  cases findings to that effect will be made and regulations appropriate  for such special cases will be issued.</p>
