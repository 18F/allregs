Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no company shall be deemed to own or control another by virtue of its ownership or control of shares in a fiduciary capacity. When used to refer to a subsidiary of a savings association, the term subsidiary means a ``subsidiary'' that is controlled by the savings association within the meaning of 12 CFR part 574 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> References to the Reserve Bank or the Comptroller shall be deemed to include the Director of OTS; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> References to the term ``unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus'' shall be deemed to refer to ``unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus'' as defined at Sec. 560.93(b)(11) of this part.
