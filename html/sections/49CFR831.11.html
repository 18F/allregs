Parties  shall be limited to those persons, government agencies, companies, and  associations whose employees, functions, activities, or products were  involved in the accident or incident and who can provide suitable  qualified technical personnel actively to assist in the investigation.  Other than the FAA in aviation cases, no other entity is afforded the  right to participate in Board investigations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Participants in the investigation (i.e., party representatives,  party coordinators, and/or the larger party organization) shall be  responsive to the direction of Board representatives and may lose party  status if they do not comply with their assigned duties and activity  proscriptions or instructions, or if they conduct themselves in a manner  prejudicial to the investigation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No party to the investigation shall be represented in any aspect  of the NTSB investigation by any person who also represents claimants or  insurers. No party representative may occupy a legal position (see Sec.  845.13 of this chapter). Failure to comply with these provisions may  result in sanctions, including loss of status as a party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Title 49, United States Code Sec. 1132 provides for the  appropriate participation of the FAA in Board investigations, and Sec.  1131(a)(2) provides for such participation by other departments,  agencies, or instrumentalities. The FAA and those other entities that  meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be  parties to the investigation with the same rights and privileges and  subject to the same limitations as other parties, provided however that  representatives of the FAA need not sign the ``Statement of Party  Representatives to NTSB Investigation'' (see paragraph (b) of this  section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Aviation investigations. In addition to compliance with the  provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, and to assist in ensuring  complete understanding of the requirements and limitations of party  status, all party representatives in aviation investigations shall sign  ``Statement of Party Representatives to NTSB Investigation'' immediately  upon attaining party representative status. Failure timely to sign that  statement may result in sanctions, including loss of status as a party.  [62 FR 3808, Jan. 27, 1997, as amended at 63 FR 71606, Dec. 29, 1998]</p>
