                                Sec.  302-17.55  What does my agency do once it has calculated my RITA
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Your RITA is likely to be different from the sum of the WTA computed and reported during the year, because the WTA is calculated using a flat rate, established by the IRC, while the RITA is calculated using the CMTR. Therefore:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the calculation above results in a negative value (that is, if your agency's calculation shows that it withheld and reported too much money as WTA), then your agency will send an adjustment to the IRS using Form 941. In this case, your agency does not make a RITA payment to you because you do not need additional funds to pay your taxes. That is, everything you need to pay substantially all of your taxes was included in the adjusted WTA, and that is the amount that will appear on your Form W-2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the calculation above results in a positive value (that is if your agency's calculation shows that it did not withhold enough money for your income taxes), then your agency will pay your RITA to you before the end of the calendar year and report it to the IRS as part of your income for that year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Shortly after the end of the calendar year, your agency will provide one or two W-2 Forms to you. At your agency's discretion, you may receive one W-2 that includes all of your taxable relocation expenses, WTA, and RITA (if any), along with your payroll wages, or you may receive one W-2 for

your payroll wages and a separate one for your taxable relocation expenses, WTA, and RITA.</p>
