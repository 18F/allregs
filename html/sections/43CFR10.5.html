Following consultation, the Federal agency official must prepare, approve, and sign a written plan of action. A copy of this plan of action must be provided to the lineal descendants, Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations involved. Lineal descendants and Indian tribe official(s) may sign the written plan of action as appropriate. At a minimum, the plan of action must comply with Sec. 10.3 (b)(1) and document the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The kinds of objects to be considered as cultural items as defined in Sec. 10.2 (b);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The specific information used to determine custody pursuant to Sec. 10.6;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The planned treatment, care, and handling of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony recovered;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The planned archeological recording of the human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony recovered;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The kinds of analysis planned for each kind of object;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any steps to be followed to contact Indian tribe officials at the time of intentional excavation or inadvertent discovery of specific human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The kind of traditional treatment, if any, to be afforded the human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony by members of the Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The nature of reports to be prepared; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The planned disposition of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony following Sec. 10.6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Comprehensive agreements.

These agreements should address all Federal agency land management activities that could result in the intentional excavation or inadvertent discovery of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony. Consultation should lead to the establishment of a process for effectively carrying out the requirements of these regulations regarding standard consultation procedures, the determination of custody consistent with procedures in this section and Sec. 10.6, and the treatment and disposition of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony. The signed agreements, or the correspondence related to the effort to reach agreements, must constitute proof of consultation as required by these regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Traditional religious leaders. The Federal agency official must be cognizant that Indian tribe officials may need to confer with traditional religious leaders prior to making recommendations. Indian tribe officials are under no obligation to reveal the identity of traditional religious leaders.
