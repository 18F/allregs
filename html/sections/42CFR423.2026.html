The ALJ must document all  oral objections in writing and maintain the documentation in the case  files. The ALJ considers the enrollee's objections and decides whether  to proceed with the hearing or withdraw.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the ALJ withdraws, another ALJ will be appointed to conduct  the hearing. If the ALJ does not withdraw, the enrollee may, after the  ALJ has issued an action in the case, present his or her objections to  the MAC in accordance with Sec. 423.2100 through Sec. 423.2130. The MAC  would then consider whether the hearing decision should be revised or a  new hearing held before another ALJ.</p>
