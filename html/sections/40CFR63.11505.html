Information used to determine the amount of plating and polishing metal HAP in materials used in the plating or polishing process may include information reported on the Material Safety Data Sheet for the material, but is not required. For plating or polishing tanks, the HAP content may

be determined from the final bath contents ``as used'' to plate or to polish.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You are exempt from the obligation to obtain a permit under 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71, ``Title V,'' provided you are not otherwise required to obtain a permit under 40 CFR 70.3(a) or 40 CFR 71.3(a) for a reason other than your status as an area source under this subpart. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, you must continue to comply with the provisions of this subpart applicable to area sources.
