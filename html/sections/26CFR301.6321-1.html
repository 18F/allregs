                            <p class="depth0">If any person liable to pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay the same after demand, the amount (including any interest, additional amount, addition to tax, or assessable penalty, together with any costs that may accrue in addition thereto) shall be a lien in favor of the United States upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, tangible or intangible, belonging to such person. For purposes of section 6321 and this section, the term ``any tax'' shall include a State individual income tax which is a ``qualified tax'', as defined in paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.6361-4. The lien attaches to all property and rights to property belonging to such person at any time during the period of the lien, including any property or rights to property acquired by such person after the lien arises. Solely for purposes of sections 6321 and 6331, any interest in restricted land held in trust by the United States for an individual noncompetent Indian (and not for a tribe) shall not be deemed to be property, or a right to property, belonging to such Indian. For the method of allocating amounts collected pursuant to a lien between the Federal Government and a State or States imposing a qualified tax with respect to which the lien attached, see paragraph (f) of Sec. 301.6361-1. For the special lien for estate and gift taxes, see section 6324 and Sec. 301.6324-1

Sec. 301.6323(a)-1  Purchasers, holders of security interests,mechanic's lienors, and judgment lien creditors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Invalidity of lien without notice. The lien imposed by section 6321 is not valid against any purchaser (as defined in paragraph (f) of Sec. 301.6323(h)--1), holder of a security interest (as defined in paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6323(h)--1), mechanic's lienor (as defined in paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1), or judgment lien creditor (as defined in paragraph (g) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1) until a notice of lien is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1). Except as provided by section 6323, if a person becomes a purchaser, holder of a security interest, mechanic's lienor, or judgment lien creditor after a notice of lien is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, the interest acquired by such person is subject to the lien imposed by section 6321.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Cross references. For provisions relating to the protection afforded a security interest arising after tax lien filing, which interest is covered by a commercial transactions financing agreement, real property construction

or improvement financing agreement, or an obligatory disbursement agreement, see Sec. Sec. 301.6323(c)-1, 301.6323(c)-2, and 301.6323(c)-3, respectively. For provisions relating to the protection afforded to a security interest coming into existence by virtue of disbursements, made before the 46th day after the date of tax lien filing, see Sec. 301.6323(d)-1. For provisions relating to priority afforded to interest and certain other expenses with respect to a lien or security interest having priority over the lien imposed by section 6321, see Sec. 301.6323(e)-1.

Even though a notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid with respect to a security (as defined in paragraph (d) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1) against--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Even though a notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid with respect to a security (as defined in paragraph (d) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1) against--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A purchaser (as defined in paragraph (f) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1) of the security who at the time of purchase did not have actual notice or knowledge (as defined in paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6323(i)-1) of the existence of the lien;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A holder of a security interest (as defined in paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1) in the security who did not have actual notice or knowledge (as defined in paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6323(i)-1) of the existence of the lien at the time the security interest came into existence or at the time such security interest was acquired from a previous holder for a consideration in money or money's worth; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A transferee of an interest protected under subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph to the same extent the lien is invalid against his transferor.
For purposes of subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph, no person can improve his position with respect to the lien by reacquiring the interest from an intervening purchaser or holder of a security interest against whom the lien is invalid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On May 1, 1969, in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed with respect to A's delinquent tax liability. On May 20, 1969. A sells 100 shares of common stock in X corporation to B, who, on the date of the sale, does not have actual notice or knowledge of the existence of the lien. Because B purchased the stock without actual notice or knowledge of the lien, under subdivision (i) of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the stock purchased by B is not subject to the lien.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that on May 30, 1969, B sells the 100 shares of common stock in X corporation to C who on May 5, 1969, had actual notice of the existence of the tax lien against A. Because the X stock when purchased by B was not subject to the lien, under subdivision (iii) of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the stock purchased by C is not subject to the lien. C succeeds to B's rights, even though C had actual notice of the lien before B's purchase.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. On June 1, 1970, in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed with respect to D's delinquent tax liability. D owns 20 $1,000 bonds issued by the Y company. On June 10, 1970, D obtains a loan from M bank for $5,000 using the Y company bonds as collateral. At the time the loan is made M bank does not have actual notice or knowledge of the existence of the tax lien. Because M bank did not have actual notice or knowledge of the lien when the security interest came into existence, under subdivision (ii) of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the tax lien is not valid against M bank to the extent of its security interest.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Assume the same facts as in example 3 except that on June 19, 1970, M bank assigns the chose in action and its security interest to N, who had actual notice or knowledge of the existence of the lien on June 1, 1970. Because the security interest was not subject to the lien to the extent of M bank's security interest, the security interest held by N is to the same extent entitled to priority over the tax lien because N succeeds to M bank's rights. See subdivision (iii) of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. On July 1, 1970, in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed with respect to E's delinquent tax liability. E owns ten $1,000 bonds issued by the Y company. On July 5, 1970, E borrows $4,000 from F and delivers the bonds to F as collateral for the loan. At the time the loan is made, F has actual knowledge of the existence of the tax lien and, therefore, holds the security interest subject to the lien on the bonds. On July 10, 1970, F sells the security interest to G for $4,000 and delivers the Y company

bonds pledged as collateral. G does not have actual notice or knowledge of the existence of the lien on July 10, 1970. Because G did not have actual notice or knowledge of the lien at the time he purchased the security interest, under subdivision (ii) of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the tax lien is not valid against G to the extent of his security interest.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Assume the same facts as in example 5 except that, instead of purchasing the security interest from F on July 10, 1970, G lends $4,000 to F and takes a security interest in F's security interest in the bonds on that date. Because G became the holder of a security interest in a security interest after notice of lien was filed and does not directly have a security interest in a security, the security interest held by G is not entitled to a priority over the tax lien under the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Motor vehicles--(1) In general.

The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A, a delinquent taxpayer against whom a notice of tax lien has been filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, sells his automobile (which qualifies as a motor vehicle under paragraph (c) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1) to B, an automobile dealer. B takes actual possession of the automobile and does not thereafter relinquish actual possession to the seller or his agent. Subsequent to his purchase, B learns of the existence of the tax lien against A. Even though notice of lien was filed before the purchase, the lien is not valid against B, because B did not know of the existence of the lien before the purchase and before acquiring actual possession of the vehicle.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. C is a wholesaler of used automobiles. A notice of lien has been filed with respect to C's delinquent tax liability in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1. Subsequent to such filing, D, a used automobile dealer, purchases and takes actual possession of 20 automobiles (which qualify as motor vehicles under the provisions of paragraph (c) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1) from C at an auction and places them on his lot for sale. C does not reacquire possession of any of the automobiles. At the time of his purchase, D does not have actual notice or knowledge of the existence of the lien against C. Even though notice of lien was filed before D's purchase, the lien was not valid against D because D did not know of the existence of the lien before the purchase and before acquiring actual possession of the vehicles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Cross reference. For provisions relating to additional circumstances in which the lien imposed by section 6321 may not be valid against the purchaser of tangible personal property (including a motor vehicle) purchased at retail, see paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Personal property purchased at retail--(1) In general. Even though a notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid against a purchaser (as defined in paragraph (f) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1) of tangible personal property purchased at a retail sale (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (c)) unless at the time of purchase the purchaser intends the purchase to (or knows that the purchase will) hinder, evade, or defeat the collection of any tax imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Even though a notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid against a purchaser (as defined in paragraph (f) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1) of tangible personal property purchased at a retail sale (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (c)) unless at the time of purchase the purchaser intends the purchase to (or knows that the purchase will) hinder, evade, or defeat the collection of any tax imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definition of retail sale. For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``retail sale'' means a sale, made in the ordinary course of the seller's trade or business, of tangible personal property of which the seller is the owner. Such term includes a sale in customary retail quantities by a seller who is going out of business, but does not include a bulk sale or an auction sale in which goods are offered in quantities substantially greater than are customary in the ordinary course of the seller's trade or business or an auction sale of goods the owner of which is not in the business of selling such goods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Example. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. A purchases a refrigerator from the M company, a retail appliance dealer. Prior to such purchase, a notice of lien was

filed with respect to M's delinquent tax liability in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1. At the time of the purchase A knows of the existence of the lien. However, A does not intend the purchase to hinder, evade, or defeat the collection of any internal revenue tax, and A does not have any reason to believe that the purchase will affect the collection of any internal revenue tax. Even though notice of lien was filed before the purchase, the lien is not valid against A because A in good faith purchased the refrigerator at retail in the ordinary course of the M company's business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Personal property purchased in casual sale--(1) In general. Even though a notice of lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid against a purchaser (as defined in Sec. 301.6323(h)-1(f)) of household goods, personal effects, or other tangible personal property of a type described in Sec. 301.6334-1 (which includes wearing apparel, school books, fuel, provisions, furniture, arms for personal use, livestock, and poultry (whether or not the seller is the head of a family); and books and tools of a trade, business, or profession (whether or not the trade, business, or profession of the seller)), purchased, other than for resale, in a casual sale for less than $1,380, effective for 2010 and adjusted each year based on the rate of inflation (excluding interest and expenses described in Sec. 301.6323(e)-1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Even though a notice of lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid against a purchaser (as defined in Sec. 301.6323(h)-1(f)) of household goods, personal effects, or other tangible personal property of a type described in Sec. 301.6334-1 (which includes wearing apparel, school books, fuel, provisions, furniture, arms for personal use, livestock, and poultry (whether or not the seller is the head of a family); and books and tools of a trade, business, or profession (whether or not the trade, business, or profession of the seller)), purchased, other than for resale, in a casual sale for less than $1,380, effective for 2010 and adjusted each year based on the rate of inflation (excluding interest and expenses described in Sec. 301.6323(e)-1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Limitation. This paragraph applies only if the purchaser does not have actual notice or knowledge (as defined in paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6323(i)-1)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Of the existence of the tax lien, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> That the sale is one of a series of sales.
For purposes of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, a sale is one of a series of sales if the seller plans to dispose of, in separate transactions, substantially all of his household goods, personal effects, and other tangible personal property described in Sec. 301.6334-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A, an attorney's widow, sells a set of law books for $200 to B, for B's own use. Prior to the sale a notice of lien was filed with respect to A's delinquent tax liability in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1. B has no actual notice or knowledge of the tax lien. In addition, B does not know that the sale is one of a series of sales. Because the sale is a casual sale for less than $1,380 and involves books of a profession (tangible personal property of a type described in Sec. 301.6334-1, irrespective of the fact that A has never engaged in the legal profession), the tax lien is not valid against B even though a notice of lien was filed prior to the time of B's purchase.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that B purchases the books for resale in his second-hand bookstore. Because B purchased the books for resale, he purchased the books subject to the lien.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. In an advertisement appearing in a local newspaper, G indicates that he is offering for sale a lawn mower, a used television set, a desk, a refrigerator, and certain used dining room furniture. In response to the advertisement, H purchases the dining room furniture for $200. H does not receive any information which would impart notice of a lien, or that the sale is one of a series of sales, beyond the information contained in the advertisement. Prior to the sale a notice of lien was filed with respect to G's delinquent tax liability in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1. Because H had no actual notice or knowledge that substantially all of G's household goods were being sold or that the sale is one of a series of sales, and because the sale is a casual sale for less than $1,380, H does not purchase the dining room furniture subject to the lien. The household goods are of a type described in Sec. 301.6334-1(a)(2) irrespective of whether G is the head of a family or whether all such household goods offered for sale exceed $8,250 in value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Personal property subject to possessory liens. Even though a notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid against a holder of a lien on tangible personal property which under local law secures the reasonable price of the repair or improvement of the property if the property is, and has been, continuously in the possession of the holder of the lien from the time the possessory lien arose. For example, if local law gives an automobile repairman the right to retain possession of an automobile he has repaired as security for payment of the repair bill and the repairman retains continuous possession of the automobile until his lien is satisfied, a tax lien filed in accordance with section 6323(f)(1) which has attached to the automobile will not be valid to the extent of the reasonable price of the repairs. It is immaterial that the notice of tax lien was filed before the repairman undertook his work

or that he knew of the lien before undertaking the work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Real property tax and special assessment liens--(1) In general. Even though a notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid against the holder of another lien upon the real property (regardless of when such other lien arises), if such other lien is entitled under local law to priority over security interests in real property which are prior in time and if such other lien on real property secures payment of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Even though a notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid against the holder of another lien upon the real property (regardless of when such other lien arises), if such other lien is entitled under local law to priority over security interests in real property which are prior in time and if such other lien on real property secures payment of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A tax of general application levied by any taxing authority based upon the value of the property;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A special assessment imposed directly upon the property by any taxing authority, if the assessment is imposed for the purpose of defraying the cost of any public improvement; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Charges for utilities or public services furnished to the property by the United States, a State or political subdivision thereof, or an instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A owns Blackacre in the city of M. A notice of lien affecting Blackacre is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1. Subsequent to the filing of the notice of lien, the city of M acquires a lien against Blackacre to secure payment of real estate taxes. Such taxes are levied against all property in the city in proportion to the value of the property. Under local law, the holder of a lien for real property taxes is entitled to priority over a security interest in real property even though the security interest is prior in time. Because the real property tax lien held by the city of M secures payment of a tax of general application and is entitled to priority over security interests which are prior in time, the lien held by the city of M is entitled to priority over the Federal tax lien with respect to Blackacre.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. B owns Whiteacre in N county. A notice of lien affecting Whiteacre is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1. Subsequent to the filing of the notice of lien, N county constructs a sidewalk, paves the street, and installs water and sewer lines adjacent to Whiteacre. In order to defray the cost of these improvements, N county imposes upon Whiteacre a special assessment which under local law results in a lien upon Whiteacre that is entitled to priority over security interests that are prior in time. Because the special assessment lien is (i) entitled under local law to priority over security interests which are prior in time, and (ii) imposed directly upon real property to defray the cost of a public improvement, the special assessment lien has priority over the Federal tax lien with respect to Whiteacre.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. C owns Greenacre in town O. A notice of lien affecting Greenacre is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1. Town O furnishes water and electricity to Greenacre and periodically collects a fee for these services. Subsequent to the filing of the notice of lien, town O supplies water and electricity to Greenacre, and C fails to pay the charges for these services. Under local law, town O acquires a lien to secure charges for the services, and this lien has priority over security interests which are prior in time. Because the lien of town O (i) is for services furnished to the real property and (ii) has priority over earlier security interests, town O's lien has priority over the Federal tax lien with respect to Greenacre.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Residential property subject to a mechanic's lien for certain repairs and improvements--(1) In general. Even though a notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid against a mechanic's lienor (as defined in Sec. 301.6323(h)-1(b)) who holds a lien for the repair or improvement of a personal residence if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Even though a notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid against a mechanic's lienor (as defined in Sec. 301.6323(h)-1(b)) who holds a lien for the repair or improvement of a personal residence if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The residence is occupied by the owner and contains no more than four dwelling units; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The contract price on the prime contract with the owner for the repair or improvement (excluding interest and expenses described in Sec. 301.6323(e)-1) is not more than $6,890, effective for 2010 and adjusted each year based on the rate of inflation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, the amounts of subcontracts under the prime contract with the owner are not to be taken into consideration for purposes of computing the $6,890 prime contract price. It is immaterial that the notice of tax lien was filed before the contractor undertakes his work or that he knew of the lien before undertaking his work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A owns a building containing four apartments, one of which he occupies as his personal residence. A notice of lien which affects the building is filed in accordance

with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1. Thereafter, A enters into a contract with B in the amount of $800, which includes labor and materials, to repair the roof of the building. B purchases roofing shingles from C for $300. B completes the work and A fails to pay B the agreed amount. In turn, B fails to pay C for the shingles. Under local law, B and C acquire mechanic's liens on A's building. Because the contract price on the prime contract with A is not more than $6,890 and under local law B and C acquire mechanic's liens on A's building, the liens of B and C have priority over the Federal tax lien.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that the amount of the prime contract between A and B is $7,100. Because the amount of the prime contract with the owner, A, is in excess of $6,890, the tax lien has priority over the entire amount of each of the mechanic's liens of B and C, even though the amount of the contract between B and C is $300.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that A and B do not agree in advance upon the amount due under the prime contract but agree that B will perform the work for the cost of materials and labor plus 10 percent of such cost. When the work is completed, it is determined that the total amount due is $850. Because the prime contract price is not more than $6,890 and under local law B and C acquire mechanic's liens on A's residence, the liens of B and C have priority over the Federal tax lien.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Attorney's liens--(1) In general. Even though notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid against an attorney who, under local law, holds a lien upon, or a contract enforceable against, a judgment or other amount in settlement of a claim or of a cause of action.

Under local law, B is entitled to a lien upon any recovery in order to secure payment of his fee. A is awarded damages of $10,000. B charges a fee of $3,000 which is the fee customarly allowed under local law in similar cases and which is found to be reasonable under the circumstances of this particular case.

C and D enter into an agreement which provides that D will receive a reasonable and customary fee of $2,500 as compensation for his services. Under local law, the agreement will give rise to a lien which is enforceable by D against any amount recovered in the suit. C is successful in the suit and is awarded $10,000. D claims $2,500 of the proceeds as his fee. The United States, however, exercises its right of set-off and applies $8,000 of the $10,000 award to satisfy C's tax liability. Because the $10,000 award resulted from the successful litigation of a cause of action against the United States, B's contract for attorney's fees is not enforceable against the amount recovered to the extent the United States offsets its liability under the judgment against C's tax liability.

On July 1, 1970, without actual notice or knowledge of the tax lien, the X company makes a ``policy loan'' to A. Under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, the loan, including interest (in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6323(e)-1), will have priority over the tax lien because X company did not have actual notice or knowledge of the tax lien at the time the policy loan was made.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. On May 1, 1964, B enters into a life insurance contract with the Y insurance company. Under one of the provisions of the contract, in the event a premium is not paid, Y is to advance out of the cash loan value of the policy the amount of an unpaid premium in order to maintain the contract in force. The contract also provides for interest on any advances so made. On June 1, 1971, a tax assessment is made against B, and on June 2, 1971, in accordance with section 6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed. On July 1, 1971, B fails to pay the premium due on that date, and Y makes an automatic premium loan to keep the policy in force. At the time the automatic premium loan is made, Y had actual knowledge of the tax lien.

The amount which C could have had advanced to him from Z company under the contract on the 90th day after service of the notice of levy on Z company is $2,000. The Z company pays $2,000 pursuant to the notice of levy, thereby satisfying the levy upon the contract in accordance with Sec. 6332(b). On February 1, 1973, Z company advances $500 to C, which is the increment in

policy loan value since satisfaction of the levy of January 29, 1971. On February 5, 1973, a new notice of levy for the unpaid balance of the delinquent taxes, executed after the first levy was satisfied, is served upon Z company. Because the new notification was not received by Z company until after the policy loan was made, under paragraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph, the tax lien is not valid against Z company with respect to the policy loan (including interest thereon in accordance with paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6323(e)-1).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4.

Sec. 301.6323(c)-1  Protection for commercial transactions financingagreements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Even though a notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid with respect to a security interest which:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Comes into existence after the tax lien filing,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Is in qualified property covered by the terms of a commercial transactions financing agreement entered into before the tax lien filing, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Is protected under local law against a judgment lien arising, as of the time of the tax lien filing, out of an unsecured obligation.
See paragraphs (a) and (e) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1 for definitions of the terms ``security interest'' and ``tax lien filing,'' respectively. For purposes of this section, a judgment lien is a lien held by a judgment lien creditor as defined in paragraph (g) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Commercial transactions financing agreement. For purposes of this section, the term ``commercial transactions financing agreement'' means a written agreement entered into by a person in the course of his trade or business--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To make loans to the taxpayer (whether or not at the option of the person agreeing to make such loans) to be secured by commercial financing security acquired by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of his trade or business, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To purchase commercial financing security, other than inventory, acquired by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of his trade or business.
Such an agreement qualifies as a commercial transactions financing agreement only with respect to loans or purchases made under the agreement before (i) the 46th day after the date of tax lien filing or, (ii) the time when the lender or purchaser has actual notice or knowledge (as defined in paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6323(i)-1) of the tax lien filing, if earlier. For purposes of this paragraph, a loan or purchase is considered to have been made in the course of the lender's or purchaser's trade or business if such person is in the business of financing commercial transactions (such as a bank or commercial factor) of if the agreement is incidental to the conduct of such person's trade or business. For example, if a manufacturer finances the accounts receivable of one of his customers, he is considered to engage in such financing in the course of his trade or business. The extent of the priority of the lender or purchaser over the tax lien is the amount of his disbursements made before the 46th day after the date the notice of tax lien is filed, or made before the day (before such 46th day) on which the lender or purchaser has actual notice or knowledge of the filing of the notice of the tax lien.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Commercial financing security--(1) In general. The term ``commercial financing security'' means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The term ``commercial financing security'' means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Paper of a kind ordinarily arising in commercial transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Accounts receivable (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (c)),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Mortgages on real property, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Inventory.


For purposes of this subparagraph, the term ``paper of a kind ordinarily arising in commercial transactions'' in general includes any written document customarily used in commercial transactions. For example, such written documents include paper giving contract rights (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (c)), chattel paper, documents of title to personal property, and negotiable instruments or securities. The term ``commercial financing security'' does not include general intangibles such as patents or copyrights. A mortgage on real estate (including a deed of trust, contract for sale, and similar instrument) may be commercial financing security if the taxpayer has an interest in the mortgage as a mortgagee or assignee. The term ``commercial financing security'' does not include a mortgage where the taxpayer is the mortgagor or realty owned by him. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term ``inventory'' includes raw materials and goods in process as well as property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definitions. For purposes of Sec. Sec. 301.6323(d)-1, 301.6323(h)-1 and this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A contract right is any right to payment under a contract not yet earned by performance and not evidenced by an instrument or chattel paper, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An account receivable is any right to payment for goods sold or leased or for services rendered which is not evidenced by an instrument or chattel paper.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Qualified property. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, qualified property consists solely of commercial financing security acquired by the taxpayer-debtor before the 46th day after the date of tax lien filing: Commercial financing security acquired before such day may be qualified property even though it is acquired by the taxpayer after the lender received actual notice or knowledge of the filing of the tax lien. For example, although the receipt of actual notice or knowledge of the filing of the notice of the tax lien has the effect of ending the period within which protected disbursements may be made to the taxpayer, property which is acquired by the taxpayer after the lender receives actual notice or knowledge of such filing and before such 46th day, which otherwise qualifies as commercial financing security, becomes commercial financing security to which the priority of the lender extends for loans made before he received the actual notice or knowledge. An account receivable (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section) is acquired by a taxpayer at the time, and to the extent, a right to payment is earned by performance. Chattel paper, documents of title, negotiable instruments, securities, and mortgages on real estate are acquired by a taxpayer when he obtains rights in the paper or mortgage. Inventory is acquired by the taxpayer when title passes to him. A contract right (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section) is acquired by a taxpayer when the contract is made. Identifiable proceeds, which arise from the collection or disposition of qualified property by the taxpayer, are considered to be acquired at the time such qualified property is acquired if the secured party has a continuously perfected security interest in the proceeds under local law. The term ``proceeds'' includes whatever is received when collateral is sold, exchanged, or collected. For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``identifiable proceeds'' does not include money, checks and the like which have been commingled with other cash proceeds. Property acquired by the taxpayer after the 45th day following tax lien filing, by the expenditure of proceeds, is not qualified property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Purchaser treated as acquiring security interest. A person who purchases commercial financing security, other than inventory, pursuant to a commercial transactions financing agreement is treated, for purposes of this section, as having acquired a security interest in the commercial financing security. In the case of a bona fide purchase at a discount, a purchaser of commercial financing security who satisfies the requirements of this section has priority over the tax lien to the full extent of the security.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On June 1, 1970, a tax is assessed against M, a tool manufacturer, with respect to his delinquent tax liability. On June 15, 1970, M enters into a written financing agreement with X, a bank. The agreement provides that, in consideration of such sums as X may advance to M, X is to have a security interest in all of M's presently owned and subsequently acquired commercial paper, accounts receivable, and inventory (including inventory in the manufacturing stages and raw materials). On July 6, 1970, notice of the tax lien is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1. On August 3, 1970, without actual notice or knowledge of the tax lien filing, X advances $10,000 to M. On August 5, 1970, M acquires additional inventory through the purchase of raw materials. On August 20, 1970, M has accounts receivable, arising from the sale of tools, amounting to $5,000. Under local law, X's security interest arising by reason of the $10,000 advance on August 3, 1970, has priority, with respect to the raw materials and accounts receivable, over a judgment lien against M arising July 6, 1970 (the date of tax lien filing) out of an unsecured obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because the $10,000 advance was made before the 46th day after the tax lien filing, and the accounts receivable in the amount of $5,000 and the raw materials were acquired by M before such 46th day, X's $10,000 security interest in the accounts receivable and the inventory has priority over the tax lien. The priority of X's security interest also extends to the proceeds, received on or after the 46th day after the tax lien filing, from the liquidation of the accounts receivable and inventory held by M on August 20, 1970, if X has a continuously perfected security interest in identifiable proceeds under local law. However, the priority of X's security interest will not extend to other property acquired with such proceeds.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that on July 15, 1970, X has actual knowledge of the tax lien filing. Because an agreement does not qualify as a commercial transactions financing agreement when a disbursement is made after tax lien filing with actual knowledge of the filing, X's security interest will not have priority over the tax lien with respect to the $10,000 advance made on August 3, 1970.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that, instead of additional inventory, on August 5, 1970, M acquires an account receivable as the result of the sale of machinery which M no longer needs in his business. Even though the account receivable was acquired by taxpayer M before the 46th day after tax lien filing, the tax lien will have priority over X's security interest arising in the account receivable pursuant to the earlier written agreement because the account receivable was not acquired by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of his trade or business.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Pursuant to a written agreement with the N Manufacturing Company entered into on January 4, 1971, Y a commercial factor, purchases the accounts receivable arising out of N's regular sales to its customers. On November 1, 1971, in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed with respect to N's delinquent tax liability. On December 6, 1971, Y, without actual notice or knowledge of the tax lien filing, purchases all of the accounts receivable resulting from N's November 1971 sales. Y has taken appropriate steps under local law so that the December 6, 1971, purchase is protected against a judgment lien arising November 1, 1971 (the date of tax lien filing) out of an unsecured obligation. Because the purchaser of commercial financing security, other than inventory, is treated as having acquired a security interest in commercial financing security, and because Y otherwise meets the requirements of this section, the tax lien is not valid with respect to Y's December 6, 1971, purchase of N's accounts receivable.

Even though a notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid with respect to a security interest which:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Comes into existence after the tax lien filing,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Is in qualified property covered by the terms of a real property construction or improvement financing agreement entered into before the tax lien filing, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Is protected under local law against a judgment lien arising, as of the time of tax lien filing, out of an unsecured obligation.
For purposes of this section, it is immaterial that the holder of the security interest had actual notice or knowledge of the lien at the time disbursements are made pursuant to such an agreement. See paragraphs (a) and (e) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1 for general definitions of the terms ``security interest'' and ``tax lien filing.'' For purposes of this section, a judgment lien is a lien

held by a judgment lien creditor as defined in paragraph (g) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Real property construction or improvement financing agreement. For purposes of this section, the term ``real property construction or improvement financing agreement'' means any written agreement to make cash disbursements (whether or not at the option of the party agreeing to make such disbursements):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To finance the construction, improvement, or demolition of real property if the agreement provides for a security interest in the real property with respect to which the construction, improvement, or demolition has been or is to be made;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To finance a contract to construct or improve, or demolish real property if the agreement provides for a security interest in the proceeds of the contract; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> To finance the raising or harvesting of a farm crop or the raising of livestock or other animals if the agreement provides for a security interest in any property subject to the lien imposed by section 6321 at the time of tax lien filing, in the crop raised or harvested, or in the livestock or other animals raised.
For purposes of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph (b), construction or improvement may include demolition. For purposes of any agreement described in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (b), the furnishing of goods and services is treated as the disbursement of cash.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Qualified property.

On February 1, 2006, in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed and recorded in the public index with respect to A's delinquent tax liability. A continues the construction, and B makes cash disbursements on June 15, 2006, and December 15, 2006. Under local law B's security interest arising by virtue of the disbursements is protected against a judgment lien arising February 1, 2006 (the date of tax lien filing) out of an unsecured obligation. Because B is the holder of a security interest coming into existence by reason of cash disbursements made pursuant to a written agreement, entered into before tax lien filing, to make cash disbursements to finance the construction of real property, and because B's security interest is protected, under local law, against a judgment lien arising as of the time of tax lien filing out of an unsecured obligation, B's security interest has priority over the tax lien.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> C is awarded a contract for the demolition of several buildings.

On April 1, 2004, in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed with respect to C's delinquent tax liability. With actual notice of the tax lien, D makes cash disbursements to C on August 13, September 13, and October 13, 2004.

Sec. 301.6323(c)-3  Protection for obligatory disbursement agreements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Even though a notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid with respect to a security interest which:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Comes into existence after the tax lien filing,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Is in qualified property covered by the terms of an obligatory disbursement agreement entered into before the tax lien filing, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Is protected under local law against a judgment lien arising, as of the time of tax lien filing, out of an unsecured obligation.
See paragraphs (a) and (e) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1 for definitions of the terms ``security interest'' and ``tax lien filing.'' For purposes of this section, a judgment lien is a lien held by a judgment lien creditor as defined in paragraph (g) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Obligatory disbursement agreement. For purposes of this section the term ``obligatory disbursement agreement'' means a written agreement, entered into by a person in the course of his trade or business, to make disbursements. An agreement is treated as an obligatory disbursement agreement only with respect to disbursements which are required to be made by reason of the intervention of the rights of a person other than the taxpayer. The obligation to pay must be conditioned upon an event beyond the control of the obligor. For example, the provisions of this section are applicable where an issuing bank obligates itself to honor drafts or other demands for payment on a letter of credit and a bank, in good faith, relies upon that letter of credit in making advances. The provisions of this section are also applicable, for example, where a bonding company obligates itself to make payments to indemnify against loss or liability and, under the terms of the bond, makes a payment with respect to a loss. The priority described in this section is not applicable, for example,

in the case of an accommodation endorsement by an endorser who assumes his obligation other than in the course of his trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Qualified property. Except as provided under paragraph (d) of this section, the term ``qualified property,'' for purposes of this section, means property subject to the lien imposed by section 6321 at the time of tax lien filing and, to the extent that the acquisition is directly traceable to the obligatory disbursement, property acquired by the taxpayer after tax lien filing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Special rule for surety agreements. Where the obligatory disbursement agreement is an agreement insuring the performance of a contract of the taxpayer and another person, the term ``qualified property'' shall be treated as also including--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The proceeds of the contract the performance of which was insured, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the contract the performance of which was insured is a contract to construct or improve real property, to produce goods, or to furnish services, any tangible personal property used by the taxpayer in the performance of the insured contract.
For example, a surety company which holds a security interest, arising from cash disbursements made after tax lien filing under a payment or performance bond on a real estate construction project, has priority over the tax lien with respect to the proceeds of the construction contract and, in addition, with respect to any tangible personal property used by the taxpayer in the construction project if its security interest in the tangible personal property is protected under local law against a judgment lien arising, as of the time the tax lien was filed, out of an unsecured obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. This section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 2, 1969, H, an appliance dealer, in order to finance the acquisition from O of a large inventory of appliances, enters into a written agreement with Z, a bank. Under the terms of the agreement, in return for a security interest in all of H's inventory, presently owned and subsequently acquired, Z issues an irrevocable letter of credit to allow H to make the purchase. On December 31, 1968 and January 10, 1969, in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, separate notices of lien are filed with respect to H's delinquent tax liabilities. On March 31, 1969, Z honors the letter of credit. Under local law, Z's security interest in both existing and after-acquired inventory is protected against a judgment lien arising on or after January 10, 1969, out of an unsecured obligation. Under local law, Z's security interest in the inventory purchased under the letter of credit qualifies as a purchase money security interest and is valid against persons acquiring security interests in or liens upon such inventory at any time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because Z's security interest in H's inventory did not arise under a written agreement entered into before the filing of notice of the first tax lien on December 31, 1968, that lien is superior to Z's security interest except to the extent of Z's purchase money security interest. Because Z's interest qualifies as a purchase money security interest with respect to the inventory purchased under the letter of credit, the tax liens attach under section 6321 only to the equity acquired by H, and the rights of Z in the inventory so purchased as superior even to the lien filed on December 31, 1968, without regard to this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Because Z's security interest arose by reason of disbursements made under a written agreement which was entered into before the filing of notice of the second tax lien on January 10, 1969, and which constitutes an agreement to make disbursements required to be made by reason of the intervention of the rights of O, a person other than the taxpayer, and because Z's security interest is valid under local law against a judgment lien arising as of the time of such tax lien filing on January 10, 1969, out of an unsecured obligation, the second tax lien is, under this section, not valid with respect to Z's security interest in inventory owned by H on January 10, 1969, as well as any after-acquired inventory directly traceable to Z's disbursements (apart from such greater protection as Z enjoys, with respect to the latter, under its purchase money security interest). No protection against the second tax lien is provided under this section with respect to a security interest in any other inventory acquired by H after January 10, 1969, because such other inventory is neither subject to the tax lien at the time of tax lien filing nor directly traceable to Z's disbursements.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. On June 1, 1971, K is awarded a contract to construct an office building. At the same time, S, a surety company, agrees in writing to insure the performance of the contract. The agreement provides that in the event S must complete the job as the result of a default by K, S will be entitled to the proceeds of the contract. In addition, the agreement provides that S is to have a security interest in all property belonging to K. On December 1, 1971, prior to the completion of the building, K defaults. On the same date, under Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed

with respect to K's delinquent tax liability. S completes the building on June 1, 1972. Under local law S's security interest in the proceeds of the contract and S's security interest in the property of K are entitled to priority over a judgment lien arising December 1, 1971 (the date of tax lien filing) out of an unsecured obligation. Because, for purposes of an obligatory disbursement agreement which is a surety agreement, the security interest may be in the proceeds of the insured contract, S's security interest in the proceeds of the contract has priority over the tax lien even though a notice of lien was filed before S's security interest arose. Furthermore, because the insured contract was a contract to construct real property, S's security interest in any of K's tangible personal property used in the performance of the contract also has priority over the tax lien.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On February 2, 1970, L enters into an agreement with M, a contractor, to construct an apartment building on land owned by L. Under a separate agreement, N bank agrees to furnish funds on a short-term basis to L for the payment of amounts due to M during the course of construction. Simultaneously, X, a financial institution, makes a binding commitment to N bank and L to provide long-term financing for the project after its completion. Under its commitment, X is obligated to pay off the balance of the construction loan held by N bank upon the execution by L of a new promissory note secured by a mortgage deed of trust upon the improved property. On September 4, 1970, in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, notice of lien is properly filed with respect to L's delinquent tax liability. On September 8, 1970. X obtains actual notice of the tax lien filing. On September 14, 1970, the documents creating X's security interest are executed and recorded, N bank's lien for its construction loan is released, and X makes the required disbursements to N bank. Under local law, X's security interest is protected against a judgment lien arising on September 4, 1970 (the time of tax lien filing) out of an unsecured obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because X's security interest arose by reason of a disbursement made under a written agreement entered into before tax lien filing, which constitutes an agreement to make disbursements required to be made by reason of the intervention of the rights of N bank, a person other than the taxpayer, and because X's security interest is valid under local law against a judgment lien arising as of the time of the tax lien filing out of an unsecured obligation, the tax lien is not valid with respect to X's security interest to the extent of the disbursement to N bank. The obligatory disbursement is protected under section 6323(c)(4) even if X is not subrogated to N bank's rights or X's agreement is not itself a real property construction financing agreement.

Sec. 301.6323(d)-1  45-day period for making disbursements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Even though a notice of a lien imposed by section 6321 is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, the lien is not valid with respect to a security interest which comes into existence, after tax lien filing, by reason of disbursements made before the 46th day after the date of tax lien filing, or if earlier, before the person making the disbursements has actual notice or knowledge of the tax lien filing, but only if the security interest is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In property which is subject, at the time of tax lien filing, to the lien imposed by section 6321 and which is covered by the terms of a written agreement entered into before tax lien filing, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Protected under local law against a judgment lien arising, as of the time of tax lien filing, out of an unsecured obligation.
For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (a), a contract right (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of Sec. 301.6323(c)-1) is subject, at the time of tax lien filing, to the lien imposed by section 6321 if the contract has been made by such time. An account receivable (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of Sec. 301.6323(c)-1) is subject, at the time of tax lien filing, to the lien imposed by section 6321 if, and to the extent, a right to payment has been earned by performance at such time. For purposes of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (a), a judgment lien is a lien held by a judgment lien creditor as defined in paragraph (g) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1. For purposes of this section, it is immaterial that the written agreement provides that the disbursements are to be made at the option of the person making the disbursements. See paragraphs (a) and (e) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1 for definitions of the terms ``security interest'' and ``tax lien filing,'' respectively. See paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6323(i)-1 for certain circumstances under which a person is deemed to have actual notice or knowledge of a fact.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Examples. The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On December 1, 1967, an assessment is made against A with respect to his delinquent tax liability. On January 2, 1968, A enters into a written agreement with B whereby B agrees to lend A $10,000 in return for a security interest in certain property owned by A. On January 10, 1968, in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1 notice of the tax lien affecting the property is filed. On February 1, 1968, B, without actual notice or knowledge of the tax lien filing, disburses the loan to A. Under local law, the security interest arising by reason of the disbursement is entitled to priority over a judgment lien arising January 10, 1968 (the date of tax lien filing) out of an unsecured obligation. Because the disbursement was made before the 46th day after tax lien filing, because the disbursement was made pursuant to a written agreement entered into before tax lien filing, and because the resulting security interest is protected under local law against a judgment lien arising as of the date of tax lien filing out of an unsecured obligation, B's $10,000 security interest has priority over the tax lien.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that when B disburses the $10,000 to A on February 10, 1968, B has actual knowledge of the tax lien filing. Because the disbursement was made with actual knowledge of tax lien filing, B's security interest does not have priority over the tax lien even though the disbursement was made before the 46th day after the tax lien filing. Furthermore, B is not protected under Sec. 301.6323(a)-1(a) as a holder of a security interest because he had not parted with money or money's worth prior to the time the notice of tax lien was filed (January 10, 1968) even though he had made a firm commitment to A before that time.

Sec. 301.6323(e)-1  Priority of interest and expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. If the lien imposed by section 6321 is not valid as against another lien or security interest, the priority of the other lien or security interest also extends to each of the following items to the extent that under local law the item has the same priority as the lien or security interest to which it relates:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any interest or carrying charges (including finance, service, and similar charges) upon the obligation secured,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The reasonable charges and expenses of an indenture trustee (including, for example, the trustee under a deed of trust) or agent holding the security interest for the benefit of the holder of the security interest,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The reasonable expenses, including reasonable compensation for attorneys, actually incurred in collecting or enforcing the obligation secured,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The reasonable costs of insuring, preserving, or repairing the property to which the lien or security interest relates,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The reasonable costs of insuring payment of the obligation secured (including amounts paid by the holder of the security interest for mortgage insurance, such as that issued by the Federal Housing Administration), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Amounts paid to satisfy any lien on the property to which the lien or security interest relates, but only if the lien so satisfied is entitled to priority over the lien imposed by section 6321.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Collection expenses. The reasonable expenses described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section include expenditures incurred by the protected holder of the lien or security interest to establish the priority of his interest or to collect, by foreclosure or otherwise, the amount due him from the property subject to his lien. Accordingly, the amount of the encumbrance which is protected is increased by the amounts so expended by the holder of the security interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Costs of insuring, preserving, etc. The reasonable costs of insuring, preserving, or repairing described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section include expenditures by the holder of a security interest for fire and casualty insurance on the property subject to the security interest and amounts paid by the holder of the lien or security interest to repair the property. Such reasonable costs also include the amounts paid by the holder of the lien or security interest in a leasehold to the lessor of the leasehold to preseve the leasehold subject to the lien or security interest. Accordingly, the amount of the lien or security interest which is protected is increased by the amounts so expended by the holder of the lien or security interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Satisfaction of liens. The amounts described in paragraph (a)(6) of this section include expenditures incurred

by the protected holder of a lien or security interest to discharge a statutory lien for State sales taxes on the property subject to his lien or security interest if both his lien or security interest and the sales tax lien have priority over a Federal tax lien. Accordingly, the amount of the lien or security interest is increased by the amounts so expended by the holder of the lien or security interest even though under local law the holder of the lien or security interest is not subrogated to the rights of the holder of the State sales tax lien. However, if the holder of the lien or security interest is subrogated, within the meaning of paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.6323(i)-1, to the rights of the holder of the sales tax lien, he will also be entitled to any additional protection afforded by section 6323(i)(2).

Sec. 301.6323(f)-1  Place for filing notice; form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Place for filing. The notice of lien referred to in Sec. 301.6323(a)-1 shall be filed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Under State laws--(i) Real property. In the case of real property, notice shall be filed in one office within the State (or the county or other governmental subdivision), as designated by the laws of the State, in which the property subject to the lien is deemed situated under the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Real property. In the case of real property, notice shall be filed in one office within the State (or the county or other governmental subdivision), as designated by the laws of the State, in which the property subject to the lien is deemed situated under the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Personal property. In the case of personal property, whether tangible or intangible, the notice shall be filed in one office within the State (or the county or other governmental subdivision), as designated by the laws of the State, in which the property subject to the lien is deemed situated under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> With the clerk of the United States district court. Whenever a State has not by law designated one office which meets the requirements of subparagraph (1)(i) or (1)(ii) of this paragraph (a), the notice shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the U.S. district court for the judicial district in which the property subject to the lien is deemed situated under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section. For example, a State has not by law designated one office meeting the requirements of subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph (a), if more than one office is designated within the State, county, or other governmental subdivision for filing notices with respect to all real property located in such State, county, or other governmental subdivision. A State has not by law designated one office meeting the requirements of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph (a), if more than one office is designated in the State, county, or other governmental subdivision for filing notices with respect to all of the personal property of a particular taxpayer. A state law that conforms to or reenacts a federal law establishing a national filing system does not constitute a designation by state law of an office for filing liens against personal property. Thus, if state law provides that a notice of lien affecting personal property must be filed in the office of the county clerk for the county in which the taxpayer resides and also adopts a federal law that requires a notice of lien to be filed in another location in order to attach to a specific type of property, the state is considered to have designated only one office for the filing of the notice of lien, and to protect its lien the Internal Revenue Service need only file its notice in the office of the county clerk for the county in which the taxpayer resides.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> With the Recorder of Deeds of the District of Columbia. If the property subject to the lien imposed by section 5321 is deemed situated, under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, in the District of Columbia, the notice shall be filed in the office of the Recorder of Deeds of the District of Columbia.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Situs of property subject to lien. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, property is deemed situated as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Real property. Real property is deemed situated at its physical location.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Personal property. Personal property, whether tangible or intangible, is deemed situated at the residence of the taxpayer at the time the notice of lien is filed.


For purposes of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (b), the residence of a corporation or partnership is deemed to be the place at which the principal executive office of the business is located, and the residence of a taxpayer whose residence is not within the United States is deemed to be in the District of Columbia.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> National filing system. The filing of federal tax liens is to be governed solely by the Internal Revenue Code and is not subject to any other federal law that may establish a national system for filing liens and encumbrances against a particular type of personal property. Thus, for example, the Service is not subject to the requirements established by the Federal Aviation Agency for filing liens against civil aircraft in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Form--(1) In general. The notice referred to in Sec. 301.6323(a)-1 shall be filed on Form 668, ``Notice of Federal Tax Lien Under Internal Revenue Laws''. Such notice is valid notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the form or content of a notice of lien. For example, omission from the notice of lien of a description of the property subject to the lien does not affect the validity thereof even though State law may require that the notice contain a description of the property subject to the lien.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The notice referred to in Sec. 301.6323(a)-1 shall be filed on Form 668, ``Notice of Federal Tax Lien Under Internal Revenue Laws''.

For example, omission from the notice of lien of a description of the property subject to the lien does not affect the validity thereof even though State law may require that the notice contain a description of the property subject to the lien.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Form 668 defined. The term Form 668 means either a paper form or a form transmitted electronically, including a form transmitted by facsimile (fax) or electronic mail (e-mail). A Form 668 must identify the taxpayer, the tax liability giving rise to the lien, and the date the assessment arose regardless of the method used to file the notice of Federal tax lien.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. The law of State X provides that notices of Federal tax lien affecting personal property are to be filed in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds of the county where the taxpayer resides. The laws of State X also provide that notices of lien affecting real property are to be filed with the recorder of deeds of the county where the real property is located. On June 1, 1970, in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed in county M with respect to the delinquent tax liability of A. At the time the notice is filed, A is a resident of county M and owns real property in that county. One year later A moves to county N and one year after that A moves to county O. Because the situs of personal property is deemed to be at the residence of the taxpayer at the time the notice of lien is filed, the notice continues to be effectively filed with respect to A's personal property even though A no longer resides in county M. Furthermore, because the situs of real property is deemed to be at its physical location, the notice of lien also continues to be effectively filed with respect to A's real property.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. B is a resident of Canada but owns personal property in the United States. On January 4, 1971, in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed with the Office of the Recorder of Deeds of the District of Columbia. On January 2, 1973, B changes his residence to State Y in the United States. Because the residence of a taxpayer who is not a resident of the United States is deemed to be in the District of Columbia and the situs of personal property is deemed to be at the residence of the taxpayer at the time of filing, the lien continues to be effectively filed with respect to the personal property of B located in the United States even though B has returned to the United States and taken up residence in State Y and even though B has at no time been in the District of Columbia.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The law of State Z in effect before July 1, 1967, provides that notices of lien affecting real property are to be filed in the office of the recorder of deeds of the county in which the real property is located, but that if the real property is registered under the Torrens system of title registration the notice is to be filed with the registrar of titles rather than the recorder of deeds. The law of State Z in effect after June 30, 1967, provides that all notices of lien affecting real property are to be filed with the recorder of deeds of the county in which the real property is located. Accordingly, where the Torrens system is adopted by a county in State Z, there were before July 1, 1967, two offices designated for filing notices of Federal tax lien affecting real property in the county because one office was designated for Torrens real property and another office was designated for non-Torrens real property. Because State Z had not designated one office within the State, county, or other governmental subdivision for filing notices before July 1, 1967, with respect to all real property located in the State, county, or governmental subdivision, before July 1, 1967, the place for filing notices of lien under this section, affecting property located in counties adopting the Torrens system, was with the clerk of the U.S. district court for the judicial district in which the real property is located. However, after June 30, 1967, the place for filing notices of lien under this section,

affecting both Torrens and non-Torrens real property in counties adopting the Torrens system is with the recorder of deeds for each such county. Notices of lien filed under this section with the clerk of the U.S. district court before July 1, 1967, remain validly filed whether or not refiled with the recorder of deeds after the change in State law or upon refiling during the required refiling period.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The law of State W provides that notices of lien affecting personal property of corporations and partnerships are to be filed in the office of the Secretary of State. Notices of lien affecting personal property of any other person are to be filed in the office of the clerk of court for the county where the person resides. Because the State law designates only one filing office within State W with respect to personal property of any particular taxpayer, notices of lien filed under this section, affecting personal property, shall be filed in the office designated under State law.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. The law of State F provides that notices of lien affecting personal property are to be filed with the clerk of the circuit court in the county in which the personal property is located. State F has conformed state law to federal law to provide that all instruments affecting title to an interest in any civil aircraft of the United States must be recorded in the Office of the Federal Aviation Administrator (FAA) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. On July 1, 1990, a tax lien arises against ABC airline, which owns aircraft situated in State F. The Internal Revenue Service files a Notice of Federal Tax Lien with the clerk of the circuit court in the county in which the aircraft is located but does not file the notice with the FAA in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Because the FAA system adopted by State F does not constitute a second place of filing pursuant to section 6323(f), the federal tax lien is validly filed.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Assume the same facts as Example 5 except that State F did not reenact or conform state law to the FAA requirements. The result is the same because the filing of federal tax liens is governed solely by the Internal Revenue Code, and is not subject to any other national filing system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective/applicability date.

If a notice of lien contains a certificate of release that provides that the lien is released at the end of the required refiling period unless the notice of lien is refiled, and the notice of lien is not refiled, then the lien is extinguished and the notice of lien is ineffective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> However, neither the failure to refile before the expiration of the refiling period, nor the release of the lien, shall alter or impair any right of the United States to property or its proceeds that is the subject of a levy or judicial proceeding commenced prior to the end of the refiling period or the release of the lien, except to the extent that a person acquires an interest in the property for adequate consideration after the commencement of the proceeding and does not have notice of, and is not bound by, the outcome of the proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a suit or levy referred to in the preceding sentence is dismissed or released and the property is subject to the lien at such time, a notice of lien

with respect to the property is not effective after the suit or levy is dismissed or released unless refiled during the required refiling period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Filing of new notice. If a notice of lien is not refiled, and the notice of lien contains a certificate of release that automatically releases the lien when the required refiling period ends, the lien is released as of that date and is no longer in existence. The Internal Revenue Service must revoke the release before it can file a new notice of lien. This new filing must meet the requirements of section 6323(f) and Sec. 301.6323(f)-1 and is effective from the date on which such filing is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Place for refiling notice of lien--(1) In general.

A notice of lien refiled during the required refiling period (described in paragraph (c) of this section) shall be effective only--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the notice of lien is refiled in the office in which the prior notice of lien (including a refiled notice) was filed under the provisions of section 6323; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In any case in which 90 days or more prior to the date the refiling of the notice of lien under subdivision (i) is completed, the Internal Revenue Service receives written information (in the manner described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (b)) concerning a change in the taxpayer's residence, if a notice of such lien is also filed in accordance with section 6323(f)(1)(A)(ii) in the State in which such new residence is located (or, if such new residence is located without the United States, in the District of Columbia).
A notice of lien is considered as refiled in the office in which the prior notice or refiled notice was filed under the provisions of section 6323 if it is refiled in the office which, pursuant to a change in the applicable local law, assumed the functions of the office in which the prior notice or refiled notice was filed. If on or before the 90th day referred to in subdivision (ii) more than one written notice is received concerning a change in the taxpayer's residence, a notice of lien is required by this subdivision to be filed only with respect to the residence shown on the written notice received on the most recent date. Subdivision (ii) is applicable regardless of whether the taxpayer resides at the new residence on the date the refiling of notice of lien under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is completed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notice of change of taxpayer's residence--(i) In general. Except as provided in subdivision (ii) or (iii) of this subparagraph, for purposes of this section, a notice of change of a taxpayer's residence will be effective only if it (A) is received, in writing, from the taxpayer or his representative by the district director or the service center director having jurisdiction where the original notice of lien was filed, (B) relates to an unpaid tax liability of the taxpayer, and (C) states the taxpayer's name and the address of his new residence. Although it is not necessary that a written notice contain the taxpayer's identifying number authorized by section 6109, it is preferable that it include such number. For purposes of this subdivision, a notice of change of a taxpayer's residence shown on a return or an amended return (including a return of the same tax) will not be effective to notify the Internal Revenue Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as provided in subdivision (ii) or (iii) of this subparagraph, for purposes of this section, a notice of change of a taxpayer's residence will be effective only if it (A) is received, in writing, from the taxpayer or his representative by the district director or the service center director having jurisdiction where the original notice of lien was filed, (B) relates to an unpaid tax liability of the taxpayer, and (C) states the taxpayer's name and the address of his new residence. Although it is not necessary that a written notice contain the taxpayer's identifying number authorized by section 6109, it is preferable that it include such number.

For the purpose of determining the date on which a notice of change of a taxpayer's residence is received under this section, the notice shall be treated as received on the date it is actually received by the Internal Revenue Service without reference to the provisions of section 7502.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of State M and owns real property in State N. In accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, notices of lien are filed in States M and N. The notices of lien contain certificates of release that release the lien at the end of the required refiling period. In order to continue the effect of the notice of lien filed in either M or N, the Internal Revenue Service must refile, during the required refiling period, the notice of lien with the appropriate office in M as well as with the appropriate office in N.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. B, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of State M. In accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, notice of lien is properly filed in that State. One year before the beginning of the required refiling period, B establishes his residence in State N, and B immediately notifies the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In order to continue the effect of the notice of lien filed in M, the Internal Revenue Service must refile, during the required refiling period, notices of lien with (i) the appropriate office in M, and (ii) the appropriate office in N, because B properly notified the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence to N more than 89 days prior to the date refiling of the notice of lien in M is completed. Even if the Internal Revenue Service had acquired actual notice or knowledge of B's change in residence by other means, if B had not properly notified the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence, the effect of the notice of lien in State M could have been continued without any refiling in State N.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. C, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of State O. In accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, notice of lien is properly filed in that State. Four years before the required refiling period, C establishes his residence in State P, and C immediately notifies the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Three years before the required refiling period, C establishes his residence in State R, and again C immediately notifies the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (2) of this section. In order to continue the effect of the notice of lien filed in O, the Internal Revenue Service must refile, during the required refiling period, notices of lien with (i) the appropriate office in O, and (ii) the appropriate office in R. Refiling in R is required because the notice received by the Service of C's change in residence to R was the most recent notice received more than 89 days prior to the date refiling in O is completed. The notice of lien is not required to be filed in P, even though C properly notified the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence to P, because such notice is not the most recent one received.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Assume the same facts as in example 3, except that C does not notify the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence to R in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In order to continue the effect of the notice of lien filed in O, the Internal Revenue Service must refile, during the required refiling period, the notice of lien with (i) the appropriate office in O, and (ii) the appropriate office in P. Refiling in P is required because C properly notified the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence to P, even though C is not a resident of P on the date refiling of the notice of lien in O is completed. The Internal Revenue Service is not required to file a notice of lien in R because C did not properly notify the Service of his change in residence to R.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. D, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of State M and owns real property in States N and O. In accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, the Internal Revenue Service files notices of lien in M, N, and O States. Nine years and 6 months after the date of the assessment shown on the notice of lien, D establishes his residence in P, and at that time the Internal Revenue Service receives from D a notification of his change in residence in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. On a date which is 9 years and 7 months after the date of the assessment shown on the notice of lien, the Internal Revenue Service properly refiles notices of lien in M, N, and O which refilings are sufficient to continue the effect of each of the notices of lien. The Internal Revenue Service is not required to file a notice of lien in P because D did not notify the Internal Revenue Service of his change of residence to P more than 89 days prior to the date each of the refilings in M, N, and O was completed.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Assume the same facts as in example 5 except that the refiling of the notice

of lien in O occurs 100 days after D notifies the Internal Revenue Service of hischange in residence to P in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In order to continue the effect of the notice of lien filed in O, in addition to refiling the notice of lien in O, the Internal Revenue Service must also refile, during the required refiling period, a notice of lien in P because D properly notified the Internal Revenue Service of his change of residence to P more than 89 days prior to the date the refiling in O was completed. However, the Internal Revenue Service is not required to refile the notice of lien in P to maintain the effect of the notices of lien in M and N because D did not notify the Internal Revenue Service of his change in residence to P more than 89 days prior to the date the refilings in M and N were completed.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. E, a delinquent taxpayer, is a resident of State T. Because T has not designated one office in the case of personal property for filing notices of lien in accordance with the provisions of section 6323(f)(1)(A)(ii), the Internal Revenue Service properly files a notice of lien with the clerk of the appropriate United States district court. However, solely as a matter of convenience for those who may have occasion to search for notices of lien, and not as a matter of legal effectiveness, the Internal Revenue Service also files notice of lien with the recorder of deeds of the county in T where E resides. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service sends a copy of the notice of lien to the X life insurance company to give the company actual notice of the notice of lien. In order to continue the effect of the notice of lien, the Internal Revenue Service must refile the notice of lien with the clerk of the appropriate United States district court during the required refiling period. In order to continue the effect of the notice of the lien, it is not necessary to refile the notice of lien with the Recorder of Deeds of the county where E resides, because the refiling of the notice of lien with the recorder of deeds does not constitute a proper filing for the purposes of section 6323(f). In addition, to continue the effect of the notice of lien under this section it is not necessary to send a copy of the notice of lien to the X life insurance company, because the sending of a notice of lien to an insurance company does not constitute a proper filing for the purposes of section 6323(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Required refiling period--(1) In general. For the purpose of this section, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the term required refiling period means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On March 10, 1998, an assessment of tax is made against B, a delinquent taxpayer, and a lien for the amount of the assessment arises on that date. On July 10, 1998, in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is filed. The notice of lien filed on July 10, 1998, is effective through April 9, 2008. The first required refiling period for the notice of lien begins on April 10, 2007, and ends on April 9, 2008. A refiling of the notice of lien during that period will extend the effectiveness of the notice of lien filed on July 10, 1998, through April 9, 2018. The second required refiling period for the notice of lien begins on April 10, 2017, and ends on April 9, 2018.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that the Internal Revenue Service fails to refile a notice of lien during the first required refiling period (April 10, 2007, through April 9, 2008). A notice of lien is filed on June 9, 2009, in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1. This notice is ineffective if the original notice contained a certificate of release, as the certificate of release would have had the effect of extinguishing the lien as of April 10, 2008. The Internal Revenue Service could revoke the release and file a new notice of lien, which would be effective as of the date it was filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effective/applicability date.

Sec. 301.6323(h)-1  Definitions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Security interest--(1) In general. The term ``security interest'' means any interest in property acquired by contract for the purpose of securing

payment or performance of an obligation or indemnifying against loss or liability. A security interest exists at any time--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The term ``security interest'' means any interest in property acquired by contract for the purpose of securing

payment or performance of an obligation or indemnifying against loss or liability. A security interest exists at any time--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If, at such time, the property is in existence and the interest has become protected under local law against a subsequent judgment lien (as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (a)) arising out of an unsecured obligation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To the extent that, at such time, the holder has parted with money or money's worth (as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (a)).
For purposes of this subparagraph, a contract right (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of Sec. 301.6323(c)-1) is in existence when the contract is made. An account receivable (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of Sec. 301.6323(c)-1) is in existence when, and to the extent, a right to payment is earned by performance.
A security interest must be in existence, within the meaning of this paragraph, at the time as of which its priority against a tax lien is determined. For example, to be afforded priority under the provisions of paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6323(a)-1 a security interest must be in existence within the meaning of this paragraph before a notice of lien is filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Protection against a subsequent judgment lien. (i) For purposes of this paragraph, a security interest is deemed to be protected against a subsequent judgment lien on--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of this paragraph, a security interest is deemed to be protected against a subsequent judgment lien on--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The date on which all actions required under local law to establish the priority of a security interest against a judgment lien have been taken, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If later, the date on which all required actions are deemed effective, under local law, to establish the priority of the security interest against a judgment lien.
For purposes of this subdivision, the dates described in (A) and (B) of this subdivision (i) shall be determined without regard to any rule or principle of local law which permits the relation back of any requisite action to a date earlier than the date on which the action is actually performed. For purposes of this paragraph, a judgment lien is a lien held by a judgment lien creditor as defined in paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (a)(2):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Under the law of State X, a security interest in certificated securities, negotiable documents, or instruments may be perfected, and hence protected against a judgment lien, by filing or by the secured party taking possession of the collateral. However, a security interest in such intangible personal property is considered to be temporarily perfected for a period of 20 days from the time the security interest attaches, to the extent that it arises for new value given under an authenticated security agreement. Under the law of X, a security interest attaches to such collateral when there is an agreement between the creditor and debtor that the interest attaches, the debtor has rights in the property, and consideration is given by the creditor. Under the law of X, in the case of temporary perfection, the security interest in such property is protected during the 20-day period against a judgment lien arising, after the security interest attaches, out of an unsecured obligation. Upon expiration of the 20-day period, the holder of the security interest must perfect its security interest under local law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because the security interest is perfected during the 20-day period against a subsequent judgment lien arising out of an unsecured obligation, and because filing or the taking of possession before the conclusion of the period of temporary perfection is not considered, for purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, to be a requisite action which relates back to the beginning of such period, the requirements of this paragraph are satisfied. Because filing or taking possession is a condition precedent to continued perfection, filing or taking possession of the collateral is a requisite action to establish such priority after expiration of the period of temporary perfection. If there is a lapse of perfection for failure to file or take possession, the determination of when the security interest exists (for purposes of protection against the tax lien) is made without regard to the period of temporary perfection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Money or money's worth. For purposes of this paragraph, the term money or money's worth includes money, a security (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section), tangible or intangible property, services, and other consideration reducible to a money value. Money or money's worth also includes any consideration which otherwise would constitute money or money's worth under the preceding sentence which was parted with before the security interest would otherwise exist if, under local law, past consideration is

sufficient to support an agreement giving rise to a security interest, and provided that the grant of the security interest is not a fraudulent transfer under local law or 28 U.S.C. Sec. 3304(a)(2). A firm commitment to part with money, a security, tangible or intangible property, services, or other consideration reducible to a money value does not, in itself, constitute a consideration in money or money's worth. A relinquishing or promised relinquishment of dower, curtesy, or of a statutory estate created in lieu of dower or curtesy, or of other marital rights is not a consideration in money or money's worth. Nor is love and affection, promise of marriage, or any other consideration not reducible to a money value a consideration in money or money's worth.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Holder of a security interest. For purposes of this paragraph, the holder of a security interest is the person in whose favor there is a security interest. For provisions relating to the treatment of a purchaser of commercial financing security as a holder of a security interest, see Sec. 301.6323(c)-1(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Mechanic's lienor--(1) In general. The term ``mechanic's lienor'' means any person who under local law has a lien on real property (or on the proceeds of a contract relating to real property) for services, labor, or materials furnished in connection with the construction or improvement (including demolition) of the property. A mechanic's lienor is treated as having a lien on the later of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The term ``mechanic's lienor'' means any person who under local law has a lien on real property (or on the proceeds of a contract relating to real property) for services, labor, or materials furnished in connection with the construction or improvement (including demolition) of the property. A mechanic's lienor is treated as having a lien on the later of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The date on which the mechanic's lien first becomes valid under local law against subsequent purchasers of the real property without actual notice, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The date on which the mechanic's lienor begins to furnish the services, labor, or materials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. On February 1, 1968, A lets a contract for the construction of an office building on property owned by him. On March 1, 1968, in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien for delinquent Federal taxes owed by A is filed. On April 1, 1968, B, a lumber dealer, delivers lumber to A's property. On May 1, 1968, B records a mechanic's lien against the property to secure payment of the price of the lumber. Under local law, B's mechanic's lien is valid against subsequent purchasers of real property without notice from February 1, 1968, which is the date the construction contract was entered into. Because the date on which B's mechanic's lien is valid under local law against subsequent purchasers is February 1, and the date on which B begins to furnish the materials is April 1, the date on which B becomes a mechanic's lienor within the meaning of this paragraph is April 1, the later of these two dates. Under paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6323(a)-1, B's mechanic's lien will not have priority over the Federal tax lien, even though under local law the mechanic's lien relates back to the date of the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Motor vehicle. (1) The term ``motor vehicle'' means a self-propelled vehicle which is registered for highway use under the laws of any State, the District of Columbia, or a foreign country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The term ``motor vehicle'' means a self-propelled vehicle which is registered for highway use under the laws of any State, the District of Columbia, or a foreign country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A motor vehicle is ``registered for highway use'' at the time of a sale if immediately prior to the sale it is so registered under the laws of any State, the District of Columbia, or a foreign country. Where immediately prior to the sale of a motor vehicle by a dealer, the dealer is permitted under local law to operate it under a dealer's tag, license, or permit issued to him, the motor vehicle is considered to be registered for highway use in the name of the dealer at the time of the sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Security. The term ``security'' means any bond, debenture, note, or certificate or other evidence of indebtedness, issued by a corporation or a government or political subdivision thereof, with interest coupons or in registered form, share of stock, voting trust certificate, or any certificate of interest or participation in, certificate of deposit or receipt for, temporary or interim certificate for, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing; negotiable instrument; or money.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Tax lien filing. The term ``tax lien filing'' means the filing of notice of the lien imposed by section 6321 in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Purchaser--(1) In general. The term ``purchaser'' means a person who, for adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth (as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (f)), acquires an interest (other than a lien or security interest) in property which

is valid under local law against subsequent purchasers without actual notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The term ``purchaser'' means a person who, for adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth (as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (f)), acquires an interest (other than a lien or security interest) in property which

is valid under local law against subsequent purchasers without actual notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interest in property. For purposes of this paragraph, each of the following interest is treated as an interest in property, if it is not a lien or security interest:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A lease of property,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A written executory contract to purchase or lease property,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An option to purchase or lease property and any interest therein, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> An option to renew or extend a lease of property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth. For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth'' means a consideration in money or money's worth having a reasonable relationship to the true value of the interest in property acquired. See paragraph (a)(3) of this section for definition of the term ``money or money's worth.'' Adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth may include the consideration in a bona fide bargain purchase. The term also includes the consideration in a transaction in which the purchaser has not completed performance of his obligation, such as the consideration in an installment purchase contract, even though the purchaser has not completed the installment payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A enters into a contract for the purchase of a house and lot from B. Under the terms of the contract A makes a down payment and is to pay the balance of the purchase price in 120 monthly installments. After payment of the last installment, A is to receive a deed to the property. A enters into possession, which under local law protects his interest in the property against subsequent purchasers without actual notice. After A has paid five monthly installments, a notice of lien for Federal taxes is filed against B in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1. Because the contract is an executory contract to purchase property and is valid under local law against subsequent purchasers without actual notice, A qualifies as a purchaser under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. C owns a residence which he leases to his son-in-law, D, for a period of 5 years commencing January 1, 1968. The lease provides for payment of $100 a year, although the fair rental value of the residence is $2,500 a year. The lease is recorded on December 31, 1967. On March 1, 1968, a notice of tax lien for unpaid Federal taxes of C is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1. Under local law, D's interest is protected against subsequent purchasers without actual notice. However, because the rental paid by D has no reasonable relationship to the value of the interest in property acquired, D does not qualify as a purchaser under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Judgment lien creditor. The term ``judgment lien creditor'' means a person who has obtained a valid judgment, in a court of record and of competent jurisdiction, for the recovery of specifically designated property or for a certain sum of money. In the case of a judgment for the recovery of a certain sum of money, a judgment lien creditor is a person who has perfected a lien under the judgment on the property involved. A judgment lien is not perfected until the identity of the lienor, the property subject to the lien, and the amount of the lien are established. Accordingly, a judgment lien does not include an attachment or garnishment lien until the lien has ripened into judgment, even though under local law the lien of the judgment relates back to an earlier date. If recording or docketing is necessary under local law before a judgment becomes effective against third parties acquiring liens on real property, a judgment lien under such local law is not perfected with respect to real property until the time of such recordation or docketing. If under local law levy or seizure is necessary before a judgment lien becomes effective against third parties acquiring liens on personal property, then a judgment lien under such local law is not perfected until levy or seizure of the personal property involved. The term ``judgment'' does not include the determination of a quasi-judicial body or of an individual acting in a quasi-judicial capacity such as the action of State taxing authorities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Effective/applicability date.

Sec. 301.6323(i)-1  Special rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Actual notice or knowledge. For purposes of subchapter C (section 6321

and following), chapter 64 of the Code, an organization is deemed, in any transaction, to have actual notice or knowledge of any fact from the time the fact is brought to the attention of the individual conducting the transaction, and in any event from the time the fact would have been brought to the individual's attention if the organization had exercised due diligence. An organization exercises due diligence if it maintains reasonable routines for communicating significant information to the person conducting the transaction and there is reasonable compliance with the routines. Due diligence does not require an individual acting for the organization to communicate information unless such communication is part of his regular duties or unless he has reason to know of the transaction and that the transaction would be materially affected by the information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Subrogation--(1) In general. Where, under local law, one person is subrogated to the rights of another with respect to a lien or interest, such person shall be subrogated to such rights for purposes of any lien imposed by section 6321 or 6324. Thus, if a tax lien imposed by section 6321 or 6324 is not valid with respect to a particular interest as against the holder of that interest, then the tax lien also is not valid with respect to that interest as against any person who, under local law, is a successor in interest to the holder of that interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Where, under local law, one person is subrogated to the rights of another with respect to a lien or interest, such person shall be subrogated to such rights for purposes of any lien imposed by section 6321 or 6324. Thus, if a tax lien imposed by section 6321 or 6324 is not valid with respect to a particular interest as against the holder of that interest, then the tax lien also is not valid with respect to that interest as against any person who, under local law, is a successor in interest to the holder of that interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. On February 1, 1968, an assessment is made and a tax lien arises with respect to A's delinquent tax liability. On February 25, 1968, in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1, a notice of lien is properly filed. On March 1, 1968, A negotiates a loan from B, the security for which is a second mortgage on property owned by A. The first mortgage on the property is held by C and has priority over the tax lien. Upon default by A, C begins proceedings to foreclose upon the first mortgage. On September 1, 1968, B pays the amount of principal and interest in default to C in order to protect the second mortgage against the pending foreclosure of C's senior mortgage. Under local law, B is subrogated to C's rights to the extent of the payment to C. Therefore, the tax lien is invalid against B to the extent he became subrogated to C's rights even though the tax lien is valid against B's second mortgage on the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Disclosure of amount of outstanding lien. If a notice of lien has been filed (see Sec. 301.6323(f)-1), the amount of the outstanding obligation secured by the lien is authorized to be disclosed as a matter of public record on Form 668 ``Notice of Federal Tax Lien Under Internal Revenue Laws.'' The amount of the outstanding obligation secured by the lien remaining unpaid at the time of an inquiry is authorized to be disclosed to any person who has a proper interest in determining this amount. Any person who has a right in the property or intends to obtain a right in the property by purchase or otherwise will, upon presentation by him of satisfactory evidence be considered to have a proper interest. Any person desiring this information may make his request to the office of the Internal Revenue Service named on the notice of lien with respect to which the request is made. The request should clearly describe the property subject to the lien, identify the applicable lien, and give the reasons for requesting the information.

Sec. 301.6323(j)-1  Withdrawal of notice of federal tax lien incertain circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. The Commissioner or his delegate (Commissioner) may withdraw a notice of federal tax lien filed under this section, if the Commissioner determines that any of the conditions in paragraph (b) of this section exist. A notice of federal tax lien is withdrawn by the filing by the Commissioner of a notice of withdrawal in the office in which the notice of federal tax lien is filed. If a notice of withdrawal is filed, chapter 64 of subtitle F, relating to collection, will be applied as if the withdrawn notice had never been filed. A copy of the notice of withdrawal will be provided to the taxpayer. Upon written request by a taxpayer with respect to whom a notice of federal tax lien has

been or will be withdrawn, the Commissioner will promptly make reasonable efforts to notify any credit reporting agency and any financial institution or creditor identified by the taxpayer of the withdrawal of such notice. The withdrawal of a notice of federal tax lien will not affect the underlying federal tax lien.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Conditions authorizing withdrawal. The Commissioner may authorize the withdrawal of a notice of federal tax lien upon determining that one of the following conditions exists:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Premature or not in accordance with administrative procedures. The filing of the notice of federal tax lien was premature or otherwise not in accordance with the administrative procedures of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Installment agreement. The taxpayer has entered into an agreement under section 6159 to satisfy the liability for which the lien was imposed by means of installment payments. Entry into an installment agreement may not, however, be the basis for withdrawal of a notice of lien if the installment agreement specifically provides that a notice of federal tax lien will not be withdrawn.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Facilitate collection. The withdrawal of the notice of federal tax lien will facilitate the collection of the tax liability for which the lien was imposed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Best interests of the United States and the taxpayer--(i) In general. The taxpayer or the National Taxpayer Advocate (or his delegate) has consented to the withdrawal of the notice of federal tax lien, and withdrawal of the notice would be in the best interest of the taxpayer, as determined by the taxpayer or the National Taxpayer Advocate (or his delegate), and in the best interest of the United States, as determined by the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The taxpayer or the National Taxpayer Advocate (or his delegate) has consented to the withdrawal of the notice of federal tax lien, and withdrawal of the notice would be in the best interest of the taxpayer, as determined by the taxpayer or the National Taxpayer Advocate (or his delegate), and in the best interest of the United States, as determined by the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Best interest of the taxpayer. When a taxpayer requests the withdrawal of notice of federal tax lien based on the best interests of the United States and the taxpayer, the National Taxpayer Advocate (or his delegate) generally will determine whether the withdrawal of the notice of federal tax lien is in the best interest of the taxpayer. If, however, a taxpayer requests the Commissioner to withdraw a notice and has not specifically requested the National Taxpayer Advocate (or his delegate) to determine the taxpayer's best interest, a finding by the Commissioner that the withdrawal of notice is in the best interest of the taxpayer will be sufficient to support withdrawal. If the Commissioner decides independently of a request by the taxpayer to withdraw a notice of federal tax lien, the taxpayer or the National Taxpayer Advocate (or his delegate) must consent to the withdrawal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (b):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A owes $1,000 in Federal income taxes. The IRS files a notice of federal tax lien to secure A's tax liability. However, the IRS failed to follow procedure provided by the Internal Revenue Manual (but not required by statute) with regard to managerial approval prior to the filing of a notice of federal tax lien. The Commissioner may withdraw the notice of federal tax lien because the filing of the notice was not in accordance with the Secretary's administrative procedures.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. A owes $1,000 in federal income taxes. A enters into an agreement to pay the outstanding federal income tax liability in installments. The agreement provides that a notice of federal tax lien may be filed if the taxpayer defaults. A timely pays the installments each month and has not defaulted in any way. Eleven months after entering into the installment agreement, the Internal Revenue Service files a notice of federal tax lien. Noting that there has been no default, the taxpayer asks the Internal Revenue Service to withdraw the notice of federal tax lien. In this situation, the Commissioner may withdraw the notice of federal tax lien because the taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. A is an employee of X Corporation. A notice of federal tax lien has been filed to secure an outstanding tax liability against A. A, who has no assets and no other secured creditors, has agreed to pay the balance of tax due through payroll deductions at a rate higher than the Internal Revenue Service could obtain through a wage levy in order to get the notice of federal tax lien withdrawn. X Corporation has agreed to allow A to enter into a payroll deduction agreement. In this situation, the Commissioner may withdraw the notice of federal tax lien to facilitate collection.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. A is owner of a farm machinery dealership against whom a notice of federal tax lien has been filed to secure an outstanding tax liability. A currently is paying

the tax liability by an installment agreement. X Corporation has agreed to provide A with 100 tractors to increase A's inventory if the notice of federal tax lien is withdrawn. A asks the Internal Revenue Service to withdraw the notice of federal tax lien. The Commissioner determines that the larger inventory would enable A to generate additional tractor sales. Increased sales would enable A to increase the amount of installment payments and, consequently, reduce the amount of time needed to satisfy the liability. A, who has no other assets or secured creditors, has agreed to modify the installment agreement. The Commissioner may withdraw the notice of federal tax lien because the withdrawal is in the best interest of the taxpayer and the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Determinations by the Commissioner. The Commissioner must determine whether any of the conditions authorizing the withdrawal of a notice of federal tax lien exist if a taxpayer submits a request for withdrawal in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. The Commissioner may also make this determination independent of a request from the taxpayer based on information received from a source other than the taxpayer. If the Commissioner determines that conditions authorizing the withdrawal are not present, the Commissioner may not authorize the withdrawal. If the Commissioner determines conditions for withdrawal are present, the Commissioner may (but is not required to) authorize the withdrawal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Procedures for request for withdrawal--(1) Manner. A request for the withdrawal of a notice of federal tax lien must be made in writing in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Manner. A request for the withdrawal of a notice of federal tax lien must be made in writing in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Form. The written request will include the following information and documents--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Name, current address, and taxpayer identification number of the person requesting the withdrawal of notice of federal tax lien;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A copy of the notice of federal tax lien affecting the taxpayer's property, if available;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The grounds upon which the withdrawal of notice of federal tax lien is being requested;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A list of the names and addresses of any credit reporting agency and any financial institution or creditor that the taxpayer wishes the Commissioner to notify of the withdrawal of notice of federal tax lien; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A request to disclose the withdrawal of notice of federal tax lien to the persons listed in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Supplemental list of credit agencies, financial institutions, and creditors--(1) In general. If the Commissioner grants a withdrawal of notice of federal tax lien, the taxpayer may supplement the list in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section. If no list was provided in the request to withdraw the notice of federal tax lien, the list in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section and the request for notification in paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section may be submitted after the notice is withdrawn.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If the Commissioner grants a withdrawal of notice of federal tax lien, the taxpayer may supplement the list in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section. If no list was provided in the request to withdraw the notice of federal tax lien, the list in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section and the request for notification in paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section may be submitted after the notice is withdrawn.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Manner. A request to supplement the list of any credit agencies and any financial institutions or creditors that the taxpayer wishes the Commissioner to notify of the withdrawal of notice of federal tax lien must be made in writing in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Form. The request must include the following information and documents--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Name, current address, and taxpayer identification number of the taxpayer requesting the notification of any credit agency or any financial institution or creditor of the withdrawal of notice of federal tax lien;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A copy of the notice of withdrawal, if available;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A supplemental list, identified as such, of the names and addresses of any credit reporting agency and any financial institution or creditor that the taxpayer wishes the Commissioner to notify of the withdrawal of notice of federal tax lien; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A request to disclose the withdrawal of notice of federal tax lien to the persons listed in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective date. This section applies on or after June 22, 2001, with respect to a withdrawal of any notice of federal tax lien.
