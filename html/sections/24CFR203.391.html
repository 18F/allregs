                            <p class="depth0">Payment of an insurance claim will not automatically be refused solely because the title evidence reveals a condition of title not taken into consideration in the original appraisal and not covered by the provisions of Sec. 203.389 of this part, or not otherwise waived in writing by the Secretary. In such instances, the Secretary may, at his or her option, approve the payment of a claim if the mortgagee agrees to accept a reduction in insurance benefits considered adequate by the Secretary to compensate for any anticipated loss to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund as a result of the existence of the title condition at the time of claim.
