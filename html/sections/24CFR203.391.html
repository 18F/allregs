In such instances, the Secretary may, at his  or her option, approve the payment of a claim if the mortgagee agrees to  accept a reduction in insurance benefits considered adequate by the  Secretary to compensate for any anticipated loss to the Mutual Mortgage  Insurance Fund as a result of the existence of the title condition at  the time of claim.
