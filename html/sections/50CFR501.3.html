                            <p class="depth0">Any individual may submit a request to be notified whether a system  of records, with respect to which the Commission has published a notice  in the Federal Register, contains a record pertaining to him or her.  Requests may be made in writing to the Privacy Officer or by appearing  in person at the Commission offices located at 1625 I Street, NW., Room  307, Washington, DC 20006 between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.  on any working day. Systems of records that are the subject of a request  should be identified by reference to the system name designated in the  Notice of Systems of Records published in the Federal Register. In the  event a system name is not known to the individual, a general request  will suffice if it indicates reasons for the belief that a record  pertaining to the named individual is maintained by the Commission.  Receipt of inquiries submitted by mail will be acknowledged within 10  days of receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public  holidays) unless a response can also be prepared and forwarded to the  individual within that time.</p>
