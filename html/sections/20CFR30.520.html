                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When an overpayment has been made to a recipient who is entitled  to further payments, the recipient shall refund to OWCP the amount of  the overpayment as soon as the error is discovered or his or her  attention is called to same. If no refund is made, OWCP shall recover  the overpayment by reducing any further lump-sum payments due currently  or in the future, taking into account the financial circumstances of the  recipient, and any other relevant factors, so as to minimize any  hardship. Should the recipient die before collection has been completed,  further collection shall be made by decreasing later payments, if any,  payable under EEOICPA with respect to the underlying occupational  illness or covered illness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When an overpayment has been made to a recipient and OWCP is  unable to recover the overpayment by reducing compensation due  currently, the recipient shall refund to OWCP the amount of the  overpayment as soon as the error is discovered or his or her attention  is called to same. The overpayment is subject to the provisions of the  Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended (31 U.S.C. 3701 et  seq.), and may be reported to the Internal Revenue Service as income. If  the recipient fails to make such refund, OWCP may recover the  overpayment through any available means, including offset of salary,  annuity benefits, or other Federal payments, including tax refunds as  authorized by the Tax Refund Offset Program, or referral of the debt to  a collection agency or to the Department of Justice.</p>
