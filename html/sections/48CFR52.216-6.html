                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 16.206-4, insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Price Redetermination--Retroactive (OCT 1997)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The unit price and the total price stated in this  contract shall be redetermined in accordance with this clause, but in no  event shall the total amount paid under this contract exceed ----  [insert dollar amount of ceiling price].</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definition. Costs, as used in this clause, means allowable costs  in accordance with part 31 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  in effect on the date of this contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Data submission. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within -- [Contracting Officer insert  number of days] days after delivery of all supplies to be delivered and  completion of all services to be performed under this contract, the  Contractor shall submit--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Proposed prices;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A statement in the format of table 15-2, FAR 15.408, or in any  other form on which the parties may agree, of all costs incurred in  performing the contract; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any other relevant data that the Contracting Officer may  reasonably require.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Contractor fails to submit the data required by  subparagraph (1) above within the time specified, the Contracting  Officer may suspend payments under this contract until the data are  furnished. If it is later determined that the Government has overpaid  the Contractor, the excess shall be repaid to the Government  immediately. Unless repaid within 30 days after the end of the data  submittal period, the amount of the excess shall bear interest, computed  from the date the data were due to the date of repayment, at the rate  established in accordance with the Interest clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Price determination. Upon the Contracting Officer's receipt of  the data required by paragraph (c) above, the Contracting Officer and  the Contractor shall promptly negotiate to redetermine fair and  reasonable prices for supplies delivered and services performed by the  Contractor under this contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Contract modification. The negotiated redetermination of price  shall be evidenced by a modification to this contract, signed by the  Contractor and the Contracting Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Adjusting billing prices. Pending execution of the contract  modification (see paragraph (e) above), the Contractor shall submit  invoices or vouchers in accordance with billing prices stated in this  contract. If at any time it appears that the then-current billing prices  will be substantially greater than the estimated final prices, or if the  Contractor submits data showing that the redetermined prices will be  substantially greater than the current billing prices, the parties shall  negotiate an appropriate decrease or increase in billing prices. Any  billing price adjustment shall be reflected in a contract modification  and shall not affect the redetermination of prices under this clause.  After the contract modification for price redetermination is executed,  the total amount paid or to be paid on all invoices or vouchers shall be  adjusted to reflect the agreed-upon prices, and any resulting additional  payments, refunds, or credits shall be made promptly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em>  shall apply until   final price redetermination under this contract has been completed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within 45 days after the end of the quarter of the Contractor's  fiscal year in which a delivery is first made (or services are first  performed) and accepted by the Government under this contract, and for  each quarter thereafter, the Contractor shall submit to the contract  administration office (with a copy to the contracting office and the  cognizant contract auditor), a statement, cumulative from the beginning  of the contract, showing--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The total contract price of all supplies delivered (or services  performed) and accepted by the Government and for which final prices  have been established;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The total costs (estimated to the extent necessary) reasonably  incurred for, and properly allocable solely to, the supplies delivered  (or services performed) and accepted by the Government and for which  final prices have not been established;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The portion of the total interim profit (used in establishing  the initial contract price or agreed to for the purpose of this  paragraph (g)) that is in direct proportion to the supplies delivered  (or services performed) and accepted by the Government and for which  final prices have not been established; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The total amount of all invoices or vouchers for supplies  delivered (or services performed) and accepted by the Government  (including amounts applied or to be applied to liquidate progress  payments).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding any provision of this contract authorizing  greater payments, if on any quarterly statement the amount under  subdivision (1)(iv) above exceeds the sum due the Contractor, as  computed in accordance with subdivisions (i), (ii), and (iii) above, the  Contractor shall immediately refund or credit to the Government the  amount of this excess. The Contractor may, when appropriate, reduce this  refund or credit by the amount of any applicable tax credits due the  contractor under 26 U.S.C. 1481 and by the amount of previous refunds or  credits effected under this clause. If any portion of the excess has  been applied to the liquidation of progress payments, then that portion  may, instead of being refunded, be added to the unliquidated progress  payment account, consistent with the Progress Payments clause. The  Contractor shall provide complete details to support any claimed  reduction in refunds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Contractor fails to submit the quarterly statement within  45 days after the end of each quarter and it is later determined that  the Government has overpaid the Contractor, the Contractor shall repay  the excess to the Government immediately. Unless repaid within 30 days  after the end of the statement submittal period, the amount of the  excess shall bear interest, computed from the date the quarterly  statement was due to the date of repayment, at the rate established in  accordance with the Interest clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Subcontracts. No subcontract placed under this contract may  provide for payment on a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Disagreements. If the Contractor and the Contracting Officer  fail to agree upon redetermined prices within 60 days (or within such  other period as the parties agree) after the date on which the data  required by paragraph (c) above are to be submitted, the Contracting  Officer shall promptly issue a decision in accordance with the Disputes  clause. For the purpose of paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) above, and  pending final settlement of the disagreement on appeal, by failure to  appeal, or by agreement, this decision shall be treated as an executed  contract modification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Termination. If this contract is terminated before price  redetermination, prices shall be established in accordance with this  clause for completed supplies and services not terminated. All other  elements of the termination shall be resolved in accordance with other  applicable clauses of this contract.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)  [48 FR 42478, Sept. 19, 1983, as amended at 60 FR 48221, Sept. 18, 1995;  61 FR 67426, Dec. 20, 1996; 62 FR 51265, Sept. 30, 1997]</p>
