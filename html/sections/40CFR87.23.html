                            <p class="depth0">This section describes the emission standards that apply for Tier 6 and Tier 8 engines. The standards of this section apply for aircraft engines manufactured on or after July 18, 2012, except where we specify that they apply differently by year, or where the engine is exempt from one or more standards of this section. Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, these standards apply based on the date the engine is manufactured. Where a gaseous emission standard is specified by a formula, calculate and round the standard to three significant figures or to the nearest 0.1 g/kN (for standards at or above 100 g/kN). Where a smoke standard is specified by a formula, calculate and round the standard to the

nearest 0.1 SN. Engines comply with an applicable standard if the testing results show that the engine type certificate family's characteristic level does not exceed the numerical level of that standard, as described in Sec. 87.60. The tier of standards identified for an engine relates to NOX emissions and that the specified standards for HC, CO, and smoke emissions apply independent of the changes to the NOX emission standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> New turboprop aircraft engines with rated output at or above 1,000 kilowatts must comply with a smoke standard of 187 . rO-0.168.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> New supersonic engines must comply with the standards shown in the following table:</p><p class="depth2">Table 1 to Sec.  87.23--Smoke and Gaseous Emission Standards for New Supersonic Engines----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">HC (g/kN rated      NOX (g/kN rated     CO (g/kN rated</p><p class="depth2">Rated output               Smoke number           output)             output)             output)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------rO <26.7 kN.....................  ..................  140 . 0.92rPR.....  36 + 2.42 . rPR...  4550 . rPR-1.03rO " 26.7 kN....................  83.6 . rO-0.274 or  140 . 0.92rPR.....  36+2.42 . rPR.....  4550 . rPR-1.03</p><p class="depth2">50.0, whichever</p><p class="depth2">is smaller.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> New turbofan or turbojet aircraft engines that are installed in subsonic aircraft must comply with the following standards:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The applicable smoke, HC, and CO standards are shown in the following table:</p><p class="depth3">Table 2 to Sec.  87.23--Smoke, HC, and CO Standards for New Subsonic Turbofan or Turbojet Engines----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Gaseous emission standards (g/kN</p><p class="depth3">rated output)</p><p class="depth3">Rated output (kN)                        Smoke standard          -----------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">HC                CO----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------rO <26.7 kN..............................  83.6 . rO-0.274 or 50.0,           ................</p><p class="depth3">whichever is smaller.rO "26.7 kN..............................  83.6 . rO-0.274 or 50.0,                       19.6               118</p><p class="depth3">whichever is smaller.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Tier 6 NOX standards apply as described in this paragraph (c)(2).

To be eligible for this exception the engines must have a date of manufacture prior to August 31, 2013 and be fully compliant with all requirements applicable to Tier 4 engines. The manufacturer must include these engines in the report required by Sec. 87.50. This exception is void for any manufacturer that produces more than six excepted engines under this paragraph.
