                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The enabling legislation for Fire Island National Seashore (the Seashore) mandated the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) to issue regulations which provide standards for local zoning in order to protect and conserve Fire Island. The regulations in this part set forth Federal standards to which local ordinances for Fire Island must conform to enable certain private property within the Seashore to be exempt from Federal condemnation. The standards also apply to use and development of public property. From time to time these standards may be reviewed and revised. These standards are intended:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To promote the protection and development of the land within the Seashore, for the purposes of the Fire Island National Seashore Act (the Act), by means of size, location, or use limitations or restrictions on commercial, residential, or other structures with the objective of controlling population density and protecting the island's natural resources;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To limit development and use of land to single-family homes, to prohibit development and use of multiple family homes, and to prohibit the conversion of structures to multiple family homes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To prohibit commercial or industrial uses initiated after September 11, 1964 or the expansion of existing commercial or industrial uses on any property within the Seashore which is inconsistent with the Federal standards and approved local ordinances or the purposes of the Act, is likely to cause a significant harm to the resources of the Seashore or will not provide a service to Fire Island;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> To recognize that the zoning authorities have the primary responsibility for zoning enforcement within the Seashore;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> To provide that private property within the Community Development District may be retained by its owner

as long as it is maintained in accordance with approved local ordinances and the Federal standards;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> To provide that, within the Seashore District, private ``improved property'' may be retained by its owner as long as it is maintained in accordance with approved local ordinances, and the Federal standards;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> To provide that, in the Dune District, private undeveloped property, if otherwise subject to condemnation, may be retained by its owner as long as it is maintained in its natural state; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> To provide a mechanism for the Superintendent to inform landowners and the zoning authority if a use or development will be inconsistent with the Federal standards or the purposes of the Act and may subject the property to condemnation, subject to available funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Secretary may utilize any other statutory authority available to the Secretary for the conservation and development of natural resources to the extent the Secretary finds that such authority will further the purpose of the Act.</p>
