                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definition--(1) Ex parte communication means any material oral or written communication relevant to the merits of an adjudicatory proceeding that was neither on the record nor on

reasonable prior notice to all parties that takes place between--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ex parte communication means any material oral or written communication relevant to the merits of an adjudicatory proceeding that was neither on the record nor on

reasonable prior notice to all parties that takes place between--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An interested person outside the NCUA (including such person's counsel); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The administrative law judge handling that proceeding, the NCUA Board, or a decisional employee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exception. A request for status of the proceeding does not constitute an ex parte communication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Prohibition of ex parte communications. From the time the notice is issued by the NCUA Board until the date that the NCUA Board issues its final decision pursuant to Sec. 747.40(c):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No interested person outside the NCUA shall make or knowingly cause to be made an ex parte communication to any member of the NCUA Board, the administrative law judge, or a decisional employee; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No member of the NCUA Board, administrative law judge, or decisional employee shall make or knowingly cause to be made to any interested person outside the NCUA any ex parte communication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedure upon occurrence of ex parte communication. If an ex parte communication is received by the administrative law judge, a member of the NCUA Board or any other person identified in paragraph (a) of this section, that person shall cause all such written communications (or, if the communication is oral, a memorandum stating the substance of the communication) to be placed on the record of the proceeding and served on all parties. All other parties to the proceeding shall have an opportunity, within ten days of receipt of service of the ex parte communication, to file responses thereto and to recommend any sanctions, in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, that they believe to be appropriate under the circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Sanctions. Any party or his or her counsel who makes a prohibited ex parte communication, or who encourages or solicits another to make any such communication, may be subject to any appropriate sanction or sanctions imposed by the NCUA Board or the administrative law judge including, but not limited to, exclusion from the proceedings and an adverse ruling on the issue which is the subject of the prohibited communication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Separation of functions. Except to the extent required for the disposition of ex parte matters as authorized by law, the administrative law judge may not consult a person or party on any matter relevant to the merits of the adjudication, unless on notice and opportunity for all parties to participate. An employee or agent engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions for the NCUA in a case may not, in that or a factually related case, participate or advise in the decision, recommended decision, or agency review of the recommended decision under section 747.40, except as witness or counsel in public proceedings.
