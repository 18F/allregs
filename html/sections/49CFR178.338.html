Sec. 178.338-3  Structural integrity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General requirements and acceptance criteria. (1) Except as permitted in paragraph (d) of this section, the maximum calculated design stress at any point in the tank may not exceed the lesser of the maximum allowable stress value prescribed in section VIII of the ASME Code, or 25 percent of the tensile strength of the material used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The relevant physical properties of the materials used in each tank may be established either by a certified test report from the material manufacturer or by testing in conformance with a recognized national standard. In either case, the ultimate tensile strength of the material used in the design may not exceed 120 percent of the minimum ultimate tensile strength specified in either the ASME Code or the ASTM standard to which the material is manufactured.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The maximum design stress at any point in the tank must be calculated separately for the loading conditions described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. Alternate test or analytical methods, or a combination thereof, may be used in lieu of the procedures described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, if the methods are accurate and verifiable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Corrosion allowance material may not be included to satisfy any of the design calculation requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Static design and construction. (1) The static design and construction of each tank must be in accordance with appendix G in Section VIII of the ASME Code (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter). The tank design must include calculation of stress due to the design pressure, the weight of lading, the weight of structures supported by the tank wall, and the effect of temperature gradients resulting from lading and ambient temperature extremes. When dissimilar materials are used, their thermal coefficients must be used in calculation of the thermal stresses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Stress concentrations in tension, bending, and torsion which occur at pads, cradles, or other supports must be considered in accordance with appendix G in Section VIII of the ASME Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Stresses resulting from static and dynamic loadings, or a combination thereof, are not uniform throughout the cargo tank motor vehicle. The following is a simplified procedure for calculating the effective stress in the tank resulting from static and dynamic loadings. The effective stress (the maximum principal stress at any point) must be determined by the following formula:
S = 0.5 (Sy + Sx) [(0.25(Sy - Sx)\2\ + Ss2) \0.5\

Where:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> S = effective stress at any given point under the most severe combination of static and dynamic loadings that can occur at the same time, in psi.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sy = circumferential stress generated by internal and external pressure when applicable, in psi.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Sx = the net longitudinal stress, in psi, generated by the following loading conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The longitudinal tensile stress generated by internal pressure;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The tensile or compressive stress generated by the axial load resulting from a decelerative force applied independently to each suspension assembly at the road surface using applicable static loadings specified in Sec. 178.338-13 (b);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The tensile or compressive stress generated by the bending moment resulting from a decelerative force applied independently to each suspension assembly at the road surface using applicable static loadings specified in Sec. 178.338-13 (b);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The tensile or compressive stress generated by the axial load resulting from an accelerative force applied to the horizontal pivot of the fifth wheel supporting the vehicle using applicable static loadings specified in Sec. 178.338-13 (b);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The tensile or compressive stress generated by the bending moment resulting from an accelerative force applied to the horizontal pivot of the fifth wheel supporting the vehicle using applicable static loadings specified in Sec. 178.338-13 (b); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The tensile or compressive stress generated by a bending moment produced by a vertical force using applicable static loadings specified in Sec. 178.338-13 (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Ss = The following shear stresses that apply, in psi,: The vectorial sum of the applicable shear stresses in the plane under consideration, including direct shear generated by the static vertical loading; direct lateral and torsional shear generated by a lateral accelerative force applied at the road surface, using applicable static loads specified in Sec. 178.338-13 (b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> In order to account for stresses due to impact in an accident, the design calculations for the tank shell and heads must include the load resulting from the design pressure in combination with the dynamic pressure resulting from a longitudinal deceleration of ``2g''. For this loading condition the stress value used may not exceed the lesser of the yield strength or 75 percent of the ultimate tensile strength of the material of construction. For a cargo tank constructed of stainless steel, the maximum design stress may not exceed 75 percent of the ultimate tensile strength of the type steel used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The minimum thickness of the shell or heads of the tank must be 0.187 inch for steel and 0.270 inch for aluminum. However, the minimum thickness for steel may be 0.110 inches provided the cargo tank is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Vacuum insulated, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Double walled with a load bearing jacket designed to carry a proportionate amount of structural loads prescribed in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Where a tank support is attached to any part of the tank wall, the stresses imposed on the tank wall must meet the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The design, construction and installation of an attachment, appurtenance to the cargo tank or structural support member between the cargo tank and the vehicle or suspension component or accident protection device must conform to the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Structural members, the suspension subframe, accident protection structures and external circumferential reinforcement devices must be used as sites for attachment of appurtenances and other accessories to the cargo tank, when practicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A lightweight attachment to the cargo tank wall such as a conduit clip, brakeline clip, skirting structure, lamp mounting bracket, or placard holder must be of a construction having lesser strength than the cargo tank wall materials and may not be more than 72 percent of the thickness of the material to which it is attached. The lightweight attachment may be secured directly to the cargo tank wall if the device is designed and installed in such a manner that, if damaged, it will not affect the lading retention integrity of the tank. A lightweight attachment must be secured to the cargo tank shell or head by a continuous weld or in such a manner as to preclude formation of pockets that may become sites for corrosion. Attachments meeting the requirements of this paragraph are not authorized for cargo tanks constructed under part UHT in Section VIII of the ASME Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Except as prescribed in paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section, the welding of any appurtenance the cargo tank wall must be made by attachment of a mounting pad so that there will be no adverse effect upon the lading retention integrity of the cargo tank if any force less than that prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is applied from any direction. The thickness of the mounting pad may not be less than that of the shell or head to which it is attached, and not more than 1.5 times the shell or head thickness. However, a pad with a minimum thickness of 0.187 inch may be used when the shell or head thickness is over 0.187 inch. If weep holes or tell-tale holes are used, the pad must be drilled or punched at the lowest point before it is welded to the tank. Each pad must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Be fabricated from material determined to be suitable for welding to both the cargo tank material and the

material of the appurtenance or structural support member; a Design Certifying Engineer must make this determination considering chemical and physical properties of the materials and must specify filler material conforming to the requirements in Section IX of the ASME Code (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Be preformed to an inside radius no greater than the outside radius of the cargo tank at the attachment location.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Extend at least 2 inches in each direction from any point of attachment of an appurtenance or structural support member. This dimension may be measured from the center of the attached structural member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Have rounded corners, or otherwise be shaped in a manner to minimize stress concentrations on the shell or head.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Be attached by continuous fillet welding. Any fillet weld discontinuity may only be for the purpose of preventing an intersection between the fillet weld and a tank or jacket seam weld.

Sec. 178.338-7  Openings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The inlet to the liquid product discharge opening of each tank intended for flammable ladings must be at the bottom centerline of the tank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If the leakage of a single valve, except a pressure relief valve, pressure control valve, full trycock or gas phase manual vent valve, would permit loss of flammable material, an additional closure that is leak tight at the tank

Sec. 178.338-8  Pressure relief devices, piping, valves, and fittings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Pressure relief devices. Each tank pressure relief device must be designed, constructed, and marked in accordance with Sec. 173.318(b) of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Piping, valves, and fittings. (1) The burst pressure of all piping, pipe fittings, hoses and other pressure parts, except for pump seals and pressure relief devices, must be at least 4 times the design pressure of the tank. Additionally, the burst pressure may not be less than 4 times any higher pressure to which each pipe, pipe fitting, hose or other pressure part may be subjected to in service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Pipe joints must be threaded, welded or flanged. If threaded pipe is used, the pipe and fittings must be Schedule 80 weight or heavier. Malleable metals must be used in the construction of valves and fittings. Where copper tubing is permitted, joints shall be brazed or be of equally strong metal union type. The melting point of the brazing materials may not be lower than 1000 F. The method of joining tubing may not reduce the strength of the tubing, such as by the cutting of threads.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Each hose coupling must be designed for a pressure of at least 120 percent of the hose design pressure and so that there will be no leakage when connected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Piping must be protected from damage due to thermal expansion and contraction, jarring, and vibration.

Sec. 178.338-9  Holding time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> ``Holding time'' is the time, as determined by testing, that will elapse from loading until the pressure of the contents, under equilibrium conditions, reaches the level of the lowest pressure control valve or pressure relief valve setting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Holding time test. (1) The test to determine holding time must be performed by charging the tank with a cryogenic liquid having a boiling point, at a pressure of one atmosphere, absolute, no lower than the design service temperature of the tank. The tank must be charged to its maximum permitted filling density with that liquid and stabilized to the lowest practical pressure, which must be equal to or less than the pressure to be used for loading. The cargo tank together with its contents must then be exposed to ambient temperature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The tank pressure and ambient temperature must be recorded at 3-hour intervals until the pressure level of the contents reaches the set-to-discharge pressure of the pressure control valve or pressure relief valve with the lowest setting. This total time lapse in hours represents the measured holding time at the actual average ambient temperature. This measured holding time for the test cryogenic liquid must be adjusted to an equivalent holding time for each cryogenic liquid that is

to be identified on or adjacent to the specification plate, at an average ambient temperature of 85 F. This is the rated holding time (RHT). The marked rated holding time (MRHT) displayed on or adjacent to the specification plate (see Sec. 178.338-18(c)(10)) may not exceed this RHT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Optional test regimen. (1) If more than one cargo tank is made to the same design, only one cargo tank must be subjected to the full holding time test at the time of manufacture. However, each subsequent cargo tank made to the same design must be performance tested during its first trip. The holding time determined in this test may not be less than 90 percent of the marked rated holding time. This test must be performed in accordance with Secs. 173.318(g)(3) and 177.840(h) of this subchapter, regardless of the classification of the cryogenic liquid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Same design.

Sec. 178.338-13  Supporting and anchoring.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> On a cargo tank motor vehicle designed and constructed so that the cargo tank constitutes in whole or in part the structural member used in place of a motor vehicle frame, the cargo tank or the jacket must be supported by external cradles or by load rings. For a cargo tank mounted on a motor vehicle frame, the tank or jacket must be supported by external cradles, load rings, or longitudinal members. If cradles are used, they must subtend at least 120 degrees of the cargo tank circumference. The design calculations for the supports and load-bearing tank or jacket, and the support attachments must include beam stress, shear stress, torsion stress, bending moment, and acceleration stress for the loaded vehicle as a unit, using a safety factor of four, based on the tensile strength of the material, and static loading that uses the weight of the cargo tank and its attachments when filled to the design weight of the lading (see appendix G in Section VIII of the ASME Code) (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter), multiplied by the following factors. The effects of fatigue must also be considered in the calculations.

The enhanced tensile strength of the material at actual operating temperature may be substituted for the tensile strength at ambient temperature to the extent recognized in the ASME Code for static loadings. Static loadings must take into consideration the weight of the tank and the structural members when the tank is filled to the design weight of lading (see Appendix G of Section VIII, Division 1 of the ASME Code), multiplied by the following factors. Static loadings must take into consideration the weight of the tank and the structural members when the tank is filled to the design weight of lading (see appendix G in Section VIII of the ASME Code), multiplied by the following factors. When load rings in the jacket are used for supporting the tank, they must be designed to carry the fully loaded tank at the specified static loadings, plus external pressure.

Sec. 178.338-14  Gauging devices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Liquid level gauging devices. (1) Unless a cargo tank is intended to be filled by weight, it must be equipped with one or more gauging devices, which accurately indicate the maximum permitted liquid level at the loading pressure, in order to provide a minimum of two percent outage below the inlet of the pressure control valve or pressure relief valve at the condition of incipient opening of that valve. A fixed-length dip tube, a fixed trycock line, or a differential pressure liquid

level gauge must be used as the primary control for filling. Other gauging devices, except gauge glasses, may be used, but not as the primary control for filling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The design pressure of each liquid level gauging device must be at least that of the tank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If a fixed length dip tube or trycock line gauging device is used, it must consist of a pipe or tube of small diameter equipped with a valve at or near the jacket and extending into the cargo tank to a specified filling height. The fixed height at which the tube ends in the cargo tank must be such that the device will function when the liquid reaches the maximum level permitted in loading.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The liquid level gauging device used as a primary control for filling must be designed and installed to accurately indicate the maximum filling level at the point midway of the tank both longitudinally and laterally.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Pressure gauges. Each cargo tank must be provided with a suitable pressure gauge indicating the lading pressure and located on the front of the jacket so it can be read by the driver in the rear view mirror. Each gauge must have a reference mark at the cargo tank design pressure or the set pressure of the pressure relief valve or pressure control valve, whichever is lowest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Orifices. All openings for dip tube gauging devices and pressure gauges in flammable cryogenic liquid service must be restricted at or inside the jacket by orifices no larger than 0.060-inch diameter. Trycock lines, if provided, may not be greater than \1/2\-inch nominal pipe size.

The test pressure must be one and one-half times the sum of the design pressure, plus static head of lading, plus 101.3 kPa (14.7 psi) if subjected to external vacuum, except that for tanks constructed in accordance with Part UHT in Section VIII of the ASME Code the test pressure must be twice the design pressure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Additional requirements for pneumatic test. A pneumatic test may be used in place of the hydrostatic test. Due regard for protection of all personnel should be taken because of the potential hazard involved in a pneumatic test. The pneumatic test pressure in the tank must be reached by gradually increasing the pressure to one-half of the test pressure. Thereafter, the test pressure must be increased in steps of approximately one-tenth of the test pressure until the required test pressure has been reached. Then the pressure must be reduced to a value equal to four-fifths of the test pressure and held for a sufficient time to permit inspection of the cargo tank for leaks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Weld inspection. All tank shell or head welds subject to pressure shall be radiographed in accordance with Section VIII of the ASME Code. A tank which has been subjected to inspection by the magnetic particle method, the liquid penetrant method, or any method involving a material deposit on the interior tank surface, must be cleaned to remove any such residue by scrubbing or equally effective means, and all such residue and cleaning solution must be removed from the tank prior to final closure of the tank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Defect repair. All cracks and other defects must be repaired as prescribed in Section VIII of the ASME Code. The welder and the welding procedure must be qualified in accordance with Section

IX of the ASME Code (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter). After repair, the tank must again be postweld heat-treated, if such heat treatment was previously performed, and the repaired areas must be retested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Verification must be made of the interior cleanliness of a tank constructed for oxygen service by means that assure that all contaminants that are likely to react with the lading have been removed as required by Sec. 178.338-15.
