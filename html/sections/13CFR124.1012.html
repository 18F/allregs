                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Upon receipt of a protest challenging the disadvantaged status  of a concern, the DC/SDBCE, or designee, will immediately notify the  protestor and the contracting officer of the date the protest was  received and whether it will be processed or dismissed for lack of  timeliness or specificity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In cases where the protest is timely and sufficiently specific,  the DC/SDBCE, or designee, will also immediately advise the protested  concern of the protest and forward a copy of it to the protested  concern.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The DC/SDBCE, or designee, is authorized to ask the protested  concern to provide any or all of the following information and  documentation, completed so as to show the circumstances existing on the  date of self-representation: SBA Form 1010A, ``Statement of Personal  Eligibility'' for each individual claiming disadvantaged status; SBA  Form 1010B, ``Statement of Business Eligibility;'' SBA Form 413,  ``Personal Financial Statement,'' for each individual claiming  disadvantaged status; information as to whether the protested concern,  or any of its owners, officers or directors, have applied for admission  to or participated in the SBA's 8(a) BD program and if so, the name of  the company which applied or participated and the date of the  application or entry into the program; business tax returns for the last  two completed fiscal years prior to the date of self-representation;  personal tax returns for the last two years prior to the date of self- representation for all individuals   claiming disadvantaged status, all officers, all directors and for any  individual owning at least 10% of the business entity; annual business  financial statements for the last two completed fiscal years prior to  the date of self-representation; a current monthly or quarterly business  financial statement no older than 90 days; articles of incorporation;  corporate by-laws; partnership agreements; limited liability company  articles of organization; and any other relevant information as to  whether the protested concern is disadvantaged.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> SBA's disadvantaged status determination need not be limited to  consideration only of the issues raised in the protest. SBA may consider  other applicable criteria.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unless the protest presents specific credible information which  calls into question the veracity of application or other documents  previously submitted to SBA by a current Participant in SBA's 8(a) BD  program, SBA will allow the Participant to submit, in lieu of the  information specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a sworn  affidavit or declaration that circumstances concerning the ownership and  control of the business and the disadvantaged status of its principals  have not changed since its application or entry into the program or its  most recent annual review, and a copy of its most recently completed  annual review.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the ownership or control of the business or the disadvantaged  status of any principals have changed, the protested concern must comply  with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An affidavit or declaration may be allowed only if SBA admitted  the protested concern to the 8(a) BD program, or conducted an annual  review of the protested concern, during the 12month period preceding the  date on which SBA receives the protest, and if proceedings to suspend,  terminate or early graduate the concern from the 8(a) BD program are not  pending.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Within 10 working days of the date that notification of the  protest was received from the DC/SDBCE or designee, the protested  concern must submit to the DC/SDBCE or designee, by personal delivery,  FAX, or mail, the information and documentation requested pursuant to  paragraph (b)(1) of this section or the affidavit permitted by paragraph  (b)(2) of this section. Materials submitted must be received by the  close of business on the 10th working day.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> SBA will consider only materials submitted timely, and the late  or non-submission of materials needed to make a disadvantaged status  determination may result in sustaining the protest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The burden is on the protested concern to demonstrate its  disadvantaged status, whether or not it is currently shown on the list  of qualified SDBs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The protested concern must timely submit to SBA any information  it deems relevant to a determination of its disadvantaged status.
