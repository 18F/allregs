                            <p class="depth0">If the participant's death is the result of a homicide, a  beneficiary will not be paid as long as the beneficiary is under  investigation by local, state or Federal law enforcement authorities as  a suspect. If the beneficiary is implicated in the death of the  participant and the beneficiary would be precluded from inheriting under  state law, the beneficiary will not be entitled to receive any portion  of the participant's account. The Board will follow the state law of the  participant's domicile as that law is set forth in a civil court  judgment (that, under the law of the state, would protect the Board from  double liability or payment) or, in the absence of such a judgment, will  apply state law to the facts after all criminal appeals are exhausted.  The Board will treat the beneficiary as if he or she predeceased the  participant and the account will be paid in accordance with  Sec. 1651.10.
