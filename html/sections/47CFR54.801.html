At the subsequent report to the Administrator for purposes of recalculating support as required by Sec. 54.808, the acquiring and selling price cap local exchange carriers will reflect the acquired and sold lines, and will adjust the Average CMT Revenue per Line month for the affected study areas accordingly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Administrator for the fund created by this subpart shall be the Universal Service Administrative Company.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Beginning January 1, 2012, no incumbent or competitive eligible telecommunications carrier shall receive support pursuant to this subpart, nor shall any incumbent or competitive eligible telecommunications carrier be required to complete any filings pursuant to this subpart after March 31, 2012.
