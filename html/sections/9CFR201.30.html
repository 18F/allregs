                                Sec. 201.30  Amount of market agency, dealer and packer bonds.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Market agency selling livestock on commission. To compute the  required amount of bond coverage, divide the dollar value of livestock  sold during the preceding business year, or the substantial part of that  business year, in which the market agency did business, by the actual  number of days on which livestock was sold. The divisor (the number of  days on which livestock was sold) shall not exceed 130. The amount of  bond coverage must be the next multiple of $5,000 above the amount so  determined. When the computation exceeds $50,000, the amount of bond  coverage need not exceed $50,000 plus 10 percent of the excess over  $50,000, raised to the next $5,000 multiple. In no case shall the amount  of bond coverage for a market agency selling on commission be less than  $10,000 or such higher amount as required to comply with any State law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Market agency buying on commission or dealer. The amount of bond  coverage must be based on the average amount of livestock purchased by  the dealer or market agency during a period equivalent to 2 business  days. To compute the required amount of bond coverage, divide the total  dollar value of livestock purchased during the preceding business year,  or substantial part of that business year, in which the dealer or market  agency or both did business, by one-half the number of days on which  business was conducted. The number of days in any business year, for  purposes of this regulation, shall not exceed 260. Therefore, the  divisor (one-half the number of days on which business was conducted)  shall not exceed 130. The amount of the bond coverage must be the next  multiple of $5,000 above the amount so determined. When the computation  exceeds $75,000, the amount of bond coverage need not exceed $75,000  plus 10 percent of the excess over $75,000, raised to the next $5,000  multiple. In no case shall the amount of bond coverage be less than  $10,000 or such higher amount as required to comply with any State law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Market agency acting as clearing agency. The amount of bond  coverage must be based on the average amount of livestock purchased by  all persons for whom the market agency served as a clearor during a  period equivalent to 2 business days. To compute the required amount of  bond coverage, divide the total dollar value of livestock purchased by  all persons for whom the   market agency served as a clearor during the preceding business year, or  substantial part of that business year, in which the market agency  acting as clearing agency did business, by one-half the number of days  on which business was conducted. The number of days in any business  year, for purposes of this regulation, shall not exceed 260. Therefore,  the divisor (one-half the number of days on which business was  conducted) shall not exceed 130. The amount of bond coverage must be the  next multiple of $5,000 above the amount so determined. When the  computation exceeds $75,000, the amount of bond coverage need not exceed  $75,000 plus 10 percent of the excess over $75,000, raised to the next  $5,000 multiple. In no case shall the amount of bond coverage be less  than $10,000 or such higher amount as required to comply with any State  law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Packer. The amount of bond coverage must be based on the average  amount of livestock purchased by the packer during a period equivalent  to 2 business days. To compute the required amount of bond coverage,  divide the total dollar value of livestock purchased during the  preceding business year, or substantial part of that business year, in  which the packer did business, by one-half the number of days on which  business was conducted. The number of days in any business year, for  purposes of this regulation, shall not exceed 260. Therefore, the  divisor (one-half the number of days on which business was conducted)  shall not exceed 130. The amount of the bond coverage must be the next  multiple of $5,000 above the amount so determined. In no case shall the  amount of bond coverage for a packer be less than $10,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a person applying for registration as a market agency or  dealer has been engaged in the business of handling livestock before the  date of the application, the value of the livestock handled, if  representative of future operations, must be used in computing the  required amount of bond coverage. If the applicant for registration is a  successor in business to a registrant formerly subject to these  regulations, the amount of bond coverage of the applicant must be at  least that amount required of the prior registrant, unless otherwise  determined by the Administrator. If a packer becomes subject to these  regulations, the value of livestock purchased, if representative of  future operations, must be used in computing the required amount of bond  coverage. If a packer is a successor in business to a packer formerly  subject to these regulations, the amount of bond coverage of the  successor must be at least that amount required of the prior packer,  unless otherwise determined by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Whenever the Administrator has reason to believe that a bond is  inadequate to secure the performance of the obligations of the market  agency, dealer or packer covered thereby, the Administrator shall notify  such person to adjust the bond to meet the requirements the  Administrator determines to be reasonable.
