                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A draft EIS shall be prepared when the Administration determines  that the action is likely to cause significant impacts on the  environment. When the applicant, after consultation with any project  sponsor that is not the applicant, has notified the Administration in  accordance with 23 U.S.C. 139(e) and the decision has been made by the  Administration to prepare an EIS, the Administration will issue a Notice  of Intent (40 CFR 1508.22) for publication in the Federal Register.  Applicants are encouraged to announce the intent to prepare an EIS by  appropriate means at the local level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> After publication of the Notice of Intent, the lead agencies, in  cooperation with the applicant (if not a lead agency), will begin a  scoping process which may take into account any planning work already  accomplished, in accordance with 23 CFR 450.212 or 450.318. The scoping  process will be used to identify the purpose and need, the range of  alternatives and impacts, and the significant issues to be addressed in  the EIS and to achieve the other objectives of 40 CFR 1501.7. For the  FHWA, scoping is normally achieved through public and agency involvement  procedures required by Sec. 771.111. For FTA, scoping is achieved by  soliciting agency and public responses to the action by letter or by  holding scoping meetings. If a scoping meeting is to be held, it should  be announced in the Administration's Notice of Intent and by appropriate  means at the local level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The draft EIS shall be prepared by the lead agencies, in  cooperation with the applicant (if not a lead agency). The draft EIS  shall evaluate all reasonable alternatives to the action and discuss the  reasons why other alternatives, which may have been considered, were  eliminated from detailed study. The draft EIS shall also summarize the  studies, reviews, consultations, and coordination required by  environmental laws or Executive Orders to the extent appropriate at this  stage in the environmental process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any of the lead agencies may select a consultant to assist in  the preparation of an EIS in accordance with applicable contracting  procedures and with 40 CFR 1506.5(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Administration, when satisfied that the draft EIS complies  with NEPA requirements, will approve the draft EIS for circulation by  signing and dating the cover sheet.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A lead, joint lead, or a cooperating agency shall be responsible  for printing the EIS. The initial printing of the draft EIS shall be in  sufficient quantity to meet requirements for copies which can reasonably  be expected from agencies, organizations, and individuals. Normally,  copies will be furnished free of charge. However, with Administration  concurrence, the party requesting the draft EIS may be charged a fee  which is not more than the actual cost   of reproducing the copy or may be directed to the nearest location where  the statement may be reviewed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The draft EIS shall be circulated for comment by the applicant  on behalf of the Administration. The draft EIS shall be made available  to the public and transmitted to agencies for comment no later than the  time the document is filed with the Environmental Protection Agency in  accordance with 40 CFR 1506.9. The draft EIS shall be transmitted to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Public officials, interest groups, and members of the public  known to have an interest in the proposed action or the draft EIS;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Federal, State and local government agencies expected to have  jurisdiction or responsibility over, or interest or expertise in, the  action. Copies shall be provided directly to appropriate State and local  agencies, and to the State intergovernmental review contacts established  under Executive Order 12372; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> States and Federal land management entities which may be  significantly affected by the proposed action or any of the  alternatives. These copies shall be accompanied by a request that such  State or entity advise the Administration in writing of any disagreement  with the evaluation of impacts in the statement. The Administration will  furnish the comments received to the applicant along with a written  assessment of any disagreements for incorporation into the final EIS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em>. Whenever a public hearing is held, the draft EIS shall  be available at the public hearing and for a minimum of 15 days in  advance of the public hearing. The availability of the draft EIS shall  be mentioned, and public comments requested, in any public hearing  notice and at any public hearing presentation. If a public hearing on an  action proposed for FHWA funding is not held, a notice shall be placed  in a newspaper similar to a public hearing notice advising where the  draft EIS is available for review, how copies may be obtained, and where  the comments should be sent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Federal Register public availability notice (40 CFR 1506.10)  shall establish a period of not fewer than 45 days nor more than 60 days  for the return of comments on the draft EIS unless a different period is  established in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 139(g)(2)(A). The notice and  the draft EIS transmittal letter shall identify where comments are to be  sent.
