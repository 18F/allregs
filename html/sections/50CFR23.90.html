                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. Article XVI of the Treaty sets out the procedures for  amending Appendix III.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General procedure. A Party may unilaterally, at any time, submit  a request to list a species in Appendix III to the CITES Secretariat.  The listing will become effective 90 days after the Secretariat notifies  the Parties of the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Criteria for listing. For a Party to list a species in Appendix  III, all of the following criteria must be met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The species must be native to the country listing the species.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The species must be protected under that country's laws or  regulations to prevent or restrict exploitation and control trade, and  the laws or regulations are being implemented.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The species is in international trade, and there are indications  that the cooperation of other Parties would help to control illegal  trade.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The listing Party must inform the Management Authorities of  other range countries, the known major importing countries, the  Secretariat, and the Animals Committee or the Plants Committee that it  is considering the listing and seek their opinions on the potential  effects of the listing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Annotation. The listing Party may annotate the Appendix-III  listing to include only specific parts, products, derivatives, or life  stages, as long as the Secretariat is notified of the annotation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> U.S. procedure. The procedure to list a species native to the  United States in Appendix III is as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> We will consult with and solicit comments from all States and  Tribes where the species occurs and all other range countries.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> We will publish a proposed rule in the Federal Register to  solicit comments from the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If after evaluating the comments received and available  information we determine the species should be listed in Appendix III,  we will publish a final rule in the Federal Register and notify the  Secretariat of the listing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Removing a species from Appendix III. We will monitor the  international trade in Appendix-III species listed by us and  periodically evaluate whether each species continues to meet the listing  criteria in paragraph (c) of this section. We will remove a species from  Appendix III provided all of the following criteria are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> International trade in the species is very limited. As a general  guide, we will consider removal when exports involve fewer than 5  shipments per year or fewer than 100 individual animals or plants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Legal and illegal trade in the species, including international  trade or interstate commerce, is determined not to be a concern.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Transferring a species from Appendix III to Appendix I or II.  If, after monitoring the trade and evaluating the status of an Appendix- III species we listed, we determine that the species meets the criteria  in Sec.  23.89(b) through (d) of this section for listing in Appendix I  or II, we will consider whether to submit a proposal to amend the  listing at the next CoP.</p>
