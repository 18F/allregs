                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> HQS inspection by PHA. The PHA may not commence monthly  homeownership assistance payments or provide a downpayment assistance  grant for the family until the PHA has inspected the unit and has  determined that the unit passes HQS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Independent inspection. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The unit must also be inspected by  an independent professional inspector selected by and paid by the  family.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The independent inspection must cover major building systems and  components, including foundation and structure, housing interior and  exterior, and the roofing, plumbing, electrical, and heating systems.  The independent inspector must be qualified to report on property  conditions, including major building systems and components.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The PHA may not require the family to use an independent  inspector selected by the PHA. The independent inspector may not be a  PHA employee or contractor, or other person under control of the PHA.  However, the PHA may establish standards for qualification of inspectors  selected by families under the homeownership option.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The independent inspector must provide a copy of the inspection  report both to the family and to the PHA. The PHA may not commence  monthly homeownership assistance payments, or provide a downpayment  assistance grant for the family, until the PHA has reviewed the  inspection report of the independent inspector. Even if the unit  otherwise complies with the HQS (and   may qualify for assistance under the PHA's tenant-based rental voucher  program), the PHA shall have discretion to disapprove the unit for  assistance under the homeownership option because of information in the  inspection report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contract of sale. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Before commencement of monthly  homeownership assistance payments or receipt of a downpayment assistance  grant, a member or members of the family must enter into a contract of  sale with the seller of the unit to be acquired by the family. The  family must give the PHA a copy of the contract of sale (see also Sec.  982.627(a)(7)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The contract of sale must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Specify the price and other terms of sale by the seller to the  purchaser.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provide that the purchaser will arrange for a pre-purchase  inspection of the dwelling unit by an independent inspector selected by  the purchaser.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provide that the purchaser is not obligated to purchase the  unit unless the inspection is satisfactory to the purchaser.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Provide that the purchaser is not obligated to pay for any  necessary repairs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In addition to the requirements contained in paragraph (c)(2) of  this section, a contract for the sale of units not yet under  construction at the time the family is to enter into the contract for  sale must also provide that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The purchaser is not obligated to purchase the unit unless an  environmental review has been performed and the site has received  environmental approval prior to commencement of construction in  accordance with 24 CFR 982.628.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The construction will not commence until the environmental  review has been completed and the seller has received written notice  from the PHA that environmental approval has been obtained. Conduct of  the environmental review may not necessarily result in environmental  approval, and environmental approval may be conditioned on the  contracting parties' agreement to modifications to the unit design or to  mitigation actions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Commencement of construction in violation of paragraph  (c)(3)(ii) of this section voids the purchase contract and renders  homeownership assistance under 24 CFR part 982 unavailable for purchase  of the unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> PHA disapproval of seller. In its administrative discretion, the  PHA may deny approval of a seller for any reason provided for  disapproval of an owner in Sec. 982.306(c).
