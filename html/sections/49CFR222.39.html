Such proposed quiet zone may  include only ASMs, or a combination of ASMs and SSMs at various  crossings within the quiet zone. Note that an engineering improvement  which does not fully comply with the requirements for an SSM under  appendix A of this part, is considered to be an ASM. The public  authority's application must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Contain an accurate, complete and current Grade Crossing  Inventory Form for each public, private and pedestrian grade crossing  within the proposed quiet zone;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Contain sufficient detail concerning the present safety  measures at each public, private and pedestrian grade crossing proposed  to be included in the quiet zone to enable the Associate Administrator  to evaluate their effectiveness;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Contain detailed information about diagnostic team reviews of  any crossing within the proposed quiet zone, including a membership list  and a list of recommendations made by the diagnostic team;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Contain a statement describing efforts taken by the public  authority to address comments submitted by each railroad operating the  public highway-rail grade crossings within the quiet zone, the State  agency responsible for highway and road safety, and the State agency  responsible for grade crossing safety in response to the Notice of  Intent. This statement shall also list any objections to the proposed  quiet zone that were raised by the railroad(s) and State agencies;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Contain detailed information as to which safety improvements are  proposed to be implemented at each public, private, or pedestrian grade  crossing within the proposed quiet zone;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Contain a commitment to implement the proposed safety  improvements within the proposed quiet zone; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Demonstrate through data and analysis that the proposed  implementation of these measures will reduce the Quiet Zone Risk Index  to a level at, or below, either the Risk Index With Horns or the  Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the proposed quiet zone contains newly established public or  private highway-rail grade crossings, the public authority's application  for approval must also include five-year projected vehicle and rail  traffic counts for each newly established grade crossing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> 60-day comment period. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The public authority application for  FRA approval of the proposed quiet zone shall be provided, by certified  mail, return receipt requested, to: all railroads operating over the  public highway-rail grade crossings within the quiet zone; the highway  or traffic control or law enforcement authority having jurisdiction over  vehicular traffic at grade crossings within the quiet zone; the  landowner having control over any private highway-rail grade crossings  within the quiet zone; the State agency responsible for highway and road  safety; the State agency responsible for grade crossing safety; and the  Associate Administrator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section,  any party that receives a copy of the public authority application may  submit comments on the public authority application to the Associate  Administrator during the 60-day period after the date on which the  public authority application was mailed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the public authority application for FRA approval contains  written statements from each railroad operating over the public highway- rail grade crossings within the quiet zone, the highway or traffic  control authority or law enforcement authority having jurisdiction over  vehicular traffic at grade crossings within the quiet zone, the State  agency responsible for grade crossing safety, and the State agency  responsible for highway and road safety stating that the railroad,   vehicular traffic authority and State agencies have waived their rights  to provide comments on the public authority application, the 60-day  comment period under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section shall be  waived.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> After reviewing any comments submitted under paragraph  (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the Associate Administrator will approve the  quiet zone if, in the Associate Administrator's judgment, the public  authority is in compliance with paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this  section and has satisfactorily demonstrated that the SSMs and ASMs  proposed by the public authority result in a Quiet Zone Risk Index that  is either:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> At or below the Risk Index With Horns or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> At or below the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Associate Administrator may include in any decision of  approval such conditions as may be necessary to ensure that the proposed  safety improvements are effective. If the Associate Administrator does  not approve the quiet zone, the Associate Administrator will describe,  in the decision, the basis upon which the decision was made. Decisions  issued by the Associate Administrator on quiet zone applications shall  be provided to all parties listed in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section  and may be reviewed as provided in Secs. 222.57(b) and (d) of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Appendix C of this part contains guidance on how to create a  quiet zone.</p>
