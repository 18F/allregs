Before we send the order, or as part of the order, we may require that  you submit information about your device that will allow us better to  define the scope of a surveillance order. We will specify the device(s)  subject to the surveillance order and the reason that we are requiring  postmarket surveillance of the device under section 522 of the act. We  will also provide you with any general or specific guidance that is  available to help you develop your plan for conducting postmarket  surveillance.</p>
