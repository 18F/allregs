                                Sec. 1610.3-1  Coordination of planning efforts.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In addition to the public involvement prescribed by Sec. 1610.2, the following coordination is to be accomplished with other Federal agencies, state and local governments, and federally recognized Indian tribes. The objectives of the coordination are for the State Directors and Field Managers to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Keep apprised of non-Bureau of Land Management plans;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assure that BLM considers those plans that are germane in the development of resource management plans for public lands;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Assist in resolving, to the extent practicable, inconsistencies between Federal and non-Federal government plans;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Provide for meaningful public involvement of other Federal agencies, State and local government officials, both elected and appointed, and federally recognized Indian tribes, in the development of resource management plans, including early public notice of final decisions that may have a significant impact on non-Federal lands; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Where possible and appropriate, develop resource management plans collaboratively with cooperating agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When developing or revising resource management plans, BLM State Directors and Field Managers will invite eligible Federal agencies, state and local governments, and federally recognized Indian tribes to participate as cooperating agencies. The same requirement applies when BLM amends resource management plans through an environmental impact statement. State Directors and Field Managers will consider any requests of other Federal agencies, state and local governments, and federally recognized Indian tribes for cooperating agency status. Field Managers who deny such requests will inform the State Director of the denial. The State Director will determine if the denial is appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> State Directors and Field Managers shall provide other Federal agencies, State and local governments, and Indian tribes opportunity for review, advice, and suggestion on issues and topics which may affect or influence other agency or other government programs. To facilitate coordination with State governments, State Directors should seek the policy advice of the Governor(s) on the timing, scope and coordination of plan components; definition of planning areas; scheduling of public involvement activities; and the multiple use opportunities and constraints on public lands. State Directors may seek written agreements with Governors or their designated representatives on processes and procedural topics such as exchanging information, providing advice and participation, and timeframes for receiving State government participation and review in a timely fashion. If an agreement is not reached, the State Director shall provide opportunity for Governor and State agency review, advice and suggestions on issues and topics that the State Director has reason to believe could affect or influence State government programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In developing guidance to Field Manager, in compliance with section

1611 of this title, the State Director shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ensure that it is as consistent as possible with existing officially adopted and approved resource related plans, policies or programs of other Federal agencies, State agencies, Indian tribes and local governments that may be affected, as prescribed by Sec. 1610.3-2 of this title;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identify areas where the proposed guidance is inconsistent with such policies, plans or programs and provide reasons why the inconsistencies exist and cannot be remedied; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notify the other Federal agencies, State agencies, Indian tribes or local governments with whom consistency is not achieved and indicate any appropriate methods, procedures, actions and/or programs which the State Director believes may lead to resolution of such inconsistencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A notice of intent to prepare, amend, or revise a resource management plan shall be submitted, consistent with State procedures for coordination of Federal activities, for circulation among State agencies. This notice shall also be submitted to Federal agencies, the heads of county boards, other local government units and Tribal Chairmen or Alaska Native Leaders that have requested such notices or that the responsible line manager has reason to believe would be concerned with the plan or amendment. These notices shall be issued simultaneously with the public notices required under Sec. 1610.2(b) of this title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Federal agencies, State and local governments and Indian tribes shall have the time period prescribed under Sec. 1610.2 of this title for review and comment on resource management plan proposals. Should they notify the Field Manager, in writing, of what they believe to be specific inconsistencies between the Bureau of Land Management resource management plan and their officially approved and adopted resources related plans, the resource management plan documentation shall show how those inconsistencies were addressed and, if possible, resolved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> When an advisory council has been formed under section 309 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 for the area addressed in a resource management plan or plan amendment, BLM will inform that council, seek its views, and consider them throughout the planning process.
