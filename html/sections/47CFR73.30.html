                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any party interested in operating an AM broadcast station on one  of the ten channels in the 1605-1705 kHz band   must file a petition for the establishment of an allotment to its  community of license. Each petition must include the following  information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Name of community for which allotment is sought;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Frequency and call letters of the petitioner's existing AM  operation; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Statement as to whether or not AM stereo operation is proposed  for the operation in the 1605-1705 kHz band.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Petitions are to be filed during a filing period to be  determined by the Commission. For each filing period, eligible stations  will be allotted channels based on the following steps:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Stations are ranked in descending order according to the  calculated improvement factor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The station with the highest improvement factor is initially  allotted the lowest available channel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Successively, each station with the next lowest improvement  factor, is allotted an available channel taking into account the  possible frequency and location combinations and relationship to  previously selected allotments. If a channel is not available for the  subject station, previous allotments are examined with respect to an  alternate channel, the use of which would make a channel available for  the subject station.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When it has been determined that, in accordance with the above  steps, no channel is available for the subject station, that station is  no longer considered and the process continues to the station with the  next lowest improvement factor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If awarded an allotment, a petitioner will have sixty (60) days  from the date of public notice of selection to file an application for  construction permit on FCC Form 301. (See Sec. Sec.  73.24 and 73.37(e)  for filing requirements). Unless instructed by the Commission to do  otherwise, the application shall specify Model I facilities. (See Sec.   73.14). Upon grant of the application and subsequent construction of the  authorized facility, the applicant must file a license application on  FCC Form 302.</p><p class="depth2">Note 1: Until further notice by the Commission, the filing of these  petitions is limited to licensees of existing AM stations (excluding  Class C stations) operating in the 535-1605 kHz band. First priority  will be assigned to Class D stations located within the primary service  contours of U.S. Class A stations that are licensed to serve communities  of 100,000 or more for which there exists no local fulltime aural  service.</p><p class="depth2">Note 2: Selection among competing petitions will be based on  interference reduction. Notwithstanding the exception contained in Note  5 of this section, within each operational category, the station  demonstrating the highest value of improvement factor will be afforded  the highest priority for an allotment, with the next priority assigned  to the station with next lowest value, and so on, until available  allotments are filled.</p><p class="depth2">Note 3: The Commission will periodically evaluate the progress of  the movement of stations from the 535-1605 kHz band to the 1605-1705 kHz  band to determine whether the 1605-1705 kHz band should continue to be  administered on an allotment basis or modified to an assignment method.  If appropriate, the Commission will later develop further procedures for  use of the 1605-1705 kHz band by existing station licensees and others.</p><p class="depth2">Note 4: Other than the exception specified in note 1 of this  section, existing fulltime stations are considered first for selection  as described in note 2 of this section. In the event that an allotment  availability exists for which no fulltime station has filed a relevant  petition, such allotment may be awarded to a licensed Class D station.  If more than one Class D station applies for this migration opportunity,  the following priorities will be used in the selection process: First  priority--a Class D station located within the 0.5 mV/m-50% contour of a  U.S. Class A station and licensed to serve a community of 100,000 or  more, for which there exists no local fulltime aural service; Second  priority--Class D stations ranked in order of improvement factor, from  highest to lowest, considering only those stations with improvement  factors greater than zero.</p><p class="depth2">Note 5: The preference for AM stereo in the expanded band will be  administered as follows: when an allotment under consideration  (candidate allotment) conflicts with one or more previously selected  allotments (established allotments) and cannot be accommodated in the  expanded band, the candidate allotment will be substituted for the  previously established allotment provided that: the petitioner for the  candidate allotment has made a written commitment to the use of AM  stereo and the petitioner for the established allotment has not; the  difference between the ranking factors associated with the candidate and  established allotments does not exceed 10% of the ranking factor of the  candidate allotment; the substitution will not require the displacement  of more than one established allotment; and both the   candidate allotment and the established allotment are within the same  priority group.
