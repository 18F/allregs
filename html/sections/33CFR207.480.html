                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All boats, barges, and vessels entering the harbor will be  required to take such positions as may be assigned them by the officer  in charge, who will direct their movements, either from the breakwater  or from the Government tug on the harbor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the absence of any directions as to position, boats, barges,  and vessels entering the harbor will observe the following rule: The  first steam vessel, or the first steam vessel with consort in tow, on  entering the harbor for shelter, will proceed to the upper end of the  breakwater. All steam vessels, and all steam vessels with consorts in  tow, entering later, will place themselves in a compact position close  to those preceding them. Sailing craft will so locate themselves that  they will not lie in the way of other vessels entering the harbor. All  vessels of every description will in no way place themselves so as to  interfere with the work of reconstruction of piers, or repairs, that may  be in progress at the time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The use of chains in making fast to the breakwater will not be  permitted. Lines must be attached to the snubbing posts only, and  outboard anchors taken in.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Steam craft with barges or vessels in tow will, if practicable,  at once place them compactly alongside the breakwater, either taking in  the towlines entirely or passing them on the breakwater so as not to  interfere in any way with the landing or departure of boats or vessels  between them. If impracticable to place them alongside the breakwater,  they will each drop anchor and at once take in all towlines extending  from one to the other.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Passenger boats will, in general, have the preference as to  location and attention by the officer in charge. Rafts will give way to  all documented craft.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> All classes of boats, barges, vessels, or other floating  property making fast to the breakwater must at once   place such fenders between themselves and the breakwater as may be  thought necessary by the officer in charge to prevent chafing or other  damage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The unloading of wood, coal, ballast, stone, or freight of any  class upon the breakwater is expressly prohibited, except in certain  cases allowed by special permission from the officer in charge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Each and every piece of floating property made fast to the  breakwater, or anchored in the harbor, must keep outboard from sunset to  sunrise a conspicuous white light, and must have upon it and in  immediate charge of it a watchman during the entire time such floating  property is in the harbor. All colored lights must be at once taken in,  or covered, on dropping anchor or making fast to the breakwater.  [Regs., Apr. 3, 1906]</p>
