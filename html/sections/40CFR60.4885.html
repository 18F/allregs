                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">To demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limits and  standards specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, use the procedures  specified in paragraph (a) of this section for particulate matter,  hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans (total mass basis or toxic equivalency  basis), mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium, lead, and  fugitive emissions from ash handling, and follow the procedures  specified in paragraph (b) of this section for carbon monoxide. In lieu  of using the procedures specified in paragraph (a) of this section, you  also have the option to demonstrate continuous compliance using the  procedures specified in paragraph (b) of this section for particulate  matter, hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans (total mass basis or toxic  equivalency basis), mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium,  and lead. You must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of  this section, as applicable, and paragraphs (c) through (e) of this  section, according to the performance testing, monitoring, and  calibration requirements in Sec. 60.4900(a) and (b). You may also  petition the Administrator for alternative monitoring parameters as  specified in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may conduct a repeat performance test at any time to  establish new values for the operating limits to apply from that point  forward. The Administrator may request a repeat performance test at any  time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must repeat the performance test within 60 days of a process  change, as defined in Sec. 60.4930.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> through (iii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You can conduct performance tests less often if your performance  tests for the pollutant for at least 2   consecutive years show that your emissions are at or below 75 percent of  the emission limit specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart, and there  are no changes in the operation of the affected source or air pollution  control equipment that could increase emissions. In this case, you do  not have to conduct a performance test for that pollutant for the next 2  years. You must conduct a performance test during the third year and no  more than 37 months after the previous performance test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If your SSI unit continues to meet the emission limit for the  pollutant, you may choose to conduct performance tests for the pollutant  every third year if your emissions are at or below 75 percent of the  emission limit, and if there are no changes in the operation of the  affected source or air pollution control equipment that could increase  emissions, but each such performance test must be conducted no more than  37 months after the previous performance test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If a performance test shows emissions exceeded 75 percent of  the emission limit for a pollutant, you must conduct annual performance  tests for that pollutant until all performance tests over 2 consecutive  years show compliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(6)</em> and use the  following procedures:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To demonstrate continuous compliance with the carbon monoxide  emission limit, you must use the carbon monoxide continuous emissions  monitoring system specified in Sec. 60.4900(b). For determining  compliance with the carbon monoxide concentration limit using carbon  monoxide CEMS, the correction to 7 percent oxygen does not apply during  periods of startup or shutdown. Use the measured carbon monoxide  concentration without correcting for oxygen concentration in averaging  with other carbon monoxide concentrations (corrected to 7 percent  oxygen) to determine the 24-hour average value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limits  for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans (total mass  basis or toxic equivalency basis), mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur  dioxide, cadmium, and lead, you may substitute the use of a continuous  monitoring system in lieu of conducting the annual performance test  required in paragraph (a) of this section, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You may substitute the use of a continuous emissions monitoring  system for any pollutant specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section  in lieu of conducting the annual performance test for that pollutant in  paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You may substitute the use of a continuous automated sampling  system for mercury or dioxins/furans in lieu of conducting the annual  mercury or dioxin/furan performance test in paragraph (a) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If you use a continuous emissions monitoring system to  demonstrate compliance with an applicable emission limit in either  paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, you must use the continuous  emissions monitoring system and follow the requirements specified in  Sec. 60.4900(b). You must measure emissions according to Sec. 60.13 to  calculate 1-hour arithmetic averages, corrected to 7 percent oxygen (or  carbon dioxide). You must demonstrate initial compliance using a 24-hour  block average of these 1-hour arithmetic average emission  concentrations, calculated using Equation 19-19 in section 12.4.1 of  Method 19 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If you use a continuous automated sampling system to demonstrate  compliance with an applicable emission limit in paragraph (b)(2) of this  section, you must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Use the continuous automated sampling system specified in Sec.  60.58b(p) and (q), and measure and calculate average emissions corrected  to 7 percent oxygen (or carbon dioxide) according to Sec. 60.58b(p) and  your monitoring plan.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Use the procedures specified in Sec. 60.58b(p) to calculate 24- hour averages to determine compliance with the mercury emission limit in  Table 1 or 2 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Use the procedures specified in Sec. 60.58b(p) to calculate 2- week averages to determine compliance with the dioxin/furan emission  limit (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis) in Table 1 or 2 to  this subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Update your monitoring plan as specified in Sec. 60.4880(e).  For mercury continuous automated sampling systems, you must use  Performance Specification 12B of appendix B of part 75 and Procedure 5  of appendix F of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, you must  complete your periodic performance evaluations required under your  monitoring plan for any continuous emissions monitoring system and  continuous automated sampling systems, according to the schedule  specified in your monitoring plan. If you were previously determining  compliance by conducting an annual performance test (or according to the  less frequent testing for a pollutant as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of  this section), you must complete the initial performance evaluation  required in your monitoring plan in Sec. 60.4880 for the continuous  monitoring system prior to using the continuous emissions monitoring  system to demonstrate compliance or continuous automated sampling  system. Your performance evaluation must be conducted using the  procedures and acceptance criteria specified in Sec. 60.4880(a)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To demonstrate compliance with the dioxins/furans toxic  equivalency emission limit in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, you  must determine dioxins/furans toxic equivalency as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Measure the concentration of each dioxin/furan tetra- through  octa-chlorinated isomer emitted using EPA Method 23.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each dioxin/furan (tetra- through octa-chlorinated) isomer  measured in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, multiply  the isomer concentration by its corresponding toxic equivalency factor  specified in Table 4 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sum the products calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)  of this section to obtain the total concentration of dioxins/furans  emitted in terms of toxic equivalency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>. You must submit the deviation report specified in Sec.  60.4915(e) for each instance that you did not meet each emission limit  in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> apply. If a force majeure is about to occur,  occurs, or has occurred for which you intend to assert a claim of force  majeure, you must notify the Administrator in writing as specified in  Sec. 60.4915(g). You must conduct the performance test as soon as  practicable after the force majeure occurs. The Administrator will  determine whether or not to grant the extension to the performance test  deadline, and will notify you in writing of approval or disapproval of  the request for an extension as soon as practicable. Until an extension  of the performance test deadline has been approved by the Administrator,  you remain strictly subject to the requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> After any initial requests in Sec. 60.4880 for alternative  monitoring requirements for initial compliance, you may subsequently  petition the Administrator for alternative monitoring parameters as  specified in Sec. Sec. 60.13(i) and 60.4880(e).</p>
