                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Description. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provolone, a pasta filata or stretched curd- type cheese, is the food prepared by the procedure set forth in  paragraph (a)(3) of this section, or by any other method which produces  a finished cheese having the same physical and chemical properties. It  has a stringy texture. The minimum milkfat content is 45 percent by  weight of the solids, as determined by the methods described in  Sec. 133.5 and the maximum moisture content is 45 percent by weight. If  the dairy ingredients used are not pasteurized, the cheese is cured at a  temperature of not less than 35 F for at least 60 days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If pasteurized dairy ingredients are used, the phenol equivalent  value of 0.25 gram of provolone cheese is not more than 3 micrograms as  determined by the method described in Sec. 133.5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this section may be added  during the procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Optional ingredients. The following safe and suitable  ingredients may be used:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Dairy ingredients. Milk, nonfat milk, or cream, as defined in  Sec. 133.3, used alone or in combination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Clotting enzymes. Rennet and/or other clotting enzymes of  animal, plant, or microbial origin.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other optional ingredients. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Blue or green color in an amount  to neutralize the natural yellow color of the curd.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Calcium chloride in an amount not more than 0.02 percent  (calculated as anhydrous calcium chloride) by weight of the dairy  ingredients, used as a coagulation aid.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Enzymes of animal, plant, or microbial origin, used in curing  or flavor development.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Safe and suitable antimycotic agent(s), the cumulative levels  of which shall not exceed current good manufacturing practice, may be  added to the cheese during the kneading and stretching process and/or  applied to the surface of the cheese.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Benzoyl peroxide or a mixture of benzoyl peroxide with potassium  alum, calcium sulfate, and magnesium carbonate used to bleach the dairy  ingredients. The weight of the benzoyl peroxide is not more than 0.002  percent of the weight of the milk being bleached, and the weight of the  potassium alum, calcium sulfate, and magnesium carbonate, singly or  combined, is not more than six times the weight of the benzoyl peroxide  used. If milk is bleached in this manner, vitamin A is added to the curd  in such quantity as to compensate for the vitamin A or its precursors  destroyed in the bleaching process, and artificial coloring is not used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Nomenclature. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name of the food is ``provolone cheese''.  The name of the food may include the common name of the shape of the  cheese, such as ``salami provolone''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> One of the following terms, in letters not less than one-half  the height of the letters used in the name of the food, shall accompany  the name of the food wherever it appears on the principal display panel  or panels:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> ``Smoked'' if the food has been smoked.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> ``Not smoked'' if the food has not been smoked.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Label declaration. Each of the ingredients used in the food  shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of  parts 101 and 130 of this chapter, except that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Enzymes of animal, plant, or microbial origin may be declared as  ``enzymes''; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The dairy ingredients may be declared, in descending order of  predominance, by the use of the terms ``milkfat and nonfat milk'' or  ``nonfat milk and milkfat'', as appropriate.
