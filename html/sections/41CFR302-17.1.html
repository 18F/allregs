                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The following definitions apply to this part:</p><p class="depth0">Allowance means:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Money paid to the employee to cover future expenses, such as the  miscellaneous expense allowance (see part 302-16 of this chapter for  information about the miscellaneous expense allowance);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Money paid to the employee to cover past expenses, such as the  relocation income tax allowance (RITA) under the two-year tax process  described in Part 302-17, Subpart G; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> A limit established by statute or regulation, such as the 18,000  pound net weight allowance for household goods shipments (see Part 302-7  of this chapter for information about the 18,000 pound net weight  allowance).</p><p class="depth0">City means any unit of general local government as defined in 31 CFR  215.2(b).</p><p class="depth0">Combined marginal tax rate (CMTR) means a single rate determined by  combining the applicable marginal tax rates for Federal, state, and  local income taxes, using the formula provided in Sec.  302-17.40. (If  you incur liability for income tax in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,  see Sec.  302-17.44.)</p><p class="depth0">County means any unit of local general government as defined in 31  CFR 215.2(e).</p><p class="depth0">Gross-up used as a noun in this part means:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The process that your agency uses to estimate the additional  income tax liability that you incur as a result of relocation benefits  and taxes on those benefits; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> The result of the gross-up process.</p><p class="depth2">Note: The gross-up allows for the fact that every reimbursement of  taxes is itself taxable. Therefore, the gross-up calculates the amount  an agency must reimburse an employee to cover substantially all of the  income taxes incurred as the result of a relocation.</p><p class="depth2">Internal Revenue Code (IRC) means Title 26 of the United States  Code, which governs Federal income taxes.</p><p class="depth2">Local income tax means a tax imposed by a recognized city or county  tax authority that is deductible for Federal income tax purposes as a  local income   tax under the IRC, at 26 U.S.C. 164(a)(3). (See the definitions for the  terms city and county in this section.)</p><p class="depth2">Marginal tax rate (MTR) means the tax rate that applies to the last  increment of taxable income after taxable relocation benefits have been  added to the employee's income. For example, suppose a married employee  who files jointly has a taxable income of $120,000. According to the IRS  2011 Tax Rate Schedules, taxable income between $69,000 and $139,350 is  taxed at the 25 percent tax rate; therefore, the $120,000 taxable income  of the employee and spouse is in this range, so they have a 25 percent  MTR. If the employee receives $30,000 of taxable relocation benefits,  the taxable income for the employee and spouse is now $150,000, which is  in the next highest tax bracket. In this example, the employee and  spouse now have a Federal MTR of 28 percent once the taxable relocation  benefits have been added to their income.</p><p class="depth2">Reimbursement means money paid to you to cover expenses that you  have already paid for out of your own funds.</p><p class="depth2">Relocation benefits means all reimbursements and allowances that you  receive, plus all direct payments that your agency makes on your behalf,  in connection with your relocation.</p><p class="depth2">Relocation income tax allowance (RITA) means the payment to the  employee to cover the difference between the withholding tax allowance  (WTA), if any, and the actual tax liability incurred by the employee as  a result of their taxable relocation benefits; RITA is paid whenever the  actual tax liability exceeds the WTA.</p><p class="depth2">State means any one of the several states of the United States, the  District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth  of the Northern Mariana Islands, or any other territory or possession of  the United States.</p><p class="depth2">State income tax means a tax imposed by a state tax authority that  is deductible for Federal income tax purposes under the IRC,  specifically 26 U.S.C. 164(a)(3).</p><p class="depth2">Withholding tax allowance (WTA) means the amount paid to the Federal  IRS by the agency as withholding of income taxes for any taxable  relocation allowance, reimbursement, or direct payment to a vendor.</p>
