                                Sec. 575.302  Vehicle labeling of safety rating information on or after January 31, 2012).
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose and scope. The purpose of this section is to aid  potential purchasers in the selection of new passenger motor vehicles by  providing them with safety rating information developed by NHTSA in its  New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) testing. Manufacturers of passenger  motor vehicles described in paragraph (b) of this section are required  to include this information on the Monroney label. Although NHTSA also  makes the information available through means such as postings at http:/ /www.safercar.gov and http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov, the additional Monroney  label information is intended to provide consumers with relevant  information at the point of sale.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application. This section applies to automobiles with a GVWR of  10,000 pounds or less, manufactured on or after January 31, 2012 that  have vehicle identification numbers that identify the vehicles to be  model year 2012 or later and that are required by the Automobile  Information Disclosure Act, 15 U.S.C. 1231-1233, to have price sticker  labels (Monroney labels), (e.g., passenger vehicles, station wagons,  passenger vans, and sport utility vehicles). Model Year 2012 or later  vehicles manufactured prior to January 31, 2012, at the manufacturer's  option, may be labeled according to the provisions of this Sec. 575.302  provided the ratings placed on the safety rating label are derived from  vehicle testing conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration under the enhanced NCAP testing and rating program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Definitions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Monroney label means the label placed on new automobiles with  the manufacturer's suggested retail price and other consumer  information, as specified at 15 U.S.C. 1231-1233.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Safety rating label means the label with NCAP safety rating  information, as specified at 15 U.S.C. 1232(g). The safety rating label  is part of the Monroney label.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Required label.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as specified in paragraph (f) of this section, each  vehicle must have a safety rating label that is part   of its Monroney label, meets the requirements specified in paragraph (e)  of this section, and conforms in content, format and sequence to the  sample label depicted in Figure 1 of this section. If NHTSA has not  provided a safety rating for any category of vehicle performance for a  vehicle, the manufacturer may use the smaller label specified in  paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The label must depict the star ratings for that vehicle as  reported to the vehicle manufacturer by NHTSA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whenever NHTSA informs a manufacturer in writing of a new safety  rating for a specified vehicle or the continued applicability of an  existing safety rating for a new model year, including any safety  concerns, the manufacturer shall include the new or continued safety  rating on vehicles manufactured on or after the date 30 calendar days  after receipt by the manufacturer of the information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If, for a vehicle that has an existing safety rating for a  category, NHTSA informs the manufacturer in writing that it has approved  an optional NCAP test that will cover that category, the manufacturer  may depict vehicles manufactured on or after the date of receipt of the  information as ``Not Rated'' or ``To Be Rated'' for that category.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The text ``Overall Vehicle Score,'' ``Frontal Crash,'' ``Side  Crash,'' ``Rollover,'' ``Driver,'' ``Passenger,'' ``Front Seat,'' ``Rear  Seat'' and where applicable, ``Not Rated'' or ``To Be Rated,'' the star  graphic indicating each rating, as well as any text in the header and  footer areas of the label, must have a minimum font size of 12 point.  All remaining text and symbols on the label (including the star graphic  specified in paragraph (e)(9)(i) of this section), must have a minimum  font size of 8 point.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Required information and format.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Safety rating label border. The safety rating label must be  surrounded by a solid dark line that is a minimum of 3 points in width.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Safety rating label size and legibility. The safety rating label  must be presented in a legible, visible, and prominent fashion that  covers at least 8 percent of the total area of the Monroney label (i.e.,  including the safety rating label) or an area with a minimum of 4\1/2\  inches in length and 3\1/2\ inches in height on the Monroney label,  whichever is larger.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Heading area. The words ``Government 5-Star Safety Ratings''  must be in boldface, capital letters that are light in color and  centered. The background must be dark.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Overall vehicle score area.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The overall vehicle score area must be placed immediately below  the heading area and must have dark text and a light background. The  overall vehicle score rating must be displayed with the maximum star  rating achieved.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The words ``Overall Vehicle Score'' must be in boldface aligned  to the left side of the label. The achieved star rating must be on the  same line and be aligned to the right side of the label and left  justified.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The words ``Based on the combined ratings of frontal, side and  rollover'' followed by the statement ``Should ONLY be compared to other  vehicles of similar size and weight'' (on the following line) must be  placed at the bottom of the overall vehicle score area and left  justified.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If NHTSA has not released the star rating for the ``Frontal  Crash,'' ``Side Crash,'' or ``Rollover'' area, the text ``Not Rated''  must be used in boldface. However, as an alternative, the words ``To Be  Rated'' (in boldface) may be used if the manufacturer has received  written notification from NHTSA that the vehicle has been chosen for the  NCAP frontal, side, and/or rollover testing such that there will be  ratings in all three areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Frontal crash area.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The frontal crash area must be placed immediately below the  overall vehicle score area, separated by a dark line that is a minimum  of three points in width. The text must be dark against a light  background. Both the driver and the right front seat passenger frontal  crash test ratings must be displayed with the maximum star ratings  achieved.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The words ``Frontal Crash'' must be in boldface, cover two  lines, and be aligned to the left side of the label.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The word ``Driver'' must be on the same line as the word  ``Frontal'' in ``Frontal Crash,'' and be horizontally centered, left  justified and vertically aligned to the top of the frontal crash area.  The achieved star rating for ``Driver'' must be on the same line and be  aligned to the right side of the label and left justified.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If NHTSA has not released the star rating for the ``Driver''  position, the text ``Not Rated'' must be used in boldface. However, as  an alternative, the words ``To Be Rated'' (in boldface) may be used if  the manufacturer has received written notification from NHTSA that the  vehicle has been chosen for NCAP testing. Both texts must be on the same  line as the text ``Driver'' and be aligned to the right side of the  label and left justified.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The word ``Passenger'' must be on the same line as the word  ``Crash'' in ``Frontal Crash,'' below the word ``Driver,'' and be  horizontally centered, left justified and vertically aligned to the top  of the frontal crash area. The achieved star rating for ``Passenger''  must be on the same line and be aligned to the right side of the label  and left justified.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> If NHTSA has not released the star rating for ``Passenger,''  the words ``Not Rated'' must be used in boldface. However, as an  alternative, the words ``To Be Rated'' (in boldface) may be used if the  manufacturer has received written notification from NHTSA that the  vehicle has been chosen for NCAP testing. Both texts must be on the same  line as the text ``Passenger'' and be aligned to the right side of the  label and left justified.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The words ``Based on the risk of injury in a frontal impact.''  followed (on the next line) by the statement ``Should ONLY be compared  to other vehicles of similar size and weight.'' must be placed at the  bottom of the frontal crash area and left justified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Side crash area.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The side crash area must be immediately below the frontal crash  area, separated by a dark line that is a minimum of three points in  width. The text must be dark against a light background. Both the driver  and the rear seat passenger side crash test rating must be displayed  with the maximum star rating achieved.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The words ``Side Crash'' must cover two lines, and be aligned  to the left side of the label in boldface.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The words ``Front seat'' must be on the same line as the word  ``Side'' in ``Side Crash'' and be horizontally centered, left justified  and vertically aligned to the top of the side crash area. The achieved  star rating for ``Front seat'' must be on the same line as the words  ``Front seat'' and be aligned to the right side of the label and left  justified.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If NHTSA has not released the star rating for ``Front Seat,''  the words ``Not Rated'' must be used in boldface. However, as an  alternative, the words ``To Be Rated'' (in boldface) may be used if the  manufacturer has received written notification from NHTSA that the  vehicle has been chosen for NCAP testing. Both texts must be on the same  line as the text ``Front seat'' and be aligned to the right side of the  label and left justified.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The words ``Rear seat'' must be on the same line as the word  ``Crash'' in ``Side Crash,'' below the word ``Front seat,'' and be  horizontally centered, left justified and vertically aligned to the top  of the side crash area. The achieved star rating for ``Rear seat'' must  be on the same line as the text ``Rear seat'' and be aligned to the  right side of the label and left justified.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> If NHTSA has not released the star rating for ``Rear Seat,''  the text ``Not Rated'' must be used in boldface.
