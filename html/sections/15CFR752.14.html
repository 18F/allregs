Generally, BIS will give reasonable notice to SCL holders and consignees in advance of a system review. The review will involve interviews with company officials, the inspection of records, and the review of ICPs. BIS may conduct special unannounced system reviews if BIS has reason to believe an SCL holder or consignee has improperly used or has failed to comply with the SCL.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Other reviews. BIS may require an SCL holder or consignee to submit to its office a list of all sales made under the SCL during a specified time-frame. Also, BIS may request from any consignee a list of transactions during a specified period involving direct shipments of items received under SCLs to customers of other consignees and sales to customers in reexport territories authorized by BIS on the consignee's validated Form BIS-752.</p>
