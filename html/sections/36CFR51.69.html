                                Sec. 51.69  What happens if there is a dispute between the new concessioner possessory interest?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">In case of a dispute between a new concessioner and a prior  concessioner as to the value of the prior concessioner's possessory  interest, the dispute will be resolved under the procedures contained in  the possessory interest concession contract. A new concessioner will not  agree on the value of a prior concessioner's possessory interest without  the prior written approval of the Director unless the value is  determined through the binding determination process required by the  possessory interest concession contract. The Director's written approval  is to ensure that the value is consistent with the terms and conditions  of the possessory interest concession contract. If a new concessioner  and a prior concessioner engage in a binding process to resolve a  dispute as to the value of the prior concessioner's possessory interest,  the new concessioner must allow the Director to assist the new  concessioner in the dispute process to the extent requested by the  Director. Nothing in this section may be construed as limiting the  rights of the prior concessioner to be paid for its possessory interest  or other property by a new concessioner in accordance with the terms of  its concession contract.</p>
