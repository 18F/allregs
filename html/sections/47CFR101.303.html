                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Any person receiving official notice of a violation of the terms of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, any other Federal statute or Executive Order pertaining to radio or wire communications or any international radio or wire communications treaty or convention, or regulations annexed thereto to which the United States is a party, or the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, must, within 10 days from such receipt, send a written answer to the office of the Commission originating the official notice. If an answer cannot be sent or an acknowledgment made within such 10-day period by reason of illness or other unavoidable circumstances, acknowledgment and answer must be made at the earliest practicable date with a satisfactory explanation of the delay. The answer to each notice must be complete in itself and may not be abbreviated by reference to other communications or answers to other notices. If the notice relates to some violation that may be due to the physical or electrical characteristics of transmitting apparatus, the answer must state fully what steps have been taken to prevent future violations, and, if any new apparatus is to be installed, the date such apparatus was ordered, the name of the manufacturer, and promised date of delivery. If the installation of such apparatus requires a construction permit, the file number of the application must be given or, if a file number has not been assigned by the Commission, such identification as will permit ready reference thereto. If the notice of violation relates to inadequate maintenance resulting in improper operation of the transmitter, the name and license number of the operator performing the maintenance must be given. If the notice of violation relates to some lack of attention to, or improper operation of, the transmitter by other employees, the reply

must enumerate the steps taken to prevent a recurrence of such lack of attention or improper operation.</p>
