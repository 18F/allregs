                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Operators of NGSO MSS feeder link earth stations and GSO FSS earth stations in the band 29.25 to 29.5 GHz where both services have a co-primary allocation shall cooperate fully in order to coordinate their systems. During the coordination process both service operators shall exchange the necessary technical parameters required for coordination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Licensed GSO FSS systems shall, to the maximum extent possible, operate with frequency/polarization selections, in the vicinity of operational or planned NGSO MSS feeder link earth station complexes, that will minimize instances of unacceptable interference to the GSO FSS space stations. Earth station licensees operating with GSO FSS systems shall be capable of providing earth station locations to support coordination of NGSO MSS feeder link stations under paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section. Operation of ubiquitously deployed GSO FSS earth stations in the 29.25-29.5 GHz frequency band shall conform to the rules contained in Sec. 25.138.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applicants for authority to use the 29.25-29.5 GHz band for NGSO MSS

feeder uplinks will have to demonstrate that their systems can share with GSO FSS and NGSO MSS systems that have been authorized for operation in that band.
