After two years from the date of each tribe's initial grant award, the maximum Federal share will be reduced to 90 percent, as long as the Regional Administrator determines that the tribe meets certain economic indicators that would provide an objective assessment of the tribe's ability to increase its share. The Regional Administrator may increase the maximum Federal share to 100 percent if the tribe can demonstrate in writing to the satisfaction of the Regional Administrator that fiscal circumstances within the tribe are constrained to such an extent that fulfilling the match would impose undue hardship.
