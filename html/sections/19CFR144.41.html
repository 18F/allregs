                                Sec. 144.41  Entry for rewarehouse.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. When merchandise which has been withdrawn from  warehouse for transportation to another port has arrived at the port of  destination, it may be entered for rewarehouse by the consignee named in  the withdrawal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form of entry. An entry for rewarehouse shall be made in  duplicate on Customs Form 7501 and shall contain all of the statistical  information as provided in Sec. 141.61(e) of this chapter. The port  director may require an extra copy or copies of Customs Form 7501,  annotated ``PERMIT,'' for use in connection with the delivery of the  merchandise to the warehouse. No declaration is required on the entry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Combining separate shipments. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Separate shipments consigned  to the same consignee and received under separate withdrawals for  transportation may be combined into one rewarehouse entry if the  warehouse withdrawals are from the same original warehouse entry.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Shipments covered by multiple warehouse entries, and shipped  from a single warehouse under separate withdrawals for transportation,  via a single conveyance, may be combined into one rewarehouse entry if  consigned to the same consignee and deposited into a single warehouse.  With the exception of alcohol and tobacco products, this procedure shall  not be allowed for merchandise which is in any way restricted (for  example, quota/visa). The combined rewarehouse entry shall have attached  either copies of each warehouse entry package which is being combined  into the single rewarehouse entry or a summary with pertinent  information, that is, the date of importation, commodity description,  size, HTSUS and entry numbers, for all entries withdrawn for  consolidation as one rewarehouse entry. Any combining of separate  withdrawals into one rewarehouse entry shall result in the rewarehouse  entry being assigned the import date of the oldest entry being combined  into the rewarehouse entry.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Combining of separate shipments shall be prohibited in all other  circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Bond. A bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions  set forth in Sec. 113.62 of this chapter shall be filed before a permit  is issued on Customs Form 7501 for sending the merchandise to the bonded  warehouse. However, no bond shall be required if the merchandise is  entered by the consignee named in the original bond filed at the  original port of entry, or if it is entered by a transferee who has  established his right to withdraw the merchandise and has filed a bond  in accordance with subpart C of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Value and classification. The duties determined at the port  where the original warehouse entry was filed shall be the duties  chargeable under the rewarehouse entry, except in the cases provided for  in Sec. Sec. 159.7 (a) and (b) of this chapter, which pertain to  certain classes of merchandise excluded from the liquidation of the  original warehouse entry and merchandise on which rates of duty or tax  are changed by an act of Congress or by a proclamation by the President.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Examination. Any examination necessary for identification of the  merchandise, determination of shortages, or other purposes shall be  made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Failure to enter. If the rewarehouse entry is not filed within  15 calendar days after its arrival, the merchandise shall be disposed of  in accordance with the applicable procedures in Sec. 4.37 or Sec.  122.50 or Sec. 123.10 of this chapter. However, merchandise sent to a  general order warehouse shall not be sold or otherwise disposed of as  unclaimed until the expiration of the original 5-year period during  which the merchandise may remain in warehouse under bond.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Protest. A protest may be filed at the port where the  rewarehouse entry is made against a liquidation made at that port under  Sec. 159.7 (a) or (b) of this chapter, or against a refusal of the  director of that port to liquidate pursuant to said sections. In all  other cases, any protest shall be filed against the original warehouse  entry.
