                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. In order to adopt a charter amendment, a subsidiary  holding company must comply with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Board of directors approval. The board of directors of the  subsidiary holding company must adopt a resolution proposing the charter  amendment that states the text of such amendment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Form of filing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Application requirement. If the proposed  charter amendment would render more difficult or discourage a merger,  tender offer, or proxy contest, the assumption of control by a holder of  a block of the subsidiary holding company's stock, the removal of  incumbent management, or involve a significant issue of law or policy,  the subsidiary holding company shall file the proposed amendment with  and shall obtain the prior approval of the Board pursuant to Sec.  238.14 of this chapter; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Notice requirement. If the proposed charter amendment does not  implicate paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section and such amendment is  permissible under   all applicable laws, rules or regulations, the subsidiary holding  company shall submit the proposed amendments to the appropriate Reserve  Bank, at least 30 days prior to the date the proposed charter amendment  is to be mailed for consideration by the subsidiary holding company's  shareholders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Approval. Any charter amendment filed pursuant to paragraph  (a)(2)(ii) of this section shall automatically be approved 30 days from  the date of filing of such amendment, provided that the subsidiary  holding company follows the requirements of its charter in adopting such  amendment, unless the Board notifies the mutual holding company prior to  the expiration of such 30-day period that such amendment is rejected or  is deemed to be filed under the provisions of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of  this section. In addition, the following charter amendments, including  the adoption of the charter as set forth in appendix B of this part,  shall be approved at the time of adoption, if adopted without change and  filed with the Board within 30 days after adoption, provided the  subsidiary holding company follows the requirements of its charter in  adopting such amendments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Title change. Prior to changing its corporate title, a  subsidiary holding company must file with the appropriate Reserve Bank a  written notice indicating the intended change. The Reserve Bank shall  provide to the subsidiary holding company a timely written  acknowledgment stating when the notice was received. If, within 30 days  of receipt of notice, the Reserve Bank or the Board does not notify the  subsidiary holding company of its objection on the grounds that the  title misrepresents the nature of the institution or the services it  offers, the subsidiary holding company may change its title by amending  section 1 of its charter in accordance with this section and the  amendment provisions of its charter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Home office. A subsidiary holding company may amend its charter  by substituting a new domicile in section 2 of its charter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Number of shares of stock and par value. A subsidiary holding  company may amend Section 5 of its charter to change the number of  authorized shares of stock, the number of shares within each class of  stock, and the par or stated value of such shares.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Capital stock. A subsidiary holding company may amend its  charter by revising Section 5 to read as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Section 5. Capital stock. The total number of shares of all classes  of capital stock that the subsidiary holding company has the authority  to issue is ------, of which ------ shall be common stock of par [or if  no par value is specified the stated] value of ------ per share and of  which [list the number of each class of preferred and the par or if no  par value is specified the stated value per share of each such class].  The shares may be issued from time to time as authorized by the board of  directors without further approval of shareholders, except as otherwise  provided in this Section 5 or to the extent that such approval is  required by governing law, rule, or regulation. The consideration for  the issuance of the shares shall be paid in full before their issuance  and shall not be less than the par [or stated] value. Neither promissory  notes nor future services shall constitute payment or part payment for  the issuance of shares of the subsidiary holding company. The  consideration for the shares shall be cash, tangible or intangible  property (to the extent direct investment in such property would be  permitted), labor, or services actually performed for the subsidiary  holding company, or any combination of the foregoing. In the absence of  actual fraud in the transaction, the value of such property, labor, or  services, as determined by the board of directors of the subsidiary  holding company, shall be conclusive. Upon payment of such  consideration, such shares shall be deemed to be fully paid and  nonassessable. In the case of a stock dividend, that part of the  retained earnings of the subsidiary holding company that is transferred  to common stock or paid-in capital accounts upon the issuance of shares  as a stock dividend shall be deemed to be the consideration for their  issuance.</p><p class="depth0">Except for shares issued in the initial organization of the  subsidiary holding company, no shares of capital stock (including shares  issuable upon conversion, exchange, or exercise of other securities)  shall be issued, directly or indirectly, to officers, directors, or  controlling persons of the association or subsidiary holding company  other than as part of a general public offering or as qualifying shares  to a director, unless their issuance or the plan under which they would  be issued has been approved by a majority of the total votes eligible to  be cast at a legal meeting.</p><p class="depth0">Nothing contained in this Section 5 (or in any supplementary  sections hereto) shall entitle the holders of any class of a series of  capital stock to vote as a separate class or   series or to more than one vote per share, except as to the cumulation  of votes for the election of directors, unless the charter otherwise  provides that there shall be no such cumulative voting: Provided, That  this restriction on voting separately by class or series shall not  apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To any provision which would authorize the holders of preferred  stock, voting as a class or series, to elect some members of the board  of directors, less than a majority thereof, in the event of default in  the payment of dividends on any class or series of preferred stock;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To any provision that would require the holders of preferred  stock, voting as a class or series, to approve the merger or  consolidation of the subsidiary holding company with another corporation  or the sale, lease, or conveyance (other than by mortgage or pledge) of  properties or business in exchange for securities of a corporation other  than the subsidiary holding company if the preferred stock is exchanged  for securities of such other corporation: Provided, That no provision  may require such approval for transactions undertaken with the  assistance or pursuant to the direction of the Board or the Federal  Deposit Insurance Corporation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> To any amendment which would adversely change the specific  terms of any class or series of capital stock as set forth in this  Section 5 (or in any supplementary sections hereto), including any  amendment which would create or enlarge any class or series ranking  prior thereto in rights and preferences. An amendment which increases  the number of authorized shares of any class or series of capital stock,  or substitutes the surviving subsidiary holding company in a merger or  consolidation for the subsidiary holding company, shall not be  considered to be such an adverse change.</p><p class="depth0">A description of the different classes and series (if any) of the  subsidiary holding company's capital stock and a statement of the  designations, and the relative rights, preferences, and limitations of  the shares of each class of and series (if any) of capital stock are as  follows:</p><p class="depth0">A. Common stock. Except as provided in this Section 5 (or in any  supplementary sections thereto) the holders of the common stock shall  exclusively possess all voting power. Each holder of shares of the  common stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share held by each  holder, except as to the cumulation of votes for the election of  directors, unless the charter otherwise provides that there shall be no  such cumulative voting.</p><p class="depth0">Whenever there shall have been paid, or declared and set aside for  payment, to the holders of the outstanding shares of any class of stock  having preference over the common stock as to the payment of dividends,  the full amount of dividends and of sinking fund, retirement fund, or  other retirement payments, if any, to which such holders are  respectively entitled in preference to the common stock, then dividends  may be paid on the common stock and on any class or series of stock  entitled to participate therewith as to dividends out of any assets  legally available for the payment of dividends.</p><p class="depth0">In the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the  subsidiary holding company, the holders of the common stock (and the  holders of any class or series of stock entitled to participate with the  common stock in the distribution of assets) shall be entitled to  receive, in cash or in kind, the assets of the subsidiary holding  company available for distribution remaining after: (i) Payment or  provision for payment of the subsidiary holding company's debts and  liabilities; (ii) distributions or provision for distributions in  settlement of its liquidation account; and (iii) distributions or  provision for distributions to holders of any class or series of stock  having preference over the common stock in the liquidation, dissolution,  or winding up of the subsidiary holding company. Each share of common  stock shall have the same relative rights as and be identical in all  respects with all the other shares of common stock.</p><p class="depth0">B. Preferred stock. The subsidiary holding company may provide in  supplementary sections to its charter for one or more classes of  preferred stock, which shall be separately identified. The shares of any  class may be divided into and issued in series, with each series  separately designated so as to distinguish the shares thereof from the  shares of all other series and classes. The terms of each series shall  be set forth in a supplementary section to the charter. All shares of  the same class shall be identical except as to the following relative  rights and preferences, as to which there may be variations between  different series:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The distinctive serial designation and the number of shares  constituting such series;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The dividend rate or the amount of dividends to be paid on the  shares of such series, whether dividends shall be cumulative and, if so,  from which date(s), the payment date(s) for dividends, and the  participating or other special rights, if any, with respect to  dividends;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The voting powers, full or limited, if any, of shares of such  series;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Whether the shares of such series shall be redeemable and, if  so, the price(s) at which, and the terms and conditions on which, such  shares may be redeemed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The amount(s) payable upon the shares of such series in the  event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding  up of the subsidiary holding company;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Whether the shares of such series shall be entitled to the  benefit of a sinking or retirement fund to be applied to the purchase or  redemption of such shares, and if so entitled, the amount of such fund  and the manner of its application, including the price(s) at which such  shares may be redeemed or purchased through the application of such  fund;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Whether the shares of such series shall be convertible into, or  exchangeable for, shares of any other class or classes of stock of the  subsidiary holding company and, if so, the conversion price(s) or the  rate(s) of exchange, and the adjustments thereof, if any, at which such  conversion or exchange may be made, and any other terms and conditions  of such conversion or exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> The price or other consideration for which the shares of such  series shall be issued; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Whether the shares of such series which are redeemed or  converted shall have the status of authorized but unissued shares of  serial preferred stock and whether such shares may be reissued as shares  of the same or any other series of serial preferred stock.</p><p class="depth0">Each share of each series of serial preferred stock shall have the  same relative rights as and be identical in all respects with all the  other shares of the same series.</p><p class="depth0">The board of directors shall have authority to divide, by the  adoption of supplementary charter sections, any authorized class of  preferred stock into series, and, within the limitations set forth in  this section and the remainder of this charter, fix and determine the  relative rights and preferences of the shares of any series so  established.</p><p class="depth0">Prior to the issuance of any preferred shares of a series  established by a supplementary charter section adopted by the board of  directors, the subsidiary holding company shall file with the  appropriate Reserve Bank a dated copy of that supplementary section of  this charter established and designating the series and fixing and  determining the relative rights and preferences thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Limitations on subsequent issuances. A subsidiary holding  company may amend its charter to require shareholder approval of the  issuance or reservation of common stock or securities convertible into  common stock under circumstances which would require shareholder  approval under the rules of the New York or American Stock Exchange if  the shares were then listed on the New York or American Stock Exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Cumulative voting. A subsidiary holding company may amend its  charter by substituting the following sentence for the second sentence  in the third paragraph of Section 5: ``Each holder of shares of common  stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share held by such holder  and there shall be no right to cumulate votes in an election of  directors.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Anti-takeover provisions following mutual to stock conversion.  Notwithstanding the law of the state in which the subsidiary holding  company is located, a subsidiary holding company may amend its charter  by renumbering existing sections as appropriate and adding a new section  8 as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Section 8. Certain Provisions Applicable for Five Years.  Notwithstanding anything contained in the subsidiary holding company's  charter or bylaws to the contrary, for a period of [specify number of  years up to five] years from the date of completion of the conversion of  the subsidiary holding company from mutual to stock form, the following  provisions shall apply:</p><p class="depth0">A. Beneficial Ownership Limitation. No person shall directly or  indirectly offer to acquire or acquire the beneficial ownership of more  than 10 percent of any class of an equity security of the subsidiary  holding company. This limitation shall not apply to a transaction in  which the subsidiary holding company forms a holding company without  change in the respective beneficial ownership interests of its  stockholders other than pursuant to the exercise of any dissenter and  appraisal rights, the purchase of shares by underwriters in connection  with a public offering, or the purchase of shares by a tax-qualified  employee stock benefit plan which is exempt from the approval  requirements under Sec. 238.12(a) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">In the event shares are acquired in violation of this section 8, all  shares beneficially owned by any person in excess of 10 percent shall be  considered ``excess shares'' and shall not be counted as shares entitled  to vote and shall not be voted by any person or counted as voting shares  in connection with any matters submitted to the stockholders for a vote.</p><p class="depth0">For purposes of this section 8, the following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The term ``person'' includes an individual, a group acting in  concert, a corporation, a partnership, an association, a joint stock  company, a trust, an unincorporated organization or similar company, a  syndicate or any other group formed for the purpose of acquiring,  holding or disposing of the equity securities of the subsidiary holding  company.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The term ``offer'' includes every offer to buy or otherwise  acquire, solicitation of an offer to sell, tender offer for, or request  or   invitation for tenders of, a security or interest in a security for  value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The term ``acquire'' includes every type of acquisition, whether  effected by purchase, exchange, operation of law or otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The term ``acting in concert'' means (a) knowing participation  in a joint activity or conscious parallel action towards a common goal  whether or not pursuant to an express agreement, or (b) a combination or  pooling of voting or other interests in the securities of an issuer for  a common purpose pursuant to any contract, understanding, relationship,  agreement or other arrangements, whether written or otherwise.</p><p class="depth0">B. Cumulative Voting Limitation. Stockholders shall not be permitted  to cumulate their votes for election of directors.</p><p class="depth0">C. Call for Special Meetings. Special meetings of stockholders  relating to changes in control of the subsidiary holding company or  amendments to its charter shall be called only upon direction of the  board of directors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Anti-takeover provisions. The Board may grant approval to a  charter amendment not listed in paragraph (b) of this section regarding  the acquisition by any person or persons of its equity securities  provided that the subsidiary holding company shall file as part of its  application for approval an opinion, acceptable to the Board, of counsel  independent from the subsidiary holding company that the proposed  charter provision would be permitted to be adopted by a corporation  chartered by the state in which the principal office of the subsidiary  holding company is located. Any such provision must be consistent with  applicable statutes, regulations, and Board policies. Further, any such  provision that would have the effect of rendering more difficult a  change in control of the subsidiary holding company and would require  for any corporate action (other than the removal of directors) the  affirmative vote of a larger percentage of shareholders than is required  by this part, shall not be effective unless adopted by a percentage of  shareholder vote at least equal to the highest percentage that would be  required to take any action under such provision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Reissuance of charter. A subsidiary holding company that has  amended its charter may apply to have its charter, including the  amendments, reissued by the Board. Such requests for reissuance should  be filed with the appropriate Reserve Bank, and contain signatures  required by the charter in appendix B to this part, together with such  supporting documents as needed to demonstrate that the amendments were  properly adopted.</p>
