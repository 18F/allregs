                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. A claimant requesting an administrative appeal may request review pursuant to any of the procedures listed in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. Any appeal of the initial determination must be in writing and must specify what type of appeal the claimant requests. The determination of whether to agree to a request for administrative appeal shall rest solely with the Board, which shall notify the claimant of its decision in writing. The 60 day period for filing a lawsuit in United States district court, provided for in Sec. 709.7 of this part, shall be tolled from the date of claimant's request for an administrative appeal to the date of the Board's decision regarding that request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Hearing on the record. Except as provided herein, any hearing requested pursuant to this section shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of subpart A, part 747, of this chapter. The Board shall render a final decision with respect to such claim after consideration of the hearing record and recommended decision. The Board's determination shall be subject to judicial review under chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code. Any claimant seeking judicial review of the Board's final decision under this paragraph must file a petition in the court of appeals for the circuit in which the principal office of the credit union is located, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, within 30 days of the date of the Board's final decision. If a claimant does not file a petition before the end of the 30-day period, the Board's

decision shall be final, and the claimant shall have no further rights or remedies with respect to such claim.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Burden of proof. In any hearing on the record, the burden of proof to establish entitlement to any modification of the initial determination shall rest solely upon the claimant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Order of procedure. In any hearing on the record, at the time for opening arguments, counsel for the claimant shall argue first, and at the time for closing arguments, counsel for the claimant shall argue last.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Alternative dispute resolution. Paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section list alternatives for dispute resolution which may be available at the discretion of the Board. From time to time, the NCUA Board may authorize additional alternative dispute resolution processes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Appeal to the Board. Pursuant to this paragraph (c)(1), the claimant may file an appeal with the NCUA Board within the time provided for in Sec. 709.7. The appeal must be in writing and filed with the Secretary of the Board, National Credit Union Administration, 1775 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22314-3428. There shall be no personal appearance before the Board in connection with an appeal under this paragraph (c)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Content of appeal. Any appeal must include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A statement of the facts on which the appeal is based;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A statement of the basis for the initial determination to which the claimant objects and the alleged error in such determination, including citations to applicable statutes and regulations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any other evidence relied upon by the claimant which was not previously provided to the liquidating agent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Procedures for review of the appeal. (A) Within 60 days of the date of the Board's receipt of an appeal, pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Board may request in writing that the claimant submit supplemental evidence in support of its appeal. If additional evidence is requested, the claimant shall have 45 days from the date of issuance of such request to provide such additional information. Failure by the claimant to provide such additional information may, as determined solely by the Board, result in denial of the claimant's appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Within 60 days from the date of the Board's receipt of an appeal, pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the claimant may amend or supplement the appeal in writing. In the event the claimant does amend or supplement the appeal, the provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, with respect to requests for additional information and responses to such requests, shall apply with equal force to any such amendment or supplement to an appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Determination on appeal. (A) Within 180 days from the date of receipt of an appeal by the Board, the Board shall issue a decision allowing or disallowing claimant's appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The decision by the Board on appeal shall be provided to the claimant in writing, stating the reasons for the decision, and shall constitute a final agency decision regarding the claimant's claim.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Failure by the Board to issue a decision on appeal of the claimant's claim within the 180-day period provided for under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section shall be deemed to be a denial of such appeal for the purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Judicial review. (A) For the purposes of seeking judicial review of actions taken pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, only a determination on appeal issued by the NCUA Board pursuant to this section shall constitute a final determination regarding a claim.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A final determination by the Board is reviewable in accordance with the provisions of chapter 7, title 5, United States Code, by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia or the court of appeals for the Federal judicial circuit where the credit union's principal place of business is located. Any request for judicial review under this paragraph must be filed within 60 days of the date of the Board's final decision. If any claimant fails to file before the end of the 60-day period, the Board's decision shall be final, and the claimant shall have no further rights or remedies with respect to such claim.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The following additional procedures for dispute resolution may be made available at the sole discretion of the Board: mediation; nonbinding arbitration; and neutral fact finding.
