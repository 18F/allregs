                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. After SBA has entered into a Cooperative Agreement with  a recipient organization, it shall not suspend, terminate or fail to  renew the agreement unless SBA gives the recipient organization written  notice setting forth the reasons and affording the recipient  organization an opportunity for a hearing. Subject to this requirement  and the provisions of Sec. 130.700(c) regarding non-renewal procedures  for non-performance, the applicable general procedures for suspension  and termination are contained in 13 CFR 143.43 and 143.44, and in OMB  Circular A-110, Attachment L.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Causes. Causes which may lead to suspension, termination, or  failure to renew include non-performance, poor performance,  unwillingness to implement changes to improve performance, or any of the  following reasons:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Disregard or material violation of these regulations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A willful or material failure to perform under the Cooperative  Agreement or under these regulations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Conduct reflecting a lack of business integrity or honesty;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A conflict of interest causing real or perceived detriment to a  small business concern, a contractor, the SBDC or SBA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Improper use of Federal funds;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Failure of a Lead Center or its subcenters to consent to audits  or examination or to maintain required documents or records;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Failure of the SBDC Director to work at the SBDC Lead Center on  a full-time basis;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Failure promptly to suspend or terminate the employment of an  SBDC Director, subcenter Director or other key employee upon receipt of  knowledge by the recipient organization and/or SBA that such individual  is engaging in or has engaged in conduct resulting in a criminal  conviction or civil judgment which would cause the public to question  the SBDC's business integrity, taking into consideration such factors as  the magnitude, repetitiveness, harm caused and remoteness in time of the  activity or activities underlying the conviction or judgment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Violation of the SBDC's standards of conduct as specified in  these rules and as established by the SBDC pursuant to these rules; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Any other cause not otherwise specified which materially and  adversely affects the operation or integrity of an SBDC or the SBDC  program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Non-Renewal Procedure. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Subject to Sec. 130.700(a), when an  SBA District Director believes there is sufficient evidence of SBDC  nonperformance, poor performance or unwillingness to implement changes  to improve performance, under the terms of the Cooperative Agreement or  these regulations, the District Director shall notify the SBDC Director  and any other appropriate official of the recipient organization of an  intention not to approve its renewal application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notice can be submitted at any time during the budget period,  but normally should be sent no later than 3 months prior to the due date  for renewal applications at the District Office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The notice shall specifically cite the reasons for the intention  not to renew. It must allow the recipient organization 60 days within  which to change its operations to correct the problems cited in the  notice, and to report to the Project Officer, in writing, regarding the  results of such changes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the recipient organization is unwilling or unable to address  the specific problem areas to the satisfaction of the SBA District  Office within the 60-day period, the SBA Project Officer shall have ten  (10) calendar days after expiration of the 60 days to submit to the AA/ SBDCs a written description of the unresolved issues, a summary of the  positions of the District Office on the issues, and any supportive  documentation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The AA/SBDCs shall transmit a written, final decision to the  recipient organization, the SBDC Director, the SBA Project Officer and  other appropriate SBA field office personnel within 30 calendar days of  receipt of such documentation, unless an extension of time is mutually  agreed upon by the recipient organization and the AA/SBDCs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The AA/SBDCs shall consider written documentation of the issues  to be resolved, including all relevant correspondence between the  Project Officer, District Director and any other SBA personnel and the  affected recipient organization. At a minimum, such documentation shall  commence with the first written notice of issues invoking the non- renewal procedure. In addition, the AA/SBDCs also may communicate with  the recipient organization and appropriate SBA personnel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If the AA/SBDCs determines that the evidence submitted  establishes nonperformance, ineffective performance or an unwillingness  to implement suggested changes to improve performance, the AA/SBDCs  shall have full discretion to order non-renewal of the SBDC. The SBA  District Office shall then pursue proposals from other organizations  interested in applying for SBDC designation. The incumbent SBDC shall  have until the end of the budget period or 120 days, whichever is  longer, to conclude operations and to submit close-out documents to the  SBA District Office. Close-out procedures shall conform with applicable  OMB Circulars.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effect of action on subcenter. If competing applications are  being accepted, a subcenter of the previously funded recipient  organization may apply for designation as the recipient organization, so  long as the subcenter was not involved in the conduct leading to non- renewal or termination of the former recipient organization.</p>
