                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The manufacturer must select for testing, from each engine family, the engine configuration which is expected to be worst-case for exhaust emission compliance on in-use engines, considering all exhaust emission constituents and the range of installation options available to vessel builders. The engines selected for testing are collectively described as the test fleet.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each engine in the test fleet must be constructed to be representative of production engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> After review of the manufacturer's test fleet, the Administrator may select from the available fleet one additional test engine from each engine family.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each engine selected shall be tested according to the provisions of Subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In lieu of testing an emission data engine selected under paragraph (a) of this section and submitting the resulting data, a manufacturer may, with Administrator approval, use emission data on a similar engine for which certification has previously been obtained or for which all applicable data required under this subpart have previously been submitted. These data must be submitted in the application for certification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A single cylinder test engine may be used for certification of Tier 1 Category 3 engine families. If you use test data from a single cylinder test engine for certification, explain in your application how you have determined that such data show that the multiple cylinder production engines will comply with the applicable emission standards.
