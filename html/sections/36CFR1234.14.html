                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Paper-based temporary records. Paper-based temporary records  must be stored under environmental conditions that prevent the active  growth of mold. Exposure to moisture through leaks or condensation,  relative humidities in excess of 70%, extremes of heat combined with  relative humidity in excess of 55%, and poor air circulation during  periods of elevated heat and relative humidity are all factors that  contribute to mold growth.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>. In general, medium term  conditions as defined by these standards are those that will ensure the  preservation of the materials for at least 10 years with little  information degradation or loss. Records may continue to be usable for  longer than 10 years when stored under these conditions, but with an  increasing risk of information loss or degradation with longer times. If  temporary records require retention longer than 10 years, better storage  conditions (cooler and drier) than those specified for medium term  storage will be needed to maintain the usability of these records. The  applicable standards are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ANSI/PIMA IT9.11 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 1234.3);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ANSI/NAPM IT9.23 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 1234.3);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ANSI/PIMA IT9.25 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 1234.3);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> ANSI/NAPM IT9.20 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 1234.3);  and/or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> ANSI/NAPM IT9.18 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 1234.3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> no later than October 1, 2009.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Nontextual permanent, unscheduled, and/or sample/select records.  All records storage facilities that store microfilm, audiovisual, and/or  electronic permanent, unscheduled, and/or sample/select   records must comply with the storage standards for permanent and  unscheduled records in parts 1238, 1237, and/or 1236 of this subchapter,  respectively.</p>
