                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> EPA considers various factors to allocate among the Management  Conferences the funds requested in the President's budget for the NEP.  Each year, the Director of the Office of Marine and Estuarine Protection  issues budgetary targets for the NEP for each Management Conference.  These targets are based upon negotiated Five-Year State/EPA Conference  Agreements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Using the budgetary targets provided by EPA, each Management  Conference develops Annual Work Plans describing the work to be  completed during the year and identifies individual projects to be  funded for the completion of such work. Each applicant having a scope of  work approved by the Management Conference completes a standard EPA  application, including a proposed work program. After the applicant  submits an application, the Regional Administrator reviews it and, if it  meets applicable requirements, approves the application and agrees to  make an award when funds are available. The Regional Administrator  awards assistance from funds appropriated by Congress for that purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The recipient conducts activities according to the approved  application and assistance award. The Regional Administrator evaluates  recipient performance to ensure compliance with all conditions of the  assistance award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Regional Administrator may use funds not awarded to an  applicant to supplement awards to other recipients who submit a score of  work approved by the management conference for NEP funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The EPA Assistant Administrator for Water may approve National  Program awards as provided in Sec. 35.9070.</p>
