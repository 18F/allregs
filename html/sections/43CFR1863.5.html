                            <p class="depth0">Evidence of title, when required by the regulations, must be submitted in such form and by such abstracter or company as may be satisfactory to the Bureau of Land Management. A policy of title insurance, or a certificate of title, may be accepted in lieu of an abstract, in proper cases, when issued by a title company. A policy of title insurance when furnished must be free from conditions and stipulations not acceptable to the Department of the Interior. A certificate of title will be accepted only where the certificate is made to the Government, or expressly for its benefit and where the interests of the Government will be sufficiently protected thereby.

Sec. 1864.0-1  Purpose.</p><p class="depth0">The Secretary of the Interior has been granted discretionary authority by section 315 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1745) to issue recordable disclaimers of interests in lands. In general, a disclaimer may be issued if the disclaimer will help remove a cloud on the title to lands and there is a determination that such lands are not lands of the United States or that the United States does not hold a valid interest in the lands. These regulations implement this statutory authority of the Secretary.


Sec. 1864.0-2  Objectives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The objective of the disclaimer is to eliminate the necessity for court action or private legislation in those instances where the United States asserts no ownership or record interest, based upon a determination by the Secretary of the Interior that there is a cloud on the title to the lands, attributable to the United States, and that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A record interest of the United States in lands has terminated by operation of law or is otherwise invalid; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The lands lying between the meander line shown on a plat of survey approved by the Bureau of Land Management or its predecessors and the actual shoreline of a body of water are not lands of the United States; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Accreted, relicted, or avulsed lands are not lands of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A disclaimer has the same effect as a quitclaim deed in that it operates to estop the United States from asserting a claim to an interest in or the ownership of lands that are being disclaimed. However, a disclaimer does not grant, convey, transfer, remise, quitclaim, release or renounce any title or interest in lands, nor does it operate to release or discharge any tax, judgement or other lien, or any other mortgage, deed or trust or other security interest in lands that are held by or for the benefit of the United States or any instrumentality of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The regulations in this subpart do not apply to any disclaimer, release, quitclaim or other similar instrument or declaration, that may be issued pursuant to any provision of law other than section 315 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1745).


Sec. 1864.0-3  Authority.</p><p class="depth0">Section 315 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1745), authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to issue a recordable disclaimer, where the disclaimer will help remove a cloud on the title of such lands, if certain determinations are made and conditions are met.


Sec. 1864.0-5  Definitions.</p><p class="depth0">As used in this subpart, the term:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authorized officer means any employee of the Bureau of Land Management who has been delegated the authority to perform the duties described in this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Accreted lands have the meaning imparted to them by applicable law. In

general, they are lands that have been gradually and imperceptibly formed along the banks of a body of water by deposition of water-borne soil.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Avulsed lands have the meaning imparted to them by applicable law. In general, they are lands that have been uncovered by a relatively sudden change in alignment of the channel of a river, or by a comparable change in some other body of water, or that remain as uplands following such a change, or that are located in the bed of the new channel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Actual shoreline means the line which is washed by the water wherever it covers the bed of a body of water at its mean high water level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Lands means lands and interests in lands now or formerly forming a part of the reserved or unreserved public lands of the contiguous 48 States and Alaska and as to any coastal State, includes submerged lands inside of the seaward boundary of the State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Meander line means a survey line established for the purpose of representing the location of the actual shoreline of a permanent natural body of water, without showing all the details of its windings and irregularities. A meander line rarely runs straight for any substantial distance. It is established not as a boundary line but in order to permit calculation of the quantity of lands in the fractional sections remaining after segregation of the water area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Relicted lands have the meaning imparted that term by applicable law. In general, they are lands gradually uncovered when water recedes permanently.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> State means ``the state and any of its creations including any governmental instrumentality within a state, including cities, counties, or other official local governmental entities.''
