                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Guides in this part represent administrative interpretations  of laws enforced by the Federal Trade Commission for the guidance of the  public in conducting its affairs in conformity with legal requirements.  Specifically, the Guides address the application of   Section 5 of the FTC Act (15 U.S.C. 45) to the use of endorsements and  testimonials in advertising. The Guides provide the basis for voluntary  compliance with the law by advertisers and endorsers. Practices  inconsistent with these Guides may result in corrective action by the  Commission under Section 5 if, after investigation, the Commission has  reason to believe that the practices fall within the scope of conduct  declared unlawful by the statute. The Guides set forth the general  principles that the Commission will use in evaluating endorsements and  testimonials, together with examples illustrating the application of  those principles. The Guides do not purport to cover every possible use  of endorsements in advertising. Whether a particular endorsement or  testimonial is deceptive will depend on the specific factual  circumstances of the advertisement at issue.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For purposes of this part, an endorsement means any advertising  message (including verbal statements, demonstrations, or depictions of  the name, signature, likeness or other identifying personal  characteristics of an individual or the name or seal of an organization)  that consumers are likely to believe reflects the opinions, beliefs,  findings, or experiences of a party other than the sponsoring  advertiser, even if the views expressed by that party are identical to  those of the sponsoring advertiser. The party whose opinions, beliefs,  findings, or experience the message appears to reflect will be called  the endorser and may be an individual, group, or institution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Commission intends to treat endorsements and testimonials  identically in the context of its enforcement of the Federal Trade  Commission Act and for purposes of this part. The term endorsements is  therefore generally used hereinafter to cover both terms and situations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For purposes of this part, the term product includes any  product, service, company or industry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For purposes of this part, an expert is an individual, group, or  institution possessing, as a result of experience, study, or training,  knowledge of a particular subject, which knowledge is superior to what  ordinary individuals generally acquire.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1: A film critic's review of a movie is excerpted in an  advertisement. When so used, the review meets the definition of an  endorsement because it is viewed by readers as a statement of the  critic's own opinions and not those of the film producer, distributor,  or exhibitor. Any alteration in or quotation from the text of the review  that does not fairly reflect its substance would be a violation of the  standards set by this part because it would distort the endorser's  opinion. [See Sec. 255.1(b).]</p><p class="depth2">Example 2: A TV commercial depicts two women in a supermarket buying  a laundry detergent. The women are not identified outside the context of  the advertisement. One comments to the other how clean her brand makes  her family's clothes, and the other then comments that she will try it  because she has not been fully satisfied with her own brand. This  obvious fictional dramatization of a real life situation would not be an  endorsement.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3: In an advertisement for a pain remedy, an announcer who  is not familiar to consumers except as a spokesman for the advertising  drug company praises the drug's ability to deliver fast and lasting pain  relief. He purports to speak, not on the basis of his own opinions, but  rather in the place of and on behalf of the drug company. The  announcer's statements would not be considered an endorsement.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4: A manufacturer of automobile tires hires a well-known  professional automobile racing driver to deliver its advertising message  in television commercials. In these commercials, the driver speaks of  the smooth ride, strength, and long life of the tires. Even though the  message is not expressly declared to be the personal opinion of the  driver, it may nevertheless constitute an endorsement of the tires. Many  consumers will recognize this individual as being primarily a racing  driver and not merely a spokesperson or announcer for the advertiser.  Accordingly, they may well believe the driver would not speak for an  automotive product unless he actually believed in what he was saying and  had personal knowledge sufficient to form that belief. Hence, they would  think that the advertising message reflects the driver's personal views.  This attribution of the underlying views to the driver brings the  advertisement within the definition of an endorsement for purposes of  this part.</p><p class="depth2">Example 5: A television advertisement for a particular brand of golf  balls shows a prominent and well-recognized professional golfer  practicing numerous drives off the tee. This would be an endorsement by  the golfer even though she makes no verbal statement in the  advertisement.</p><p class="depth2">Example 6: An infomercial for a home fitness system is hosted by a  well-known entertainer. During the infomercial, the entertainer  demonstrates the machine and states that it is the most effective and  easy-to-use home exercise machine that she has ever tried. Even if she  is reading from a script, this statement would be an endorsement,  because consumers are likely to believe it reflects the entertainer's  views.</p><p class="depth2">Example 7: A television advertisement for a housewares store  features a well-known female comedian and a well-known male baseball  player engaging in light-hearted banter about products each one intends  to purchase for the other. The comedian says that she will buy him a  Brand X, portable, high-definition television so he can finally see the  strike zone. He says that he will get her a Brand Y juicer so she can  make juice with all the fruit and vegetables thrown at her during her  performances. The comedian and baseball player are not likely to be  deemed endorsers because consumers will likely realize that the  individuals are not expressing their own views.</p><p class="depth2">Example 8: A consumer who regularly purchases a particular brand of  dog food decides one day to purchase a new, more expensive brand made by  the same manufacturer. She writes in her personal blog that the change  in diet has made her dog's fur noticeably softer and shinier, and that  in her opinion, the new food definitely is worth the extra money. This  posting would not be deemed an endorsement under the Guides.</p><p class="depth2">Assume that rather than purchase the dog food with her own money,  the consumer gets it for free because the store routinely tracks her  purchases and its computer has generated a coupon for a free trial bag  of this new brand. Again, her posting would not be deemed an endorsement  under the Guides.</p><p class="depth2">Assume now that the consumer joins a network marketing program under  which she periodically receives various products about which she can  write reviews if she wants to do so. If she receives a free bag of the  new dog food through this program, her positive review would be  considered an endorsement under the Guides.</p>
