                                Sec. 250.108  Potassium permanganate preparations as prescription drugs.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> There have been a number of reports in the medical literature of  serious injuries to women resulting from the misuse of potassium  permanganate in an effort to induce abortion. Reports from physicians  who have treated such cases show that the injuries are commonly caused  by introducing tablets or crystals of potassium permanganate into the  vagina. Experience with these cases shows that such use of potassium  permanganate is not effective in producing abortion, but that instead  the drug produces serious and painful injury to the walls of the vagina,  causing ulcers, massive hemorrhage, and infection. Such dangerous and  useless employment of potassium permanganate is apparently encouraged  among the misinformed by the mistaken idea that the vaginal bleeding  caused by the corrosive action of the drug indicates a termination of  pregnancy, which it does not.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Potassium permanganate is a strong oxidizing agent, a highly  caustic, tissue-destroying chemical, and a poison. There are no  circumstances under which crystals and tablets of potassium permanganate  constitute safe dosage forms for use in self-medication. It is the  consensus of informed medical opinion that the only dosage forms of  potassium permanganate known to be safe for use in self-medication are  aqueous solutions containing not more than 0.04 percent potassium  permanganate. Such solutions are safe for use in self-medication only by  external application to the skin.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In view of the very real potentiality for harmful effect, and  the actual injuries caused by the misuse of potassium permanganate, the  Food and Drug Administration believes that in order adequately to  protect the public health:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of the  Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and should be restricted to  prescription sale. Such drugs will be regarded as misbranded if at any  time prior to dispensing the   label fails to bear the statement ``Rx only.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Potassium permanganate labeled for use as a prescription  component in human drugs under the exemption provided in Sec. 201.120  of this chapter or labeled for manufacturing use under the exemption  provided in Sec. 201.122 of this chapter will be regarded as misbranded  unless the label bears the statement, ``Rx only.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> These drugs will be regarded as misbranded when intended for  veterinary use unless the label bears the legend, ``Caution: Federal law  restricts this drug to sale by or on the order of a licensed  veterinarian''; Provided, however, That this shall not apply to a drug  labeled and marketed for veterinary use if such drug contains not more  than 50 percent of potassium permanganate and includes other ingredients  which make it unsuitable for human use and unlikely that the article  would be used in an attempt to induce abortion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any preparation of potassium permanganate intended for over-the- counter sale for human use internally or by application to any mucous  membranes or for use in the vagina will be regarded as misbranded under  the provisions of section 502(f) (1) and (2) and section 502(j) of the  act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any other preparation of potassium permanganate intended for  over-the-counter sale for human use will be regarded as misbranded under  section 502(f) (1) and (2) and section 502(j) of the act unless, among  other things, all of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It is an aqueous solution containing not more than 0.04 percent  potassium permanganate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The label and labeling bear, in juxtaposition with adequate  directions for use, clear warning statements designated as ``Warning,''  and to the effect: ``Warning--For external use on the skin only. Severe  injury may result from use internally or as a douche. Avoid contact with  mucous membranes.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The labeling or dispensing of any potassium permanganate  preparations intended for drug use within the jurisdiction of the  Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act contrary to this statement after 60  days from the date of its publication in the Federal Register may be  made the subject of regulatory proceedings.
