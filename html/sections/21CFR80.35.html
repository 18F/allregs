A color additive mixture prepared from a previously certified batch of one or more straight colors, with or without any diluent that has been listed in part 73 of this chapter for use in mixtures, shall be exempt from batch certification if the straight color used has not changed in composition in any manner whatsoever since its certification and if it is simply mixed with the approved diluents for exempt mixtures. The label of such color additive mixtures shall not bear the lot number assigned by the Food and Drug Administration to the certified straight color components, but shall bear the manufacturer's control number through which the history of the straight color can be determined.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Additions to the list of diluents. A person requesting additions to the list of diluents authorized for the purposes described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall submit a petition in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 71.1 of this chapter.
