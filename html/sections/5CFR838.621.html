                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Pro rata share means one-half of the fraction whose numerator is  the number of months of Federal civilian and military service that the  employee performed during the marriage and whose denominator is the  total number of months of Federal civilian and military service  performed by the employee through the day before the effective date of  phased retirement or separation for retirement, as applicable to the  annuity calculation. In the computation of the division of phased  retirement annuity and a composite retirement annuity, a pro rata share  will be computed through the day before the effective date of an  employee's phased retirement for the computation of the division of a  phased retirement annuity and then recomputed for division of the  composite retirement annuity under Sec. Sec. 831.1742 and 848.502.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A court order that awards a former spouse a prorata share of an  employee annuity or a refund of employee contributions by using the term  ``prorata share'' and identifying the date when the marriage began  satisfies the requirements of Sec. Sec. 838.305 and 838.504 and awards  the former spouse a prorata share as defined in paragraph (a) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A court order that awards a portion of an employee annuity as of  a specified date before the employee's phased retirement or retirement  awards the former spouse a pro rata share as defined in paragraph (a) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A court order that awards a portion of the ``value'' of an  annuity as of a specific date before retirement, without specifying what  ``value'' is, awards the former spouse a prorata share as defined in  paragraph (a) of this section.
