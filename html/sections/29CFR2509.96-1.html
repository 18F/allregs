                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This interpretive bulletin sets forth the Department of  Labor's interpretation of section 3(21)(A)(ii) of the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), and 29 CFR  2510.3-21(c) as applied to the provision of investment-related  educational information to participants and beneficiaries in  participant-directed individual account pension plans (i.e., pension  plans that permit participants and beneficiaries to direct the  investment of assets in their individual accounts, including plans that  meet the requirements of the Department's regulations at 29 CFR  2550.404c-1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General. Fiduciaries of an employee benefit plan are charged  with carrying out their duties prudently and solely in the interest of  participants and beneficiaries of the plan, and are subject to personal  liability to, among other things, make good any losses to the plan  resulting from a breach of their fiduciary duties. ERISA sections 403,  404 and 409, 29 U.S.C. 1103, 1104, and 1109. Section 404(c) of ERISA  provides a limited exception to these rules for a pension plan that  permits a participant or beneficiary to exercise control over the assets  in his or her individual account. The Department of Labor's regulation,  at 29 CFR 2550.404c-1, describes the kinds of plans to which section  404(c) applies, the circumstances under which a participant or  beneficiary will be considered to have exercised independent control  over the assets in his or her account, and the consequences of a  participant's or beneficiary's exercise of such control. \1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ The section 404(c) regulation conditions relief from fiduciary  liability on, among other things, the participant or beneficiary being  provided or having the opportunity to obtain sufficient investment  information regarding the investment alternatives available under the  plan in order to make informed investment decisions. Compliance with  this condition, however, does not require that participants and  beneficiaries be offered or provided either investment advice or  investment education, e.g., regarding general investment principles and  strategies, to assist them in making investment decisions. 29 CFR  2550.404c-1(c)(4). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">With both an increase in the number of participant-directed  individual account plans and the number of investment options available  to participants and beneficiaries under such plans, there has been an  increasing recognition of the importance of providing participants and  beneficiaries, whose investment decisions will directly affect their  income at retirement, with information designed to assist them in making  investment and retirement-related decisions appropriate to their  particular situations. Concerns have been raised, however, that the  provision of such information may in some situations be viewed as  rendering ``investment advice for a fee or other compensation,'' within  the meaning of ERISA section 3(21)(A)(ii), thereby giving rise to  fiduciary status and potential liability under ERISA for investment  decisions of plan participants and beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth0">In response to these concerns, the Department of Labor is clarifying  herein the applicability of ERISA section 3(21)(A)(ii) and 29 CFR  2510.3-21(c) to the provision of investment-related educational  information to participants and beneficiaries in participant directed  individual account plans. \2\ In providing this clarification, the  Department   does not address the ``fee or other compensation, direct or indirect,''  which is a necessary element of fiduciary status under ERISA section  3(21)(A)(ii). \3\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ Issues relating to the circumstances under which information  provided to participants and beneficiaries may affect a participant's or  beneficiary's ability to exercise independent control over the assets in  his or her account for purposes of relief from fiduciary liability under  ERISA section 404(c) are beyond the scope of this interpretive bulletin.  Accordingly, no inferences should be drawn regarding such issues. See 29  CFR 2550.404c-1(c)(2). It is the view of the Department, however, that  the provision of investment-related information and material to  participants and beneficiaries in accordance with paragraph (d) of this  interpretive bulletin will not, in and of itself, affect the  availability of relief under section 404(c).</p><p class="depth0">\3\ The Department has expressed the view that, for purposes of  section 3(21)(A)(ii), such fees or other compensation need not come from  the plan and should be deemed to include all fees or other compensation  incident to the transaction in which the investment advise has been or  will be rendered. See A.O. 83-60A (Nov. 21, 1983); Reich v. McManus, 883  F. Supp. 1144 (N.D. Ill. 1995). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> is intended  to clarify the application of that section, it is the view of the  Department of Labor that the criteria set forth in the regulation apply  to determine whether a person renders ``investment advice'' to a pension  plan participant or beneficiary who is permitted to direct the  investment of assets in his or her individual account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A))</em>, or (B) renders the advice on a  regular basis to the participant or beneficiary, pursuant to a mutual  agreement, arrangement or understanding (written or otherwise) with the  participant or beneficiary that the advice will serve as a primary basis  for the participant's or beneficiary's investment decisions with respect  to plan assets and that such person will render individualized advice  based on the particular needs of the participant or beneficiary (2510.3- 21(c)(1)(ii)(B)). \4\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\4\ This IB does not address the application of 29 CFR 2510.3-21(c)  to communications with fiduciaries of participant-directed individual  account pension plan plans. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Whether the provision of particular investment-related information  or materials to a participant or beneficiary constitutes the rendering  of ``investment advice,'' within the meaning of 29 CFR 2510.3-21(c)(1),  generally can be determined only by reference to the facts and  circumstances of the particular case with respect to the individual plan  participant or beneficiary. To facilitate such determinations, however,  the Department of Labor has identified, in paragraph (d), below,  examples of investment-related information and materials which if  provided to plan participants and beneficiaries would not, in the view  of the Department, result in the rendering of ``investment advice''  under ERISA section 3(21)(A)(ii) and 29 CFR 2510.3-21(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Investment Education. For purposes of ERISA section 3(21)(A)(ii)  and 29 CFR 2510.3-21(c), the Department of Labor has determined that the  furnishing of the following categories of information and materials to a  participant or beneficiary in a participant-directed individual account  pension plan will not constitute the rendering of ``investment advice,''  irrespective of who provides the information (e.g., plan sponsor,  fiduciary or service provider), the frequency with which the information  is shared, the form in which the information and materials are provided  (e.g., on an individual or group basis, in writing or orally, or via  video or computer software), or whether an identified category of  information and materials is furnished alone or in combination with  other identified categories of information and materials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Plan Information. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Information and materials that inform a  participant or beneficiary about the benefits of plan participation, the  benefits of increasing plan contributions, the impact of preretirement  withdrawals on retirement income, the terms of the plan, or the  operation of the plan; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> information such as that described in 29 CFR 2550.404c- 1(b)(2)(i) on investment alternatives under the plan (e.g., descriptions  of investment objectives and philosophies, risk and return  characteristics, historical return information, or related  prospectuses). \5\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\5\ Descriptions of investment alternatives under the plan may  include information relating to the generic asset class (e,g,, equities,  bonds, or cash) of the investment alternatives. 29 CFR 2550.404c-1  (b)(2)(i)(B)(1)(ii).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">The information and materials described above relate to the plan and  plan participation, without reference to the appropriateness of any  individual investment option for a particular participant or beneficiary  under the plan. The information, therefore, does not contain either  ``advice'' or ``recommendations'' within the meaning of 29 CFR 2510.3- 21(c)(1)(i). Accordingly, the furnishing of such information would not  constitute the rendering of ``investment advice'' for purposes of  section 3(21)(A)(ii) of ERISA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> General Financial and Investment Information. Information and  materials that inform a participant or beneficiary about: (i) General  financial and investment concepts, such as risk and return,  diversification, dollar cost averaging, compounded return, and tax  deferred investment; (ii) historic differences in rates of return  between different asset classes (e.g., equities, bonds, or cash) based  on standard market indices; (iii) effects of inflation; (iv) estimating  future retirement income needs; (v) determining investment time  horizons; and (vi) assessing risk tolerance.</p><p class="depth0">The information and materials described above are general financial  and investment information that have no direct relationship to  investment alternatives available to participants and beneficiaries  under a plan or to individual participants or beneficiaries. The  furnishing of such information, therefore, would not constitute  rendering ``advice'' or making ``recommendations'' to a participant or  beneficiary within the meaning of 29 CFR 2510.3-21(c)(1)(i).  Accordingly, the furnishing of such information would not constitute the  rendering of ``investment advice'' for purposes of section 3(21)(A)(ii)  of ERISA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Asset Allocation Models. Information and materials (e.g., pie  charts, graphs, or case studies) that provide a participant or  beneficiary with models, available to all plan participants and  beneficiaries, of asset allocation portfolios of hypothetical  individuals with different time horizons and risk profiles, where: (i)  Such models are based on generally accepted investments theories that  take into account the historic returns of different asset classes (e.g.,  equities, bonds, or cash) over define periods of time; (ii) all material  facts and assumptions on which such models are based (e.g., retirement  ages, life expectancies, income levels, financial resources, replacement  income ratios, inflation rates, and rates of return) accompany the  models; (iii) to the extent that an asset allocation model identifies  any specific investment alternative available under the plan, the model  is accompanied by a statement indicating that other investment  alternatives having similar risk and return characteristics may be  available under the plan and identifying where information on those  investment alternatives may be obtained; and (iv) the asset allocation  models are accompanied by a statement indicating that, in applying  particular asset allocation models to their individual situations,  participants or beneficiaries should consider their other assets,  income, and investments (e.g., equity in a home, IRA investments,  savings accounts, and interests in other qualified and non-qualified  plans) in addition to their interests in the plan.</p><p class="depth0">Because the information and materials described above would enable a  participant or beneficiary to assess the relevance of an asset  allocation model to his or her individual situation, the furnishing of  such information would not constitute a ``recommendation'' within the  meaning of 29 CFR 2510.3-21(c)(1)(i) and, accordingly, would not  constitute ``investment advice'' for purposes of section 3(21)(A)(ii) of  ERISA. This result would not, in the view of the Department, be affected  by the fact that a plan offers only one investment alternative in a  particular asset class identified in an asset allocation model.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Interactive Investment Materials. Questionnaires, worksheets,  software, and similar materials which provide a participant or  beneficiary the means to estimate future retirement income needs and  assess the impact of different asset allocations on retirement income,  where: (i) Such materials are based on generally accepted investment  theories that take into account the historic returns of different asset  classes (e.g., equities, bonds, or cash) over defined periods of time;  (ii) there is an objective correlation between the asset allocations  generated by the materials and the information and data supplied by the  participant or beneficiary; (iii) all material facts and assumptions  (e.g., retirement ages, life expectancies, income levels, financial  resources, replacement income ratios, inflation rates, and rates of  return) which may affect a participant's or beneficiary's assessment of  the different asset allocations accompany the materials or are specified  by the participant or beneficiary; (iv) to the extent that an asset  allocation generated by the materials identifies any specific investment  alternative available under the plan, the asset allocation is  accompanied by a statement indicating that other investment alternatives  having similar risk and return characteristics may be available under  the plan and identifying where information on those investment  alternatives may be obtained; and (v) the materials either take into  account or are accompanied by a statement indicating that, in applying  particular asset allocations to their individual situations,  participants or beneficiaries should consider their other assets,  income, and investments (e.g., equity in a home, IRA investments,  savings accounts, and interests in other qualified and non-qualified  plans) in addition to their interests in the plan.</p><p class="depth0">The information provided through the use of the above-described  materials enables participants and beneficiaries independently to design  and assess multiple asset allocation models, but otherwise these  materials do not differ from asset allocation models based on  hypothetical assumptions. Such information would not constitute a  ``recommendation'' within the meaning of 29 CFR 2510.3-21(c)(1)(i) and ,  accordingly, would not constitute ``investment advice'' for purposes of  section 3(21)(A)(ii) of ERISA.</p><p class="depth0">The Department notes that the information and materials described in  subparagraphs (1)-(4) above merely represent examples of the type of  information and materials which may be furnished to participants and  beneficiaries without such information and materials constituting  ``investment advice.'' In this regard, the Department recognizes that  there may be many other examples of information, materials, and  educational services which, if furnished to participants and  beneficiaries, would not constitute ``investment advice.'' Accordingly,  no inferences should be drawn from subparagraphs (1)-(4), above, with  respect to whether the furnishing of any information, materials or  educational services not described therein may constitute ``investment  advice.'' Determinations as to whether the provision of any information,  materials or educational services not described herein constitutes the  rendering of ``investment advice'' must be made by reference to the  criteria set forth in 29 CFR 2510. 3-21(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Selection and Monitoring of Educators and Advisors. As with any  designation of a service provider to a plan, the designation of a  person(s) to provide investment educational services or investment  advice to plan participants and beneficiaries is an exercise of  discretionary authority or control with respect to management of the  plan; therefore, persons making the designation must act prudently and  solely in the interest of the plan participants and beneficiaries, both  in making the designation(s) and in continuing such designation(s). See  ERISA sections 3(21)(A)(i) and 404(a), 29 U.S.C. 1002 (21)(A)(i) and  1104(a). In addition, the designation of an investment advisor to serve  as a fiduciary may give rise to co-fiduciary liability if the person  making and continuing such designation in doing so fails to act  prudently and solely in the interest of plan participants and  beneficiaries; or knowingly participates in, conceals or fails to make  reasonable efforts to correct a known breach by the investment advisor.  See ERISA section 405(a), 29 U.S.C. 1105(a). The Department notes,  however, that, in the context of an ERISA section 404(c) plan, neither  the designation of a person to provide education nor the designation of  a fiduciary to provide investment advice to participants and  beneficiaries would, in itself, give rise to fiduciary liability for  loss, or with respect to any breach of part 4 of title I of ERISA, that  is the direct and necessary result of a participant's or beneficiary's  exercise of independent control. 29 CFR 2550.404c-1(d). The Department  also notes that a plan sponsor or fiduciary would have no fiduciary  responsibility or liability with respect to the actions of a third party  selected by a participant or beneficiary to provide education or  investment advice where the plan sponsor or fiduciary neither selects  nor endorses the educator or advisor, nor otherwise makes arrangements  with the educator or advisor to provide such services.
