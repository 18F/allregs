Tart cherries which are used for the purpose of new product development, for new market development and market expansion, for the development of export markets, for experimental purposes, for export to countries other than Canada, and Mexico, or which are donated to charitable organizations may be granted an exemption by the Board and will be exempt from Sec. Sec. 930.41, 930.44, 930.51, 930.53, and Sec. Sec. 930.55 through 930.57, subject to the following terms and conditions. Any information received of a confidential and/or proprietary nature included in this application will be protected from disclosure pursuant to Sec. 930.73 of the order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. The terms in paragraph (a) of this section shall have the following meaning:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> New product development. This term includes the development of new tart cherry products or of foods or other products in which tart cherries or tart cherry products are incorporated which are not presently being produced on a commercial basis. New product development can also include the production or processing of a tart cherry product using a technique not presently being utilized commercially in the tart cherry industry; an end product of the processing of raw tart cherries done by the industry at pack time either for resale or for re-manufacturing which has not been manufactured previously by the industry; or a processed, value-added item that includes tart cherry products as an ingredient which has never been marketed to consumers either by a handler within the industry or by a food manufacturer. In addition, the maximum duration of any credit activity is three years from the first date of shipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> New market development and market expansion. This includes the development of markets for tart cherry products which are not commercially established markets and which are not competitive with commercial outlets presently utilized by the tart cherry industry (including the development of new export markets): Provided, That these markets are a geographic area into which tart cherries or products derived from them have not been previously sold. The term ``market expansion'', includes activities that incrementally expand the sale of either tart cherries or the products in which tart cherries are an ingredient, such as, but not limited to: Expansions of the geographic areas into which tart cherries or tart cherry products are marketed; product line extensions; significant improvements to or revisions of existing products; packaging innovations; segmentation of markets along geographic, demographic, or other definable characteristics; and product repositionings. In addition, shipments of tart cherries or tart cherry products in new market development and market expansion outlets are eligible for handler diversion credit for a period of one year

from the handler's first date of shipment into such outlets.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Development of export markets. The sale of cherries or cherry products, including the development of sales for new or different tart cherry products or the expansion of sales for existing tart cherry products, to countries other than Canada, and Mexico.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Experimental purposes. The use of cherries or cherry products in preliminary and/or developmental activities intended to result in new products, new applications and/or new markets for tart cherry products. Any exemption for experimental work shall be limited in scope, duration and volume based on information supplied by the applicant at the time a request for exemption is made. In no case shall an individual exemption for experimental purposes last longer than five years or exceed 100,000 pounds raw product equivalent of tart cherries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Obtaining approval for exempt uses. In order to receive exemptions for cherries or cherry products utilized for exempt purposes, handlers must apply to the Board for a new exemption or for renewal of an existing exemption by November 1 for the next succeeding year, except for the 1997 year only, handlers may apply through February 5, 1998. A handler shall have one crop year to dispose of cherries or cherry products to exempt outlets approved by the Board, unless granted a renewal. Handlers applying to the Board for a new exemption or for renewal of an existing exemption are subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When applying to the Board for an exemption for new product development, handlers must detail the nature of their new product, how it differs from current, existing products and the anticipated short and long term sales volume for the exemption. It will be the Board staff's responsibility to analyze and investigate any request and upon completion of that analysis authorize or deny the exemption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When applying to the Board for an exemption for new market development, handlers must detail the nature of their new market, how it differs from current, existing markets and the anticipated short and long term sales volume for the exemption. It will be the Board staff's responsibility to analyze and investigate any request and upon completion of that analysis authorize or deny the exemption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When applying to the Board for an exemption for the development of export markets for tart cherries or cherry products (including juice and juice concentrate) in countries other than Canada and Mexico, including the expansion of sales in existing export markets, handlers must detail the nature of their product, specify whether such product differs from current products being sold in export markets, and estimate the anticipated short and long term sales volumes for the requested exemption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When applying to the Board for an exemption for experimental purposes, handlers must indicate the preliminary and/or developmental experimental activity. Such experimental purposes should be intended to result in new products, new applications and/or new markets for existing tart cherry products. Any exemption for experimental work shall be limited in scope, duration and volume which the proposing party shall specify at the time a request for exemption is made. In no case shall an exemption for experimental purposes last longer than five years or exceed 100,000 pounds raw product equivalent per handler of tart cherries during the duration of the experiment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> To be eligible for new product, new market development and market expansion diversion exemptions, a handler must demonstrate involvement in the activity for which the exemptions are sought. The requesting handler must either be or have been involved in development of the product, the market, or market expansion activities for which the exemptions are sought or have had financial involvement in the activities. This involvement must be demonstrated and established to the satisfaction of the Board by the handler requesting the exemptions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Review of applications.

Handler diversion certificates for exempt uses shall be issued to handlers provided that terms and conditions applicable to exempt uses are satisfied. Diversion certificates will not be issued to handlers for any volume of tart cherry products for which such terms and conditions are not satisfied and such cherries would be subject to all of the terms and conditions of Sec. Sec. 930.41, 930.44, 930.51, 930.53, and Sec. Sec. 930.55 through 930.57.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Failure to meet terms and conditions for exemption.
