However, if another law sets specific  procedures for disclosure, the CSB will process a request in accordance  with the procedures that apply to those specific documents. If a request  is received for disclosure of a document to the public which is not  required to be released under those provisions, the CSB will consider  the request under the FOIA and the regulations in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Records available through routine distribution procedures. When  the record requested includes material published and offered for sale,  e.g., by the Superintendent of Documents of the Government Printing  Office, or by an authorized private distributor, the CSB will first  refer the requester to those sources. Nevertheless, if the requester is  not satisfied with the alternative   sources, the CSB will process the request under the FOIA.</p>
