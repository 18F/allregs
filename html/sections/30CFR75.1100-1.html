A portable water car shall be capable of providing a flow through the hose of 50 gallons of water per minute at a nozzle pressure of 50 pounds per square inch.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A portable chemical car shall carry enough chemicals to provide a

fire extinguishing capacity equivalent to that of a portable water car.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Portable foam-generating machines or devices: A portable foam-generating machine or device shall have facilities and equipment for supplying the machine with 30 gallons of water per minute at 30 pounds per square inch for a period of 35 minutes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Portable fire extinguisher: A portable fire extinguisher shall be either (1) a multipurpose dry chemical type containing a nominal weight of 5 pounds of dry powder and enough expellant to apply the powder or (2) a foam-producing type containing at least 2\1/2\ gallons of foam-producing liquids and enough expellant to supply the foam. Only fire extinguishers approved by the Underwriters Laboratories, Inc., or Factory Mutual Research Corp., carrying appropriate labels as to type and purpose, shall be used.
