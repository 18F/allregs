                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Conversion of units of measurement required. Where a veteran  enrolls concurrently in courses offered by two schools and the standards  for the measurement of the courses pursued concurrently in the two  schools are different, VA will measure the veteran's enrollment by  converting the units of measurement for courses in the second school to  their equivalent in units of measurement required for the courses in the  program of education which the veteran is pursuing at the primary  institution. This conversion will be accomplished as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If VA measures the courses at the primary institution on a  credit-hour basis (including a course which does not lead to a standard  college degree, which is being measured on a credit-hour basis), and VA  measures the courses at the second school on a clock-hour basis, the  clock hours will be converted to credit hours.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If VA measures the courses pursued at the primary institution on  a clock-hour basis, and VA measures the courses pursued at the second  school on a credit-hour basis, VA will convert the credit hours to clock  hours to determine the veteran's training time.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3034, 3688)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If VA measures the courses pursued at the primary institution on  a clock-hour basis, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> VA measures the courses pursued at the second school on a mixed  basis, the courses pursued at the second school which VA can measure on  credit-hour basis for at least one program at the second school will be  converted to clock hours and the resulting clock hours added to  determine the veteran's training time; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> VA measures the courses pursued at the second school on a  credit-hour basis, VA will convert the credit hours to clock hours to  determine the veteran's training time.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3034, 3688)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Conversion of clock hours to credit hours. If the provisions of  paragraph (a) of this section require VA to convert clock hours to  credit hours, it will do so by--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Dividing the number of credit hours which VA considers to be  full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a  credit-hour basis by the number of clock hours which are full-time at  the educational institution whose courses are measured on a clock-hour  basis; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Multiplying each clock hour of attendance by the decimal  determined in   paragraph (b)(1) of this section. VA will drop all fractional hours.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3034, 3688)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Conversion of credit hours to clock hours. If the provisions of  paragraph (a) of this section require VA to convert credit hours to  clock hours, it will do so by--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Dividing the number of clock hours which VA considers to be  full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a  clock-hour basis by the number of credit hours which are full-time at  the educational institution whose courses are measured on a credit-hour  basis; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Multiplying each credit hour by the number determined in  paragraph (c)(1) of this section. VA will drop all fractional hours.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3034, 3688)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Both courses measured on a credit hour basis or both courses  measured on a clock hour basis. If VA measures the courses pursued at  both institutions on a credit hour basis or on a clock hour basis, VA  will measure the veteran's enrollment by adding together the units of  measurement for the courses at the second school and the units of  measurement for the courses at the primary institution. The standard for  full time will be the full-time standard for the courses at the primary  institution.
