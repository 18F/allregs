                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Processing method. The processing method shall be one that has been shown: (1) To be capable of concentrating tenfold from source material at least two different antibodies; (2) not to affect the integrity of the globulins; (3) to consistently yield a product which is safe for subcutaneous and intramuscular injection and (4) not to transmit viral hepatitis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Microbial contamination. Low temperatures or aseptic techniques shall be used to minimize contamination by microorganisms. Preservatives to inhibit growth of microorganisms shall not be used during processing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Bulk storage. The globulin fraction may be stored in bulk prior to further processing provided it is stored in clearly identified hermetically closed vessels. Globulin as either a liquid concentrate or a solid and containing alcohol or more than 5 percent moisture shall be stored at a temperature of -10 [deg]C or lower. Globulin as a solid free from alcohol and containing less than 5 percent moisture, shall be stored at a temperature of 0 [deg]C or lower.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Determination of the lot. Each lot of Immune Globulin (Human) shall represent a pooling of approximately equal amounts of material from not less than 1,000 donors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Sterilization and heating. The final product shall be sterilized promptly after solution. At no time during processing shall the product be exposed to temperatures above 45 [deg]C, and after sterilization the product shall not be exposed to temperatures above 32 [deg]C for more than 72 hours.
