                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definition. The term ``break-even amount'' as used herein means the minimum average monthly amount required to provide funds for the items listed in the illustration below. A separate break-even amount shall be established for each size and type of dwelling unit, as well as for the Project as a whole. The break-even amount for EHPA and NRMR will vary by size and type of dwelling unit; similar variations as to other line items may be made if the LHA deems this equitable.</p><p class="depth2">Illustration. The following is an illustration of the computation of the break-even amount based upon hypothetical amounts.
(1) Operating Expense (see Sec. 904.109):</p><p class="depth2">Administration.......................................   $8.50</p><p class="depth2">Homebuyer services...................................    2.00</p><p class="depth2">Project supplied utilities...........................    3.00</p><p class="depth2">Routine maintenance--common property.................    3.00</p><p class="depth2">Protective services..................................    2.00</p><p class="depth2">General expense......................................    6.50</p><p class="depth2">Nonroutine maintenance--common property (Contribution    2.00   $27.00</p><p class="depth2">to operating reserve)...............................(2) Earned Home Payments Account (see Sec. 904.110)..  ......    12.00(3) Nonroutine Maintenance Reserve (see Sec. 904.111)  ......     7.50Break-Even Amount......................................  ......    46.50</p><p class="depth2">The break-even amount does not include the monthly allowance for utilities which the homebuyer pays for directly, nor does it include any amount for debt service on the Project notes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Excess over break-even. When the homebuyer's required monthly payment (see Sec. 904.107(j)) exceeds the applicable break-even amount, the excess shall constitute additional Project income and shall be deposited and used in the same manner as other Project income.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Deficit in monthly payment. When the homebuyer's required monthly payment is less than the applicable break-even amount, the deficit shall be applied as a reduction of that portion of the monthly payment designated for operating expense (i. e., as a reduction of Project income). In all such cases, the EHPA and the NRMR shall be credited with the amount included in the break-even amount for these accounts.</p>
