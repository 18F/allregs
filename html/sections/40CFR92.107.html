                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Fuel flow measurement for locomotive and engine testing. The rate of fuel consumption by the engine must be measured with equipment conforming to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The fuel flow rate measurement instrument must have a minimum accuracy of [2 percent of measurement flow rate for each measurement range used. An exception is allowed at idle where the minimum accuracy is [10 percent of measured flow rate for each measurement range used. The measurement instrument must be able to comply with this requirement with an averaging time of one minute or less, except for idle, dynamic brake, and notches 1 and 2 where the instrument must be able to comply with this requirement with an averaging time of three minutes or less.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The controlling parameters are the elapsed time measurement of the event and the weight or volume measurement. Restrictions on these parameters are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The error in the elapsed time measurement of the event must not be greater than 1 percent of the absolute event time. This includes errors in starting and stopping the clock as well as the period of the clock.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the mass of fuel consumed is measured by discrete weights, then the error in the actual weight of the fuel consumed must not be greater than [1 percent of the measuring weight. An exception is allowed at idle, where the error in the actual weight of the fuel consumed must not be greater than [2 percent of the measuring weight.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the mass of fuel consumed is measured electronically (load cell, load beam, etc.), the error in the actual weight of fuel consumed must not be greater than [1 percent of the full-scale value of the electronic device.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the mass of fuel consumed is measured by volume flow and density, the error in the actual volume consumed must not be greater than [1 percent of the full-scale value of the volume measuring device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For devices that have varying mass scales (electronic weight, volume, density, etc.), compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section may require a separate flow measurement system for low flow rates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Calibration. Fuel flow rate measurement devices shall be calibrated against an independent measurement of the total mass of fuel dispensed during a fixed amount of time in accordance with the following provisions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Measurement of the total mass shall have an accuracy and precision of 1 percent of point, or better.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fuel measurements shall be performed for at least 10 flow rates evenly distributed over the entire range of fuel flow rates used during testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For each flow rate, either the total mass of fuel dispense must exceed 5.0 kilograms (11.0 pounds), or the length of time during which the fuel is dispensed must exceed 30 minutes. In all cases, the length of time during which fuel is dispensed must be at least 180 seconds.</p>
