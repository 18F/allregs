Notice of this election must be provided to the Commissioner in the  manner prescribed in 24 CFR part 200, subpart B. HUD may extend the  Eligibility Notice Period at the request of the mortgagee under the  following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The request must be made to and approved by HUD prior to the  45th day after the date of eligibility; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The approval of an extension shall in no way prejudice the  mortgagee's right to file its notice of its intention to file an  insurance claim and of its election either to assign the mortgage to the  Commissioner or to acquire and convey title to the Commissioner within  the 45-day period or any extension prescribed by the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For mortgages funded with the proceeds of state or local bonds,  Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities, participation certificates, or  other bond obligations specified by the Commissioner (such as an  agreement under which the insured mortgagee has obtained the mortgage  funds from third-party investors and has agreed in writing to repay such  investors at a stated interest rate and in accordance with a fixed  repayment schedule), any of which contains a lock-out or prepayment  premium, in the event of a default during the term of the prepayment  lock-out or prepayment premium, and for any mortgage insured under  section 232 of the Act, the mortgagee must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Request a 90-day extension of the deadline for filing the notice  of the mortgagee's intention to file an insurance claim and the  mortgagee's election to assign the mortgage or acquire and convey title  in accordance with the mortgagee certificate, which HUD may further  extend at the written request of the mortgagee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Assist the mortgagor in arranging refinancing to cure the  default and avert an insurance claim, if the Commissioner grants the  requested (or a shorter) extension of notice filing deadline;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Report to the Commissioner at least monthly on any progress in  arranging refinancing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Cooperate with the Commissioner in taking reasonable steps in  accordance with prudent business practices to avoid an insurance claim;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Require successors or assigns to certify in writing that they  agree to be bound by these conditions for the remainder of the term of  the prepayment lock-out or prepayment premium; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> After commencement of amortization of the refinanced mortgage,  notify HUD of a delinquency when a payment is not received by the 10th  day after the date the payment is due.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For multifamily project mortgages for which HUD issued a firm  commitment for mortgage insurance on or after September 1, 2011, the  regulations of paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall apply, unless the  mortgagor demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that  financial hardship to the mortgagor would result from application of the  regulations in paragraph (a)(2) of this section due to the reasonable  expectations of the mortgagor that the transaction would close under the  regulations in effect prior to September 1, 2011, in which case, the  regulations of paragraph (a)(2) shall not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Acknowledgment of election. For mortgages insured pursuant to  section 232 of the Act, if the lender provides notice to the  Commissioner of its election either to assign the mortgage to the  Commissioner or to acquire and   convey title to the Commissioner, the Commissioner shall, not later than  90 calendar days after the expiration of the Eligibility Notice Period,  as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, as the same may have  been extended, acknowledge and accept, or reject for cause, pursuant to  program requirements, the lender's election, provided that the  Commissioner may, in the Commissioner's discretion, extend such 90-day  period by no more than an additional 90 calendar days if the  Commissioner determines that such an extension is in HUD's interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Assignment of mortgage to Commissioner-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Timeframe; request  for extension. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the mortgagee elects to assign the mortgage to the  Commissioner, the mortgagee shall, at any time within 30 calendar days  after the date HUD acknowledges the notice of election, file its  application for insurance benefits and assign to the Commissioner, in  such manner as the Commissioner may require, any applicable credit  instrument and the realty and chattel security instruments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Commissioner may extend this 30-day period by written  notice that a partial payment of insurance claim under Sec. 207.258b is  being considered. A mortgagee may consider failure to receive a notice  of an extension approval by the end of the 30-day time period a denial  of the request for an extension.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The extension shall be for such term, not to exceed 60 days,  as the Commissioner prescribes; however, the Commissioner's  consideration of a partial payment of claim, or the Commissioner's  request that a mortgagee accept partial payment of a claim in accordance  with Sec. 207.258b, shall in no way prejudice the mortgagee's right to  file its application for full insurance benefits within either the 30- day period or any extension prescribed by the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(6) of this  section shall also be met by the mortgagee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notice of assignment.

In assigning its security interest in  chattels, including materials, located on the premises covered by the  mortgage, or its security interest in building components stored either  on-site or off-site at the time of the assignment, the mortgagee shall  warrant that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> No act or omission of the mortgagee has impaired the validity or  priority of the lien created by the chattel security instruments; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The mortgagee has a good right to assign the security  instruments; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The chattel security instruments are a first lien on the items  covered by the instruments except for such other liens or encumbrances  as may be approved by the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Items delivered by mortgagee.

To be satisfactory to the  Commissioner, the title evidence covering the property conveyed to him  shall show the same title vested in the Commissioner as was vested in  the mortgagor as of the date of the mortgage was filed for record, with  the exception of such liens or other matters affecting the title as may  be approved by the Commissioner.    Sec. 207.258b  Partial payment of claim.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Whenever the Commissioner receives notice under Sec. 207.258 of  a mortgagee's intention to file an insurance claim and to assign the  mortgage to the Commissioner, the Commissioner may request the  mortgagee, in lieu of assignment, to accept partial payment of the claim  under the mortgage insurance contract and to recast the mortgage, under  such terms and conditions as the Commissioner may determine.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Commissioner may request the mortgagee to participate in a  partial payment of claim in lieu of assignment only after a  determination that partial payment would be less costy to the Federal  government than other reasonable alternatives for maintaining the low-  and moderate-income character of the project. This determination shall  be based upon the findings listed below and such other findings as the  Commissioner deems appropriate:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The mortgagee is entitled, under Sec. 207.255, to assign the  mortgage in exchange for the payment of insurance benefits;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The relief resulting from partial payment, when considered with  other resources available to the project, would be sufficient to restore  the financial viability of the project;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The project is, or can at reasonable cost be made, structurally  sound;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The management of the project is satisfactory to the  Commissioner; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The default under the insured mortgage was beyond the control of  the mortgagor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Partial payment of a claim under this section shall be made only  when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The project is, or potentially could serve as, a low- and  moderate-income housing resource;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The property covered by the mortgage is free and clear of all  liens other than the insured first mortgage and such other liens as the  Commissioner may have approved;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The mortgagee has voluntarily agreed to accept partial payment  of the insurance claim under the mortgage insurance contract and to  recast the remaining mortgage amount under terms and conditions  prescribed by the Commissioner; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The mortgagor has agreed to repay to the Commissioner an amount  equal to the partial payment, with the obligation secured by a second  mortgage on the project containing terms and conditions prescribed by  the Commissioner. The terms of the second mortgage will be determined on  a case-by-case basis to assure that the estimated project income will be  sufficient to cover estimated operating expenses and debt service on the  recast insured mortgage. The Commissioner may provide for postponed  amortization of the second mortgage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Payment of insurance benefits under this section shall be in  cash. The Commissioner shall waive the deduction of one percent of the  mortgage funds advanced to the mortgagor, provided for in  Sec. 207.259(b)(2)(iv), with respect to a partial payment of a claim  under this section. The items referred to in Sec. 207.258(b)(4) shall  either be retained by the mortgagee or delivered to the Commissioner in  accordance with instructions to be issued by the Commissioner with  respect to a partial payment of claim under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Lenders receiving a partial payment of claim following the  Commissioner's endorsement of the Mortgage for full insurance under  parts 251, 252, or 255 of this chapter, will pay HUD a fee in an amount  set forth through Federal Register notice. HUD, in its discretion, may  collect this fee or deduct the fee from any payment it makes in the  claim process.  [50 FR 38786, Sept. 25, 1985, as amended at 61 FR 49037, Sept. 17, 1996]</p>
