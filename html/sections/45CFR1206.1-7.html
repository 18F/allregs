                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The termination hearing, decision, and any review shall  be conducted in accordance with the rules of procedure in this section  and Sec. Sec. 1206.1-8 and 1206.1-9.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Presiding officer. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The presiding officer at the hearing  shall be the responsible Corporation official or, at the discretion of  the responsible Corporation official, an independent hearing examiner  designated as promptly as possible in accordance with section 3105 of  title 5 of the United States Code. The presiding officer shall conduct a  full and fair hearing, avoid delay, maintain order, and make a  sufficient record for a full and true disclosure of the facts and  issues. To accomplish these ends, the presiding officer shall have all  powers authorized by law, and he may make all procedural and evidentiary  rulings necessary for the conduct of the hearing. The hearing shall   be open to the public unless the presiding officer for good cause shown  shall otherwise determine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After the notice described in paragraph (f) of this section is  filed with the presiding officer, he shall not consult any person or  party on a fact in issue unless on written notice and opportunity for  all parties to participate. However, in performing his functions under  this part the presiding officer may use the assistance and advice of an  attorney designated by the General Counsel of the Corporation: Provided,  That the attorney designated to assist him has not represented the  Corporation or any other party or otherwise participated in a  proceeding, recommendation, or decision in the particular matter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Presentation of evidence. Both the Corporation and the recipient  are entitled to present their case by oral or documentary evidence, to  submit rebuttal evidence and to conduct such examination and cross- examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of all  facts bearing on the issues. The issues shall be those stated in the  notice required to be filed by paragraph (f) of this section, those  stipulated in a prehearing conference or those agreed to by the parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Participation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In addition to the Corporation, the  recipient, and any agency which has a right to appear, the presiding  officer in his discretion may permit the participation in the  proceedings of such persons or organizations as he deems necessary for a  proper determination of the issues involved. Such participation may be  limited to those issues or activities which the presiding officer  believes will meet the needs of the proceeding, and may be limited to  the filing of written material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any person or organization that wishes to participate in a  proceeding may apply for permission to do so from the presiding officer.  This application, which shall be made as soon as possible after the  notice of suspension or proposed termination has been received by the  recipient, shall state the applicant's interest in the proceeding, the  evidence or arguments the applicant intends to contribute, and the  necessity for the introduction of such evidence or arguments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The presiding officer shall permit or deny such participation  and shall give notice of his decision to the applicant, the recipient,  and the Corporation, and, in the case of denial, a brief statement of  the reasons for his decision: Provided however, That the presiding  officer may subsequently permit such participation if, in his opinion,  it is warranted by subsequent circumstances. If participation is  granted, the presiding officer shall notify all parties of that fact and  may, in appropriate cases, include in the notification a brief statement  of the issues as to which participation is permitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Permission to participate to any extent is not a recognition  that the participant has any interest which may be adversely affected or  that the participant may be aggrieved by any decision, but is allowed  solely for the aid and information of the presiding officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Filing. All papers and documents which are required to be filed  shall be filed with the presiding officer. Prior to filing, copies shall  be sent to the other parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notice. The responsible Corporation official shall send the  recipient and any other party a written notice which states the time,  place, nature of the hearing, the legal authority and jurisdiction under  which the hearing is to be held. The notice shall also identify with  reasonable specificity the facts relied on as justifying termination and  the Corporation requirements which it is contended the recipient has  violated. The notice shall be filed and served not later than 10 days  prior to the hearing and a copy thereof shall be filed with the  presiding officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Notice of intention to appear. The recipient and any other party  which has a right or has been granted permission to participate in the  hearing shall give written confirmation to the Corporation of its  intention to appear at the hearing 3 days before it is scheduled to  occur. Failing to do so may, at the discretion of the presiding officer,  be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Form and date of service. All papers and documents filed or sent  to party   shall be signed in ink by the appropriate party or his authorized  representative. The date on which papers are filed shall be the day on  which the papers or documents are deposited, postage prepaid in the U.S.  mail, or are delivered in person: Provided however, That the effective  date of the notice that there appear to be grounds which warrant  terminating assistance shall be the date of its delivery or attempted  delivery at the recipient's last known address as reflected in the  records of the Corporation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Prehearing conferences. Prior to the commencement of a hearing  the presiding officer may, subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)  of this section, require the parties to meet with him or correspond with  him concerning the settlement of any matter which will expedite a quick  and fair conclusion of the hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Evidence. Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to  hearings conducted pursuant to this subpart, but the presiding officer  shall apply rules or principles designed to assure production of  relevant evidence and to subject testimony to such examination and cross  examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the  facts. The presiding officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or  unduly repetitious evidence. A transcription shall be made of the oral  evidence and shall be made available to any participant upon payment of  the prescribed costs. All documents and other evidence submitted shall  be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to  refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Depositions. If the presiding officer determines that the  interests of justice would be served, he may authorize the taking of  depositions provided that all parties are afforded an opportunity to  participate in the taking of the depositions. The party who requested  the deposition shall arrange for a transcript to be made of the  proceedings and shall upon request, and at his expense, furnish all  other parties with copies of the transcript.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Official notice. Official notice may be taken of a public  document, or part of a public document, such as a statute, official  report, decision, opinion or published scientific data issued by any  agency of the Federal Government or a State or local government and such  document or data may be entered on the record without further proof of  authenticity. Official notice may also be taken of such matters as may  be judicially noticed in the courts of the United States, or any other  matter of established fact within the general knowledge of the  Corporation. If the decision of the presiding officer rests on official  notice of a material fact not appearing in evidence, a party shall on  timely request be afforded an opportunity to show the contrary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Proposed findings and conclusions. After the hearing has  concluded, but before the presiding officer makes his decision, he shall  afford each participant a reasonable opportunity to submit proposed  findings of fact and conclusions. After considering each proposed  finding or conclusion the presiding officer shall state in his decision  whether he has accepted or rejected them in accordance with the  provisions of Sec. 1206.1-8(a).</p>
