                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whenever you treat, store, or dispose of hazardous remediation  wastes in a manner that requires a RCRA permit under Sec.  270.1, you  must either obtain:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A RCRA permit according to Sec. Sec.  270.3 through 270.66; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A RAP according to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Treatment units that use combustion of hazardous remediation  wastes at a remediation waste management site are not eligible for RAPs  under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)(iv)</em> do not apply; instead, you must submit the  information required under Sec.  270.110. When your permit is modified  the RAP becomes part of the RCRA permit. Therefore when your permit  (including the RAP portion) is modified, revoked and reissued,  terminated or when it expires, it will be modified according to the  applicable requirements in Sec. Sec.  270.40 through 270.42, revoked and  reissued according to the applicable requirements in Sec. Sec.  270.41  and 270.43, terminated according to the applicable requirements in Sec.   270.43, and expire according to the applicable requirements in  Sec. Sec.  270.50 and 270.51.</p>
