                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Cooperator may appeal the determinations of the Deputy  Administrator to the Administrator. An appeal must be in writing and be  submitted to the Office of the Administrator within 30 days following  the date of the initial determination by the Deputy Administrator or the  determination on reconsideration. The Cooperator may request a hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the Cooperator submits its appeal and requests a hearing, the  Administrator, or the Administrator's designee, will set a date and  time, generally within 60 days. The hearing will be an informal  proceeding. A transcript will not ordinarily be prepared unless the  Cooperator bears the cost of a transcript; however, the Administrator  may have a transcript prepared at FAS's expense.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Administrator will base the determination on appeal upon  information contained in the administrative record and will endeavor to  make a determination within 60 days after submission of the appeal,  hearing, or receipt of any transcript, whichever is later. The  determination of the Administrator will be the final determination of  FAS. The Cooperator must exhaust all administrative remedies contained  in this section before pursuing judicial review of a determination by  the Administrator.</p>
