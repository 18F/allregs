                                Sec. 19.490  Numbering of packages and cases filled in processing.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Packages of spirits and denatured spirits filled during  processing operations. When a proprietor fills packages of spirits and  denatured spirits during processing, the proprietor must identify the  packages consecutively beginning with ``1'' and continuing the series  until the number ``1,000,000'' is reached, except that any series of  such numbers already in use may be continued to that limit. When the  identification in any series reaches ``1,000,000'', the proprietor may  begin a new series with ``1'' but must add an alphabetical prefix or  suffix to the new series number. For example, the first identifier in  the second series of 1,000,000 packages filled might be ``1A'' or  ``A1''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cases containing bottles or other containers of spirits and  denatured spirits. When a proprietor fills cases containing bottles or  other containers of spirits and denatured spirits during processing, the  proprietor must identify the cases consecutively beginning with ``1''  and continuing the series until the number ``1,000,000'' is reached,  except that any series of such numbers already in use may be continued  to that limit. When the identification in any series reaches  ``1,000,000'', the proprietor may begin a new series with ``1''. This  series of identifiers for cases containing bottles or other containers  must be distinct from the series of serial numbers required for packages  under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Additional identification. A proprietor may establish separate  series of identifiers, distinguished from each other by the use of  alphabetical prefixes or suffixes, to identify the size of bottles, the  brand names, or other information, on written notice to the appropriate  TTB officer. The proprietor must identify remnant cases by placing the  identifier of the last full case followed by the letter ``R'' on the  remnant case. When there is a change in the name, or trade name of the  proprietor, all series in use may be continued. However, if there is a  change in   proprietorship, a new series must be commenced.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Alternative marking for spirits for industrial use. A proprietor  may mark packages and cases of spirits for industrial use, including  denatured spirits, filled in processing with the lot identification  numbers specified in Sec. 19.485 instead of using the identifiers  specified in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section.
