Other types of event recorders,  if installed, shall be inspected, maintained, and tested in accordance  with instructions of the manufacturer, supplier, or owner thereof and in  accordance with the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A written or electronic copy of the instructions in use shall be  kept at the point where the work is performed and a hard-copy version,  written in the English language, shall be made available upon request to  FRA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The event recorder shall be tested before any maintenance work  is performed on it. At a minimum, the event recorder test shall include  cycling, as practicable, all required recording elements and determining  the full range of each element by reading out recorded data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the pre-maintenance test reveals that the device is not  recording all the specified data and that all recordings are within the  designed recording elements, this fact shall be noted, and maintenance  and testing shall be performed as necessary until a subsequent test is  successful.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When a successful test is accomplished, a copy of the data- verification results shall be maintained in any medium with the  maintenance records for the locomotive until the next one is filed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A railroad's event recorder periodic maintenance shall be  considered effective if 90 percent of the recorders on locomotives  inbound for periodic inspection in any given calendar month are still  fully functional; maintenance practices and test intervals shall be  adjusted as necessary to yield effective periodic maintenance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Remote control locomotive. Remote control locomotive system  components that interface with the mechanical devices of the locomotive  shall be tested including, but not limited to, air pressure monitoring  devices, pressure switches, and speed sensors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Alerters. The alerter shall be tested, and all automatic timing  resets shall function as intended.
