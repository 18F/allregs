                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 970.4403 insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Contractor Purchasing System (JAN 2013)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The Contractor shall develop, implement, and maintain  formal policies, practices, and procedures to be used in the award of  subcontracts consistent with this clause and 48 CFR subpart 970.44. The  Contractor's purchasing system and methods shall be fully documented,  consistently applied, and acceptable to the Department of Energy (DOE)  in accordance with 48 CFR 970.4401-1. The Contractor shall maintain file  documentation which is appropriate to the value of the purchase and is  adequate to establish the propriety of the transaction and the price  paid. The Contractor's purchasing performance will be evaluated against  such performance criteria and measures as may be set forth elsewhere in  this contract. DOE reserves the right at any time to require that the  Contractor submit for approval any or all purchases under this contract.  The Contractor shall not purchase any item or service, the purchase of  which is expressly prohibited by the written direction of DOE, and shall  use such special and directed sources as may be expressly required by  the DOE Contracting Officer. DOE will conduct periodic appraisals of the  Contractor's management of all facets of the purchasing function,  including the Contractor's compliance with its approved system and  methods. Such appraisals will be performed through the conduct of  Contractor Purchasing System Reviews in accordance with 48 CFR subpart  44.3, or, when approved by the Contracting Officer, through the  Contractor's participation in the conduct of the Balanced Scorecard  performance measurement and performance management system. The  Contractor's approved purchasing system and methods shall include the  requirements set forth in paragraphs (b) through (y) of this clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Acquisition of utility services. Utility services shall be  acquired in accordance with the requirements of 48 CFR subpart 970.41.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Acquisition of real property. Real property shall be acquired in  accordance with 48 CFR subpart 917.74.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Advance notice of proposed subcontract awards. Advance notice  shall be provided in accordance with 48 CFR 970.4401-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Audit of subcontractors. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Contractor shall provide for--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Periodic post-award audit of cost-reimbursement subcontractors  at all tiers; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Audits, where necessary, to provide a valid basis for pre-award  or cost or price analysis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Responsibility for determining the costs allowable under each  cost-reimbursement subcontract remains with the contractor or next  higher-tier subcontractor. The Contractor shall provide, in appropriate  cases, for the timely involvement of the Contractor and the DOE  Contracting Officer in resolution of subcontract cost allowability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where audits of subcontractors at any tier are required,  arrangements may be made to have the cognizant Federal agency perform  the audit of the subcontract. These arrangements shall be made  administratively between DOE and the other agency involved and shall  provide for the cognizant agency to audit in an appropriate manner in  light of the magnitude and nature of the subcontract. In no case,  however, shall these arrangements preclude determination by the DOE  Contracting Officer of the allowability or unallowability of  subcontractor costs claimed for reimbursement by the Contractor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Allowable costs for cost reimbursable subcontracts are to be  determined in accordance with the cost principles of 48 CFR Part 31,  appropriate for the type of organization to which the subcontract is to  be awarded, as supplemented by 48 CFR part 931. Allowable costs in the  purchase or transfer from contractor-affiliated sources shall be  determined in accordance with 48 CFR 970.4402-3 and 48 CFR 31.205-26(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Bonds and insurance. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Contractor shall require  performance bonds in penal amounts as set forth in 48 CFR 28.102-2(a)  for all fixed-priced and unit-priced construction subcontracts in excess  of $100,000. The Contractor shall consider the use of performance bonds  in fixed-price non-construction subcontracts, where appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For fixed-price, unit-priced and cost reimbursement construction  subcontracts in excess of $100,000, a payment bond shall be obtained on  Standard Form 25A modified to name the Contractor as well as the United  States of America as obligees. The penal amounts shall be determined in  accordance with 48 CFR 28.102-2(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For fixed-price, unit-priced and cost-reimbursement construction  subcontracts greater than $25,000, but not greater than $100,000, the  Contractor shall select two or more of the payment protections at 48 CFR  28.102-1(b), giving particular consideration to the inclusion of an  irrevocable letter of credit as one of the selected alternatives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A subcontractor may have more than one acceptable surety in both  construction and other subcontracts, provided that in no case will the  liability of any one surety exceed the maximum penal sum for which it is  qualified for any one obligation. For subcontracts other than  construction, a co-surety (two or more sureties together) may reinsure  amounts in excess of their individual capacity, with each surety having  the required underwriting capacity that appears on the list of  acceptable corporate sureties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Buy American. The Contractor shall comply with the provisions of  the Buy American Act as reflected in 48 CFR 52.225-1 and 48 CFR 52.225- 9. The Contractor shall forward determinations of non-availability of  individual items to the DOE Contracting Officer for approval. Items in  excess of $100,000 require the prior concurrence of the Head of  Contracting Activity. If, however, the Contractor has an approved  purchasing system, the Head of the Contracting Activity may authorize  the Contractor to make determinations of non-availability for individual  items valued at $100,000 or less.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Construction and architect-engineer subcontracts. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Independent Estimates. A detailed, independent estimate of costs shall  be prepared for all construction work to be subcontracted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specifications. Specifications for construction shall be  prepared in accordance with the DOE publication entitled ``General  Design Criteria Manual.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Prevention of conflict of interest. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Contractor shall not  award a subcontract for construction to the architect-engineer firm or  an affiliate that prepared the design. This prohibition does not  preclude the award of a ``turnkey'' subcontract so long as the  subcontractor assumes all liability for defects in design and  construction and consequential damages.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Contractor shall not award both a cost-reimbursement  subcontract and a fixed-price subcontract for construction or architect- engineer services or any combination thereof to the same firm where  those subcontracts will be performed at the same site.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Contractor shall not employ the construction subcontractor  or an affiliate to inspect the firm's work. The contractor shall assure  that the working relationships of the construction subcontractor and the  subcontractor inspecting its work and the authority of the inspector are  clearly defined.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Contractor-affiliated sources. Equipment, materials, supplies,  or services from a contractor-affiliated source shall be purchased or  transferred in accordance with 48 CFR 970.4402-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Contractor-subcontractor relationship. The obligations of the  Contractor under paragraph (a) of this clause, including the development  of the purchasing system and methods, and purchases made pursuant  thereto, shall not relieve the Contractor of any obligation under this  contract (including, among other things, the obligation to properly  supervise, administer, and coordinate the work of subcontractors).  Subcontracts shall be in the name of the Contractor, and shall not bind  or purport to bind the Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Government Property. The Contractor shall establish and maintain  a property management system that complies with criteria in 48 CFR  970.5245-1, Property, and 48 CFR 52.245-1, Government Property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Indemnification. Except for Price-Anderson Nuclear Hazards  Indemnity, no subcontractor may be indemnified except with the prior  approval of the Senior Procurement Executive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Leasing of motor vehicles. Contractors shall comply with 48 CFR  subpart 8.11 and 48 CFR subpart 908.11.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Management, acquisition and use of information resources.  Requirements for automatic data processing resources and  telecommunications facilities, services, and equipment, shall be  reviewed and approved in accordance with applicable DOE Orders and  regulations regarding information resources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Priorities, allocations and allotments. Priorities, allocations  and allotments shall be extended to appropriate subcontracts in  accordance with the clause or clauses of this contract dealing with  priorities and allocations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Purchase of special items. Purchase of the following items shall  be in accordance with the following provisions of 48 CFR subpart 8.5, 48  CFR subpart 908.71, Federal Management Regulation 41 CFR part 102, and  the Federal Property Management Regulation 41 CFR chapter 101:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Motor vehicles--48 CFR 908.7101</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Aircraft--48 CFR 908.7102</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Security Cabinets--48 CFR 908.7106</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Alcohol--48 CFR 908.7107</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Helium--48 CFR subpart 8.5</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Fuels and packaged petroleum products--48 CFR 908.7109</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Coal--48 CFR 908.7110</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Arms and Ammunition--48 CFR 908.7111</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Heavy Water--48 CFR 908.7121(a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Precious Metals--48 CFR 908.7121(b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Lithium--48 CFR 908.7121(c)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Products and services of the blind and severely handicapped--41  CFR 101-26.701</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Products made in Federal penal and correctional institutions-- 41 CFR 101-26.702.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Purchase versus lease determinations. Contractors shall  determine whether required equipment and property should be purchased or  leased, and establish appropriate thresholds for application of lease  versus purchase determinations. Such determinations shall be made--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At time of original acquisition;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When lease renewals are being considered; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> At other times as circumstances warrant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> Quality assurance. Contractors shall provide no less protection  for the Government in its subcontracts than is provided in the prime  contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(t)</em> Setoff of assigned subcontractor proceeds.

When subcontracts are terminated for reasons other  than termination of this contract, the Contractor shall settle such  subcontracts in general conformity with the policies and principles in  48 CFR subparts 49.1, 49.2, 49.3 and 49.4. Each such termination shall  be documented and consistent with the terms of this contract.
