                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements.

The terms ``light'' or ``lite'' may be used on  the label or in the labeling of foods, except meal products as defined  in Sec. 101.13(l) and main dish products as defined in Sec. 101.13(m),  without further qualification, provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the food derives less than 50 percent of its calories from  fat:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The number of calories is reduced by at least one-third (33\1/3\  percent) per reference amount customarily consumed compared to an  appropriate reference food; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Its fat content is reduced by 50 percent or more per reference  amount customarily consumed compared to the reference food that it  resembles or for which it substitutes as specified in Sec. 101.13(j)(1);

regular cheesecake--300 calories, 8 g fat  per serving'') is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to  the nutrition label, except that if the nutrition label is on the  information panel, the quantitative information may be located elsewhere  on the information panel in accordance with Sec. 101.2;

and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The attribute (e.g., ``color'' or ``texture'') is in the same  style, color, and at least one-half the type size as the word ``light''  and in immediate proximity thereto.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If a manufacturer can demonstrate that the word ``light'' has  been associated, through common use, with a particular food to reflect a  physical or organoleptic attribute (e.g., light brown sugar, light corn  syrup, or light molasses) to the point where it has become part of the  statement of identity, such use of the term ``light'' shall not be  considered a nutrient content claim subject to the requirements in this  part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The term ``lightly salted'' may be used on a product to which  has been added 50 percent less sodium than is normally added to the  reference food as described in Sec. 101.13(j)(1)(i)(B) and  (j)(1)(ii)(B), provided that if the product is not ``low in sodium'' as  defined in Sec. 101.61(b)(4), the statement ``not a low sodium food,''  shall appear adjacent to the nutrition label of the food bearing the  claim, or, if the nutrition label is on the information panel, it may  appear elsewhere on the information panel in accordance with Sec. 101.2  and the information required to accompany a relative claim shall appear  on the label or labeling as specified in Sec. 101.13(j)(2).
