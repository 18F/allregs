                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Termination of Participation. If the FDIC, in its discretion,  after consultation with the participating entity's appropriate Federal  banking agency, determines that the participating entity should no  longer be permitted to continue to participate in the temporary  liquidity guarantee program, the FDIC will inform the entity that it  will no longer be provided the protections of the temporary liquidity  guarantee program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Termination of participation in the temporary liquidity  guarantee program will solely have prospective effect. All previously  issued guaranteed debt will continue to be guaranteed as set forth in  this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The FDIC will work with the participating entity and its  appropriate Federal banking agency to assure that the entity notifies  its counterparties or creditors that subsequent debt issuances are not  covered by the temporary liquidity guarantee program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b))</em>.  The violation of any provision of the program by an insured depository  institution also constitutes grounds for terminating the institution's  deposit insurance under section 8(a)(2) of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C.  1818(a)(2)). The appropriate Federal banking agency for the  participating entity will consult with the FDIC in enforcing the  provisions of this part. The appropriate Federal banking agency and the  FDIC also have enforcement authority under section 18(a)(4)(C) of the  FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(a)(4)(C)) to pursue an enforcement action if a  person knowingly misrepresents that any deposit liability, obligation,  certificate, or share is insured when it is not in fact insured.</p>
