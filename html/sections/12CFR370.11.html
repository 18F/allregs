                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Termination of Participation. If the FDIC, in its discretion, after consultation with the participating entity's appropriate Federal banking agency, determines that the participating entity should no longer be permitted to continue to participate in the temporary liquidity guarantee program, the FDIC will inform the entity that it will no longer be provided the protections of the temporary liquidity guarantee program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Termination of participation in the temporary liquidity guarantee program will solely have prospective effect. All previously issued guaranteed debt will continue to be guaranteed as set forth in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The FDIC will work with the participating entity and its appropriate Federal banking agency to assure that the entity notifies its counterparties or creditors that subsequent debt issuances are not covered by the temporary liquidity guarantee program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Enforcement Actions. Violating any provision of the temporary liquidity guarantee program constitutes a violation of a regulation and may subject the participating entity and its institution-affiliated parties to enforcement actions under Section 8 of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1818), including, for example, assessment of civil money penalties under section 8(i) of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1818(i)), removal and prohibition orders under section 8(e) of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1818(e)), and cease and desist orders under section 8(b) of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1818(b)). The violation of any provision of the program by an insured depository institution also constitutes grounds for terminating the institution's deposit insurance under section 8(a)(2) of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1818(a)(2)). The appropriate Federal banking agency for the participating entity will consult with the FDIC in enforcing the provisions of this part. The appropriate Federal banking agency and the FDIC also have enforcement authority under section 18(a)(4)(C) of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(a)(4)(C)) to pursue an enforcement action if a person knowingly misrepresents that any deposit liability, obligation, certificate, or share is insured when it is not in fact insured.</p>
