                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Your objective in setting a goal is to estimate the percentage  of the base calculated under Sec. Sec. 23.47-23.49 that would be  performed by ACDBEs in the absence of discrimination and its effects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This percentage is the estimated ACDBE participation that would  occur if there were a ``level playing field'' for firms to work as  concessionaires for your airport.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In conducting this goal setting process, you are determining the  extent, if any, to which the firms in your market area have suffered  discrimination or its effects in connection with concession  opportunities or related business opportunities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must complete the goal-setting process separately for each  of the two overall goals identified in Sec. 23.41 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each overall concessions goal must be based on demonstrable  evidence of the availability of ready, willing and able ACDBEs relative  to all businesses ready, willing and able to participate in your ACDBE  program (hereafter, the ``relative availability of ACDBEs'').</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You cannot simply rely on the 10 percent national aspirational  goal, your previous overall goal, or past ACDBE participation rates in  your program without reference to the relative availability of ACDBEs in  your market.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Your market area is defined by the geographical area in which  the substantial majority of firms which seek to do concessions business  with the airport are located and the geographical area in which the  firms which receive the substantial majority of concessions-related  revenues are located. Your market area may be different for different  types of concessions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Step 1. You must begin your goal setting process by determining  a base figure for the relative availability of ACDBEs. The following are  examples of approaches that you may take toward determining a base  figure. These examples are provided as a starting point for your goal  setting process. Any percentage figure derived from one of these  examples should be considered a basis from which you begin when  examining the evidence available to you. These examples are not intended  as an exhaustive list. Other methods or combinations of methods to  determine a base figure may be used, subject to approval by the FAA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use DBE Directories and Census Bureau Data. Determine the number  of ready, willing and able ACDBEs in your market area from your ACDBE  directory. Using the Census Bureau's County Business Pattern (CBP) data  base, determine the number of all ready, willing and able businesses  available in your market area that perform work in the same NAICS codes.  (Information about the CBP data base may be obtained from the Census  Bureau at their Web site, http://www.census.gov/epcd/cbp/view/ cbpview.html.) Divide the number of ACDBEs by the number of all  businesses to derive a base figure for the relative availability of  ACDBEs in your market area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use an Active Participants List. Determine the number of ACDBEs  that have participated or attempted to participate in your airport  concessions program in previous years. Determine the number of all  businesses that have participated or attempted to participate in your  airport concession program in previous years. Divide the number of  ACDBEs who have participated or attempted to participate by the number  for all businesses to derive a base figure for the relative availability  of ACDBEs in your market area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Use data from a disparity study. Use a percentage figure derived  from data in a valid, applicable disparity study.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Use the goal of another recipient. If another airport or other  DOT recipient in the same, or substantially similar,   market has set an overall goal in compliance with this rule, you may use  that goal as a base figure for your goal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Alternative methods. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You may use other methods to determine  a base figure for your overall goal. Any methodology you choose must be  based on demonstrable evidence of local market conditions and be  designed to ultimately attain a goal that is rationally related to the  relative availability of ACDBEs in your market area.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a car rental goal, where it appears that all or  most of the goal is likely to be met through the purchases by car rental  companies of vehicles or other goods or services from ACDBEs, one  permissible alternative is to structure the goal entirely in terms of  purchases of goods and services. In this case, you would calculate your  car rental overall goal by dividing the estimated dollar value of such  purchases from ACDBEs by the total estimated dollar value of all  purchases to be made by car rental companies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Step 2. Once you have calculated a base figure, you must examine  all relevant evidence reasonably available in your jurisdiction to  determine what adjustment, if any, is needed to the base figure in order  to arrive at your overall goal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There are many types of evidence that must be considered when  adjusting the base figure. These include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The current capacity of ACDBEs to perform work in your  concessions program, as measured by the volume of work ACDBEs have  performed in recent years; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Evidence from disparity studies conducted anywhere within your  jurisdiction, to the extent it is not already accounted for in your base  figure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If your base figure is the goal of another recipient, you must  adjust it for differences in your market area and your concessions  program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If available, you must consider evidence from related fields  that affect the opportunities for ACDBEs to form, grow and compete.  These include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Statistical disparities in the ability of ACDBEs to get the  financing, bonding and insurance required to participate in your  program;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Data on employment, self-employment, education, training and  union apprenticeship programs, to the extent you can relate it to the  opportunities for ACDBEs to perform in your program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If you attempt to make an adjustment to your base figure to  account for the continuing effects of past discrimination, or the  effects of an ongoing ACDBE program, the adjustment must be based on  demonstrable evidence that is logically and directly related to the  effect for which the adjustment is sought.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Among the information you submit with your overall goal (see  23.45(e)), you must include description of the methodology you used to  establish the goal, including your base figure and the evidence with  which it was calculated, as well as the adjustments you made to the base  figure and the evidence relied on for the adjustments. You should also  include a summary listing of the relevant available evidence in your  jurisdiction and an explanation of how you used that evidence to adjust  your base figure. You must also include your projection of the portions  of the overall goal you expect to meet through race-neutral and race- conscious measures, respectively (see Sec. Sec. 26.51(c)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You are not required to obtain prior FAA concurrence with your  overall goal (i.e., with the number itself). However, if the FAA's  review suggests that your overall goal has not been correctly  calculated, or that your method for calculating goals is inadequate, the  FAA may, after consulting with you, adjust your overall goal or require  that you do so. The adjusted overall goal is binding on you.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If you need additional time to collect data or take other steps  to develop an approach to setting overall goals, you may request the  approval of the FAA Administrator for an interim goal and/or goal- setting mechanism. Such a mechanism must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reflect the relative availability of ACDBEs in your local market  area to the maximum extent feasible given the data available to you; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Avoid imposing undue burdens on non-ACDBEs.</p>
