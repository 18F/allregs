A low-volume facility is an  ESRD facility that, as determined based on the documentation submitted  pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Furnished less than 4,000 treatments in each of the 3 cost  reporting years (based on as-filed or final settled 12-consecutive month  cost reports, whichever is most recent) preceding the payment year; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Has not opened, closed, or received a new provider number due to  a change in ownership in the 3 cost reporting years (based on as-filed  or final settled 12-consecutive month cost reports, whichever is most  recent) preceding the payment year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For the purpose of determining the number of treatments under  paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the number of treatments considered  furnished by the ESRD facility shall equal the aggregate number of  treatments furnished by the ESRD facility and the number of treatments  furnished by other ESRD facilities that are both:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Under common ownership with, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 25 miles or less from the ESRD facility in question.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The determination under paragraph (c) of this section does not  apply to an ESRD facility that was in existence and certified for  Medicare participation prior January 1, 2011.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Common ownership means the same individual, individuals, entity,  or entities, directly, or indirectly, own 5 percent or more of each ESRD  facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, to receive  the low-volume adjustment an ESRD facility must provide an attestation  statement, by November 1st of each year preceding the payment year, to  its Medicare Administrative Contractor that the facility meets all the  criteria established in this section, except that, for calendar year  2012, the attestation must be provided by January 3, 2012, and for,  calendar year 2015, the attestation must be provided by December 31,  2014.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The low-volume adjustment applies only for dialysis treatments  provided to adults (18 years or older).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> To receive the low-volume adjustment, an ESRD facility must  include in their attestation provided pursuant to paragraph (f) of this  section a statement that the ESRD facility meets the definition of a  low-volume facility in paragraph (b) of this section. To determine  eligibility for the low-volume adjustment, the Medicare Administrative  Contractor (MAC) on behalf of CMS relies upon as filed or final settled  12-consecutive month cost reports for the 3 cost reporting years  preceding the payment year to verify the number of treatments, except  that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of a hospital-based ESRD facility as defined in  Sec. 413.174(c), the MAC relies upon the attestation submitted pursuant  to paragraph (f) of this section and may consider other supporting data  in addition to the total treatments reported in each of the 12- consecutive month cost reports for the 3 cost reporting years preceding  the payment year to verify the number of treatments that were furnished  by the individual hospital-based ESRD facility seeking the adjustment;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of an ESRD facility that has undergone a change of  ownership that does not result in a new Provider Transaction Access  Number for the ESRD facility, the MAC relies upon the attestation and  when the change of ownership results in two non-standard cost reporting  periods (less than or greater than 12-consecutive months), does one or  both of the following for the 3 cost reporting years preceding the  payment year to verify the number of treatments:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Combines the two non-standard cost reporting periods of less  than 12 months to equal a full 12-consecutive month period; and/or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Combines the two non-standard cost reporting periods that in  combination may exceed 12-consecutive months and prorates the data to  equal a full 12-consecutive month period.
