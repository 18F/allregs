                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Initiation and purposes. In any proceeding the Commission or the  presiding officer may, with or without motion, upon due notice as to  time and place, direct the participants in a proceeding to appear for a  prehearing conference for the purposes of considering all possible ways  of expediting the proceeding, including those in paragraph (d) of this  section. It is the intent of the Commission to issue its advisory  opinion on requests under section 3661 of the Act with the utmost  practicable expedition. The Commission directs that these prehearing  procedures shall be rigorously pursued by the presiding officer and all  participants to that end.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Informal off-the-record procedures. In order to make the  prehearing conference as effective as possible, the presiding officer  may, in his/her discretion, direct that conferences be held off   the record at the beginning of a prehearing conference or at other  appropriate times, without the presiding officer being present. Such  informal off-the-record conferences shall be presided over by the  Commission's officer designated to represent the interests of the  general public or such other person as the participants may select. At  such off-the-record conferences the participants shall be expected to  reach agreement on those matters which will expedite the proceeding,  including the matters specified in the notice of the prehearing  conference, in the ruling of the presiding officer directing that the  off-the-record conference be held and in paragraph (d) of this section.  A report on the results of such off-the-record conference shall be made  to the presiding officer on the record at a time specified by the  presiding officer and he/she shall then determine the further prehearing  procedures to be followed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Required preparation and cooperation of all parties. All  participants in any proceeding before the Commission are required and  expected to come to the prehearing conference fully prepared to discuss  in detail and resolve all matters specified in paragraph (d) of this  section, and notice of the prehearing conference, and such other notice  or agenda as may have been issued by the Commission or the presiding  officer. All participants are required and expected to cooperate fully  at all stages of the proceeding to achieve these objectives, through  thorough advance preparation for the prehearing conference, including  informal communications between the participants, requests for discovery  and appropriate discovery procedures at the earliest possible time and  no later than at the prehearing conference, and the commencement of  preparation of evidence and cross-examination. The failure of any  participant to appear at the prehearing conference or to raise any  matters that could reasonably be anticipated and resolved at the  prehearing conference shall not be permitted to unduly delay the  progress of the proceeding and shall constitute a waiver of the rights  of the participant with regard thereto, including all objections to the  agreements reached, actions taken, or rulings issued by the presiding  officer with regard thereto.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Matters to be pursued. At the prehearing conference in any  proceeding, the presiding officer and the participants shall consider  and resolve the following matters:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The definition and simplification of the issues including any  appropriate explanation, clarification, or amendment of any proposal,  filing, evidence, complaint or other pleading filed by any participant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Arrangement for timely completion of discovery from the Postal  Service or any other participant concerning information desired by any  participant with regard to any issues in the proceeding or prior  filings, evidence or pleadings of any participant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Agreement as to procedures for timely discovery with regard to  any future evidentiary filings of any participant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Stipulations, admissions or concessions as to evidentiary facts,  and agreements as to documentary matters, exhibits and matters of  official notice, which will avoid unnecessary proof or dispute;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Grouping parties with substantially like interests for purposes  of presenting evidence, making and arguing motions and objections,  cross-examining witnesses, filing briefs, and presenting oral argument  to the Commission or presiding officer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Disclosure of the number, identity and qualifications of  witnesses, and the nature of their testimony, particularly with respect  to the policies of the Act and, as applicable according to the nature of  the proceeding;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Limitation of the scope of the evidence and the number of  witnesses to eliminate irrelevant, immaterial, or cumulative and  repetitious evidence;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Procedures to direct and control the use of discovery prior to  the hearing and submission of written testimony and exhibits on matters  in dispute so as to restrict to a bare minimum the amount of hearing  time required for oral cross-examination of witnesses;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Division of the proceeding where practicable into two or more  phases for separate simultaneous hearings;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Fixing dates for the submission and service of such written  testimony and exhibits as may be appropriate in advance of the hearing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Order of presentation of the evidence and cross-examination of  witnesses so that the hearing may proceed in the most expeditious and  orderly manner possible; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> All other matters which would aid in an expeditious disposition  of the proceeding, including consent of the participants to the conduct  of the entire proceedings off the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Rulings by presiding officer. The presiding officer at such  prehearing conference, irrespective of the consent of the participants,  shall dispose of by ruling (1) any of the procedural matters itemized in  paragraph (d) of this section and (2) such other procedural matters on  which he/she is authorized to rule during the course of the hearing if  ruling at this stage would expedite the proceeding. Either on the record  at the conclusion of such prehearing conference, or by order issued  shortly thereafter, the presiding officer shall state the agreements  reached by the participants, the actions taken, and the rulings made by  the presiding officer. Such rulings shall control the subsequent course  of the proceedings unless modified at the hearing to prevent manifest  injustice.
