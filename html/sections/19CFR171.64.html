                            <p class="depth0">The deciding Customs official always reserves the right to require a  waiver of the statute of limitations executed by the claimants to the  property or charged party or parties as a condition precedent before  accepting a supplemental petition in any case in which less than one  year remains before the statute will be available as a defense to all or  part of that case.    Sec. Appendix A to Part 171--Guidelines for Disposition of Violations of</p><p class="depth0">19 U.S.C. 1497</p><p class="depth0">Liabilities incurred under section 497, Tariff Act of 1930 (19  U.S.C. 1497), shall be mitigated or remitted in accordance with the  following guidelines (see also part 148, Customs Regulations):</p><p class="depth0">I. Violations Involving Dutiable Articles. For violations involving  articles subject to duty and for which there is no applicable exemption  from duty, the following rules apply:</p><p class="depth0">1. Mitigated Penalty for First Offense. For violations which are the  first offense, where there is knowledge of the declaration requirements,  and where the undeclared articles are discovered by the Customs  officers, the liabilities shall be remitted upon payment of Three Times  the Duty (but not less than $50), or the domestic value, whichever is  lower.</p><p class="depth0">2. Mitigating Factors. When one or more of the following mitigating  factors are present, the deciding officer may, within his discretion,  remit the liabilities upon payment of Between One and One-Half and Three  Times the Duty or the domestic value, whichever is lower:</p><p class="depth0">a. Communications with the violator are impaired because of language  barrier, mental condition, or physical ailment;</p><p class="depth0">b. Violator cooperates with Customs officers after discovery of the  violation by providing additional information which facilitates  conclusion of the case;</p><p class="depth0">c. Violator is an inexperienced traveler;</p><p class="depth0">d. There is contributory Customs error (for example, violator  demonstrates he was given incorrect advice by a Customs officer).</p><p class="depth0">3. Aggravating Factors. When one or more of the following  aggravating factors are present, the deciding officer may, within his   discretion, remit the liabilities upon payment of Between Three and Six  Times the Duty (but not less than $100), or the domestic value,  whichever is lower:</p><p class="depth0">a. Documentary or other evidence discovered establishes violator's  intent;</p><p class="depth0">b. Informant provides information which tends to establish  violator's intent and leads to discovery of the violation after the  violator has been given an opportunity to properly declare;</p><p class="depth0">c. Violator is an experienced traveler;</p><p class="depth0">d. Undeclared articles are concealed to evade U.S. law;</p><p class="depth0">e. There is behavior, including extreme lack of cooperation, verbal  or physical abuse, or attempted escape, which tends to demonstrate a  lack of respect for law and authority.</p><p class="depth0">4. Commercial Articles. When the undeclared articles are brought in  for commercial purposes, the liabilities shall be remitted upon the  payment of Six Times the Duty (but not less than $100), or the domestic  value, whichever is lower. Mitigating factors may be used to lower this  amount to as little as Three Times the Duty; aggravating factors may be  used to increase this amount up to Eight Times the Duty.</p><p class="depth0">5. Extraordinary Mitigating Factor.</p><p class="depth0">a. When an individual who has been cleared through Customs without  discovery of any undeclared article returns to the examination area and  declares that article, the deciding officer may, within his discretion,  remit the liabilities upon payment of One Times the Duty.</p><p class="depth0">b. An individual who declares articles some time later (hours, days,  weeks, etc.) may be treated similarly.</p><p class="depth0">6. Extraordinary Aggravating Factors.</p><p class="depth0">a. When the offense is a second or subsequent violation, the  deciding officer may, within his discretion, remit the liabilities upon  payment of Between Six and Eight Times the Duty (but not less than  $250), or the domestic value, whichever is lower.</p><p class="depth0">b. When the offense is a second or subsequent violation, and there  are aggravating factors present, generally there shall either be a  denial of relief or mitigation to No Less Than Eight Times the Duty or  the domestic value, whichever is lower.</p><p class="depth0">c. When there is evidence of an ongoing scheme to defraud the  revenue involving multiple entries without declaration of articles  subject to declaration, the deciding officer shall act in accordance  with the preceding paragraph.</p><p class="depth0">II. Violations Involving Absolutely or Conditionally Free Articles.  For violations involving articles either entitled to entry free of duty  absolutely (classifiable under a duty-free provision in Chapters 1-97,  Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS); (19 U.S.C.  1202)), or entry free of duty conditionally (entitled to treatment under  the Generalized System of Preferences (see Sec. Sec. 10.171-10.178,  Customs Regulations) or Chapter 98, HTSUS), the following rules apply:</p><p class="depth0">1. Mitigated Penalty for First Offense.</p><p class="depth0">a. For violations which are first offense, and involve articles  entitled to the benefit of GSP or Chapter 98, HTSUS, the liabilities  shall be remitted upon payment of One Times the Duty which would have  been due if the articles had not been entitled to the benefit.</p><p class="depth0">b. For violations which are first offense, and involve absolutely  duty-free articles, the liabilities shall be remitted upon payment of  Between One and Five Percent of the Domestic Value, but not less than  $50 (or the domestic value, whichever is less) nor more than $1,000.</p><p class="depth0">2. Mitigating Factors. When mitigating factors such as those  outlined above are present, the deciding officer may, in his discretion,  reduce the mitigated amount to a lower figure.</p><p class="depth0">3. Aggravating Factors.</p><p class="depth0">a. When aggravating factors such as those outlined above are  present, the deciding officer may, in his discretion, remit the  liabilities for conditionally free articles upon the payment of Between  One and Two Times the Duty (but not less than $100), or the domestic  value, whichever is lower.</p><p class="depth0">b. For absolutely free articles, the deciding officer may remit the  liabilities upon payment of Between Five and Ten Percent of the Domestic  Value, but not less than $100.</p><p class="depth0">4. Commercial Merchandise.</p><p class="depth0">The fact that undeclared duty-free articles are imported for  commercial purposes may be considered an aggravating factor under  section II.3. of these guidelines.</p><p class="depth0">III. Other Applicable Rules.</p><p class="depth0">1. These guidelines provide a framework and procedure by which  violations of 19 U.S.C. 1497 are to be analyzed. They are not mandatory  in the sense that they must be absolutely applied. Customs officers  varying from these guidelines must provide reasons for doing so in the  case record.</p><p class="depth0">2. Customs officers shall document mitigating and aggravating  factors found in each case in the case file. There must be a basis shown  for mitigated amounts.</p><p class="depth0">3. It is intended that mitigating and aggravating factors shall be  considered together and used to offset each other where appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">4. The rate of duty to be used in calculating the mitigated penalty  shall be the appropriate rate from Chapters 1-97, HTSUS, and not the  flat rate from Chapter 98, HTSUS.</p><p class="depth0">5. ``Duty'' means Customs duties and any internal revenue taxes  which would have attached upon importation (see section 101.1(i),  Customs Regulations). Therefore, multiples   will also be applied to internal revenue taxes which would have been  due.</p><p class="depth0">6. Customs officers may, within their discretion, consider other  factors not here delineated as aggravating or mitigating and apply the  guidelines accordingly. These additional factors must also be documented  in the case file.</p><p class="depth0">7. These guidelines are not authority for admitting into the  commerce of the United States articles which are conditionally or  absolutely prohibited from entry.</p><p class="depth0">8. The presence of one or more extraordinary aggravating factors,  including but not limited to those set forth in section I.6. of these  guidelines, may within the discretion of the deciding officer be a basis  for denial of relief.</p><p class="depth0">9. If the violator is being prosecuted criminally, the civil (19  U.S.C. 1497) liability generally is administratively settled only after  completion of the prosecution or with the express approval of the  appropriate U.S. attorney. Criminal prosecution of the violator,  however, is insufficient grounds to delay indefinitely determination of  the civil liability. The Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer  should contact the Chief Counsel representative in the field to  determine the best course of action to follow with respect to the civil  liability. Chief Counsel representative will consult with the U.S.  attorney and the Penalties Branch at Customs Headquarters. Because of  time delay problems, all seizures involving criminal prosecutions must  be promptly coordinated in this manner, and consideration should be  given to immediate referral of the forfeiture action to the U.S.  attorney for the institution of a judicial proceeding.  [T.D. 83-145, 48 FR 30100, June 30, 1983, as amended by T.D. 89-1, 53 FR  51271, Dec. 21, 1988; T.D. 99-27, 64 FR 13676, Mar. 22, 1999]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix B to Part 171--Customs Regulations, Guidelines for the</p><p class="depth0">Imposition and Mitigation of Penalties for Violations of 19 U.S.C. 1592</p><p class="depth0">A monetary penalty incurred under section 592 of the Tariff Act of  1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1592; hereinafter referred to as section  592) may be remitted or mitigated under section 618 of the Tariff Act of  1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1618), if it is determined that there are  mitigating circumstances to justify remission or mitigation. The  guidelines below will be used by the Customs Service in arriving at a  just and reasonable assessment and disposition of liabilities arising  under section 592 within the stated limitations. It is intended that  these guidelines shall be applied by Customs officers in pre-penalty  proceedings and in determining the monetary penalty assessed in any  penalty notice. The assessed penalty or penalty amount set forth in  Customs administrative disposition determined in accordance with these  guidelines does not limit the penalty amount which the Government may  seek in bringing a civil enforcement action pursuant to section 592(e).  It should be understood that any mitigated penalty is conditioned upon  payment of any actual loss of duty as well as a release by the party  that indicates that the mitigation decision constitutes full accord and  satisfaction. Further, mitigation decisions are not rulings within the  meaning of part 177 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR part 177).  Lastly, these guidelines may supplement, and are not intended to  preclude application of, any other special guidelines promulgated by  Customs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Violations of Section 592</p><p class="depth0">Without regard to whether the United States is or may be deprived of  all or a portion of any lawful duty, tax or fee thereby, a violation of  section 592 occurs when a person, through fraud, gross negligence, or  negligence, enters, introduces, or attempts to enter or introduce any  merchandise into the commerce of the United States by means of any  document, electronic transmission of data or information, written or  oral statement, or act that is material and false, or any omission that  is material; or when a person aids or abets any other person in the  entry, introduction, or attempted entry or introduction of merchandise  by such means. It should be noted that the language ``entry,  introduction, or attempted entry or introduction'' encompasses placing  merchandise in-bond (e.g., filing an immediate transportation  application). There is no violation if the falsity or omission is due  solely to clerical error or mistake of fact, unless the error or mistake  is part of a pattern of negligent conduct. Also, the unintentional  repetition by an electronic system of an initial clerical error  generally will not constitute a pattern of negligent conduct.  Nevertheless, if Customs has drawn the party's attention to the  unintentional repetition by an electronic system of an initial clerical  error, subsequent failure to correct the error could constitute a  violation of section 592. Also, the unintentional repetition of a  clerical mistake over a significant period of time or involving many  entries could indicate a pattern of negligent conduct and a failure to  exercise reasonable care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Definition of Materiality Under Section 592</p><p class="depth0">A document, statement, act, or omission is material if it has the  natural tendency to influence or is capable of influencing agency action  including, but not limited to a Customs action regarding: (1)  Determination of   the classification, appraisement, or admissibility of merchandise (e.g.,  whether merchandise is prohibited or restricted); (2) determination of  an importer's liability for duty (including marking, antidumping, and/or  countervailing duty); (3) collection and reporting of accurate trade  statistics; (4) determination as to the source, origin, or quality of  merchandise; (5) determination of whether an unfair trade practice has  been committed under the anti-dumping or countervailing duty laws or a  similar statute; (6) determination of whether an unfair act has been  committed involving patent, trademark, or copyright infringement; or (7)  the determination of whether any other unfair trade practice has been  committed in violation of federal law. The ``but for'' test of  materiality is inapplicable under section 592.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Degrees of Culpability Under Section 592</p><p class="depth0">The three degrees of culpability under section 592 for the purposes  of administrative proceedings are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Negligence. A violation is determined to be negligent if it  results from an act or acts (of commission or omission) done through  either the failure to exercise the degree of reasonable care and  competence expected from a person in the same circumstances either: (a)  in ascertaining the facts or in drawing inferences therefrom, in  ascertaining the offender's obligations under the statute; or (b) in  communicating information in a manner so that it may be understood by  the recipient. As a general rule, a violation is negligent if it results  from failure to exercise reasonable care and competence: (a) to ensure  that statements made and information provided in connection with the  importation of merchandise are complete and accurate; or (b) to perform  any material act required by statute or regulation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Gross Negligence. A violation is deemed to be grossly negligent  if it results from an act or acts (of commission or omission) done with  actual knowledge of or wanton disregard for the relevant facts and with  indifference to or disregard for the offender's obligations under the  statute.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fraud. A violation is determined to be fraudulent if a material  false statement, omission, or act in connection with the transaction was  committed (or omitted) knowingly, i.e., was done voluntarily and  intentionally, as established by clear and convincing evidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Discussion of Additional Terms</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Duty Loss Violations. A section 592 duty loss violation involves  those cases where there has been a loss of duty including any marking,  anti-dumping, or countervailing duties, or any tax and fee (e.g.,  merchandise processing and/or harbor maintenance fees) attributable to  an alleged violation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Non-duty Loss Violations. A section 592 non-duty loss violation  involves cases where the record indicates that an alleged violation is  principally attributable to, for example, evasion of a prohibition,  restriction, or other non-duty related consideration involving the  importation of the merchandise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Actual Loss of Duties. An actual loss of duty occurs where there  is a loss of duty including any marking, anti-dumping, or countervailing  duties, or any tax and fee (e.g., merchandise processing and/or harbor  maintenance fees) attributable to a liquidated Customs entry, and the  merchandise covered by the entry has been entered or introduced (or  attempted to be entered or introduced) in violation of section 592.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Potential Loss of Duties. A potential loss of duty occurs where  an entry remains unliquidated and there is a loss of duty, including any  marking, anti-dumping or countervailing duties or any tax and fee (e.g.,  merchandise processing and/or harbor maintenance fees) attributable to a  violation of section 592, but the violation was discovered prior to  liquidation. In addition, a potential loss of duty exists where Customs  discovers the violation and corrects the entry to reflect liquidation at  the proper classification and value. In other words, the potential loss  in such cases equals the amount of duty, tax and fee that would have  occurred had Customs not discovered the violation prior to liquidation  and taken steps to correct the entry.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Total Loss of Duty. The total loss of duty is the sum of any  actual and potential loss of duty attributable to alleged violations of  section 592 in a particular case. Payment of any actual and/or potential  loss of duty shall not affect or reduce the total loss of duty used for  assessing penalties as set forth in these guidelines. The ``multiples''  set forth below in paragraph (F)(2) involving assessment and disposition  of cases shall utilize the ``total loss of duty'' amount in arriving at  the appropriate assessment or disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Reasonable Care. General Standard: All parties, including  importers of record or their agents, are required to exercise reasonable  care in fulfilling their responsibilities involving entry of  merchandise. These responsibilities include, but are not limited to:  providing a classification and value for the merchandise; furnishing  information sufficient to permit Customs to determine the final  classification and valuation of merchandise; taking measures that will  lead to and assure the preparation of accurate documentation, and  determining whether any applicable requirements of law with respect to  these issues are met. In addition, all parties, including the importer,  must use reasonable care to provide accurate information or  documentation to enable Customs to determine if the merchandise may be  released. Customs may consider an importer's failure to follow   a binding Customs ruling a lack of reasonable care. In addition,  unreasonable classification will be considered a lack of reasonable care  (e.g., imported snow skis are classified as water skis). Failure to  exercise reasonable care in connection with the importation of  merchandise may result in imposition of a section 592 penalty for fraud,  gross negligence or negligence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Clerical Error. A clerical error is an error in the preparation,  assembly or submission of import documentation or information provided  to Customs that results from a mistake in arithmetic or transcription  that is not part of a pattern of negligence. The mere non-intentional  repetition by an electronic system of an initial clerical error does not  constitute a pattern of negligence. Nevertheless, as stated earlier, if  Customs has drawn a party's attention to the non-intentional repetition  by an electronic system of an initial clerical error, subsequent failure  to correct the error could constitute a violation of section 592. Also,  the unintentional repetition of a clerical mistake over a significant  period of time or involving many entries could indicate a pattern of  negligent conduct and a failure to exercise reasonable care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Mistake of Fact. A mistake of fact is a false statement or  omission that is based on a bona fide erroneous belief as to the facts,  so long as the belief itself did not result from negligence in  ascertaining the accuracy of the facts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Penalty Assessment</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Case Initiation--Pre-penalty Notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(i)</em>, (b)(i) and (c)(i) involving assessment and  disposition of duty loss violation cases will use the amount of total  loss of duty in arriving at the appropriate assessment or disposition.  Further, where separate duty loss and non-duty loss violations occur on  the same entry, it is within the Customs field officer's discretion to  assess both duty loss and non-duty loss penalties, or only one of them.  Where only one of the penalties is assessed, the Customs field officer  has the discretion to select which penalty (duty loss or non-duty loss)  shall be assessed. Also, where there is a violation accompanied by an  incidental or nominal loss of duties, the Customs field officer may  assess a non-duty loss penalty where the incidental or nominal duty loss  resulted from a separate non-duty loss violation. The Customs field  officer will propose a level of culpability in the pre-penalty notice  that conforms to the level of culpability suggested by the evidence at  the time of issuance. Moreover, the pre-penalty notice will include a  statement that it is Customs practice to base its actions on the  earliest point in time that the statute of limitations may be asserted  (i.e., the date of occurrence of the alleged violation) inasmuch as the  final resolution of a case in court may be less than a finding of fraud.  A pre-penalty notice that is issued to a party in a case where Customs  determines a claimed prior disclosure is not valid--owing to the  disclosing party's knowledge of the commencement of a formal  investigation of a disclosed violation--will include a copy of a written  document that evidences the commencement of a formal investigation. In  addition, a pre-penalty notice is not required if a violation involves a  non-commercial importation or if the proposed claim does not exceed  $1,000. Special guidelines relating to penalty assessment and  dispositions involving ``Arriving Travelers,'' are set forth in section  (L) below.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Pre-penalty Notice--Proposed Claim Amount</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Fraud. In general, if a violation is determined to be the result  of fraud, the proposed claim ordinarily will be assessed in an amount  equal to the domestic value of the merchandise. Exceptions to assessing  the penalty at the domestic value may be warranted in unusual  circumstances such as a case where the domestic value of the merchandise  is disproportionately high in comparison to the loss of duty  attributable to an alleged violation (e.g., a total loss of duty of  $10,000 involving 10 entries with a total domestic value of $2,000,000).  Also, it is incumbent upon the appropriate Customs field officer to  consider whether mitigating factors are present warranting a reduction  in the customary domestic value assessment. In all section 592 cases of  this nature regardless of the dollar amount of the proposed claim, the  Customs field officer will obtain the approval of the Penalties Branch  at Headquarters prior to issuance of a pre-penalty notice at an amount  less than domestic value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Gross Negligence and Negligence. In determining the amount of  the proposed claim in cases involving gross negligence and negligence,  the appropriate Customs field officer will take into account the gravity  of the offense, the amount of loss of duty, the extent of wrongdoing,  mitigating or aggravating   factors, and other factors bearing upon the seriousness of a violation,  but in no case will the assessed penalty exceed the statutory ceilings  prescribed in section 592. In cases involving gross negligence and  negligence, penalties equivalent to the ceilings stated in paragraphs  (F)(2)(b) and (c) regarding disposition of cases may be appropriate in  cases involving serious violations, e.g., violations involving a high  loss of duty or significant evasion of import prohibitions or  restrictions. A ``serious'' violation need not result in a loss of duty.  The violation may be serious because it affects the admissibility of  merchandise or the enforcement of other laws, as in the case of quota  evasions, false statements made to conceal the dumping of merchandise,  or violations of exclusionary orders of the International Trade  Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Technical Violations. Violations where the loss of duty is  nonexistent or minimal and/or that have an insignificant impact on  enforcement of the laws of the United States may justify a proposed  penalty in a fixed amount not related to the value of merchandise, but  an amount believed sufficient to have a deterrent effect: e.g.,  violations involving the subsequent sale of merchandise or vehicles  entered for personal use; violations involving failure to comply with  declaration or entry requirements that do not change the admissibility  or entry status of merchandise or its appraised value or classification;  violations involving the illegal diversion to domestic use of  instruments of international traffic; and local point-to-point traffic  violations. Generally, a penalty in a fixed amount ranging from $1,000  to $2,000 is appropriate in cases where there are no prior violations of  the same kind. However, fixed sums ranging from $2,000 to $10,000 may be  appropriate in the case of multiple or repeated violations. Fixed sum  penalty amounts are not subject to further mitigation and may not exceed  the maximum amounts stated in section 592 and in these guidelines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Statute of Limitations Considerations--Waivers. Prior to  issuance of any section 592 pre-penalty notice, the appropriate Customs  field officer will calculate the statute of limitations attributable to  an alleged violation. Inasmuch as section 592 cases are reviewed de novo  by the Court of International Trade, the statute of limitations  calculation in cases alleging fraud should assume a level of culpability  of gross negligence or negligence, i.e., ordinarily applying a shorter  period of time for statute of limitations purposes. In accordance with  section 162.78 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 162.78), if less than  1 year remains before the statute of limitations may be raised as a  defense, a shortened response time may be specified in the notice--but  in no case, less than 7 business days from the date of mailing. In cases  of shortened response times, the Customs field officer should notify  alleged violators by telephone and use all reasonable means (e.g.,  facsimile transmission of a copy of the notice) to expedite receipt of  the notice by the alleged violators. Also in such cases, the appropriate  Customs field officer should advise the alleged violator that additional  time to respond to the pre-penalty notice will be granted only if an  acceptable waiver of the statute of limitations is submitted to Customs.  With regard to waivers of the statute of limitations, it is Customs  practice to request waivers concurrently both from all potential alleged  violators and their sureties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Closure of Case or Issuance of Penalty Notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Case Closure. The appropriate Customs field officer may find,  after consideration of the record in the case, including any pre-penalty  response/oral presentation, that issuance of a penalty notice is not  warranted. In such cases, the Customs field officer will provide written  notification to the alleged violator who received the subject pre- penalty notice that the case is closed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(i)</em>. In general, the degree of  culpability or proposed penalty amount stated in a pre-penalty notice  will not be increased in the penalty notice. If, subsequent to the  issuance of a pre-penalty notice and upon further review of the record,  the appropriate Customs field officer determines that a higher degree of  culpability exists, the original pre-penalty notice should be rescinded  and a new pre-penalty notice issued that indicates the higher degree of  culpability and increased proposed penalty amount. However, if less than  9 months remain before expiration of the statute of limitations or any  waiver thereof by the party named in the pre-penalty notice, the higher  degree of culpability and higher penalty amount may be indicated in the  notice of penalty without rescinding the earlier pre-penalty notice. In  such cases, the Customs field officer will consider whether a lower  degree of culpability is appropriate or whether to change the  information contained in the pre-penalty notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Statute of Limitations Considerations. Prior to issuance of any  section 592 penalty notice, the appropriate Customs field officer again  shall calculate the statute of limitations attributable to the alleged  violation and request a waiver(s) of the statute, if necessary. In  accordance with part 171 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR part 171),  if less than 180 days remain before the statute of limitations may be  raised as a defense, a shortened response time may be specified in the  notice--but in no case less than 7 business days from the date of  mailing. In such cases, the Customs field officer should notify an  alleged violator by telephone and use all reasonable means (e.g.,  facsimile transmission of a copy) to expedite receipt of the penalty  notice by the alleged violator. Also, in such cases, the Customs field  officer should advise an alleged violator that, if an acceptable waiver  of the statute of limitations is provided, additional time to respond to  the penalty notice may be granted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Administrative Penalty Disposition</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Generally. It is the policy of the Department of the Treasury  and the Customs Service to grant mitigation in appropriate  circumstances. In certain cases, based upon criteria to be developed by  Customs, mitigation may take an alternative form, whereby a violator may  eliminate or reduce his or her section 592 penalty liability by taking  action(s) to correct problems that caused the violation. In any case, in  determining the administrative section 592 penalty disposition, the  appropriate Customs field officer will consider the entire case record-- taking into account the presence of any mitigating or aggravating  factors. All such factors should be set forth in the written  administrative section 592 penalty decision. Once again, Customs  emphasizes that any penalty liability which is mitigated is conditioned  upon payment of any actual loss of duty in addition to that penalty as  well as a release by the party that indicates that the mitigation  decision constitutes full accord and satisfaction. Finally, section 592  penalty dispositions in duty-loss and non-duty-loss cases will proceed  in the manner set forth below.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Dispositions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Fraudulent Violation. Penalty dispositions for a fraudulent  violation will be calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Duty Loss Violation. An amount ranging from a minimum of 5 times  the total loss of duty to a maximum of 8 times the total loss of duty-- but in any such case the amount may not exceed the domestic value of the  merchandise. A penalty disposition greater than 8 times the total loss  of duty may be imposed in a case involving an egregious violation, or a  public health and safety violation, or due to the presence of  aggravating factors, but again, the amount may not exceed the domestic  value of the merchandise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Non-Duty Loss Violation. An amount ranging from a minimum of 50  percent of the dutiable value to a maximum of 80 percent of the dutiable  value of the merchandise. A penalty disposition greater than 80 percent  of the dutiable value may be imposed in a case involving an egregious  violation, or a public health and safety violation, or due to the  presence of aggravating factors, but the amount may not exceed the  domestic value of the merchandise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Grossly Negligent Violation. Penalty dispositions for a grossly  negligent violation shall be calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Duty Loss Violation. An amount ranging from a minimum of 2.5  times the total loss of duty to a maximum of 4 times the total loss of  duty--but in any such case, the amount may not exceed the domestic value  of the merchandise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Non-Duty Loss Violation. An amount ranging from a minimum of 25  percent of the dutiable value to a maximum of 40 percent of the dutiable  value of the merchandise--but in any such case, the amount may not  exceed the domestic value of the merchandise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Negligent Violation. Penalty dispositions for a negligent  violation shall be calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Duty Loss Violation. An amount ranging from a minimum of 0.5  times the total loss of duty to a maximum of 2 times the total loss of  duty but, in any such case, the amount may not exceed the domestic value  of the merchandise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Non-Duty Loss Violation. An amount ranging from a minimum of 5  percent of the dutiable value to a maximum of 20 percent of the dutiable  value of the merchandise, but, in any such case, the amount may not  exceed the domestic value of the merchandise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Authority to Cancel Claim. Upon issuance of a penalty notice,  Customs has set forth its formal monetary penalty claim. Except as  provided in 19 CFR part 171, in those section 592 cases within the  administrative jurisdiction of the concerned Customs field office, the  appropriate Customs field officer will cancel any such formal claim  whenever it is determined that an essential element of the alleged  violation is not established by the agency record, including pre-penalty  and penalty responses provided by the alleged violator. Except as  provided in 19 CFR part 171, in those section 592 cases within Customs  Headquarters jurisdiction, the appropriate Customs field officer will  cancel any such formal claim whenever it is determined that an essential  element of the alleged violation is not established by the agency  record, and such cancellation action precedes the date of the Customs  field officer's receipt of the alleged violator's petition responding to  the penalty notice. On and after the date of Customs receipt of the  petition responding to   the penalty notice, jurisdiction over the action rests with Customs  Headquarters including the authority to cancel the claim.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Remission of Claim. If the Customs field officer believes that a  claim for monetary penalty should be remitted for a reason not set forth  in these guidelines, the Customs field officer should first seek  approval from the Chief, Penalties Branch, Customs Service Headquarters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Prior Disclosure Dispositions. It is the policy of the  Department of the Treasury and the Customs Service to encourage the  submission of valid prior disclosures that comport with the laws,  regulations, and policies governing this provision of section 592.  Customs will determine the validity of the prior disclosure including  whether or not the prior disclosure sets forth all the required elements  of a violation of section 592. A valid prior disclosure warrants the  imposition of the reduced Customs civil penalties set forth below:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Fraudulent Violation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Duty Loss Violation. The claim for monetary penalty shall be  equal to 100 percent of the total loss of duty (i.e., actual +  potential) resulting from the violation. No mitigation will be afforded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Non-Duty Loss Violation. The claim for monetary penalty shall be  equal to 10 percent of the dutiable value of the merchandise in  question. No mitigation will be afforded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Gross Negligence and Negligence Violation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Duty Loss Violation. The claim for monetary penalty shall be  equal to the interest on the actual loss of duty computed from the date  of liquidation to the date of the party's tender of the actual loss of  duty resulting from the violation. Customs notes that there is no  monetary penalty in these cases if the duty loss is potential in nature.  Absent extraordinary circumstances, no mitigation will be afforded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Non-Duty Loss Violation. There is no monetary penalty in such  cases and any claim for monetary penalty which had been issued prior to  the decision granting prior disclosure will be remitted in full.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Mitigating Factors</p><p class="depth0">The following factors will be considered in mitigation of the  proposed or assessed penalty claim or the amount of the administrative  penalty decision, provided that the case record sufficiently establishes  their existence. The list is not all-inclusive.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contributory Customs Error. This factor includes misleading or  erroneous advice given by a Customs official in writing to the alleged  violator, or established by a contemporaneously created written Customs  record, only if it appears that the alleged violator reasonably relied  upon the information and the alleged violator fully and accurately  informed Customs of all relevant facts. The concept of comparative  negligence may be utilized in determining the weight to be assigned to  this factor. If it is determined that the Customs error was the sole  cause of the violation, the proposed or assessed penalty claim shall be  canceled. If the Customs error contributed to the violation, but the  violator also is culpable, the Customs error will be considered as a  mitigating factor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cooperation with the Investigation. To obtain the benefits of  this factor, the violator must exhibit extraordinary cooperation beyond  that expected from a person under investigation for a Customs violation.  Some examples of the cooperation contemplated include assisting Customs  officers to an unusual degree in auditing the books and records of the  violator (e.g., incurring extraordinary expenses in providing computer  runs solely for submission to Customs to assist the agency in cases  involving an unusually large number of entries and/or complex issues).  Another example consists of assisting Customs in obtaining additional  information relating to the subject violation or other violations.  Merely providing the books and records of the violator should not be  considered cooperation justifying mitigation inasmuch as Customs has the  right to examine an importer's books and records pursuant to 19 U.S.C.  1508-1509.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Immediate Remedial Action. This factor includes the payment of  the actual loss of duty prior to the issuance of a penalty notice and  within 30 days after Customs notifies the alleged violator of the actual  loss of duties attributable to the alleged violation. In appropriate  cases, where the violator provides evidence that immediately after  learning of the violation, substantial remedial action was taken to  correct organizational or procedural defects, immediate remedial action  may be granted as a mitigating factor. Customs encourages immediate  remedial action to ensure against future incidents of non-compliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Inexperience in Importing. Inexperience is a factor only if it  contributes to the violation and the violation is not due to fraud or  gross negligence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Prior Good Record. Prior good record is a factor only if the  alleged violator is able to demonstrate a consistent pattern of  importations without violation of section 592, or any other statute  prohibiting false or fraudulent importation practices. This factor will  not be considered in alleged fraudulent violations of section 592.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Inability to Pay the Customs Penalty. The party claiming the  existence of this factor must present documentary evidence in support  thereof, including copies of income tax returns for the previous 3  years, and an audited financial statement for the most recent fiscal  quarter. In certain cases, Customs may waive the production of an  audited financial statement or may request alternative or additional  financial data in order to facilitate   an analysis of a claim of inability to pay (e.g., examination of the  financial records of a foreign entity related to the U.S. company  claiming inability to pay).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Customs Knowledge. Additional relief in non-fraud cases (which  also are not the subject of a criminal investigation) will be granted if  it is determined that Customs had actual knowledge of a violation and,  without justification, failed to inform the violator so that it could  have taken earlier corrective action. In such cases, if a penalty is to  be assessed involving repeated violations of the same kind, the maximum  penalty amount for violations occurring after the date on which actual  knowledge was obtained by Customs will be limited to two times the loss  of duty in duty-loss cases or twenty percent of the dutiable value in  non-duty-loss cases if the continuing violations were the result of  gross negligence, or the lesser of one time the loss of duty in duty- loss cases or ten percent of dutiable value in non-duty-loss cases if  the violations were the result of negligence. This factor will not be  applicable when a substantial delay in the investigation is attributable  to the alleged violator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Aggravating Factors</p><p class="depth0">Certain factors may be determined to be aggravating factors in  calculating the amount of the proposed or assessed penalty claim or the  amount of the administrative penalty decision. The presence of one or  more aggravating factors may not be used to raise the level of  culpability attributable to the alleged violations, but may be utilized  to offset the presence of mitigating factors. The following factors will  be considered ``aggravating factors,'' provided that the case record  sufficiently establishes their existence. The list is not exclusive.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Obstructing an investigation or audit,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Withholding evidence,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Providing misleading information concerning the violation,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Prior substantive violations of section 592 for which a final  administrative finding of culpability has been made,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Textile imports that have been the subject of illegal  transshipment (i.e., false country of origin declaration), whether or  not the merchandise bears false country of origin markings,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Evidence of a motive to evade a prohibition or restriction on  the admissibility of the merchandise (e.g., evading a quota  restriction),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Failure to comply with a lawful demand for records or a Customs  summons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Offers in Compromise (``Settlement Offers'')</p><p class="depth0">Parties who wish to submit a civil offer in compromise pursuant to  19 U.S.C. 1617 (also known as a ``settlement offer'') in connection with  any section 592 claim or potential section 592 claim should follow the  procedures outlined in Sec. 161.5 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR  161.5). Settlement offers do not involve ``mitigation'' of a claim or  potential claim, but rather ``compromise'' an action or potential action  where Customs evaluation of potential litigation risks, or the alleged  violator's financial position, justifies such a disposition. In any case  where a portion of the offered amount represents a tender of unpaid  duties, taxes and fees, Customs letter of acceptance may identify the  portion representing any such duty, tax and fee. The offered amount  should be deposited at the Customs field office responsible for handling  the section 592 claim or potential section 592 claim. The offered amount  will be held in a suspense account pending acceptance or rejection of  the offer in compromise. In the event the offer is rejected, the  concerned Customs field office will promptly initiate a refund of the  money deposited in the suspense account to the offeror.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(J)</em> Section 592(d) Demands</p><p class="depth0">Section 592(d) demands for actual losses of duty ordinarily are  issued in connection with a penalty action, or as a separate demand  without an associated penalty action. In either case, information must  be present establishing a violation of section 592(a). In those cases  where the appropriate Customs field officer determines that issuance of  a penalty under section 592 is not warranted (notwithstanding the  presence of information establishing a violation of section 592(a)), but  that circumstances do warrant issuance of a demand for payment of an  actual loss of duty pursuant to section 592(d), the Customs field  officer shall follow the procedures set forth in section 162.79b of the  Customs Regulations (19 CFR 162.79b). Except in cases where less than  one year remains before the statute of limitations may be raised as a  defense, information copies of all section 592(d) demands should be sent  to all concerned sureties and the importer of record if such party is  not an alleged violator. Also, except in cases where less than one year  remains before the statute of limitations may be raised as a defense,  Customs will endeavor to issue all section 592(d) demands to concerned  sureties and non-violator importers of record only after default by  principals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(K)</em> Customs Brokers</p><p class="depth0">If a customs broker commits a section 592 violation and the  violation involves fraud, or the broker commits a grossly negligent or  negligent violation and shares in the benefits of the violation to an  extent over and above customary brokerage fees, the customs broker will  be subject to these guidelines.   However, if the customs broker commits either a grossly negligent or  negligent violation of section 592 (without sharing in the benefits of  the violation as described above), the concerned Customs field officer  may proceed against the customs broker pursuant to the remedies provided  under 19 U.S.C. 1641.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(L)</em> Arriving Travelers</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Liability. Except as set forth below, proposed and assessed  penalties for violations by an arriving traveler must be determined in  accordance with these guidelines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Limitations on Liability on Non-commercial Violations. In the  absence of a referral for criminal prosecution, monetary penalties  assessed in the case of an alleged first-offense, non-commercial,  fraudulent violation by an arriving traveler will generally be limited  as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Fraud--Duty Loss Violation. An amount ranging from a minimum of  three times the loss of duty to a maximum of five times the loss of  duty, provided the loss of duty is also paid;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Fraud--Non-duty Loss Violation. An amount ranging from a minimum  of 30 percent of the dutiable value of the merchandise to a maximum of  50 percent of its dutiable value;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Gross Negligence--Duty Loss Violation. An amount ranging from a  minimum of 1.5 times the loss of duty to a maximum of 2.5 times the loss  of duty provided the loss of duty is also paid;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Gross Negligence--Non-duty Loss Violation. An amount ranging  from a minimum of 15 percent of the dutiable value of the merchandise to  a maximum of 25 percent of its dutiable value;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Negligence--Duty Loss Violation. An amount ranging from a  minimum of .25 times the loss of duty to a maximum of 1.25 times the  loss of duty provided that the loss of duty is also paid;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Negligence--Non-duty Loss Violation. An amount ranging from a  minimum of 2.5 percent of the dutiable value of the merchandise to a  maximum of 12.5 percent of its dutiable value;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Special Assessments/Dispositions. No penalty action under  section 592 will be initiated against an arriving traveler if the  violation is not fraudulent or commercial, the loss of duty is $100.00  or less, and there are no other concurrent or prior violations of  section 592 or other statutes prohibiting false or fraudulent  importation practices. However, all lawful duties, taxes and fees will  be collected. Also, no penalty under section 592 will be initiated  against an arriving traveler if the violation is not fraudulent or  commercial, there are no other concurrent or prior violations of section  592, and a penalty is not believed necessary to deter future violations  or to serve a law enforcement purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(M)</em> Violations of Laws Administered by Other Federal Agencies.</p><p class="depth0">Violations of laws administered by other federal agencies (such as  the Food and Drug Administration, Consumer Product Safety Commission,  Office of Foreign Assets Control, Department of Agriculture, Fish and  Wildlife Service) should be referred to the appropriate agency for its  recommendation. Such recommendation, if promptly tendered, will be given  due consideration, and may be followed provided the recommendation would  not result in a disposition inconsistent with these guidelines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(N)</em> Section 592 Violations by Small Entities</p><p class="depth0">In compliance with the mandate of the Small Business Regulatory  Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, under appropriate circumstances, the  issuance of a penalty under section 592 may be waived for businesses  qualifying as small business entities.</p><p class="depth0">Procedures established for small business entities regarding  violations of 19 U.S.C. 1592 were published as Treasury Decision 97-46  in the Federal Register (62 FR 30378) on June 3, 1997.  [T.D. 00-41, 65 FR 39093, June 23, 2000]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix C to Part 171--Customs Regulations Guidelines for the</p><p class="depth0">Imposition and Mitigation of Penalties for Violations of 19 U.S.C. 1641</p><p class="depth0">The Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 promulgated numerous changes to the  current statute relating to Customs brokers. The following document  attempts to define that conduct which is to be proscribed and to suggest  penalty amounts to be assessed for such violations. It also chronicles  procedures to be followed in assessment and mitigation of penalties.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Assessment of a monetary penalty is an alternative sanction to  revocation or suspension of the broker's license or permit.</p><p class="depth0">I. Penalty Assessment Procedures--19 CFR Part 111, Subpart E</p><p class="depth0">A. When a penalty against a broker is contemplated, the  ``appropriate Customs officer'', (i.e., the Fines, Penalties, and  Forfeitures Officer) shall issue a written notice which advises the  violator of the allegations which would warrant imposition of a penalty.  The written notice shall be in a format similar to a prepenalty notice  that would be issued in contemplation of assessment of a penalty under  section 1592 or 1584.</p><p class="depth0">B. The written notice shall inform the violator that he has 30 days  to respond as to why a penalty should not be issued. See 19 CFR 111.92.</p><p class="depth0">C. If no response is received from the violator, or, if after  receipt of the response, it is determined that the penalty should be  issued as stated in the prepenalty notice, a notice of penalty CF-5955A  shall be issued formally assessing a monetary penalty against the  broker.</p><p class="depth0">D. The Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer may reduce the  amount of the contemplated penalty or cancel its issuance altogether if,  after review of the violator's submission in response to the prepenalty  notice, he is satisfied that the acts which are the basis for the  penalty did not occur as charged or occurred in a manner that would  permit a reduction in the contemplated penalty.</p><p class="depth0">E. After issuance of a penalty notice, the petitioning provisions of  part 171 of the Customs Regulations are in effect.</p><p class="depth0">F. If the broker does not comply with a final mitigation decision  within 60 days, the matter shall be referred to the Department of  Justice for commencement of judicial action.</p><p class="depth0">II. Penalty Assessment--Conducting Customs Business Without a License</p><p class="depth0">(19 U.S.C. 1641(b)(6))</p><p class="depth0">A. No person may conduct Customs business, other than solely on  behalf of that person, without a broker's license.</p><p class="depth0">B. Penalty amount:</p><p class="depth0">1. The maximum penalty for any one incident of conducting Customs  business without a license is $10,000.</p><p class="depth0">2. Total aggregate penalties for violation of this or any other  section of the broker penalty statute is $30,000. As a general rule,  $10,000 will be the maximum assessment for a violation solely involving  conducting Customs business without a license, without regard to the  frequency of violations. In particularly aggravated circumstances, this  rule shall be suspended.</p><p class="depth0">C. Customs business includes:</p><p class="depth0">1. Classification and valuation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Payment of duties, taxes or other charges.</p><p class="depth0">3. Drawback or refund of duties.</p><p class="depth0">4. Filing of entries or other documents relating to issues covered  by 1-3.</p><p class="depth0">D. Customs business does not include:</p><p class="depth0">1. Marine transactions.</p><p class="depth0">2. In-bond movement or transportation of merchandise.</p><p class="depth0">3. Foreign Trade Zone admissions. See C.S.D. 84-23.</p><p class="depth0">E. Penalty amounts to be imposed for transacting Customs business  without a license are as follows:</p><p class="depth0">1. No penalty action when importation is conducted on behalf of a  family member. For purposes of this subsection, ``family member'' is  defined as a parent, child, spouse, sibling, grandparent or grandchild.</p><p class="depth0">2. No penalty action against an individual who has a power of  attorney to act as an unpaid agent on a non-commercial shipment. See 19  CFR 141.33.</p><p class="depth0">3. A $250 penalty for:</p><p class="depth0">a. First violation when transaction is non-commercial but is  conducted on behalf of any business entity, or</p><p class="depth0">b. First violation where the importation is commercial in nature  (i.e., imported merchandise is for resale) or where the violator is  compensated for his action, e.g., an importation of raw material or  parts of merchandise that is to be manufactured, refined or assembled  here before resale would be a commercial entry because the merchandise  eventually would be resold, albeit in another form than that which it  was entered.</p><p class="depth0">4. A $1,000 penalty for repeat violation involving:</p><p class="depth0">a. Commercial importation.</p><p class="depth0">b. Non-commercial importation made on behalf of a business entity.</p><p class="depth0">c. Non-commercial importation for which compensation is received by  the violator.</p><p class="depth0">5. A $10,000 penalty when:</p><p class="depth0">a. Violator falsely holds himself out as being a licensed Customs  broker.</p><p class="depth0">b. A continuing course of conduct can be shown (determined by  frequency of violations or number of entries involved) which would  indicate that the violator is entering merchandise for others on a  regular commercial basis, e.g., if the violator has incurred numerous  penalties under subsections (3) and (4) above, but the smaller penalties  have had no deterrent effect, the $10,000 penalty under this subsection  should be assessed in an action separate from those smaller penalties.</p><p class="depth0">F. Mitigation--No mitigation will be afforded for any violation  involving conducting Customs business without a license unless the  violator can show an inability to pay such penalty.</p><p class="depth0">G. IMPORTANT: As a general rule, a separate penalty should not be  imposed for each unlawful Customs business transaction if numerous  transactions occur contemporaneously. For example:</p><p class="depth0">1. If an unlicensed individual files six commercial entries at one  time, that should be treated as one violation. It should not be treated  as six violations because the entries were presented contemporaneously.</p><p class="depth0">2. If Customs discovers that an individual has conducted Customs  business without a license on numerous occasions, but such individual  acted without knowledge of the prohibition on such conduct, those  numerous transactions should be treated as one violation for purposes of  imposition of any penalty.</p><p class="depth0">H. Note: Conducting Customs business without a license is not the  same violation as conducting Customs business without a permit. The  latter violation is discussed   later in this appendix in the section involving Violation of Other Laws  or Regulations Enforced by Customs.</p><p class="depth0">I. Intent to violate the law is not an element of this violation.  Reference to ``intentionally transacts Customs business'' in subsection  1641(b)(6) relates to the intentional transaction of the business  itself, not to any intentional attempt to violate the terms of the  statute.  III. Section 1641(d)(1)(A)--Making a False or Misleading Statement or an</p><p class="depth0">Omission as to Material Fact Which Was Required To Be Stated in Any</p><p class="depth0">Application for a License or Permit</p><p class="depth0">A. If the license would not have been issued but for the false  statement, the proper sanction would be suspension or revocation of the  license. If the false or misleading statement would not have absolutely  resulted in the denial, revocation or suspension of a license, then  penalty sanctions are proper.</p><p class="depth0">B. Material facts include but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0">1. Facts as to identity.</p><p class="depth0">2. Facts as to citizenship status of an individual.</p><p class="depth0">3. Facts as to moral character of an individual which relate to his  fitness to conduct Customs business.</p><p class="depth0">4. The organization of any corporation, association or partnership.</p><p class="depth0">5. The status of the license of a license holder who is a corporate  officer or partner.</p><p class="depth0">C. Penalty Amount--$5,000 for each false statement, to a maximum of  $30,000.</p><p class="depth0">D. Examples of situations where revocation of the license is  appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">1. An applicant states that he is 21 years old (as required by 19  CFR 111.11) and he is not. But for the false statement, the applicant  could not meet the age requirement for a license.</p><p class="depth0">2. An applicant provides an alias in the application which is a  material false statement as to identity.</p><p class="depth0">E. Mitigation guidelines.</p><p class="depth0">1. Violation due to clerical error (clerical error as defined by 19  U.S.C. 1520(c)(1)), mitigated without payment.</p><p class="depth0">2. Violation due to negligence.</p><p class="depth0">a. This is defined as more than clerical error, but not an  intentional violation. Examples include:</p><p class="depth0">i. Failing to list a new corporate office because corporate records  have not been kept current.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Listing an incorrect address for a reference because applicant  has failed to update his records.</p><p class="depth0">b. Mitigate to $500 for each $5,000 penalty assessed.</p><p class="depth0">c. This category excludes cases of harmless error, i.e., a mistake  which could not possibly harm the government's interests. Cases falling  in this category should be mitigated in full.</p><p class="depth0">3. Intentional violations--Revocation of a license which has been  granted is the preferred sanction. If no license has been granted, no  mitigation.</p><p class="depth0">IV. Section 1641(d)(1)(B)--Broker Convicted of Certain Felonies or</p><p class="depth0">Misdemeanors Subsequent To Filing License Application</p><p class="depth0">A. As a general rule, license revocation is the standard sanction  for these violations. If the conviction occurs subsequent to the filing  of an application, monetary penalties may be assessed according to the  following criteria.</p><p class="depth0">B. Unlawful conduct must relate to:</p><p class="depth0">1. Importation or exportation of merchandise.</p><p class="depth0">2. Conduct of Customs business (this shall include violations  relating to taxes and duties and documents required to be filed with  regard to such taxes and duties).</p><p class="depth0">3. Relevant convictions would include:</p><p class="depth0">a. 18 U.S.C. 1001--making a false statement to Customs or any other  agency with regard to any relevant transaction.</p><p class="depth0">b. 18 U.S.C. 545--unlawful importation of merchandise.</p><p class="depth0">c. 18 U.S.C. 542--unlawful importation by means of a fraudulent act  or omission.</p><p class="depth0">d. 22 U.S.C. 2778--illegal exportation of munitions.</p><p class="depth0">C. Monetary penalties may not be imposed in connection with  convictions relating to conduct described in subsection  1641(d)(1)(B)(iii) including larceny, theft, robbery, extortion,  counterfeiting, fraudulent concealment or conversion, embezzlement or  misappropriation of funds. Either suspension or revocation is the  appropriate penalty for these infractions.</p><p class="depth0">D. Penalty amounts.</p><p class="depth0">1. $15,000 for a misdemeanor conviction.</p><p class="depth0">2. $30,000 for a felony conviction.</p><p class="depth0">E. Mitigation.</p><p class="depth0">1. For a misdemeanor conviction, mitigation to a lesser amount is  permitted if the conviction related to Customs business and the domestic  value of the merchandise involved is less than $15,000. In such case,  mitigation to an amount equal to the domestic value of the merchandise  is appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">2. For other misdemeanor convictions, no relief.</p><p class="depth0">3. Felony convictions, no relief.</p><p class="depth0">V. Section 1641(d)(1)(C)--Violation of Any Law Enforced by the Customs</p><p class="depth0">Service or the Rules or Regulations Issued Under Any Such Provision</p><p class="depth0">A. Penalties under this section may be imposed in addition to any  penalty provided for under the law enforced by Customs. Exception:  Penalties imposed against a broker   under 19 U.S.C. 1592 at a culpability level of less than fraud or under  19 U.S.C. 1595a(b) shall not be imposed in addition to a broker's  penalty.</p><p class="depth0">B. Additional penalties under this section shall also be imposed  against any broker where the other statute violated only moves against  property, or the violator has demonstrated a continuing course of  illegal conduct or evidence exists which indicates repeated violations  of other statutes or regulations.</p><p class="depth0">C. Conducting Customs business without a permit penalties should be  assessed under this section.</p><p class="depth0">1. The penalty notice should also cite 19 CFR 111.19 as the  regulation violated. A party operating without a permit is required to  apply for one under the above-noted regulation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Assessment amount--$1,000 per transaction conducted without a  permit.</p><p class="depth0">3. Mitigation.</p><p class="depth0">a. Negligence, mitigate to $250-$500 per transaction depending on  the presence of mitigating factors (lack of knowledge of permit  requirement).</p><p class="depth0">b. Intentional, grant no relief.</p><p class="depth0">c. No mitigation if permit revoked by operation of law.</p><p class="depth0">4. Generally, a separate penalty should not be assessed for each  non-permitted transaction if numerous transactions occurred  contemporaneously. For example, if a broker files 30 entries the day  after a permit expires, the 30 filings should be treated as one  violation, not 30 separate violations.</p><p class="depth0">D. Penalties for failure to exercise due diligence in payment,  refund or deposit of monies received from clients in connection with  clients' Customs business also should be assessed under this section.  This includes failure to pay over to a client, or file a written  statement to a client accounting for, funds received.</p><p class="depth0">1. The penalty notice should also cite 19 CFR 111.29 as the  regulation violated.</p><p class="depth0">2. Assessment amount--an amount equal to the value of any monies up  to a maximum of $30,000, to be deposited with Customs or refunded or  accounted for to a client.</p><p class="depth0">3. No mitigation shall be afforded until the monies are properly  paid to Customs or refunded or accounted for to the clients.</p><p class="depth0">4. If any claims for liquidated damages result against the client's  bond from the failure to pay monies to Customs, no mitigation from the  penalty shall be granted until the claim for liquidated damages is  settled by the violating broker either through payment of the full claim  or a mitigated amount.</p><p class="depth0">5. After monies are paid or accounted for and/or liquidated damages  claims are settled as stated in 3. and 4. above, mitigation may be  afforded. If the violator is found to be negligent, the penalty may be  mitigated to an amount between 25 and 50 percent of the assessed amount,  but no lower than $250. No mitigation from an intentional violation.</p><p class="depth0">E. Penalties for failure to retain powers of attorney from clients  to act in their names.</p><p class="depth0">1. The penalty notice should also cite 19 CFR 141.46 as the  regulation violated.</p><p class="depth0">2. Assessment amount--$1,000 for each power of attorney not on file.</p><p class="depth0">3. Mitigation--for a first offense, mitigate to an amount between  $250 and $500 unless extraordinary mitigating factors are present, in  which case full mitigation should be afforded. An extraordinary  mitigating factor would be a fire, theft or other destruction of records  beyond broker control. Subsequent offenses--no mitigation unless  extraordinary mitigating factors are present.</p><p class="depth0">4. Penalty should be mitigated in full if it can be established that  a valid power of attorney had been issued to the broker, but it was  misplaced or destroyed through clerical error or mistake.</p><p class="depth0">F. If the other statute violated moves only against property, the  violator shall incur a monetary penalty equal to the domestic value of  such property or $30,000, whichever is less.  e.g., Violation of 22 U.S.C. 401 for unlawful exportation of merchandise  results in seizure and forfeiture of the violative merchandise. There  are no penalty provisions which Customs enforces against parties  responsible for the seizable offense. If brokers are recalcitrant and  are constantly responsible for offenses which result in seizure of  merchandise, a penalty equal to the domestic value of such merchandise  (in no case to exceed $30,000) should be imposed.</p><p class="depth0">G. Use of a broker's importation bond to aid an importer who has had  his immediate delivery privileges revoked.</p><p class="depth0">1. The broker has aided his client in avoiding the immediate  delivery sanctions. The penalty notice should cite 19 CFR 142.25(c) as  the regulation violated. Before assessment of this penalty, the broker  should be shown to have known or been negligent in not knowing of the  client's sanction.</p><p class="depth0">2. A penalty equal to the value of the merchandise, not to exceed  $30,000, should be assessed.</p><p class="depth0">3. Mitigation--The penalty shall be mitigated to an amount between  25 and 50 percent of that assessed for a first violation where  negligence is shown. Any knowing violation or a subsequent negligent  violation (not necessarily involving the same client) will result in no  mitigation.</p><p class="depth0">H. If the other statute violated provides for a personal penalty,  the violator shall incur an additional monetary penalty under this  section equal to such personal penalty or $30,000, whichever is less.</p><p class="depth0">I. Penalties assessed under this provision are not limited to  violations just involving Customs business as defined in the statute.</p><p class="depth0">J. Mitigation guidelines.</p><p class="depth0">1. If the other law violated moves only against property, mitigate  the penalty using guidelines in effect for the other statute violated.  For example, if the broker is responsible for a 401 seizure of  merchandise valued at $45,000, he incurs a penalty of $30,000. The  guidelines for remission of the 401 forfeiture are applicable to  mitigation of the broker penalty. Thus, if the forfeiture is remitted  upon payment of 5 percent of the merchandise's value, the penalty will  be mitigated upon payment of a like amount.</p><p class="depth0">2. If the other law violated provides for a personal penalty,  mitigate the broker penalty using guidelines in effect for the other  statute violated.  For example, a broker incurs a $40,000 penalty under 1592. The penalty  amount represents eight times the loss of revenue because a preliminary  finding of fraud is made (see section V.A. of this appendix). A penalty  of $30,000, in addition to the $40,000 penalty issued under 1592, may be  assessed. The 1592 penalty is later mitigated to $25,000, an amount  equal to five times the loss of revenue, as the finding of fraud is  upheld and it is also determined that the broker shared in the financial  benefits of the violation. The broker penalty also should be mitigated  to that $25,000 figure, for a total collection of $50,000.</p><p class="depth0">VI. Section 1641(d)(1)(D)--Counseling, Commanding, Inducing, Procuring</p><p class="depth0">or Knowingly Aiding and Abetting Violations by Any Other Person of Any</p><p class="depth0">Law Enforced by the Customs Service</p><p class="depth0">A. If the law violated by another moves only against property, a  monetary penalty equal to the domestic value of such property or $30,000  whichever is less, may be imposed against the broker who counsels,  commands or knowingly aids and abets such violation.</p><p class="depth0">B. If the law violated provides for only a personal penalty against  the actual violator, a penalty may be imposed against the broker in an  amount equal to that assessed against the violator, but in no case can  the penalty exceed $30,000.</p><p class="depth0">C. If the broker is assessed a penalty under the statute violated by  the other person, he may be assessed a penalty under this section in  addition to any other penalties.</p><p class="depth0">D. Examples of violations of this subsection:</p><p class="depth0">1. A broker counsels a client that certain gemstones are absolutely  free of duty and need not be declared upon entry into the United States.  The client arrives in the United States and fails to declare a quantity  of gemstones worth $45,000. A penalty of $30,000 may be imposed against  the broker for such counseling. The client would incur a personal  penalty of $45,000 under the provisions of title 19, United States Code,  section 1497, but the penalty against the broker cannot exceed $30,000.</p><p class="depth0">2. A client imports $15,000 worth of merchandise by vessel. The  merchandise is unladen at the wharf but Customs has not appraised or  released it. Customs informs the broker that the shipment must be held  for an intensive examination. The broker informs the client that the  merchandise can be moved and delivered to the consignee. The broker  assures his client that he will handle all the necessary paperwork. The  merchandise is moved from the wharf. The broker is subject to a $15,000  penalty for counseling and inducing his client to violate the provisions  of title 19, United States Code, section 1448 and title 19, United  States Code, section 1595a(b).</p><p class="depth0">E. Mitigation--Follow guidelines applicable to the other penalty or  forfeiture statute involved.  VII. Section 1641(d)(1)(E)--Knowingly Employing or Continuing To Employ  Any Person Who Has Been Convicted of a Felony, Without Written Approval</p><p class="depth0">of Such Employment From the Secretary of the Treasury</p><p class="depth0">A. A broker has 30 days to seek approval of the Secretary for such  employment. If he seeks the approval within such time, no penalty will  be assessed.</p><p class="depth0">B. A $5,000 penalty for knowingly employing any convicted felon and  failing to make application with the Secretary approving such employment  within 30 days of the date of discovery of the felony conviction.</p><p class="depth0">C. A $25,000 penalty for knowingly employing any convicted felon  without seeking approval for employment.</p><p class="depth0">D. A $30,000 penalty for knowingly employing any convicted felon and  continuing to employ same after approval has been denied (generally  revocation or suspension of the license would be appropriate under this  circumstance).</p><p class="depth0">E. Example: If a broker unknowingly employs a convicted felon and 1  year after employment discovers the existence of such a conviction, the  following actions would dictate imposition of a penalty:</p><p class="depth0">1. If he seeks approval of the Secretary within 30 days after  discovery of the existence of the conviction, no penalty will be  assessed.</p><p class="depth0">2. If he seeks approval at some time after 30 days from the date of  discovery, a $5,000 penalty would lie.</p><p class="depth0">3. If he does not seek approval until after Customs becomes aware of  the violation, a $25,000 penalty would lie.</p><p class="depth0">4. If he seeks approval, but is denied, and continues to employ the  convicted felon, a $30,000 penalty would lie.</p><p class="depth0">F. Customs discovery of a felony conviction. If Customs discovers  the felony conviction and there is no indication that the employer is  aware of same, Customs may inform the employer of such conviction.  Discretion should be used in divulging this information.</p><p class="depth0">G. Mitigation will only be permitted from the $5,000 penalty as  follows:</p><p class="depth0">1. If the application for approval is submitted within 60 days, but  after 30 days, mitigate to $2,000.</p><p class="depth0">2. If there is no application beyond the 60-day period, no  mitigation shall be granted. Continued employment will result in further  penalties as described above in sections E.3 and E.4.</p><p class="depth0">VIII. Section 1641(d)(1)(F)--In the Course of Customs Business, With</p><p class="depth0">Intent To Defraud, Knowingly Deceiving, Misleading or Threatening Any</p><p class="depth0">Client or Prospective Client</p><p class="depth0">A. An unsubstantiated accusation by a client is inadequate basis to  assess any penalty under this section of law.</p><p class="depth0">B. A $30,000 penalty should be imposed for any violation of this  section.</p><p class="depth0">C. Mitigation--Inasmuch as evidence of intent must be shown before a  penalty can be imposed, no mitigation should be permitted if a violation  is found to lie. A petition for mitigation could be entertained only on  the issue of whether such violation did, in fact, occur.  IX. Section 1641(b)(5)--The Failure of a Customs Broker That is Licensed  as a Corporation, Association or Partnership To Have, For Any Continuous</p><p class="depth0">Period of 120 Days, at Least One Officer of the Corporation or</p><p class="depth0">Association or One Member of the Partnership Validly Licensed</p><p class="depth0">A. Important: Violation of this section results in the revocation of  the broker's license by operation of law.</p><p class="depth0">B. A $10,000 penalty may be imposed pursuant to section 1641(b)(6)  because the revocation by operation of law results in the broker  conducting Customs business without a license. No penalty liability  would be incurred specifically under section 1641(b)(5).</p><p class="depth0">C. Mitigation--Grant no mitigation from any penalty incurred by a  broker for conducting Customs business without a license as a result of  revocation of that license by operation of law.</p><p class="depth0">X. Section 1641(c)(3)--Failure of a Customs Broker Granted a Permit To</p><p class="depth0">Conduct Business in a Certain District to Employ, for a Continuous</p><p class="depth0">Period of 180 Days, at Least One Individual Who is Licensed Within the</p><p class="depth0">District or Region</p><p class="depth0">A. Important: Violation of this section results in the revocation of  a permit by operation of law.</p><p class="depth0">B. Penalties may be imposed for violation of the provisions of  1641(d)(1)(C), violation of other laws enforced by Customs. Guidelines  for imposition of penalties for conducting Customs business without a  permit should be followed.</p><p class="depth0">C. Mitigation--No mitigation should be permitted from any penalty  imposed for failure to have a permit when the permit lapses by operation  of law.</p><p class="depth0">XI. Section 1641(b)(4)--Failure of a Licensed Broker To Exercise</p><p class="depth0">Responsible Supervision and Control Over the Customs Business That it</p><p class="depth0">Conducts</p><p class="depth0">A. Standards of responsible supervision and control shall be issued  by the Commissioner of Customs. Statutory authority to set such  standards is provided by section 1641(f).</p><p class="depth0">Note: All penalties assessed for violation of 1641(b)(4) shall also  cite section 1641(d)(1)(C) as the statute violated in all notices issued  to the alleged violator.</p><p class="depth0">B. The following penalty amounts shall be assessed against brokers  who fail to exercise responsible supervision and control over business  conducted at district level.</p><p class="depth0">1. A penalty of $1,000 against any broker who:</p><p class="depth0">a. Continuously makes the same errors on a particular type of entry;</p><p class="depth0">b. Fails to properly instruct employees about Customs business,  thereby resulting in the filing of incorrect entries or the mishandling  of transactions relating to Customs business;</p><p class="depth0">c. Knowingly allows his entry bond to be used to effect release of  merchandise in districts where he does not have a license or permit  (this is imposed in addition to any penalty for conducting Customs  business without a license);</p><p class="depth0">d. Fails to comply with regulations or procedures but does not  commit violations that would warrant any higher penalty amount as  described below.</p><p class="depth0">2. A penalty of $5,000 against any broker who, when requested, is  unable to produce documents relating to specific Customs business which  are material to that business (e.g., if the business regards an entry he  should have the invoice, packing list, etc.). This requirement excludes  documents not required to be kept by a broker.</p><p class="depth0">3. A penalty of $5,000 against any broker who is unable to satisfy  the deciding Customs official that he has a working knowledge of any  operation material to his ability to render valuable service to others  in the conduct of Customs business.</p><p class="depth0">Examples include:</p><p class="depth0">a. A working knowledge of all automated systems in use in the  district;</p><p class="depth0">b. A knowledge of the cash flow procedures in each district of  operation;</p><p class="depth0">c. Retention of copies of all surety bonds in proper form and in  sufficient dollar amount;</p><p class="depth0">d. Knowledge of filing systems and document record storage in each  district;</p><p class="depth0">e. Continuous monitoring to ensure timely payment of all obligations  including duties, taxes and refunds.</p><p class="depth0">4. A penalty of $5,000 against any broker who fails to exercise  responsible supervision and control over the Customs business that it  conducts as defined in section XI.C. of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">5. A penalty of $10,000 against any broker who is found to have  failed to maintain satisfactory accounting records or records of  documents filed with Customs on any matter.</p><p class="depth0">C. The following factors shall be indicative of a lack of  supervision or lack of working knowledge of Customs procedures (the list  is not conclusive):</p><p class="depth0">1. A high rate of entry rejections when compared with other brokers  in the permitted district.</p><p class="depth0">2. A high rate of late filing liquidated damages cases when compared  with other brokers in the permitted district.</p><p class="depth0">3. In the case of entry summaries filed in the broker's name, a high  number of missing document cases when compared with other brokers in the  permitted district.</p><p class="depth0">4. An inordinate number of entries for which free entry is claimed,  but no documentation supporting such claim is submitted, resulting in  liquidation of the entries as dutiable.</p><p class="depth0">5. Inability to assist or failure to cooperate with an audit,  including failure to provide all records and any other necessary  information pertaining to a broker's Customs business to assist  auditors.</p><p class="depth0">6. Failure to settle (including petitioning) liquidated damages  claims in a timely manner.</p><p class="depth0">7. Evidence to indicate that timely duty refunds to clients are not  made or accounted for and adequate records of same are not kept (usually  will result in penalty assessed in accordance with section B.5. above).</p><p class="depth0">8. Employing a licensed individual for a minimal number of days each  120- or 180-day period (see sections 1641(b)(5) and 1641(c)(3) so as to  avoid violation of the statute.</p><p class="depth0">a. For purposes of imposition of penalties under this subsection, a  minimal number of days shall be 10 working days for each 120-day period  or 15 working days for each 180-day period.</p><p class="depth0">b. It shall be presumed that temporary employment of such a licensed  individual is undertaken solely to avoid revocation of a license or  permit. Such minimal employment shall be prima facie evidence of lack of  supervision.</p><p class="depth0">D. Mitigation.</p><p class="depth0">1. $1,000 penalties shall not be mitigated unless the broker can  show that extraordinary mitigating factors are present.</p><p class="depth0">2. $5,000 penalties for failure to produce documents may be  mitigated to an amount between $2,000 and $3,500 if the documents are  produced but not in a timely fashion. No mitigation shall be afforded if  the documents are not produced, unless the broker can satisfactorily  demonstrate that such failure to produce was caused by circumstances  beyond the control of the broker or his client (e.g., a rupture of  relations with the party responsible for generating the documents). Full  mitigation shall be afforded in the case of destruction of records by  events beyond a broker's control, such as theft, flood, fire or other  acts of God.</p><p class="depth0">3. $5,000 penalty for failure to have a working knowledge of any  operation for which a broker is licensed to do business may be mitigated  to a lesser amount upon a showing by the broker that steps have been  taken to improve instruction and supervision of employees and an  improvement in the knowledge of his operation occurs.</p><p class="depth0">4. $5,000 penalty for failure to exercise responsible supervision  and control may be mitigated to a lesser amount if the broker  immediately corrects the problem which was the basis for the assessment  and sufficiently monitors the situation to avoid recurrence.</p><p class="depth0">5. $10,000 penalty for failure to maintain satisfactory accounting  records will only be subject to mitigation in full if the broker can  prove that satisfactory accounting records and documents records are  being kept. Mitigation in a lesser degree may be afforded upon a showing  by the broker that a bona fide attempt was made to establish a  satisfactory accounting and/or recordkeeping system, or upgrade a  deficient system, but such efforts proved unsuccessful or only partially  effective.</p><p class="depth0">6. Penalty equal to the value of monies not properly paid or  accounted for.</p><p class="depth0">a. If the broker shows that the monies were paid or accounted for  and requisite notifications were made, albeit in an untimely fashion not  to exceed 30 days after any due date, the penalty may be mitigated upon  payment of 25 percent of the assessed amount, but no less than $250.</p><p class="depth0">b. If the monies were paid and notifications made more than 30 days  after any due date, the penalty may be mitigated upon payment of 50  percent of the assessed amount, but not less than $1,000.</p><p class="depth0">c. If there is no proof of proper payment of duties, refunds, etc.,  no mitigation shall be granted.</p><p class="depth0">XII. Limits of Penalty Assessments</p><p class="depth0">A. A broker shall be penalized a maximum of $30,000 for any  violation or violations of the statute in any one penalty notice.</p><p class="depth0">B. If a broker is penalized to the maximum the statute will allow  and continues to commit the same violation or violations, revocation or  suspension of his license would be the appropriate sanction. Barring  such revocation or suspension action, he may again be penalized to the  maximum the statute will allow.</p><p class="depth0">C. From any one audit, the maximum aggregate penalty for all  violations discovered is $30,000.</p><p class="depth0">XIII. Consolidation of Cases</p><p class="depth0">Whenever multiple penalties arising from a particular fact situation  or pattern are contemplated against brokers or individuals operating in  different districts, the cases may be consolidated in one district.  Approval for consolidation must be sought from the Trade Policy and  Programs, Office of International Trade.  [T.D. 90-20, 55 FR 10056, Mar. 19, 1990, as amended by T.D. 97-82, 62 FR  51771, Oct. 3, 1997; T.D. 99-27, 64 FR 13676, Mar. 22, 1999; T.D. 00-57,  65 FR 53578, Sept. 5, 2000; 65 FR 65770, Nov. 2, 2000]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix D to Part 171--Guidelines for the Imposition and</p><p class="depth0">Mitigation of Penalties for Violations of 19 U.S.C. 1593a</p><p class="depth0">A monetary penalty incurred under section 593A, Tariff Act of 1930,  as amended (19 U.S.C. 1593a; hereinafter referred to as section 593A),  may be remitted or mitigated under section 618, Tariff Act of 1930, as  amended (19 U.S.C. 1618; hereinafter referred to as section 618), if it  is determined that there exist such mitigating circumstances as to  justify remission or mitigation. The guidelines below will be used by  Customs in arriving at a just and reasonable assessment and disposition  of liabilities arising under section 593A within the stated limitations.  It is intended that these guidelines will be applied by Customs officers  in prepenalty proceedings, in determining the monetary penalty assessed  in the penalty notice, and in arriving at a final penalty disposition.  The assessed or mitigated penalty amount set forth in Customs  administrative disposition determined in accordance with these  guidelines does not limit the penalty amount which the Government may  seek in bringing a civil enforcement action pursuant to 19 U.S.C.  1593a(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Violations of Section 593A</p><p class="depth0">A violation of section 593A occurs when a person, through fraud or  negligence, seeks, induces, or affects, or attempts to seek, induce, or  affect, the payment or credit to that person or others of any drawback  claim by means of any document, written or oral statement, or  electronically transmitted data or information, or act which is material  and false, or any omission which is material, or aids or abets any other  person in the foregoing violation. There is no violation if the falsity  is due solely to clerical error or mistake of fact unless the error or  mistake is part of a pattern of negligent conduct. Also, the mere  nonintentional repetition by an electronic system of an initial clerical  error will not constitute a pattern of negligent conduct. Nevertheless,  if Customs has drawn the person's attention to the nonintentional  repetition by an electronic system of an initial clerical error,  subsequent failure to correct the error could constitute a violation of  section 593A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Degrees of Culpability</p><p class="depth0">There are two degrees of culpability under section 593A: negligence  and fraud.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Negligence. A violation is determined to be negligent if it  results from an act or acts (of commission or omission) done with actual  knowledge of, or wanton disregard for, the relevant facts and with  indifference to, or disregard for, the offender's obligations under the  statute or done through the failure to exercise the degree of reasonable  care and competence expected from a person in the same circumstances in  ascertaining the facts or in drawing inferences from those facts, in  ascertaining the offender's obligations under the statute, or in  communicating information so that it may be understood by the recipient.  As a general rule, a violation is determined to be negligent if it  results from the offender's failure to exercise reasonable care and  competence to ensure that a statement made is correct.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fraud. A violation is determined to be fraudulent if the  material false statement, omission or act in connection with the  transaction was committed (or omitted) knowingly, i.e., was done  voluntarily and intentionally, as established by clear and convincing  evidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Assessment of Penalties</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Issuance of Prepenalty Notice. As provided in Sec. 162.77a of  the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 162.77a), if Customs has reasonable  cause to believe that a violation of section 593A has occurred and  determines that further proceedings are warranted, a notice of intent to  issue a claim for a monetary penalty will be issued to the person  concerned.   In issuing such prepenalty notice, the appropriate Customs field officer  will make a tentative determination of the degree of culpability and the  amount of the proposed claim. A prepenalty notice will not be issued if  the claim does not exceed $1,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Issuance of Penalty Notice. After considering representations,  if any, made by the person concerned pursuant to the notice issued under  paragraph (C)(1), the appropriate Customs field officer will determine  whether any violation described in section (A) has occurred. If a notice  was issued under paragraph (C)(1) and the appropriate Customs field  officer determines that there was no violation, Customs will promptly  issue a written statement of the determination to the person to whom the  notice was sent. If the appropriate Customs field officer determines  that there was a violation, Customs will issue a written penalty claim  to the person concerned. The written penalty claim will specify all  changes in the information provided in the prepenalty notice issued  under paragraph (C)(1). The person to whom the penalty notice is issued  will have a reasonable opportunity under section 618 to make  representations, both oral and written, seeking remission or mitigation  of the monetary penalty. At the conclusion of any proceeding under  section 618, Customs will provide to the person concerned a written  statement which sets forth the final determination and the findings of  fact and conclusions of law on which such determination is based.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Maximum Penalties</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Fraud. In the case of a fraudulent violation of section 593A,  the monetary penalty will be in an amount not to exceed 3 times the  actual or potential loss of revenue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Negligence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In General. In the case of a negligent violation of section  593A, the monetary penalty will be in an amount not to exceed 20 percent  of the actual or potential loss of revenue for the first violation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Repetitive Violations. For the first negligent violation that is  repetitive (i.e., involves the same issue and the same violator), the  penalty will be in an amount not to exceed 50 percent of the actual or  potential loss of revenue. The penalty for a second and each subsequent  repetitive negligent violation will be in an amount not to exceed the  actual or potential loss of revenue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Prior Disclosure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In General. Subject to paragraph (D)(3)(b), if the person  concerned discloses the circumstances of a violation of section 593A  before, or without knowledge of the commencement of, a formal  investigation of such violation, the monetary penalty assessed under  this Appendix will not exceed:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of fraud, an amount equal to the actual or potential  revenue of which the United States is or may be deprived as a result of  overpayment of the claim; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the violation resulted from negligence, an amount equal to  the interest computed on the basis of the prevailing rate of interest  applied under 26 U.S.C. 6621 on the amount of actual revenue of which  the United States is or may be deprived during the period that begins on  the date of overpayment of the claim and ends on the date on which the  person concerned tenders the amount of the overpayment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Condition Affecting Penalty Limitations. The limitations in  paragraph (D)(3)(a) on the amount of the monetary penalty to be assessed  apply only if the person concerned tenders the amount of the overpayment  made on the claim either at the time of the disclosure or within 30 days  (or such longer period as Customs may provide) from the date of notice  by Customs of its calculation of the amount of overpayment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Burden of Proof. The person asserting lack of knowledge of the  commencement of a formal investigation has the burden of proof in  establishing such lack of knowledge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Commencement of Investigation. For purposes of this Appendix, a  formal investigation of a violation is considered to be commenced with  regard to the disclosing party, and with regard to the disclosed  information, on the date recorded in writing by Customs as the date on  which facts and circumstances were discovered which caused Customs to  believe that a possibility of a violation of section 593A existed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Exclusivity. Penalty claims under section D will be the  exclusive civil remedy for any drawback-related violation of section  593A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Deprivation of Lawful Revenue</p><p class="depth0">Notwithstanding section 514, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19  U.S.C. 1514), if the United States has been deprived of lawful duties  and taxes resulting from a violation of section 593A, Customs will  require that such duties and taxes be restored whether or not a monetary  penalty is assessed.  (F) Final Disposition of Penalty Cases When the Drawback Claimant Is Not</p><p class="depth0">a Certified Participant in the Drawback Compliance Program</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In General. Customs will consider all information in the  petition and all available evidence, taking into account any mitigating,  aggravating, and extraordinary factors, in determining the final  assessed penalty. All factors considered should be stated in the  decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Penalty Disposition When There Has Been No Prior Disclosure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Nonrepetitive Negligent Violation. The final penalty disposition  will be in an   amount ranging from a minimum of 10 percent of the actual or potential  loss of revenue to a maximum of 20 percent of the actual or potential  loss of revenue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Repetitive Negligent Violation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> First Repetitive Negligent Violation. The final penalty  disposition will be in an amount ranging from a minimum of 25 percent of  the actual or potential loss of revenue to a maximum of 50 percent of  the actual or potential loss of revenue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Second and Each Subsequent Repetitive Negligent Violation. The  final penalty disposition will be in an amount ranging from a minimum of  50 percent of the actual or potential loss of revenue to a maximum of  100 percent of the actual or potential loss of revenue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Fraudulent Violation. The final penalty disposition will be in  an amount ranging from a minimum of 1.5 times the actual or potential  loss of revenue to a maximum of 3 times the actual or potential loss of  revenue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Penalty Disposition When There Has Been a Prior Disclosure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(ii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Fraudulent Violation. The final penalty disposition will be in  an amount equal to 100 percent of the actual or potential loss of  revenue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Mitigating Factors. The following factors will be considered in  mitigation of the proposed or assessed penalty claim or final penalty  amount, provided that the case record sufficiently establishes their  existence. The list is not exclusive.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Contributory Customs Error. This factor includes misleading or  erroneous advice given by a Customs official in writing to the alleged  violator, but this factor may be applied in such a case only if it  appears that the alleged violator reasonably relied upon the written  information and the alleged violator fully and accurately informed  Customs of all relevant facts. The concept of comparative negligence may  be utilized in determining the weight to be assigned to this factor. If  the Customs error contributed to the violation, but the alleged violator  is also culpable, the Customs error is to be considered as a mitigating  factor. If it is determined that the Customs error was the sole cause of  the violation, the proposed or assessed penalty is to be cancelled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Cooperation With the Investigation. To obtain the benefits of  this factor, the alleged violator must exhibit cooperation beyond that  expected from a person under investigation for a Customs violation. An  example of the cooperation contemplated includes assisting Customs  officers to an unusual degree in auditing the books and records of the  alleged violator (e.g., incurring extraordinary expenses in providing  computer runs solely for submission to Customs to assist the agency in  cases involving an unusually large number of entries and/or complex  issues). Another example consists of assisting Customs in obtaining  additional information relating to the subject violation or other  violations. Merely providing the books and records of the alleged  violator may not be considered cooperation justifying mitigation  inasmuch as Customs has the right to examine an importer's books and  records pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1508-1509.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Immediate Remedial Action. This factor includes the payment of  the actual loss of revenue prior to the issuance of a penalty notice and  within 30 days after Customs notifies the alleged violator of the actual  loss of revenue attributable to the violation. In appropriate cases,  where the alleged violator provides evidence that, immediately after  learning of the violation, substantial remedial action was taken to  correct organizational or procedural defects, immediate remedial action  may be granted as a mitigating factor. Customs encourages immediate  remedial action to ensure against future incidents of non-compliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Prior Good Record. Prior good record is a factor only if the  alleged violator is able to demonstrate a consistent pattern of filing  drawback claims without violation of section 593A, or any other statute  prohibiting the making or filing of a false statement or document in  connection with a drawback claim. This factor will not be considered in  alleged fraudulent violations of section 593A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Inability to Pay the Customs Penalty. The party claiming the  existence of this factor must present documentary evidence in support  thereof, including copies of income tax returns for the previous 3 years  and an audited financial statement for the most recent fiscal quarter.  In certain cases, Customs may waive the production of an audited  financial statement or may request alternative or additional financial  data in order to facilitate an analysis of a claim of inability to pay  (e.g., examination of the financial records of a foreign entity related  to the U.S. company claiming inability to pay). In addition, the alleged  violator must present information reflecting ownership and related  domestic and foreign parties and must provide information reflecting its  current financial condition, including books and records of account,  bank statements, other tax records (for example, sales tax returns) and  a list of assets with current values; if the alleged violator is a  closely held corporation, similar current financial information must be  provided on the shareholders, wherever they are located.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Customs Knowledge. This factor may be used in non-fraud cases  (which also are not the subject of a criminal investigation) if it is  determined that Customs had actual knowledge of a violation and failed,  without justification, to inform the violator so that   it could have taken earlier remedial action. This factor is not  applicable when a substantial delay in the investigation is attributable  to the alleged violator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Aggravating Factors. Certain factors may be determined to be  aggravating factors in calculating the amount of the proposed or  assessed penalty claim or the amount of the final administrative  penalty. The presence of one or more aggravating factors may not be used  to raise the level of culpability attributable to the alleged  violations, but may be used to offset the presence of mitigating  factors. The following factors will be considered ``aggravating  factors'', provided that the case record sufficiently establishes their  existence. The list is not exclusive.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Obstructing an investigation or audit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Withholding evidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Providing misleading information concerning the violation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Prior substantive violations of section 593A for which a final  administrative finding of culpability has been made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Failure to comply with a Customs summons or lawful demand for  records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Drawback Compliance Program Participants</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In General. Special alternative procedures and penalty  assessment standards apply in the case of negligent violations of  section 593A committed by persons who are certified as participants in  the Customs drawback compliance program and who are generally in  compliance with the procedures and requirements of that program.  Provisions regarding the operation of the drawback compliance program  are set forth in part 191 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR part 191).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Alternatives to Penalties. When a participant described in  paragraph (G)(1) commits a violation of section 593A, in the absence of  fraud or repeated violations and in lieu of a monetary penalty, Customs  will issue a written notice of the violation (warning letter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Contents of Notice. The notice will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> State that the person has violated section 593A;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Explain the nature of the violation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Warn the person that future violations of section 593A may  result in the imposition of monetary penalties and that repetitive  violations may result in removal of certification under the drawback  compliance program until the person takes corrective action that is  satisfactory to Customs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(2)(ii))</em>. If the person fails to provide  the required notification in a timely manner, any penalty assessed for a  repetitive violation under paragraph (G)(3) will not be subject to  mitigation under this Appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Repetitive Violations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In General. A person who has been issued a written notice under  paragraph (G)(2) and who subsequently commits a negligent violation that  is repetitive (i.e., involves the same issue), and any other person who  is a participant described in paragraph (G)(1) and who commits a  repetitive negligent violation, is subject to one of the following  monetary penalties:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An amount not to exceed 20 percent of the loss of revenue for  the first repetitive violation that occurs within three years from the  date of the violation of which it is repetitive;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An amount not to exceed 50 percent of the loss of revenue for  the second repetitive violation that occurs within three years from the  date of the first of two violations of which it is repetitive ; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An amount not to exceed 100 percent of the loss of revenue for  the third and each subsequent repetitive violation that occurs within  three years from the date of the first of three or more violations of  which it is repetitive.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Repetitive Violations Outside 3-Year Period. If a participant  described in paragraph (G)(1) commits a negligent violation that is  repetitive but that did not occur within 3 years of the violation of  which it is repetitive, the new violation will be treated as a first  violation for which a written notice will be issued in accordance with  paragraph (G)(2), and each repetitive violation subsequent to that  violation that occurs within any 3-year period described in paragraph  (G)(3)(a) will result in the assessment of the applicable monetary  penalty prescribed in that paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Final Penalty Disposition When There Has Been No Prior  Disclosure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In General. Customs will consider all information in the  petition and all available evidence, taking into account any mitigating  factors (see paragraph (F)(4)), aggravating factors (see paragraph  (F)(5)), and extraordinary factors in determining the final assessed  penalty. All factors considered should be stated in the decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> First Repetitive Negligent Violation Within 3 Years of Violation  Handled Under Paragraph (G)(2). The final penalty disposition will be in  an amount ranging from a minimum of 10 percent of the loss of revenue to  a maximum of 20 percent of the loss of revenue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Second Repetitive Negligent Violation Within 3 Years of  Violation Handled Under Paragraph (G)(2) or (G)(3). The final penalty  disposition will be in an amount ranging from a minimum of 25 percent of  the loss of revenue to a maximum of 50 percent of the loss of revenue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Third and Each Subsequent Repetitive Negligent Violation Within  3 Years of Violation Handled Under Paragraph (G)(2) or (G)(3). The final  penalty disposition will be in an amount ranging from a minimum of 50  percent of the loss of revenue to a maximum of 100 percent of the loss  of revenue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Fraudulent Violations. The final penalty disposition will be  determined in the same manner as in the case of fraudulent violations  committed by persons who are not participants in the drawback compliance  program (see paragraph (F)(2)(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Final Penalty Disposition When There Has Been A Prior  Disclosure. The final penalty disposition will be determined in the same  manner as in the case of persons who are not participants in the  drawback compliance program (see paragraph (F)(3)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Violations by Small Entities</p><p class="depth0">In compliance with the mandate of the Small Business Regulatory  Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, under appropriate circumstances, the  issuance of a penalty under section 593A may be waived for businesses  qualifying as small business entities. Procedures that were established  for small business entities regarding violations of 19 U.S.C. 1592 in  Treasury Decision 97-46 published in the Federal Register (62 FR 30378)  are also applicable for small entities regarding violations of section  593A.
