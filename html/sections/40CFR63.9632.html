                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For each negative pressure baghouse or positive pressure baghouse equipped with a stack, applied to meet any particulate emission limit in Table 1 to this subpart, you must install, operate, and maintain a bag leak detection system according to the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (8) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The system must be certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting emissions of particulate matter at concentrations of 10 milligrams per actual cubic meter (0.0044 grains per actual cubic foot) or less.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The system must provide output of relative changes in particulate matter loadings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The system must be equipped with an alarm that will sound when an increase in relative particulate loadings is detected over the alarm level set point established according to paragraph (a)(4) of this section. The alarm must be located such that it can be heard by the appropriate plant personnel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For each bag leak detection system, you must develop and submit to the Administrator for approval, a site-

specific monitoring plan that addresses the items identified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (v) of this section. For each bag leak detection system that operates based on the triboelectric effect, the monitoring plan shall be consistent with the recommendations contained in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) guidance document, ``Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance'' (EPA-454/R-98-015). This document is available on the EPA's Technology Transfer Network at http://www.epa.gov/ttn/emc/cem/tribo.pdf (Adobe Acrobat version) or http://www.epa.gov/ttn/emc/cem/tribo.wpd (WordPerfect version). You must operate and maintain the bag leak detection system according to the site-specific monitoring plan at all times. The plan shall describe all of the items in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (v) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Installation of the bag leak detection system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Initial and periodic adjustment of the bag leak detection system including how the alarm set-point will be established.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Operation of the bag leak detection system including quality assurance procedures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> How the bag leak detection system will be maintained including a routine maintenance schedule and spare parts inventory list.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> How the bag leak detection system output shall be recorded and stored.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> To make the initial adjustment of the system, establish the baseline output by adjusting the sensitivity (range) and the averaging period of the device. Then, establish the alarm set points and the alarm delay time (if applicable).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Following initial adjustment, do not adjust averaging period, alarm set point, or alarm delay time, without approval from the Administrator except as provided for in paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Once per quarter, you may adjust the sensitivity of the bag leak detection system to account for seasonal effects, including temperature and humidity, according to the procedures identified in the site-specific monitoring plan required under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Where multiple detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The bag leak detector sensor must be installed downstream of the baghouse and upstream of any wet scrubber.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For each CPMS required in Sec. 63.9631, you must develop and make available for inspection upon request by the permitting authority a site-specific monitoring plan that addresses the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Installation of the CPMS sampling probe or other interface at a measurement location relative to each affected emission unit such that the measurement is representative of control of the exhaust emissions (e.g., on or downstream of the last control device).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Performance and equipment specifications for the sample interface, the parametric signal analyzer, and the data collection and reduction system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Performance evaluation procedures and acceptance criteria (e.g., calibrations).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Ongoing operation and maintenance procedures in accordance with the general requirements of Sec. 63.8(c)(1), (3), (4)(ii), (7), and (8).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Ongoing data quality assurance procedures in accordance with the general requirements of Sec. 63.8(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Ongoing recordkeeping and reporting procedures in accordance with the general requirements of Sec. 63.10(c), (e)(1), and (e)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Corrective action procedures that you will follow in the event an air pollution control device, except for a baghouse, exceeds an established operating limit as required in Sec. 63.9600(b)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unless otherwise specified, each CPMS must meet the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each CPMS must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation for each successive 15-minute period and must have valid data for at least 95 percent of every daily averaging period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each CPMS must determine and record the daily average of all recorded readings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You must conduct a performance evaluation of each CPMS in accordance with your site-specific monitoring plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You must operate and maintain the CPMS in continuous operation according to the site-specific monitoring plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For each dry electrostatic precipitator subject to the opacity operating limit in Sec. 63.9590(b)(3)(i), you must install, operate, and maintain each COMS according to the requirements in paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must install each COMS and conduct a performance evaluation of each COMS according to Sec. 63.8 and Performance Specification 1 in appendix B to 40 CFR part 60.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must develop and implement a quality control program for operating and maintaining each COMS according to Sec. 63.8. At a minimum, the quality control program must include a daily calibration drift assessment, quarterly performance audit, and annual zero alignment of each COMS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must operate and maintain each COMS according to Sec. 63.8(e) and your quality control program. You must also identify periods the COMS is out of control, including any periods that the COMS fails to pass a daily calibration drift assessment, quarterly performance audit, or annual zero alignment audit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You must determine and record the 6-minute average opacity for periods during which the COMS is not out of control.</p>
