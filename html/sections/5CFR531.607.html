                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Apply the following methods to convert an annual locality rate  to an hourly, daily, weekly, or biweekly rate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To derive an hourly rate, divide the annual locality rate by  2,087 and round to the nearest cent, counting one-half cent and over as  the next higher cent.  Example: Annual locality rate = $50,000 Computation of hourly rate: $50,000 / 2,087 = 23.957 or $23.96.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To derive a daily rate, multiply the hourly rate by the number  of daily hours of service required by the employee's basic daily tour of  duty.  Example: Hourly rate = $23.96 Daily hours = 8 Computation of daily rate: $23.96 x 8 = $191.68</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To derive a weekly or biweekly rate, multiply the hourly rate by  40 or 80, as applicable.  Example: Hourly rate = $23.96 Biweekly hours = 80 Computation of biweekly rate: $23.96 x 80 = $1,916.80</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, for a firefighter  whose pay is computed under 5 U.S.C. 5545b, a firefighter hourly  locality rate is computed using a divisor of 2,756 hours instead of  2,087, as prescribed in 5 CFR part 550, subpart M. Also, such a  firefighter's weekly and biweekly locality rates must be based on the  firefighter's extended tour of duty as prescribed in that subpart.  [70 FR 31304, May 31, 2005]</p>
