                                Sec. 26.2642-6  Qualified severance.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. If a trust is divided in a qualified severance into  two or more trusts, the separate trusts resulting from the severance  will be treated as separate trusts for generation-skipping transfer  (GST) tax purposes and the inclusion ratio of each new resulting trust  may differ from the inclusion ratio of the original trust. Because the  post-severance resulting trusts are treated as separate trusts for GST  tax purposes, certain actions with respect to one resulting trust will  generally have no GST tax impact with respect to the other resulting  trust(s). For example, GST exemption allocated to one resulting trust  will not impact on the inclusion ratio of the other resulting trust(s);  a GST tax election made with respect to one resulting trust will not  apply to the other resulting trust(s); the occurrence of a taxable  distribution or termination with regard to a particular resulting trust  will not have any GST tax impact on any other trust resulting from that  severance. In general, the rules in this section are applicable only for  purposes of the GST tax and are not applicable in determining, for  example, whether the resulting trusts may file separate income tax  returns or whether the severance may result in a gift subject to gift  tax, may cause any trust to be included in the gross estate of a  beneficiary, or may result in a realization of gain for purposes of  section 1001. See Sec. 1.1001-1(h) of this chapter for rules relating  to whether a qualified severance will constitute an exchange of property  for other property differing materially either in kind or in extent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b))</em> into two or more separate trusts that meets each  of the requirements in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effective date of qualified severance. A qualified severance is  applicable as of the date of the severance, as defined in Sec. 26.2642- 6(d)(3), and the resulting trusts are treated as separate trusts for GST  tax purposes as of that date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Requirements for a qualified severance. For purposes of this  section, a qualified severance must satisfy each of the following  requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The single trust is severed pursuant to the terms of the  governing instrument, or pursuant to applicable local law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The severance is effective under local law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The date of severance is either the date selected by the trustee  as of which the trust assets are to be valued in order to determine the  funding of the resulting trusts, or the court-imposed date of funding in  the case of an order of the local court with jurisdiction over the trust  ordering the trustee to fund the resulting trusts on or as of a specific  date. For a date to satisfy the definition in the preceding sentence,  however, the funding must be commenced immediately upon, and funding  must occur within a reasonable time (but in no event more than 90 days)  after, the selected valuation date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The single trust (original trust) is severed on a fractional  basis, such that each new trust (resulting trust) is funded with a  fraction or percentage of the original trust, and the sum of those  fractions or percentages is one or one hundred percent, respectively.  For this purpose, the fraction or percentage may be determined by means  of a formula (for example, that fraction of the trust the numerator of  which is equal to the transferor's unused GST tax exemption, and the  denominator of which is the fair market value of the original trust's  assets on the date of severance). The severance of a trust based on a  pecuniary amount does not satisfy this requirement. For example, the  severance of a trust is not a qualified severance if the trust is  divided into two trusts, with one trust to be funded with $1,500,000 and  the other trust to be funded with the balance of the original trust's  assets. With respect to the particular assets to be distributed to each  separate trust resulting from the severance, each such trust may be  funded with the appropriate fraction or percentage (pro rata portion) of  each asset held by the original trust. Alternatively, the assets may be  divided among the resulting trusts on a non-pro rata basis, based on the  fair market value of the assets on the date of severance. However, if a  resulting trust is funded on a non-pro rata basis, each asset received  by a resulting trust must be valued, solely for funding purposes, by  multiplying the fair market value of the asset held in the original  trust as of the date of severance by the fraction or percentage of that  asset received by that resulting trust. Thus, the assets must be valued  without taking into account any discount or premium arising from the  severance, for example, any valuation discounts that might arise because  the resulting trust receives less than the entire interest held by the  original trust. See paragraph (j), Example 6 of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The terms of the resulting trusts must provide, in the  aggregate, for the same succession of interests of beneficiaries as are  provided in the original trust. This requirement is satisfied if the  beneficiaries of the separate resulting trusts and the interests of the  beneficiaries with respect to the separate trusts, when the separate  trusts are viewed collectively, are the same as the beneficiaries and  their respective beneficial interests with respect to the original trust  before severance. With respect to trusts from which discretionary  distributions may be made to any one or more beneficiaries on a non-pro  rata basis, this requirement is satisfied if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The terms of each of the resulting trusts are the same as the  terms of the original trust (even though each permissible distributee of  the original trust is not a beneficiary of all of the resulting trusts);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each beneficiary's interest in the resulting trusts  (collectively) equals the beneficiary's interest in the original trust,  determined by the terms of the trust instrument or, if none, on a per- capita basis. For example, in the case of the severance of a  discretionary   trust established for the benefit of A, B, and C and their descendants  with the remainder to be divided equally among those three families,  this requirement is satisfied if the trust is divided into three  separate trusts of equal value with one trust established for the  benefit of A and A's descendants, one trust for the benefit of B and B's  descendants, and one trust for the benefit of C and C's descendants;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The severance does not shift a beneficial interest in the  trust to any beneficiary in a lower generation (as determined under  section 2651) than the person or persons who held the beneficial  interest in the original trust; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The severance does not extend the time for the vesting of any  beneficial interest in the trust beyond the period provided for in (or  applicable to) the original trust.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In the case of a qualified severance of a trust with an  inclusion ratio as defined in Sec. 26.2642-1 of either one or zero,  each trust resulting from the severance will have an inclusion ratio  equal to the inclusion ratio of the original trust.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a qualified severance occurring after GST tax  exemption has been allocated to the trust (whether by an affirmative  allocation, a deemed allocation, or an automatic allocation pursuant to  the rules contained in section 2632), if the trust has an inclusion  ratio as defined in Sec. 26.2642-1 that is greater than zero and less  than one, then either paragraph (d)(7)(ii) or (iii) of this section must  be satisfied.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The trust is severed initially into only two resulting trusts.  One resulting trust must receive that fractional share of the total  value of the original trust as of the date of severance that is equal to  the applicable fraction, as defined in Sec. 26.2642-1(b) and (c), used  to determine the inclusion ratio of the original trust immediately  before the severance. The other resulting trust must receive that  fractional share of the total value of the original trust as of the date  of severance that is equal to the excess of one over the fractional  share described in the preceding sentence. The trust receiving the  fractional share equal to the applicable fraction shall have an  inclusion ratio of zero, and the other trust shall have an inclusion  ratio of one. If the applicable fraction with respect to the original  trust is .50, then, with respect to the two equal trusts resulting from  the severance, the trustee may designate which of the resulting trusts  will have an inclusion ratio of zero and which will have an inclusion  ratio of one. Each separate trust resulting from the severance then may  be further divided in accordance with the rules of this section. See  paragraph (j), Example 7, of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The trust is severed initially into more than two resulting  trusts. One or more of the resulting trusts in the aggregate must  receive that fractional share of the total value of the original trust  as of the date of severance that is equal to the applicable fraction  used to determine the inclusion ratio of the original trust immediately  before the severance. The trust or trusts receiving such fractional  share shall have an inclusion ratio of zero, and each of the other  resulting trust or trusts shall have an inclusion ratio of one. (If,  however, two or more of the resulting trusts each receives the  fractional share of the total value of the original trust equal to the  applicable fraction, the trustee may designate which of those resulting  trusts will have an inclusion ratio of zero and which will have an  inclusion ratio of one.) The resulting trust or trusts with an inclusion  ratio of one must receive in the aggregate that fractional share of the  total value of the original trust as of the date of severance that is  equal to the excess of one over the fractional share described in the  second sentence of this paragraph. See paragraph (j), Example 9, of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Reporting a qualified severance--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A qualified  severance is reported by filing Form 706-GS(T), ``Generation-Skipping  Transfer Tax Return for Terminations,'' (or such other form as may be  provided from time to time by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the  purpose of reporting a qualified severance). Unless otherwise provided  in the applicable form or instructions, the IRS requests that the filer  write ``Qualified Severance''   at the top of the form and attach a Notice of Qualified Severance  (Notice). The return and attached Notice should be filed by April 15th  of the year immediately following the year during which the severance  occurred or by the last day of the period covered by an extension of  time, if an extension of time is granted, to file such form.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Information concerning the original trust. The Notice should  provide, with respect to the original trust that was severed--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name of the transferor;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The name and date of creation of the original trust;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The tax identification number of the original trust; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The inclusion ratio before the severance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Information concerning each new trust. The Notice should  provide, with respect to each of the resulting trusts created by the  severance--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name and tax identification number of the trust;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date of severance (within the meaning of paragraph (c) of  this section);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The fraction of the total assets of the original trust  received by the resulting trust;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Other details explaining the basis for the funding of the  resulting trust (a fraction of the total fair market value of the assets  on the date of severance, or a fraction of each asset); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The inclusion ratio.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Time for making a qualified severance. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A qualified severance  of a trust may occur at any time prior to the termination of the trust.  Thus, provided that the separate resulting trusts continue in existence  after the severance, a qualified severance may occur either before or  after--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> GST tax exemption has been allocated to the trust;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A taxable event has occurred with respect to the trust; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An addition has been made to the trust.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Because a qualified severance is effective as of the date of  severance, a qualified severance has no effect on a taxable termination  as defined in section 2612(a) or a taxable distribution as defined in  section 2612(b) that occurred prior to the date of severance. A  qualified severance shall be deemed to occur before a taxable  termination or a taxable distribution that occurs by reason of the  qualified severance. See paragraph (j) Example 8 of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Trusts that were irrevocable on September 25, 1985--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In  general. See Sec. 26.2601-1(b)(4) for rules regarding severances and  other actions with respect to trusts that were irrevocable on September  25, 1985.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Trusts in receipt of a post-September 25, 1985, addition. A  trust described in Sec. 26.2601-1(b)(1)(iv)(A) that is deemed for GST  tax purposes to consist of one separate share not subject to GST tax  (the non-chapter 13 portion) with an inclusion ratio of zero, and one  separate share subject to GST tax (the chapter 13 portion) with an  inclusion ratio determined under section 2642, may be severed into two  trusts in accordance with Sec. 26.2654-1(a)(3). One resulting trust  will hold the non-chapter 13 portion of the original trust (the non- chapter 13 trust) and will not be subject to GST tax, and the other  resulting trust will hold the chapter 13 portion of the original trust  (the chapter 13 trust) and will have the same inclusion ratio as the  chapter 13 portion immediately prior to the severance. The chapter 13  trust may be further divided in a qualified severance in accordance with  the rules of this section. The non-chapter 13 trust may be further  divided in accordance with the rules of Sec. 26.2601-1(b)(4).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em>, however, will have the same inclusion ratio  immediately after the severance as that of the original trust  immediately before the severance. (See Sec. 26.2654-1 for the inclusion  ratio of each trust resulting from a severance described in that  section.) Further, any trust resulting from a nonqualified severance may  be severed subsequently, pursuant to a qualified severance described in  this Sec. 26.2642-6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Examples. The rules of this section are illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Succession of interests. T dies in 2006. T's will  establishes a testamentary trust (Trust) providing that income is to be  paid to T's sister, S, for her life. On S's death, one-half of the  corpus is to be paid to T's child, C (or to C's estate if C fails to  survive S), and one-half of the corpus is to be paid to T's grandchild,  GC (or to GC's estate if GC fails to survive S). On the Form 706,  ``United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return,''  filed for T's estate, T's executor allocates all of T's available GST  tax exemption to other transfers and trusts, such that Trust's inclusion  ratio is 1. Subsequent to filing the Form 706 in 2007 and in accordance  with applicable state law, the trustee divides Trust into two separate  trusts, Trust 1 and Trust 2, with each trust receiving 50 percent of the  value of the assets of the original trust as of the date of severance.  Trust 1 provides that trust income is to be paid to S for life with  remainder to C or C's estate, and Trust 2 provides that trust income is  to be paid to S for life with remainder to GC or GC's estate. Because  Trust 1 and Trust 2 provide for the same succession of interests in the  aggregate as provided in the original trust, the severance constitutes a  qualified severance, provided that all other requirements of section  2642(a)(3) and this section are satisfied.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Succession of interests in discretionary trust. In 2006,  T establishes Trust, an irrevocable trust providing that income may be  paid from time to time in such amounts as the trustee deems advisable to  any one or more members of the group consisting of T's children (A and  B) and their respective descendants. In addition, the trustee may  distribute corpus to any trust beneficiary in such amounts as the  trustee deems advisable. On the death of the last to die of A and B, the  trust is to terminate and the corpus is to be distributed in two equal  shares, one share to the then-living descendants of each child, per  stirpes. T elects, under section 2632(c)(5), to not have the automatic  allocation rules contained in section 2632(c) apply with respect to T's  transfers to Trust, and T does not otherwise allocate GST tax exemption  with respect to Trust. As a result, Trust has an inclusion ratio of one.  In 2008, the trustee of Trust, pursuant to applicable state law, divides  Trust into two equal but separate trusts, Trust 1 and Trust 2, each of  which has terms identical to the terms of Trust except for the identity  of the beneficiaries. Trust 1 and Trust 2 each has an inclusion ratio of  one. Trust 1 provides that income is to be paid in such amounts as the  trustee deems advisable to A and A's descendants. In addition, the  trustee may distribute corpus to any trust beneficiary in such amounts  as the trustee deems advisable. On the death of A, Trust 1 is to  terminate and the corpus is to be distributed to the then-living  descendants of A, per stirpes, but, if A dies with no living  descendants, the principal will be added to Trust 2. Trust 2 contains  identical provisions, except that B and B's descendants are the trust  beneficiaries and, if B dies with no living descendants, the principal  will be added to Trust 1. Trust 1 and Trust 2 in the aggregate provide  for the same beneficiaries and the same succession of interests as  provided in Trust, and the severance does not shift any beneficial  interest to a beneficiary who occupies a lower generation than the  person or persons who held the beneficial interest in Trust.  Accordingly, the severance constitutes a qualified severance, provided  that all other requirements of section 2642(a)(3) and this section are  satisfied.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Severance based on actuarial value of beneficial  interests. In 2004, T establishes Trust, an irrevocable trust providing  that income is to be paid to T's child C during C's lifetime. Upon C's  death, Trust is to terminate and the assets of Trust are to be paid to  GC, C's child, if living, or, if GC is not then living, to GC's estate.  T properly elects, under section 2632(c)(5), not to have the automatic  allocation rules contained in section 2632(c) apply with respect to T's  transfers to Trust, and T does not otherwise allocate GST tax exemption  with respect to Trust. Thus, Trust has an inclusion ratio of one. In  2009, the trustee of Trust, pursuant to applicable state law, divides  Trust into two separate trusts, Trust 1 for the benefit of C (and on C's  death to C's estate), and Trust 2 for the benefit of GC (and on GC's  death to GC's estate). The document severing Trust directs that Trust 1  is to be funded with an amount equal to the actuarial value of C's  interest in Trust prior to the severance, determined under section 7520  of the Internal Revenue Code. Similarly, Trust 2 is to be funded with an  amount equal to the actuarial value of GC's interest in Trust prior to  the severance, determined under section 7520.   Trust 1 and Trust 2 do not provide for the same succession of interests  as provided under the terms of the original trust. Therefore, the  severance is not a qualified severance. Furthermore, because the  severance results in no non-skip person having an interest in Trust 2,  Trust 2 constitutes a skip person under section 2613 and, therefore, the  severance results in a taxable termination subject to GST tax.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. Severance of a trust with a 50% inclusion ratio. On  September 1, 2006, T transfers $100,000 to a trust for the benefit of  T's grandchild, GC. On a timely filed Form 709, ``United States Gift  (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return,'' reporting the transfer,  T allocates all of T's remaining GST tax exemption ($50,000) to the  trust. As a result of the allocation, the applicable fraction with  respect to the trust is .50 [$50,000 (the amount of GST tax exemption  allocated to the trust) divided by $100,000 (the value of the property  transferred to the trust)]. The inclusion ratio with respect to the  trust is .50 [1-.50]. In 2007, pursuant to authority granted under  applicable state law, the trustee severs the trust into two trusts,  Trust 1 and Trust 2, each of which is identical to the original trust  and each of which receives a 50 percent fractional share of the total  value of the original trust, valued as of the date of severance. Because  the applicable fraction with respect to the original trust is .50 and  the trust is severed into two equal trusts, the trustee may designate  which resulting trust has an inclusion ratio of one, and which resulting  trust has an inclusion ratio of zero. Accordingly, in the Notice of  Qualified Severance reporting the severance, the trustee designates  Trust 1 as having an inclusion ratio of zero, and Trust 2 as having an  inclusion ratio of one. The severance constitutes a qualified severance,  provided that all other requirements of section 2642(a)(3) and this  section are satisfied.</p><p class="depth2">Example 5. Funding of severed trusts on a non-pro rata basis. T's  will establishes a testamentary trust (Trust) for the benefit of T's  descendants, to be funded with T's stock in Corporation A and  Corporation B, both publicly traded stocks. T dies on May 1, 2004, at  which time the Corporation A stock included in T's gross estate has a  fair market value of $100,000 and the stock of Corporation B included in  T's gross estate has a fair market value of $200,000. On a timely filed  Form 706, T's executor allocates all of T's remaining GST tax exemption  ($270,000) to Trust. As a result of the allocation, the applicable  fraction with respect to Trust is .90 [$270,000 (the amount of GST tax  exemption allocated to the trust) divided by $300,000 (the value of the  property transferred to the trust)]. The inclusion ratio with respect to  Trust is .10 [1-.90]. On August 1, 2008, in accordance with applicable  local law, the trustee executes a document severing Trust into two  trusts, Trust 1 and Trust 2, each of which is identical to Trust. The  instrument designates August 3, 2008, as the date of severance (within  the meaning of paragraph (d)(3) of this section). The terms of the  instrument severing Trust provide that Trust 1 is to be funded on a non- pro rata basis with assets having a fair market value on the date of  severance equal to 90% of the value of Trust's assets on that date, and  Trust 2 is to be funded with assets having a fair market value on the  date of severance equal to 10% of the value of Trust's assets on that  date. On August 3, 2008, the value of the Trust assets totals $500,000,  consisting of Corporation A stock worth $450,000 and Corporation B stock  worth $50,000. On August 4, 2008, the trustee takes all action necessary  to transfer all of the Corporation A stock to Trust 1 and to transfer  all of the Corporation B stock to Trust 2. On August 6, 2008, the stock  transfers are completed and the stock is received by the appropriate  resulting trust. Accordingly, Trust 1 is funded with assets having a  value equal to 90% of the value of Trust as of the date of severance,  August 3, 2008, and Trust 2 is funded with assets having a value equal  to 10% of the value of Trust as of the date of severance. Therefore, the  severance constitutes a qualified severance, provided that all other  requirements of section 2642(a)(3) and this section are satisfied. Trust  1 will have an inclusion ratio of zero and Trust 2 will have an  inclusion ratio of one.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>  T's will establishes an irrevocable trust (Trust) for the benefit of T's  descendants. As a result of the allocation of GST tax exemption, the  applicable fraction with respect to Trust is .60 and Trust's inclusion  ratio is .40 [1-.60]. Pursuant to authority granted under applicable  state law, on August 1, 2008, the trustee executes a document severing  Trust into two trusts, Trust 1 and Trust 2, each of which is identical  to Trust. The instrument of severance provides that the severance is  intended to qualify as a qualified severance within the meaning of  section 2642(a)(3) and designates August 3, 2008, as the date of  severance (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3) of this section). The  instrument further provides that Trust 1 and Trust 2 are to be funded on  a non-pro rata basis with Trust 1 funded with assets having a fair  market value on the date of severance equal to 40% of the value of  Trust's assets on that date and Trust 2 funded with assets having a fair  market value equal to 60% of the value of Trust's assets on that date.  The fair market value of the assets used to fund each trust is to be  determined in compliance with the requirements of paragraph (d)(4) of  this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> On August 3, 2008, the fair market value of the Trust assets  totals $4,000,000, consisting of 52% of the outstanding common   stock in Company, a closely-held corporation, valued at $3,000,000 and  $1,000,000 in cash and marketable securities. Trustee proposes to divide  the Company stock equally between Trust 1 and Trust 2, and thus transfer  26% of the Company stock to Trust 1 and 26% of the stock to Trust 2. In  addition, the appropriate amount of cash and marketable securities will  be distributed to each trust. In accordance with paragraph (d)(4) of  this section, for funding purposes, the interest in the Company stock  distributed to each trust is valued as a pro rata portion of the value  of the 52% interest in Company held by Trust before severance, without  taking into account, for example, any valuation discount that might  otherwise apply in valuing the noncontrolling interest distributed to  each resulting trust.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Accordingly, for funding purposes, each 26% interest in  Company stock distributed to Trust 1 and Trust 2 is valued at $1,500,000  (.5 x $3,000,000). Therefore, Trust 1, which is to be funded with  $1,600,000 (.40 x $4,000,000), receives $100,000 in cash and marketable  securities valued as of August 3, 2008, in addition to the Company  stock, and Trust 2, which is to be funded with $2,400,000 (.60 x  $4,000,000), receives $900,000 in cash and marketable securities in  addition to the Company stock. Therefore, the severance is a qualified  severance, provided that all other requirements of section 2642(a)(3)  and this section are satisfied.</p><p class="depth2">Example 7. Statutory qualified severance. T dies on October 1, 2004.  T's will establishes a testamentary trust (Trust) to be funded with  $1,000,000. Trust income is to be paid to T's child, S, for S's life.  The trustee may also distribute trust corpus from time to time, in equal  or unequal shares, for the benefit of any one or more members of the  group consisting of S and T's three grandchildren (GC1, GC2, and GC3).  On S's death, Trust is to terminate and the assets are to be divided  equally among GC1, GC2, and GC3 (or their respective then-living  descendants, per stirpes). On a timely filed Form 706, T's executor  allocates all of T's remaining GST tax exemption ($300,000) to Trust. As  a result of the allocation, the applicable fraction with respect to the  trust is .30 [$300,000 (the amount of GST tax exemption allocated to the  trust) divided by $1,000,000 (the value of the property transferred to  the trust)]. The inclusion ratio with respect to the trust is .70  [1-.30]. On June 1, 2007, the trustee determines that it is in the best  interest of the beneficiaries to sever Trust to provide a separate trust  for each of T's three grandchildren and their respective families. The  trustee severs Trust into two trusts, Trust 1 and Trust 2, each with  terms and beneficiaries identical to Trust and thus each providing that  trust income is to be paid to S for life, trust principal may be  distributed for the benefit of any or all members of the group  consisting of S and T's grandchildren, and, on S's death, the trust is  to terminate and the assets are to be divided equally among GC1, GC2,  and GC3 (or their respective then-living descendants, per stirpes). The  instrument severing Trust provides that Trust 1 is to receive 30% of  Trust's assets and Trust 2 is to receive 70% of Trust's assets. Further,  each such trust is to be funded with a pro rata portion of each asset  held in Trust. The trustee then severs Trust 1 into three equal trusts,  Trust GC1, Trust GC2, and Trust GC3. Each trust is named for a  grandchild of T and provides that trust income is to be paid to S for  life, trust principal may be distributed for the benefit of S and T's  grandchild for whom the trust is named, and, on S's death, the trust is  to terminate and the trust proceeds distributed to the respective  grandchild for whom the trust is named. If that grandchild has  predeceased the termination date, the trust proceeds are to be  distributed to that grandchild's then-living descendants, per stirpes,  or, if none, then equally to the other two trusts resulting from the  severance of Trust 1. Each such resulting trust is to be funded with a  pro rata portion of each Trust 1 asset. The trustee also severs Trust 2  in a similar manner, into Trust GC1(2), Trust GC2(2), and Trust GC3(2).  The severance of Trust into Trust 1 and Trust 2, the severance of Trust  1 into Trust GC1, Trust GC2, Trust GC3, and the severance of Trust 2  into Trust GC1(2), Trust GC2(2) and Trust GC3(2), constitute qualified  severances, provided that all other requirements of section 2642(a)(3)  and this section are satisfied with respect to each severance. Trust  GC1, Trust GC2, Trust GC3 will each have an inclusion ratio of zero and  Trust GC1(2), Trust GC2(2), and Trust GC3(2) will each have an inclusion  ratio of one.</p><p class="depth2">Example 8. Qualified severance deemed to precede a taxable  termination. In 2004, T establishes an inter vivos irrevocable trust  (Trust) for a term of 10 years providing that Trust income is to be paid  annually in equal shares to T's child C and T's grandchild GC (the child  of another then-living child of T). If either C or GC dies prior to the  expiration of the 10-year term, the deceased beneficiary's share of  Trust's income is to be paid to that beneficiary's then-living  descendants, per stirpes, for the balance of the trust term. At the  expiration of the 10-year trust term, the corpus is to be distributed  equally to C and GC; if either C or GC is not then living, then such  decedent's share is to be distributed instead to such decedent's then- living descendants, per stirpes. T allocates T's GST tax exemption to  Trust such that Trust's applicable fraction is .50 and Trust's inclusion  ratio is .50 [1-.50]. In 2006, pursuant to applicable state law, the  trustee severs the trust into two equal trusts, Trust 1 and Trust 2. The  instrument severing Trust provides that Trust 1 is to receive 50% of the  Trust assets, and   Trust 2 is to receive 50% of Trust's assets. Both resulting trusts are  identical to Trust, except that each has different beneficiaries: C and  C's descendants are designated as the beneficiaries of Trust 1, and GC  and GC's descendants are designated as the beneficiaries of Trust 2. The  severance constitutes a qualified severance, provided all other  requirements of section 2642(a)(3) and this section are satisfied.  Because the applicable fraction with respect to Trust is .50 and Trust  was severed into two equal trusts, the trustee may designate which  resulting trust has an inclusion ratio of one, and which has an  inclusion ratio of zero. Accordingly, in the Notice of Qualified  Severance reporting the severance, the trustee designates Trust 1 as  having an inclusion ratio of one, and Trust 2 as having an inclusion  ratio of zero. Because Trust 2 is a skip person under section 2613, the  severance of Trust resulting in the distribution of 50% of Trust's  corpus to Trust 2 would constitute a taxable termination or distribution  (as described in section 2612(a)) of that 50% of Trust for GST tax  purposes, but for the rule that a qualified severance is deemed to  precede a taxable termination that is caused by the qualified severance.  Thus, no GST tax will be due with regard to the creation and funding of  Trust 2 because the inclusion ratio of Trust 2 is zero.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In 2004, T  establishes an inter vivos irrevocable trust (Trust) providing that  trust income is to be paid annually in equal shares to T's children, A  and B, for 10 years. Trust provides that the trustee has discretion to  make additional distributions of principal to A and B during the 10-year  term without adjustments to their shares of income or the trust  remainder. If either (or both) dies prior to the expiration of the 10- year term, the deceased child's share of trust income is to be paid to  the child's then living descendants, per stirpes, for the balance of the  trust term. At the expiration of the 10-year term, the corpus is to be  distributed equally to A and B; if A and B (or either or them) is not  then living, then such decedent's share is to be distributed instead to  such decedent's then living descendants, per stirpes. T allocates GST  tax exemption to Trust such that Trust's applicable fraction is .25 and  its inclusion ratio is .75.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In 2006, pursuant to applicable state law, the trustee severs  the trust into three trusts: Trust 1, Trust 2, and Trust 3. The  instrument severing Trust provides that Trust 1 is to receive 50% of  Trust's assets, Trust 2 is to receive 25% of Trust's assets, and Trust 3  is to receive 25% of Trust's assets. All three resulting trusts are  identical to Trust, except that each has different beneficiaries: A and  A's issue are designated as the beneficiaries of Trust 1, and B and B's  issue are designated as the beneficiaries of Trust 2 and Trust 3. The  severance constitutes a qualified severance, provided that all other  requirements of section 2642(a)(3) and this section are satisfied. Trust  1 will have an inclusion ratio of 1. Because both Trust 2 and Trust 3  have each received the fractional share of Trust's assets equal to  Trust's applicable fraction of .25, trustee designates that Trust 2 will  have an inclusion ratio of one and that Trust 3 will have an inclusion  ratio of zero.</p><p class="depth2">Example 10. Beneficiary's interest dependent on inclusion ratio. On  August 8, 2006, T transfers $1,000,000 to Trust and timely allocates  $400,000 of T's remaining GST tax exemption to Trust. As a result of the  allocation, the applicable fraction with respect to Trust is .40  [$400,000 divided by $1,000,000] and Trust's inclusion ratio is .60  [1-.40]. Trust provides that all income of Trust will be paid annually  to C, T's child, for life. On C's death, the corpus is to pass in  accordance with C's exercise of a testamentary limited power to appoint  the corpus of Trust to C's lineal descendants. However, Trust provides  that if, at the time of C's death, Trust's inclusion ratio is greater  than zero, then C may also appoint that fraction of the trust corpus  equal to the inclusion ratio to the creditors of C's estate. On May 3,  2008, pursuant to authority granted under applicable state law, the  trustee severs Trust into two trusts. Trust 1 is funded with 40% of  Trust's assets, and Trust 2 is funded with 60% of Trust's assets in  accordance with the requirements of this section. Both Trust 1 and Trust  2 provide that all income of Trust will be paid annually to C during C's  life. On C's death, Trust 1 corpus is to pass in accordance with C's  exercise of a testamentary limited power to appoint the corpus to C's  lineal descendants. Trust 2 is to pass in accordance with C's exercise  of a testamentary power to appoint the corpus of Trust to C's lineal  descendants and to the creditors of C's estate. The severance  constitutes a qualified severance, provided that all other requirements  of section 2642(a)(3) and this section are satisfied. No additional  contribution or allocation of GST tax exemption is made to either Trust  1 or Trust 2 prior to C's death. Accordingly, the inclusion ratio with  respect to Trust 1 is zero. The inclusion ratio with respect to Trust 2  is one until C's death, at which time C will become the transferor of  Trust 2 for GST tax purposes. (Some or all of C's GST tax exemption may  be allocated to Trust 2 upon C's death.)</p><p class="depth2">Example 11. Date of severance. Trust is an irrevocable trust that  has both skip person and non-skip person beneficiaries. Trust holds two  parcels of real estate, Property A and Property B, stock in Company X, a  publicly traded company, and cash. On June 16, 2008, the local court  with jurisdiction over Trust issues an order, pursuant to the trustee's  petition authorized under state law, severing Trust into two resulting  trusts of equal   value, Trust 1 and Trust 2. The court order directs that Property A will  be distributed to Trust 1 and Property B will be distributed to Trust 2,  and that an appropriate amount of stock and cash will be distributed to  each trust such that the total value of property distributed to each  trust as of the date of severance will be equal. The court order does  not mandate a particular date of funding. Trustee receives notice of the  court order on June 24, and selects July 16, 2008, as the date of  severance. On June 26, 2008, Trustee commences the process of  transferring title to Property A and Property B to the appropriate  resulting trust(s), which process is completed on July 8, 2008. Also on  June 26, the Trustee hires a professional appraiser to value Property A  and Property B as of the date of severance and receives the appraisal  report on Friday, October 3, 2008. On Monday, October 6, 2008, Trustee  commences the process of transferring to Trust 1 and Trust 2 the  appropriate amount of Company X stock valued as of July 16, 2008, and  that transfer (as well as the transfer of Trust's cash) is completed by  October 9, 2008. Under the facts presented, the funding of Trust 1 and  Trust 2 occurred within 90 days of the date of severance selected by the  trustee, and within a reasonable time after the date of severance taking  into account the nature of the assets involved and the need to obtain an  appraisal. Accordingly, the date of severance for purposes of this  section is July 16, 2008, the resulting trusts are to be funded based on  the value of the original trust assets as of that date, and the  severance is a qualified severance assuming that all other requirements  of section 2642(a)(3) and this section are met. (However, if Trust had  contained only marketable securities and cash, then in order to satisfy  the reasonable time requirement, the stock transfer would have to have  been commenced, and generally completed, immediately after the date of  severance, and the cash distribution would have to have been made at the  same time.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In 2004, T establishes an irrevocable inter  vivos trust (Trust) providing that Trust income is to be paid to T's  children, A and B, in equal shares for their joint lives. Upon the death  of the first to die of A and B, all Trust income will be paid to the  survivor of A and B. At the death of the survivor, the corpus is to be  distributed in equal shares to T's grandchildren, W and X (with any  then-deceased grandchild's share being paid in accordance with that  grandchild's testamentary general power of appointment). W is A's child  and X is B's child. T elects under section 2632(c)(5) not to have the  automatic allocation rules contained in section 2632(c) apply with  respect to T's transfers to Trust, but T allocates GST tax exemption to  Trust resulting in Trust having an inclusion ratio of .30.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In 2009, the trustee of Trust, as permitted by applicable state  law, divides Trust into two separate trusts, Trust 1 and Trust 2. Trust  1 provides that trust income is to be paid to A for life and, on A's  death, the remainder is to be distributed to W (or pursuant to W's  testamentary general power of appointment). Trust 2 provides that trust  income is to be paid to B for life and, on B's death, the remainder is  to be distributed to X (or pursuant to X's testamentary general power of  appointment). Because Trust 1 and Trust 2 do not provide A and B with  the contingent survivor income interests that were provided to A and B  under the terms of Trust, Trust 1 and Trust 2 do not provide for the  same succession of interests in the aggregate as provided by Trust.  Therefore, the severance does not satisfy the requirements of this  section and is not a qualified severance. Provided that Trust 1 and  Trust 2 are recognized as separate trusts under applicable state law,  Trust 1 and Trust 2 will be recognized as separate trusts for GST tax  purposes pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section, prospectively from  the date of the severance. However, Trust 1 and Trust 2 each have an  inclusion ratio of .30 immediately after the severance, the same as the  inclusion ratio of Trust prior to severance.</p><p class="depth4">Example 13. Qualified severance following a non-qualified  severance. Assume the same facts as in Example 12, except that, as of  November 4, 2010, the trustee of Trust 1 severs Trust 1 into two trusts,  Trust 3 and Trust 4, in accordance with applicable local law. The  instrument severing Trust 1 provides that both resulting trusts have  provisions identical to Trust 1. The terms of the instrument severing  Trust 1 further provide that Trust 3 is to be funded on a pro rata basis  with assets having a fair market value as of the date of severance equal  to 70% of the value of Trust 1's assets on that date, and Trust 4 is to  be funded with assets having a fair market value as of the date of  severance equal to 30% of the value of Trust 1's assets on that date.  The severance constitutes a qualified severance, provided that all other  requirements of section 2642(a)(3) and this section are satisfied. Trust  3 will have an inclusion ratio of zero and Trust 4 will have an  inclusion ratio of one.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Effective/applicability date--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as  otherwise provided in this paragraph (k), this section applies to  severances occurring on or after August 2, 2007. Paragraph (d)(7)(iii),  paragraph (h), and Examples 9, 12 and 13 of paragraph (j) of this  section apply to severances occurring on or after September 2, 2008.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transition rule. In the case of a qualified severance occurring  after December 31, 2000, and before August 2, 2007, taxpayers may rely  on any reasonable interpretation of section 2642(a)(3) as long as  reasonable notice concerning the qualified severance and identification  of the trusts involved has been given to the IRS. For this purpose, the  proposed regulations (69 FR 51967) are treated as a reasonable  interpretation of the statute. For purposes of the reporting provisions  of Sec. 26.2642-6(e), notice to the IRS should be mailed by the due  date of the gift tax return (including extensions granted) for gifts  made during the year in which the severance occurred. If no gift tax  return is filed, notice to the IRS should be mailed by April 15th of the  year immediately following the year during which the severance occurred.  For severances occurring between December 31, 2000, and January 1, 2007,  notification should be mailed to the IRS as soon as reasonably  practicable after August 2, 2007, if sufficient notice has not already  been given.
