resources without permanent impairment of the productivity of the lands and the quality of the environment with consideration being given to the relative values of the resources and not necessarily to the combination of uses that will give the greatest economic return or the greatest unit output.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Officially approved and adopted resource related plans means plans, policies, programs and processes prepared and approved pursuant to and in accordance with authorization provided by Federal, State or local constitutions, legislation, or charters which have the force and effect of State law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Public means affected or interested individuals, including consumer organizations, public land resource users, corporations and other business entities, environmental organizations and other special interest groups and officials of State, local, and Indian tribal governments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Public lands means any lands or interest in lands owned by the United States and administered by the Secretary of the Interior through the Bureau of Land Management, except lands located on the Outer Continental Shelf and lands held for the benefit of Indians, Aleuts and Eskimos.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Resource area or field office means a geographic portion of a Bureau of Land Management district. It is the administrative subdivision whose manager has primary responsibility for day-to-day resource management activities and resource use allocations and is, in most instances, the area for which resource management plans are prepared and maintained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Resource management plan means a land use plan as described by the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. The resource management plan generally establishes in a written document:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Land areas for limited, restricted or exclusive use; designation, including ACEC designation; and transfer from Bureau of Land Management Administration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Allowable resource uses (either singly or in combination) and related levels of production or use to be maintained;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Resource condition goals and objectives to be attained;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Program constraints and general management practices needed to achieve the above items;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Need for an area to be covered by more detailed and specific plans;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Support action, including such measures as resource protection, access development, realty action, cadastral survey, etc., as necessary to achieve the above;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> General implementation sequences, where carrying out a planned action is dependent upon prior accomplishment of another planned action; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Intervals and standards for monitoring and evaluating the plan to determine the effectiveness of the plan and the need for amendment or revision.
It is not a final implementation decision on actions which require further specific plans, process steps, or decisions under specific provisions of law and regulations.
