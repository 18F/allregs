                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An employer may apply for a permanent, structural variance from a specific standard(s) in this subpart by filing a written application for such a variance with the local Job Service office serving the area in which the housing is located. This application must be filed by June 2, 1980 and must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Clearly specify the standard(s) from which the variance is desired;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide adequate justification that the variance is necessary to obtain a beneficial use of an existing facility, and to prevent a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Clearly set forth the specific alternative measures which the employer has taken to protect the health and safety of workers and adequately show that such alternative measures have achieved the same result as the standard(s) from which the employer desires the variance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon receipt of a written request for a variance under paragraph (a) of

this section, the local Job Service office shall send the request to the State office which, in turn, shall forward it to the Regional Administrator, Employment and Training Administration (RA). The RA shall review the matter and, after consultation with OSHA, shall either grant or deny the request for a variance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The variance granted by the RA shall be in writing, shall state the particular standard(s) involved, and shall state as conditions of the variance the specific alternative measures which have been taken to protect the health and safety of the workers. The RA shall send the approved variance to the employer and shall send copies to the Regional Administrator of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Regional Administrator of the Employment Standards Administration, and the appropriate State agency and the local Job Service office. The employer shall submit and the local Job Service office shall attach copies of the approved variance to each of the employer's job orders which is placed into intrastate or interstate clearance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the RA denies the request for a variance, the RA shall provide written notice stating the reasons for the denial to the employer, the appropriate State agency and the local Job Service office. The notice shall also offer the employer an opportunity to request a hearing before a DOL Hearing Officer, provided the employer requests such a hearing from the RA within 30 calendar days of the date of the notice. The request for a hearing shall be handled in accordance with the employment service complaint procedures set forth at Sec. Sec.  658.421 (i) and (j), 658.422 and 658.423 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The procedures of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section shall only apply to an employer who has chosen, as evidenced by its written request for a variance, to comply with the ETA housing standards at Sec. Sec.  654.404-654.417 of this subpart.</p>
