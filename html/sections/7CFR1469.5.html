that the applicant has addressed the nationally significant resource concerns of water quality and soil quality to the minimum level of treatment as specified in paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section for all eligible land uses on the entire agricultural operation.

Practices or activities shall not be required for participation in the program unless they would have an ultimate conservation benefit as demonstrated by the Conservation Practice Physical Effects matrix in the FOTG. Under Tier III, the entire agricultural operation is enrolled in CSP including other land as defined in Sec. 1469.5(d)(1)(v).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The minimum level of treatment on cropland for Tier I and Tier II:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The minimum level of treatment for soil quality on cropland is considered achieved when the Soil Conditioning Index value is positive.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The minimum level of treatment for water quality on cropland is considered achieved if the benchmark inventory indicates that the current level of treatment addresses the risks that nutrients, pesticides, sediment, and salinity present to water quality by meeting or exceeding the quality criteria for the specific resource concerns of nutrients, pesticides, sediment and salinity for surface water and nutrients, pesticides and salinity for ground water.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Chief may make minor exceptions to criteria for areas, such as tropical and tundra regions, where technology tools are being refined or testing is needed to review performance data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The minimum level of treatment on pastureland and rangelands for Tier I and Tier II is vegetation and animal management accomplished by following a grazing management plan that provides for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A forage-animal balance;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Proper livestock distribution;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Timing of use; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Managing livestock access to water courses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The minimum level of treatment for Tier III:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The minimum level of treatment for Tier III is having a fully implemented resource management system that meets the quality criteria for the local NRCS FOTG for all applicable resource concerns and considerations with the following exceptions:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The minimum requirement for soil quality on cropland is considered achieved when the Soil Conditioning Index value is positive;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The minimum requirement for water quantity--irrigation water management on cropland or pastureland is considered achieved when the current level of treatment and management for the system results in a water use index value of at least 50; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The minimum requirement for wildlife is considered achieved when the current level of treatment and management for the system results in an index value of at least 0.5 using a general or species specific habitat assessment guide; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All riparian corridors, including streams and natural drainages, within the agricultural operation are buffered to restore, protect, or enhance riparian resources. Riparian corridors, as appropriate, will be managed or designed to intercept sediment, nutrients, pesticides, and other materials in surface runoff; reduce nutrients and other pollutants in shallow subsurface water flow; lower water temperature; and provide litter fall or structural components for habitat complexity or to slow out-of-bank floods.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In the instance of a significant natural event, such as drought, wildfire, pestilence, or flooding which would prevent the participant or applicant from achieving the minimum requirements, those requirements will be considered met so long as the participant or applicant can provide documentation of their stewardship prior to such an event.</p>
