                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introduction--(1) Scope. This section implements section  1861(v)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(A)</em> of the Act by setting forth the general rules under which  CMS may establish limits on SNF and HHA costs recognized as reasonable  in determining Medicare program payments. It also sets forth rules  governing exemptions and exceptions to limits established under this  section that CMS may make as appropriate in considering special needs or  situations of particular providers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> General principle. Reimbursable provider costs may not exceed  the costs CMS estimates to be necessary for the efficient delivery of  needed health care services. CMS may establish estimated cost limits for  direct or indirect overall costs or for costs of specific services or  groups of services. CMS imposes these limits prospectively and may  calculate them on a per admission, per discharge, per diem, per visit,  or other basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedure for establishing limits. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In establishing limits  under this section, CMS may classify SNFs and HHAs by factors that CMS  finds appropriate and practical, including the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Type of services furnished.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Geographical area where services are furnished, allowing for  grouping of noncontiguous areas having similar demographic and economic  characteristics.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Size of institution.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Nature and mix of services furnished.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Type and mix of patients treated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> CMS bases its estimates of the costs necessary for efficient  delivery of health services on cost reports or other data providing  indicators of current costs. CMS adjusts current and past period data to  arrive at estimated costs for the prospective periods to which limits  are applied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Before the beginning of a cost period to which revised limits  will be applied, CMS publishes a notice in the Federal Register,  establishing cost limits and explaining the basis on which they are  calculated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In establishing limits under paragraph (b)(1) of this section,  CMS may find it inappropriate to apply particular limits to a class of  SNFs or HHAs due to the characteristics of the SNF or HHA class, the  data on which CMS bases those limits, or the method by which CMS  determines the limits. In these cases, CMS may exclude that class of  SNFs or HHAs from the limits, explaining the basis of the exclusion in  the notice setting forth the limits for the appropriate cost reporting  periods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requests regarding applicability of cost limits. For cost  reporting periods beginning before July 1, 1998, a SNF may request an  exception or exemption to the cost limits imposed under this section. An  HHA may request only an exception to the cost limits. The SNF or HHA  must make its request to its contractor within 180 days of the date on  the contractor's notice of program reimbursement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Home health agencies. The contractor makes a recommendation on  the HHA's request to CMS, which makes the decision. CMS responds to the  request within 180 days from the date CMS receives the request from the  contractor. The contractor notifies the HHA of CMS's decision. The time  required by CMS to review the request is considered good cause for the  granting of an extension of the time limit for requesting an contractor  hearing or a Provider Reimbursement Review Board (Board) hearing as  specified in Sec. Sec. 405.1813 and 405.1836 of this chapter,  respectively.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Skilled nursing facility exception. The contractor makes the  final determination on the SNF's exception request and notifies the SNF  of its determination within 90 days from the date that the contractor  receives the request from the SNF. If the contractor   determines that the SNF did not provide adequate documentation from  which a proper determination can be made, the contractor notifies the  SNF that the request is denied. The contractor also notifies the SNF  that it has 45 days from the date on the contractor's denial letter to  submit a new exception request with the complete documentation and that  otherwise, the denial is the final determination. The time required by  the contractor to review the request is considered good cause for the  granting of an extension of the time limit for requesting an contractor  hearing or a Board hearing as specified in Sec. Sec. 405.1813 and  405.1836 of this chapter, respectively.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exemptions. Exemptions from the limits imposed under this  section may be granted to a new SNF with cost reporting periods  beginning before July 1, 1998 as stated in Sec. 413.1(g)(1). The  contractor makes a recommendation on the provider's request to CMS,  which makes the decision. A new SNF is a provider of inpatient services  that has operated as a SNF (or the equivalent) for which it is certified  for Medicare, under present and previous ownership, for less than 3 full  years. An exemption granted under this paragraph expires at the end of  the SNF's first cost reporting period beginning at least 2 years after  the provider accepts its first inpatient.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(5)</em> of this section. An adjustment is made  only to the extent that the costs are reasonable, attributable to the  circumstances specified, separately identified by the SNF or HHA, and  verified by the contractor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Atypical services. The SNF or HHA can show that the--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Actual cost of services furnished by a SNF or HHA exceeds the  applicable limit because the services are atypical in nature and scope,  compared to the services generally furnished by SNFs or HHAs similarly  classified; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Atypical services are furnished because of the special needs of  the patients treated and are necessary in the efficient delivery of  needed health care.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Extraordinary circumstances. The SNF or HHA can show that it  incurred higher costs due to extraordinary circumstances beyond its  control. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, strikes,  fire, earthquake, flood, or other unusual occurrences with substantial  cost effects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Areas with fluctuating populations. The SNF meets the following  conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is located in an area (for example, a resort area) that has a  population that varies significantly during the year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is furnishing similar services in an area for which the  appropriate health planning agency has determined does not have a  surplus of beds or similar services and has certified that the beds or  similar services furnished by the SNF are necessary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Meets occupancy or capacity standards established by the  Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Medical and paramedical education. The SNF or HHA can  demonstrate that, if compared to other SNFs or HHAs in its group, it  incurs increased costs for services covered by limits under this section  because of its operation of an approved education program specified in  Sec. 413.85.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Unusual labor costs. The SNF or HHA has a percentage of labor  costs that varies more than 10 percent from that included in the  promulgation of the limits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Operational review. Any SNF or HHA that applies for an exception  to the limits established under paragraph (e) of this section must agree  to an operational review at the discretion of CMS. The findings from  this review may be the basis for recommendations for improvements in the  efficiency and economy of the SNF's or the HHA's operations. If  recommendations are made, any future exceptions are contingent on the  SNF's or HHA's implementation of these recommendations.
