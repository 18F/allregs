                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Reclassification based on unsafe or unsound condition or  practice--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Issuance of notice of proposed reclassification--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Grounds for reclassification. (A) Pursuant to Sec. 208.43(c) of  Regulation H (12 CFR 208.43(c)), the Board may reclassify a well  capitalized bank as adequately capitalized or subject an adequately  capitalized or undercapitalized institution to the supervisory actions  applicable to the next lower capital category if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Board determines that the bank is in unsafe or unsound  condition; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Board deems the bank to be engaged in an unsafe or unsound  practice and not to have corrected the deficiency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any action pursuant to this paragraph (a)(1)(i) shall  hereinafter be referred to as ``reclassification.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Prior notice to institution. Prior to taking action pursuant to  Sec. 208.33(c) of this chapter, the Board shall issue and serve on the  bank a written notice of the Board's intention to reclassify the bank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contents of notice. A notice of intention to reclassify a bank  based on unsafe or unsound condition shall include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A statement of the bank's capital measures and capital levels  and the category to which the bank would be reclassified;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The reasons for reclassification of the bank;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The date by which the bank subject to the notice of  reclassification may file with the Board a written appeal of the  proposed reclassification and a request for a hearing, which shall be at  least 14 calendar days from the date of service of the notice unless the  Board determines that a shorter period is appropriate in light of the  financial condition of the bank or other relevant circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Response to notice of proposed reclassification. A bank may file  a written response to a notice of proposed reclassification within the  time period set by the Board. The response should include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An explanation of why the bank is not in unsafe or unsound  condition or otherwise should not be reclassified;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any other relevant information, mitigating circumstances,  documentation, or other evidence in support of the position of the bank  or company regarding the reclassification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Failure to file response. Failure by a bank to file, within the  specified time period, a written response with the Board to a notice of  proposed reclassification shall constitute a waiver of the opportunity  to respond and shall constitute consent to the reclassification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Request for hearing and presentation of oral testimony or  witnesses. The response may include a request for an informal hearing  before the Board or its designee under this section. If the bank desires  to present oral testimony or witnesses at the hearing, the bank shall  include a request to do so with the request for an informal hearing. A  request to present oral testimony or   witnesses shall specify the names of the witnesses and the general  nature of their expected testimony. Failure to request a hearing shall  constitute a waiver of any right to a hearing, and failure to request  the opportunity to present oral testimony or witnesses shall constitute  a waiver of any right to present oral testimony or witnesses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Order for informal hearing. Upon receipt of a timely written  request that includes a request for a hearing, the Board shall issue an  order directing an informal hearing to commence no later than 30 days  after receipt of the request, unless the bank requests a later date. The  hearing shall be held in Washington, DC or at such other place as may be  designated by the Board, before a presiding officer(s) designated by the  Board to conduct the hearing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Hearing procedures. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The bank shall have the right to  introduce relevant written materials and to present oral argument at the  hearing. The bank may introduce oral testimony and present witnesses  only if expressly authorized by the Board or the presiding officer(s).  Neither the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C.  554-557) governing adjudications required by statute to be determined on  the record nor the Uniform Rules of Practice and Procedure in subpart A  of this part apply to an informal hearing under this section unless the  Board orders that such procedures shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The informal hearing shall be recorded, and a transcript shall  be furnished to the bank upon request and payment of the cost thereof.  Witnesses need not be sworn, unless specifically requested by a party or  the presiding officer(s). The presiding officer(s) may ask questions of  any witness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The presiding officer(s) may order that the hearing be  continued for a reasonable period (normally five business days)  following completion of oral testimony or argument to allow additional  written submissions to the hearing record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Recommendation of presiding officers. Within 20 calendar days  following the date the hearing and the record on the proceeding are  closed, the presiding officer(s) shall make a recommendation to the  Board on the reclassification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Time for decision. Not later than 60 calendar days after the  date the record is closed or the date of the response in a case where no  hearing was requested, the Board will decide whether to reclassify the  bank and notify the bank of the Board's decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Request for rescission of reclassification. Any bank that has  been reclassified under this section, may, upon a change in  circumstances, request in writing that the Board reconsider the  reclassification, and may propose that the reclassification be rescinded  and that any directives issued in connection with the reclassification  be modified, rescinded, or removed. Unless otherwise ordered by the  Board, the bank shall remain subject to the reclassification and to any  directives issued in connection with that reclassification while such  request is pending before the Board.
