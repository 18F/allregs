We will develop and initiate procedures to  implement a plan to partially or completely assume the disability  determination function from the State agency under Sec. 416.1090 or  Sec. 416.1091, as appropriate. Except for the State agency's  administrator, deputy administrator, or assistant administrator (or his  equivalent), we will give employees of the State agency who are capable  of performing duties in the disability determination function preference  over any other persons in filling positions with us for which they are  qualified. We may also give a preference in hiring to the State agency's  administrator, deputy administrator, or assistant administrator (or his  equivalent). We will establish a system for determining the hiring  priority among the affected State agency employees in those instances  where we are not hiring all of them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determination by Secretary of Labor. We will not assume  responsibility for performing the disability determination function from  a State until the Secretary of Labor determines that the State has made  fair and equitable arrangements under applicable Federal, State and  local law to protect the interests of employees who will be displaced  from their employment because of the assumption and who we will not  hire.</p>
