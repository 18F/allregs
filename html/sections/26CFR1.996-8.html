                                Sec. 1.996-8  Effect of carryback of capital loss or net operating
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Under Sec. 1.995-2(e), the deduction under section 172 for a net  operating loss carryback or under section 1212 for a capital loss  carryback is determined as if the DISC were a domestic corporation which  had not elected to be treated as a DISC. A carryback of a net operating  loss or of a capital loss of any corporation which reduces its taxable  income for a preceding taxable year for which it qualified as a DISC  will have the consequences enumerated in paragraphs (b) through (e) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For such preceding taxable year, the amount of a deemed  distribution of one-half of certain taxable income described in  Sec. 1.995-2(a)(4) will ordinarily be reduced in effect (but not below  zero) by one-half of the sum of the amount of the deduction under  section 172 for such year for net operating loss carrybacks and the  amount of the deduction under section 1212 for such year for capital  loss carrybacks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The amount of reduction in the deemed distribution under  paragraph (b) of this section will have the effect of increasing the  limitation, provided in Sec. 1.995-2(b)(2), on the amount of foreign  investment attributable to producer's loans which is deemed distributed  under Sec. 1.995-2(a)(5).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> for the priority  of such deemed distribution in relation to other distributions made in  that preceding taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The amount and treatment of any actual distribution made in such  preceding taxable year or a year subsequent to such preceding year, and  the treatment of gain on a disposition (in any such year) of the DISC's  stock to which Sec. 1.995-4 applies, shall be properly adjusted to  reflect the adjustments to previously taxed income and accumulated DISC  income described in paragraph (d) of this section.
