                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The marketing and operation of intentional radiators under the  provisions of this section is restricted to biomedical telemetry devices  employed solely on the premises of health care facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A health care facility includes hospitals and other  establishments that offer services, facilities, and beds for use beyond  24 hours in rendering medical treatment and institutions and  organizations regularly engaged in providing medical services through  clinics, public health facilities, and similar establishments, including  governmental entities and agencies for their own medical activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This authority to operate does not extend to mobile vehicles,  such as ambulances, even if those vehicles are associated with a health  care facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The fundamental emissions from a biomedical telemetry device  operating under the provisions of this section shall be contained within  a single television broadcast channel, as defined in part 73 of this  chapter, under all conditions of operation and shall lie wholly within  the frequency ranges of 174-216 MHz and 470-668 MHz.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The field strength of the fundamental emissions shall not exceed  200 mV/m, as measured at a distance of 3 meters using a quasi-peak  detector.   Manufacturers should note that a quasi-peak detector function indicates  field strength per 120 kHz of bandwidth [20 kHz. Accordingly, the total  signal level over the band of operation may be higher than 200 mV/m. The  field strength of emissions radiated on any frequency outside of the  television broadcast channel within which the fundamental is contained  shall not exceed the general limits in Sec. 15.209.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The user and the installer of a biomedical telemetry device  operating within the frequency range 174-216 MHz, 470-608 MHz or 614-668  MHz shall ensure that the following minimum separation distances are  maintained between the biomedical telemetry device and the authorized  radio services operating on the same frequencies:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At least 10.3 km outside of the Grade B field strength contour  (56 dBuV/m) of a TV broadcast station or an associated TV booster  station operating within the band 174-216 MHz.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At least 5.5 km outside of the Grade B field strength contour  (64 dBuV/m) of a TV broadcast station or an associated TV booster  station operating within the bands 470-608 MHz or 614-668 MHz.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> At least 5.1 km outside of the 68 dBuV/m field strength contour  of a low power TV or a TV translator station operating within the band  174-216 MHz.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> At least 3.1 km outside of the 74 dBuV/m field strength contour  of a low power TV or a TV translator station operating within the bands  470-608 MHz or 614-668 MHz.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Whatever distance is necessary to protect other authorized users  within these bands.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The user and the installer of a biomedical telemetry device  operating within the frequency range 608-614 MHz and that will be  located within 32 km of the very long baseline array (VLBA) stations or  within 80 km of any of the other radio astronomy observatories noted in  footnote US385 of Section 2.106 of this chapter must coordinate with,  and obtain the written concurrence of, the director of the affected  radio astronomy observatory before the equipment can be installed or  operated. The National Science Foundation point of contact for  coordination is: Spectrum Manager, Division of Astronomical Sciences,  NSF Room 1045, 4201 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, VA 22230; tel: (703) 306- 1823.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Biomedical telemetry devices must not cause harmful interference  to licensed TV broadcast stations or to other authorized radio services,  such as operations on the broadcast frequencies under subparts G and H  of part 74 of this chapter, land mobile stations operating under part 90  of this chapter in the 470-512 MHz band, and radio astronomy operation  in the 608-614 MHz band. (See Sec. 15.5.) If harmful interference  occurs, the interference must either be corrected or the device must  immediately cease operation on the occupied frequency. Further, the  operator of the biomedical telemetry device must accept whatever level  of interference is received from other radio operations. The operator,  i.e., the health care facility, is responsible for resolving any  interference that occurs subsequent to the installation of these  devices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The manufacturers, installers, and users of biomedical telemetry  devices are reminded that they must ensure that biomedical telemetry  transmitters operating under the provisions of this section avoid  operating in close proximity to authorized services using this spectrum.  Sufficient separation distance, necessary to avoid causing or receiving  harmful interference, must be maintained from co-channel operations.  These parties are reminded that the frequencies of the authorized  services are subject to change, especially during the implementation of  the digital television services. The operating frequencies of the part  15 devices may need to be changed, as necessary and in accordance with  the permissive change requirements of this chapter, to accommodate  changes in the operating frequencies of the authorized services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The manufacturers, installers and users of biomedical telemetry  devices are cautioned that the operation of this equipment could result  in harmful interference to other nearby medical devices.
