When a backflow prevention device does not bear a critical level marking, the bottom of the vacuum breaker, combination valve, or of any such approved or listed device shall constitute the critical level.</p><p class="depth0">Cross connection means any physical connection or arrangement between two otherwise separate systems or sources, one of which contains potable water and the other either water, steam, gas or chemical of unknown or questionable safety whereby there may be a flow from one system or source to the other, the direction of flow depending on the pressure differential between the two systems.</p><p class="depth0">Developed length means that length of pipe measured along the center line of the pipe and fittings.</p><p class="depth0">Diameter, unless otherwise specifically stated, means the nominal (inside) diameter designated commercially.</p><p class="depth0">Drain means a pipe that carries waste, water, or water-borne waste in a drainage system.</p><p class="depth0">Drain connector means the removable extension, consisting of all pipes, fittings and appurtenances, from the drain outlet to the drain inlet serving the manufactured home.</p><p class="depth0">Drain outlet means the lowest end of the main or secondary drain to which a sewer connection is made.</p><p class="depth0">Drainage system means all piping within or attached to the structure that conveys sewage or other liquid waste to the drain outlet, not including the drain connector.</p><p class="depth0">Fixture drain means the drain from the trap of a fixture to the junction of that drain with any other drain pipe.</p><p class="depth0">Fixture supply means the water supply pipe connecting a fixture to a branch water supply pipe or directly to a main water supply pipe.</p><p class="depth0">Flood-level means the level in the receptacle over which water would overflow to the outside of the receptacle.</p><p class="depth0">Flooded means the condition which results when the liquid in a container or receptacle rises to the flood-level.</p><p class="depth0">Flush tank means that portion of a water closet that is designed to contain sufficient water to adequately flush the fixture.</p><p class="depth0">Flush valve means a device located at the bottom of a flush tank for flushing a water closet.</p><p class="depth0">Flushometer tank: means a device integrated within an air accumulator vessel which is designed to discharge a predetermined quantity of water to fixtures for flushing purposes.</p><p class="depth0">Flushometer valve means a device which discharges a predetermined quantity of water to a fixture for flushing purposes and is closed by direct water pressure.</p><p class="depth0">Grade means the fall (slope) of a pipe in reference to a horizontal plane expressed in inches per foot length.</p><p class="depth0">Horizontal branch means any pipe extending laterally, which receives the discharge from one or more fixture drains and connects to the main drain.</p><p class="depth0">Horizontal pipe means any pipe or fitting which makes an angle of not more than 45 degrees with the horizontal.</p><p class="depth0">Individual vent means a pipe installed to vent a fixture drain.</p><p class="depth0">Inlet coupling means the terminal end of the water system to which the water service connection is attached. It may be a swivel fitting or threaded pipe end.</p><p class="depth0">Main means the principal artery of the system to which branches may be connected.</p><p class="depth0">Main drain means the lowest pipe of a drainage system which receives sewage from all the fixtures within a manufactured home and conducts these wastes to the drain outlet.</p><p class="depth0">Main vent means the principal artery of the venting system to which vent branches may be connected.</p><p class="depth0">Mechanical trap vent device means a device that automatically opens to admit air to a fixture drain above the connection of the trap arm so as to prevent siphonage, and closes tightly when the pressure within the drainage system is equal to or greater than atmospheric pressure, so as to prevent the escape of gases from the drainage system into the manufactured home.</p><p class="depth0">Offset means a combination of pipe and/or fittings that brings one section of the pipe out of line but into a line parallel with the other section.</p><p class="depth0">Pitch. See Grade.</p><p class="depth0">Plumbing appliance: means any one of a special class of plumbing fixture which is intended to perform a special plumbing function. Its operation and/or control may be dependent upon one or more energized components, such as motors, control, heating elements, or pressure or temperature-sensing elements. Such fixture may operate automatically through one or more of the following actions: A time cycle, a temperature range, a pressure range, a measured volume or weight, or the fixture may be manually adjusted or controlled by the user or operator.</p><p class="depth0">Plumbing appurtenance: means a manufactured device, or a prefabricated assembly, or an on-the-job assembly of component parts, and which is an adjunct to the basic piping system and plumbing system and plumbing fixtures. An appurtenance demands no additional water supply, nor does it add any discharge load to a fixture or the drainage system.</p><p class="depth0">Plumbing fixtures means receptacles, devices, or appliances which are supplied with water or which receive liquid or liquid-borne wastes for discharge into the drainage system.</p><p class="depth0">Plumbing system means the water supply and distribution pipes; plumbing fixtures, faucets and traps; soil, waste and vent pipes; and water-treating or water-using equipment.</p><p class="depth0">Primary vent.
