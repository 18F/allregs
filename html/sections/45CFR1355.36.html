                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For the purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The term ``title IV-B funds'' refers to the title IV-E agency's combined allocation of title IV-B subpart 1 and subpart 2 funds; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The term ``title IV-E funds'' refers to the title IV-E agency's reimbursement for administrative costs for the foster care program under title IV-E.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Determination of the amount of Federal funds to be withheld. ACF will determine the amount of title IV-B and IV-E funds to be withheld due to a finding that the title IV-E agency is not operating in substantial conformity, as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A title IV-E agency will have the opportunity to develop and complete a program improvement plan prior to any withholding of funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Title IV-B and IV-E funds will not be withheld from a title IV-E agency if the determination of nonconformity was caused by the title IV-E agency's correct use of formal written statements of Federal law or policy provided the title IV-E agency by DHHS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A portion of the title IV-E agency's title IV-B and IV-E funds will be withheld by ACF for the year under review and for each succeeding year until the title IV-E agency either successfully completes a program improvement plan or is found to be operating in substantial conformity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The amount of title IV-B and title IV-E funds subject to withholding due to a determination that a title IV-E agency is not operating in substantial conformity is based on a pool of funds defined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The title IV-E agency's allotment of title IV-B funds for each of the years to which the withholding applies; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An amount equivalent to 10 percent of the title IV-E agency's Federal claims for title IV-E foster care administrative costs for each of the years to which withholding applies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The amount of funds to be withheld from the pool in paragraph (b)(4) of this section will be computed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided for in paragraphs (b)(7) and (b)(8) of this section, an amount equivalent to one percent of the funds described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section for each of the years to which withholding applies will be withheld for each of the seven outcomes listed in Sec. 1355.34(b)(1) of this part that is determined not to be in substantial conformity; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Except as provided for in paragraphs (b)(7) and (b)(8) of this section, an amount equivalent to one percent of the funds described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section for each of the years to which withholding applies will be withheld for each of the seven systemic factors listed in Sec. 1355.34(c) of this part that is determined not to be in substantial conformity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Except as provided for in paragraphs (b)(7), (b)(8), and (e)(4) of this section, in the event the title IV-E agency is determined to be in nonconformity on each of the seven outcomes and each of the seven systemic factors subject to review, the maximum amount of title IV-B and title IV-E funds to be withheld due to the title IV-E agency's failure to comply is 14 percent per year of the funds described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section for each year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Title IV-E agencies determined not to be in substantial conformity that fail to correct the areas of nonconformity through the successful completion of a program improvement plan, and are determined to be in nonconformity on the second full review following the first full review in which

a determination of nonconformity was made will be subject to increased withholding as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount of funds described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section will increase to two percent for each of the seven outcomes and each of the seven systemic factors that continues in nonconformity since the immediately preceding child and family services review;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The increased withholding of funds for areas of continuous nonconformity is subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The maximum amount of title IV-B and title IV-E funds to be withheld due to the title IV-E agency's failure to comply on the second full review following the first full review in which the determination of nonconformity was made is 28 percent of the funds described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section for each year to which the withholding of funds applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Title IV-E agencies determined not to be in substantial conformity that fail to correct the areas of nonconformity through the successful completion of a program improvement plan, and are determined to be in nonconformity on the third and any subsequent full reviews following the first full review in which a determination of nonconformity was made will be subject to increased withholding as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount of funds described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section will increase to three percent for each of the seven outcomes and each of the seven systemic factors that continues in nonconformity since the immediately preceding child and family services review;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The increased withholding of funds for areas of continuous nonconformity is subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The maximum amount of title IV-B and title IV-E funds to be withheld due to the title IV-E agency's failure to comply on the third and any subsequent full reviews following the first full review in which the determination of nonconformity was made is 42 percent of the funds described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section for each year to which the withholding of funds applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Suspension of withholding. (1) For title IV-E agencies determined not to be operating in substantial conformity, ACF will suspend the withholding of the title IV-E agencies' title IV-B and title IV-E funds during the time that a program improvement plan is in effect, provided that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The program improvement plan conforms to the provisions of Sec. 1355.35 of this part; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The title IV-E agency is actively implementing the provisions of the program improvement plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Suspension of the withholding of funds is limited to three years following each review, or the amount of time approved for implementation of the program improvement plan, whichever is less.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Terminating the withholding of funds. For title IV-E agencies determined not to be in substantial conformity, ACF will terminate the withholding of the title IV-E agency's title IV-B and title IV-E funds related to the nonconformity upon determination by the title IV-E agency and ACF that the title IV-E agency has achieved substantial conformity or has successfully completed a program improvement plan. ACF will rescind the withholding of the portion of title IV-B and title IV-E funds related to specific goals or action steps as of the date at the end of the quarter in which they were determined to have been achieved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Withholding of funds. (1) Title IV-E agencies determined not to be in substantial conformity that fail to successfully complete a program improvement plan will be notified by ACF of this final determination of nonconformity in writing within 10 business days after the relevant completion date specified in the plan, and advised of the amount of title IV-B and title IV-E funds which are to be withheld.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Title IV-B and title IV-E funds will be withheld based on the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the title IV-E agency fails to submit status reports in accordance with Sec. 1355.35(d)(4), or if such reports indicate that the title IV-E agency is not making satisfactory progress toward achieving goals or actions steps, funds

will be withheld at that time for a period beginning October 1 of the fiscal year for which the determination of nonconformity was made and ending on the specified completion date for the affected goal or action step.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Funds related to goals and action steps that have not been achieved by the specified completion date will be withheld at that time for a period beginning October 1 of the fiscal year for which the determination of nonconformity was made and ending on the completion date of the affected goal or action step; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The withholding of funds commensurate with the level of nonconformity at the end of the program improvement plan will begin at the latest completion date specified in the program improvement plan and will continue until a subsequent full review determines the title IV-E agency to be in substantial conformity or the title IV-E agency successfully completes a program improvement plan developed as a result of that subsequent full review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When the date the title IV-E agency is determined to be in substantial conformity or to have successfully completed a program improvement plan falls within a specific quarter, the amount of funds to be withheld will be computed to the end of that quarter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A title IV-E agency that refuses to participate in the development or implementation of a program improvement plan, as required by ACF, will be subject to the maximum increased withholding of 42 percent of its title IV-B and title IV-E funds, as described in paragraph (b)(8) of this section, for each year or portion thereof to which the withholding of funds applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The title IV-E agency will be liable for interest on the amount of funds withheld by the Department, in accordance with the provisions of 45 CFR 30.18.
