                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope and effective date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as otherwise  provided, the definitions in this section apply for all purposes of  sections 103 and 141 through 150.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effective/applicability date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as  otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(2), this section applies to  issues issued after June 30, 1993 to which Sec. Sec. 1.148-1 through  1.148-11 apply. In addition, this section (other than paragraph (c)(3)  of this section) applies to any issue to which the election described in  Sec. 1.148-11(b)(1) is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special effective date for paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(4)(iii), and  (c)(6). Paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(4)(iii), and (c)(6) of this section apply  to bonds sold on or after July 8, 1997 and to any issue to which the  election described in Sec. 1.148-11(b)(1) is made. See Sec. 1.148- 11A(i) for rules relating to certain bonds sold before July 8, 1997.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Additional exception to the general applicability date. Section  1.150-1(b), Issuance costs, applies on and after July 6, 2011.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Certain general definitions. The following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth0">Bond means any obligation of a State or political subdivision  thereof under section 103(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0">Bond documents means the bond indenture or resolution, transcript of  proceedings, and any related documents.</p><p class="depth0">Capital expenditure means any cost of a type that is properly  chargeable to capital account (or would be so chargeable with a proper  election or with the application of the definition of placed in service  under Sec. 1.150-2(c)) under general Federal income tax principles. For  example, costs incurred to acquire, construct, or improve land,  buildings, and equipment generally are capital expenditures. Whether an  expenditure is a capital expenditure is determined   at the time the expenditure is paid with respect to the property. Future  changes in law do not affect whether an expenditure is a capital  expenditure.</p><p class="depth0">Conduit borrower means the obligor on a purpose investment (as  defined in Sec. 1.148-1). For example, if an issuer invests proceeds in  a purpose investment in the form of a loan, lease, installment sale  obligation, or similar obligation to another entity and the obligor uses  the proceeds to carry out the governmental purpose of the issue, the  obligor is a conduit borrower.</p><p class="depth0">Conduit financing issue means an issue the proceeds of which are  used or are reasonably expected to be used to finance at least one  purpose investment representing at least one conduit loan to one conduit  borrower.</p><p class="depth0">Conduit loan means a purpose investment (as defined in Sec. 1.148- 1).</p><p class="depth0">Governmental bond means any bond of an issue of tax-exempt bonds in  which none of the bonds are private activity bonds.</p><p class="depth0">Issuance costs means costs to the extent incurred in connection  with, and allocable to, the issuance of an issue within the meaning of  section 147(g). For example, issuance costs include the following costs  but only to the extent incurred in connection with, and allocable to,  the borrowing: underwriters' spread; counsel fees; financial advisory  fees; fees paid to an organization to evaluate the credit quality of an  issue; trustee fees; paying agent fees; bond registrar, certification,  and authentication fees; accounting fees; printing costs for bonds and  offering documents; public approval process costs; engineering and  feasibility study costs; guarantee fees, other than for qualified  guarantees (as defined in Sec. 1.148-4(f)); and similar costs.</p><p class="depth0">Issue date means, in reference to an issue, the first date on which  the issuer receives the purchase price in exchange for delivery of the  evidence of indebtedness representing any bond included in the issue.  Issue date means, in reference to a bond, the date on which the issuer  receives the purchase price in exchange for that bond. In no event is  the issue date earlier than the first day on which interest begins to  accrue on the bond or bonds for Federal income tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0">Obligation means any valid evidence of indebtedness under general  Federal income tax principles.</p><p class="depth0">Pooled financing issue means an issue the proceeds of which are to  be used to finance purpose investments representing conduit loans to two  or more conduit borrowers, unless those conduit loans are to be used to  finance a single capital project.</p><p class="depth0">Private activity bond means a private activity bond (as defined in  section 141).</p><p class="depth0">Qualified mortgage loan means a mortgage loan with respect to an  owner-occupied residence acquired with the proceeds of an obligation  described in section 143(a)(1) or 143(b) (or applicable prior law).</p><p class="depth0">Qualified student loan means a student loan acquired with the  proceeds of an obligation described in section 144(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0">Related party means, in reference to a governmental unit or a  501(c)(3) organization, any member of the same controlled group, and, in  reference to any person that is not a governmental unit or 501(c)(3)  organization, a related person (as defined in section 144(a)(3)).</p><p class="depth0">Taxable bond means any obligation the interest on which is not  excludable from gross income under section 103.</p><p class="depth0">Tax-exempt bond means any bond the interest on which is excludable  from gross income under section 103(a). For purposes of section 148,  tax-exempt bond includes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An interest in a regulated investment company to the extent that  at least 95 percent of the income to the holder of the interest is  interest that is excludable from gross income under section 103; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A certificate of indebtedness issued by the United States  Treasury pursuant to the Demand Deposit State and Local Government  Series program described in 31 CFR part 344.</p><p class="depth0">Working capital expenditure means any cost that is not a capital  expenditure. Generally, current operating expenses are working capital  expenditures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definition of issue--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as otherwise  provided in this paragraph (c), the term issue means two or more bonds  that meet all of the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Sold at substantially the same time. The bonds are sold at  substantially the same time. Bonds are treated as sold at substantially  the same time if they are sold less than 15 days apart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Sold pursuant to the same plan of financing. The bonds are sold  pursuant to the same plan of financing. Factors material to the plan of  financing include the purposes for the bonds and the structure of the  financing. For example, generally--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Bonds to finance a single facility or related facilities are  part of the same plan of financing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Short-term bonds to finance working capital expenditures and  long-term bonds to finance capital projects are not part of the same  plan of financing; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Certificates of participation in a lease and general obligation  bonds secured by tax revenues are not part of the same plan of  financing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Payable from same source of funds. The bonds are reasonably  expected to be paid from substantially the same source of funds,  determined without regard to guarantees from parties unrelated to the  obligor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exception for taxable bonds. Taxable bonds and tax-exempt bonds  are not part of the same issue under this paragraph (c). The issuance of  tax-exempt bonds in a transaction (or series of related transactions)  that includes taxable bonds, however, may constitute an abusive  arbitrage device under Sec. 1.148-10(a) or a device to avoid other  limitations in sections 103 and 141 through 150 (for example, structures  involving windows or unreasonable allocations of bonds).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exception for certain bonds financing separate purposes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In  general. Bonds may be treated as part of separate issues if the  requirements of this paragraph (c)(3) are satisfied. Each of these  separate issues must finance a separate purpose (e.g., refunding a  separate prior issue, financing a separate purpose investment, financing  integrated or functionally related capital projects, and financing any  clearly discrete governmental purpose). Each of these separate issues  independently must be a tax-exempt bond (e.g., a governmental bond or a  qualified mortgage bond). The aggregate proceeds, investments, and bonds  in such a transaction must be allocated between each of the separate  issues using a reasonable, consistently applied allocation method. If  any separate issue consists of refunding bonds, the allocation rules in  Sec. 1.148-9(h) must be satisfied. An allocation is not reasonable if  it achieves more favorable results under sections 103 and 141 to 150  than could be achieved with actual separate issues. All allocations  under this paragraph (c)(3) must be made in writing on or before the  issue date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exceptions. This paragraph (c)(3) does not apply for purposes  of sections 141, 144(a), 148, 149(d) and 149(g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Special rules for certain financings--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Draw-down loans. Bonds  issued pursuant to a draw-down loan are treated as part of a single  issue. The issue date of that issue is the first date on which the  aggregate draws under the loan exceed the lesser of $50,000 or 5 percent  of the issue price.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Commercial paper--(A) In general. Short-term bonds having a  maturity of 270 days or less (commercial paper) issued pursuant to the  same commercial paper program may be treated as part of a single issue,  the issue date of which is the first date the aggregate amount of  commercial paper issued under the program exceeds the lesser of $50,000  or 5 percent of the aggregate issue price of the commercial paper in the  program. A commercial paper program is a program to issue commercial  paper to finance or refinance the same governmental purpose pursuant to  a single master legal document. Commercial paper is not part of the same  commercial paper program unless issued during an 18-month period,  beginning on the deemed issue date. In addition, commercial paper issued  after the end of this 18-month period may be treated as part of the  program to the extent issued to refund commercial paper that is part of  the program, but only to the extent that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> There is no increase in the principal amount outstanding; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The program does not have a term in excess of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 30 years; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The period reasonably necessary for the governmental purposes  of the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Safe harbor. The requirement of paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A)(2) of  this section is treated as satisfied if the weighted average maturity of  the issue does not exceed 120 percent of the weighted average expected  economic life of the property financed by the issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Certain general obligation bonds. Except as otherwise provided  in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, bonds that are secured by a pledge  of the issuer's full faith and credit (or a substantially similar  pledge) and sold and issued on the same dates pursuant to a single  offering document may be treated as part of the same issue if the issuer  so elects on or before the issue date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Anti-abuse rule. In order to prevent the avoidance of sections  103 and 141 through 150 and the general purposes thereof, the  Commissioner may treat bonds as part of the same issue or as part of  separate issues to clearly reflect the economic substance of a  transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Sale date. The sale date of a bond is the first day on which  there is a binding contract in writing for the sale or exchange of the  bond.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Definition of refunding issue and related definitions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  General definition of refunding issue. Refunding issue means an issue of  obligations the proceeds of which are used to pay principal, interest,  or redemption price on another issue (a prior issue, as more  particularly defined in paragraph (d)(5) of this section), including the  issuance costs, accrued interest, capitalized interest on the refunding  issue, a reserve or replacement fund, or similar costs, if any, properly  allocable to that refunding issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions and special rules. For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)  of this section, the following exceptions and special rules apply--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Payment of certain interest. An issue is not a refunding issue  if the only principal and interest that is paid with proceeds of the  issue (determined without regard to the multipurpose issue rules of  Sec. 1.148-9(h)) is interest on another issue that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Accrues on the other issue during a one-year period including  the issue date of the issue that finances the interest;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Is a capital expenditure; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Is a working capital expenditure to which the de minimis rule of  Sec. 1.148-6(d)(3)(ii)(A) applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certain issues with different obligors--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. An  issue is not a refunding issue to the extent that the obligor (as  defined in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) of one issue is  neither the obligor of the other issue nor a related party with respect  to the obligor of the other issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Definition of obligor. The obligor of an issue means the actual  issuer of the issue, except that the obligor of the portion of an issue  properly allocable to an investment in a purpose investment means the  conduit borrower under that purpose investment. The obligor of an issue  used to finance qualified mortgage loans, qualified student loans, or  similar program investments (as defined in Sec. 1.148-1) does not  include the ultimate recipient of the loan (e.g., the homeowner, the  student).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Certain special rules for purpose investments. For purposes of  this paragraph (d), the following special rules apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Refunding of a conduit financing issue by a conduit loan  refunding issue. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this  section, the use of the proceeds of an issue that is used to refund an  obligation that is a purpose investment (a conduit refunding issue) by  the actual issuer of the conduit financing issue determines whether the  conduit refunding issue is a refunding of the conduit financing issue  (in addition to a refunding of the obligation that is the purpose  investment).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Recycling of certain payments under purpose investments. A  conduit refunding issue is not a refunding of a conduit financing issue  to the extent that the actual issuer of the conduit financing issue  reasonably expects as of the date of receipt of the proceeds of the  conduit refunding issue to use those amounts within 6 months (or, if  greater, during the applicable temporary period for those amounts under  section 148(c) or under applicable prior law) to acquire a new purpose  investment. Any new purpose investment is treated as made from the  proceeds of the conduit financing issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Application to tax-exempt loans. For purposes of this paragraph  (d), obligations that would be purpose investments (absent section  148(b)(3)(A)) are treated as purpose investments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Substance of transaction controls. In the absence of other  applicable controlling rules under this paragraph (d), the determination  of whether an issue is a refunding issue is based on the substance of  the transaction in light of all the facts and circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Certain integrated transactions in connection with asset  acquisition not treated as refunding issues. If, within six months  before or after a person assumes (including taking subject to)  obligations of an unrelated party in connection with an asset  acquisition (other than a transaction to which section 381(a) applies if  the person assuming the obligation is the acquiring corporation within  the meaning of section 381(a)), the assumed issue is refinanced, the  refinancing issue is not treated as a refunding issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Current refunding issue. Current refunding issue means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, a  refunding issue that is issued not more than 90 days before the last  expenditure of any proceeds of the refunding issue for the payment of  principal or interest on the prior issue; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a refunding issue issued before 1986--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A refunding issue that is issued not more than 180 days before  the last expenditure of any proceeds of the refunding issue for the  payment of principal or interest on the prior issue; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A refunding issue if the prior issue had a term of less than 3  years and was sold in anticipation of permanent financing, but only if  the aggregate term of all prior issues sold in anticipation of permanent  financing was less than 3 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Advance refunding issue. Advance refunding issue means a  refunding issue that is not a current refunding issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Prior issue. Prior issue means an issue of obligations all or a  portion of the principal, interest, or call premium on which is paid or  provided for with proceeds of a refunding issue. A prior issue may be  issued before, at the same time as, or after a refunding issue. If the  refunded and unrefunded portions of a prior issue are treated as  separate issues under Sec. 1.148-9(i), for the purposes for which that  section applies, except to the extent that the context clearly requires  otherwise, references to a prior issue refer only to the refunded  portion of that prior issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Direct control. The determination of direct control is made on  the basis of all the relevant facts and circumstances. One entity or  group of entities (the controlling entity) generally controls another  entity or group of entities (the controlled entity) for purposes of this  paragraph if the controlling entity possesses either of the following  rights or powers and the rights or powers are discretionary and non- ministerial--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The right or power both to approve and to remove without cause a  controlling portion of the governing body of the controlled entity; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The right or power to require the use of funds or assets of the  controlled entity for any purpose of the controlling entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Indirect control. If a controlling entity controls a controlled  entity under the test in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, then the  controlling entity also controls all entities controlled, directly or  indirectly, by the controlled entity or entities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exception for general purpose governmental entities. An entity  is not a controlled entity under this paragraph (e) if the entity  possesses substantial taxing, eminent domain, and police powers. For  example, a city possessing substantial amounts of each of these  sovereign powers is not a controlled entity of the state.
