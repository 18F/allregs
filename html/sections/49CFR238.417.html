In calculating the stress to show compliance with this  requirement, local yielding of the side skin adjacent to the side sill  and belt rail, and local yielding of the side sill bend radii at the  crossbearer and floor-beam connections is allowed.   For purposes of this paragraph, local yielding is allowed provided the  resulting deformations in no way intrude upon the occupied volume of the  car.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The connections of the side frame to the roof and underframe  shall support the loads specified in this section.</p>
