If the article is not promptly safeguarded, removed from the United States, or abandoned by the importer for destruction, it may be seized, destroyed, or otherwise disposed of in accordance with section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A regulated article may be imported without complying with other restrictions under this subpart if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Imported for experimental, therapeutic, or developmental purposes under the conditions specified in a controlled import permit issued in accordance with Sec. 319.6;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Imported at the National Plant Germplasm Inspection Station, Building 580, Beltsville Agricultural Research Center East, Beltsville, MD 20705, or through any USDA plant inspection station listed in Sec. 319.37-14; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Imported with a controlled import tag or label securely attached to the outside of the container containing the article or securely attached to the article itself if not in a container, and with such tag or label bearing a controlled import permit number corresponding to the number of the controlled import permit issued for such article.
