Examples of situations in which complaints  may be used are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Immediate possession is required for some essential military  need and time does not permit preparation of an appraisal, title work,  or negotiations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Condemnation proceedings are necessary in connection with a  cemetery, in order to secure court approval   of the relocation and reinterment plan in accordance with the procedure  outlined in ER 1180-1-1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where right of entry for survey and exploration, appraisal  purposes, or other similar need is required, and there is no material  interference with the owner's possession. However, where there is  material interference with the owner's possession, or it is considered  there will be significant damage to the land, a deposit of estimated  compensation may be necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Approval required. Prior to submission of a complaint assembly,  except in cemetery cases, all pertinent facts justifying the need for  such action will be submitted to the Division Engineer for approval. If  the proposed action is approved, the Division or District Engineer will  inform all affected landowners and tenants of the action being taken,  the necessity therefor, and the subsequent procedure to be followed by  the Government in conducting negotiations to acquire the land after the  filing of the complaint.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Complaint assembly.

Where a complaint assembly is submitted,  the letter of transmittal should include the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement indicating the date of approval of the Real Estate  Design Memorandum in civil works projects or the date of the Real Estate  Directive for other projects, and whether the land included in the  complaint assembly is within the approved project boundary line,  together with the citations of the authorization and appropriation acts  which cover the acquisition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The approved appraised valuation and date of appraisal of the  interest to be acquired or, if appraisals have not been prepared, the  estimated value with a statement indicating the basis of the estimate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Information as to whether the land included in the complaint  assembly is vacant or occupied, together with the date any occupants  will be required to vacate the premises.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If possession is required, an explanation of the need therefor  and the reasons why the normal land acquisition schedule was not met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Results of contacts with the landowners and tenants and their  views with respect to the filing of condemnation proceedings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A statement as to the plan and schedule to acquire such land  after filing of the complaint in order to make funds available to the  landowners and tenants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> In assemblies concerning land for other than civil works  projects, a statement indicating whether all of the land authorized in  the Real Estate Directive is included in the assembly. Any variance  between the area or estate authorized in the directive and those in the  assembly should be fully explained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> In military assemblies, a statement of expected local resistance  to the proposed acquisition and efforts made to adjust military  requirements to the local situation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Whether there have been any Congressional inquiries regarding  the acquisition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Action after filing complaint. After filing of a complaint  proceeding, action to acquire the land involved, either by   direct purchase or by the filing of a declaration of taking, will be  completed as soon as possible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where a satisfactory Offer to Sell is obtained and accepted, the  transaction will proceed through the stages of title clearance, payment  and closing. Upon final approval of title, the Division or District  Engineer will recommend to the Chief of Engineers that the Department of  Justice be requested to dismiss the tract from the proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where a satisfactory lease of the premises included in a  leasehold condemnation proceeding is obtained and accepted, the Division  or District Engineer will recommend to the Chief of Engineers that the  Department of Justice be requested to dismiss the tract from the  proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The recommendation of the Division or District Engineer for  dismissal of a tract from condemnation will include the following  information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Name of project.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Caption of the complaint and civil action number assigned  thereto.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The date the final title approval was rendered; on lease  cases, the date the lease was accepted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A statement as to whether the particular deed or lease includes  the same land described in the complaint under the same tract number.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A statement as to whether the particular deed or lease includes  all outstanding interests involved in the complaint insofar as the  specific parcel of land is concerned. If all outstanding interests are  not covered by the deed or lease instrument, a statement of the proposed  method of acquiring those interests which remain outstanding, either by  filing a declaration of taking or by direct purchase, or a  recommendation that they be left outstanding permanently.</p>
