                            <p class="depth0">Section 13(b)(12) requires for exemption of irrigation work that the  ditches, canals, reservoirs, or waterways in connection with which the  employee's work is done be ``used exclusively for supply and storing of  water at least 90 percent of which was ultimately delivered for  agricultural purposes during the preceding calendar year.'' If a water  supplier supplies water of which more than 10 percent is used for  purposes other than ``agricultural purposes'' during the preceding  calendar year, the exemption would not apply. For example, the exemption  would not apply where more than 10 percent of the water supplier's water  is delivered to a municipality to be used for general, domestic, and  commercial purposes. Water used for watering livestock raised by a  farmer is ``for agricultural purposes.''  [76 FR 18859, Apr. 5, 2011]</p>
