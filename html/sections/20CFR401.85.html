This exemption applies only to an investigatory record compiled by SSA for criminal law enforcement purposes in a system of records exempt under subsection (j)(2) of the Privacy Act to the extent that these requirements would prejudice the conduct of the investigation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following systems of records are exempt from those provisions of the Privacy Act and this part listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Pursuant to subsection (j)(2) of the Privacy Act, the Investigatory Material Compiled for Law Enforcement Purposes System, SSA.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Pursuant to subsection (k)(2) of the Privacy Act:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The General Criminal Investigation Files, SSA;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The Criminal Investigations File, SSA; and,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The Program Integrity Case Files, SSA.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Civil and Administrative Investigative Files of the Inspector General, SSA/OIG.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Complaint Files and Log.
