                            <p class="depth0">HHS charges the following fees:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Manual searching for or reviewing of records--when the search or review is performed by employees at grade GS-1 through GS-8, an hourly rate based on the salary of a GS-5, step 7, employee; when done by a GS-9 through GS-14, an hourly rate based on the salary of a GS-12, step 4, employee; and when done by a GS-15 or above, an hourly rate based on the salary of a GS-15, step 7, employee. In each case, the hourly rate will be computed by taking the current hourly rate for the specified grade and step, adding 16% of that rate to cover benefits, and rounding to the nearest whole dollar. As of November 25, 1988, these rates were $10, $20, and $37 respectively. When a search involves employees at more than one of these levels, we will charge the rate appropriate for each.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Computer searching and printing--the actual cost of operating the computer plus charges for the time spent by the operator, at the rates given in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Photocopying standard size pages--$0.10 per page.
