                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Annual compliance level. Subject to the provisions of this subpart, a facility is in compliance with its assurance to provide a reasonable volume of services to persons unable to pay if it provides for the fiscal year uncompensated services at a level not less than the lesser of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Three percent of its operating costs for the most recent fiscal year for which an audited financial statement is available;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Ten percent of all Federal assistance provided to or on behalf of the facility, adjusted by a percentage equal to the percentage change in the CPI between the year in which the facility received assistance or 1979, whichever is later, and the most recent year for which a published index is available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Deficits. If in any fiscal year a facility fails to meet its annual compliance level, it shall provide uncompensated services in an amount sufficient to make up that deficit in subsequent years, and its period of obligation shall be extended until the deficit is made up.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Types of deficits. For purposes of determining the timing and amount of any deficit make-up, there are two types of deficits:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Justifiable deficits. A justifiable deficit is one in which the facility did not meet its annual compliance level due to either financial inability (as determined under Sec.  124.511(c)) or, although otherwise in compliance with this subpart, a lack of eligible applicants for uncompensated services during the fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Noncompliance deficits. A noncompliance deficit is one in which the facility failed to meet its annual compliance level due to noncompliance with this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Timing of deficit make-up--(i) Justifiable deficits. (A) A facility assisted under title VI of the Act may make up a justifiable deficit at any time during its period of obligation or in the year (or years, if necessary) immediately following its period of obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A facility assisted under title XVI of the Act is not required to make up a justifiable deficit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Noncompliance deficits. (A) A facility must begin to make up a noncompliance deficit in the fiscal year following the finding of noncompliance by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A facility which claimed financial inability under Sec.  124.509(a)(2)(iii) and is found by the Secretary, pursuant to Sec.  124.511(c), to have been financially able to provide uncompensated services

in the year in which the deficit was incurred shall begin to make up the deficit beginning in the fiscal year following the Secretary's finding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A facility required to make up a noncompliance deficit but which is determined by the Secretary, pursuant to Sec.  124.511(c), to be financially unable to do so in the year following the Secretary's finding of noncompliance shall make up the deficit in accordance with a schedule set by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Deficit make-up amount. (i) The amount of a deficit in any fiscal year is the difference between the facility's annual compliance level for that year and the amount of uncompensated services provided in that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of a justifiable deficit must be adjusted by a percentage equal to the percentage change in the CPI between the CPI available in the fiscal year in which the deficit was incurred and the CPI available in the fiscal year in which it was made up.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An amount equal to the result of dividing the amount of any noncompliance deficit for a fiscal year by the number of years of obligation remaining and adjusting it by a percentage equal to the percentage change in the CPI between the CPI available in the fiscal year in which the deficit was incurred and the CPI available in the fiscal year in which it was made up shall be added to a facility's annual compliance level for each fiscal year following the fiscal year of the finding of noncompliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Affirmative action plan for precluding future deficits. Except where a facility reports to the Secretary in accordance with Sec.  124.509(a)(2)(iii) that it was financially unable to provide uncompensated services at the annual compliance level, a facility that fails to meet its annual compliance level in any fiscal year shall, in the following year, develop and implement a plan of action that can reasonably be expected to enable the facility to meet its annual compliance level. Such actions may include special notice to the community through newspaper, radio, and television, or expansion of service to Category B, or, with respect to nursing homes, Category C, persons. The Secretary may require changes to the plan. Where a facility fails to comply with this section, the Secretary may require it to make up the deficit in the fiscal year following the year in which it was required to institute the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Excesses. (1) Except for facilities certified under Sec.  124.513, Sec.  124.514, Sec.  124.515, Sec.  124.516, or Sec.  124.517, if a facility provides in a fiscal year uncompensated services in an amount exceeding its annual compliance level, it may apply the amount of excess to reduce its annual compliance level in any subsequent fiscal year. The facility may use any excess amount to reduce its annual compliance level only if the services in excess of the annual compliance level are provided in accordance with the requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Calculation and adjustment of excess. (i) The amount of an excess in uncompensated services in any fiscal year is the difference between the amount of uncompensated services the facility provided in that year and the facility's annual compliance level for that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of any excess compliance applied to reduce a facility's annual compliance level must be adjusted by a percentage equal to the percentage change in the CPI between the CPI available in the fiscal year in which the facility provided the excess, and the CPI available in the fiscal year in which the facility applies the excess to reduce its annual compliance level or satisfy its remaining obligation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Except as provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, a facility assisted under title VI may in any fiscal year apply the amount of excess credited under this paragraph to satisfy the remainder of its obligation to provide uncompensated services. A facility's remaining obligation is determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Where the annual compliance level in such fiscal year is established under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the remaining obligation is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For grant assistance, 10 percent of each grant under obligation, multiplied by the number of years remaining in its period of obligation, adjusted as provided for in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, plus any deficits required to be made up and less any unused excesses accrued in prior years; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For loan assistance, the facility's annual compliance level multiplied by

the number of years remaining in the scheduled life of the loan, plus the sum of 10 percent of each yearly cumulative total of additional interest subsidy or other payments (which the Secretary will have made in connection with the guaranteed loan or a direct loan which has been sold) in each subsequent year remaining in the scheduled life of the loan, plus any deficits required to be made up, and less any unused excesses accrued in prior years; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Where the annual compliance level in such fiscal year is established under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the remaining obligation is the average of the facility's annual compliance levels in the previous three years, multiplied by the number of years remaining in its period of obligation, plus any deficits required to be made up under this section, and less any unused excesses accrued in prior years.
