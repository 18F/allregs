If no significant information exists, a negative report will be  submitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Articles, preferably by-lined, with supporting photographs or  illustrations. (Suggested length is 2,000-2,500 words, but may be  shorter or longer as coverage of subject requires.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Material covering subjects that are timely and of particular  interest to those organizations oriented toward defense contracting,  including, but not necessarily limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Research and development;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Procurement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Contract management;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Small business opportunity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> DoD policies affecting industry;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Management improvement programs, such as Zero Defects;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Programs successfully conducted by industry and the DoD working  together;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Explanations of new DoD issuances affecting industry; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Major organizational changes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Key personnel appointment and reassignment announcements, for  the ``About People'' section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> New or revised official directives, instructions, regulations,  and other publications, for the ``Bibliography'' section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Scheduled technical meetings and symposia sponsored by DoD  organizations, projected at least forty-five (45) days, for the  ``Meeting and Symposia'' section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Announcements of meetings, conferences, briefings,  demonstrations, exercises, etc., projected at least forty-five (45)  days, for the ``Calendar of Events.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each DoD component will designate one action officer and one  alternate to assist the Directorate for Community Relations, OASD(PA),  in carrying out responsibilities defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Participation in special events--(1) Industry-sponsored events.  (i) DoD components are encouraged to cooperate with and assist industry  in activities and events beneficial to the Government, provided such  cooperation and assistance is not in conflict with the provisions of  part 40 of this chapter which authorizes participation in:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Luncheons, dinners and similar gatherings when the host is an  industrial, technical, or professional association, not an individual  defense contractor or other commercial firm;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Public ceremonies of mutual interest to industry, local  committees, and the DoD (examples--ship launchings, rollouts, and first  flights);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Industrial programs which are in support of Government policy  (example--international exhibits which offer the opportunity to promote  U.S. scientific and technical leadership); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Civic and community projects in which industry relationship is  remote from the purpose and tenor of the event (example--Armed Forces  Day event sponsored by an individual firm).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Participation in events which benefit a particular firm  (examples--open houses and ceremonies dedicating new facilities) will be  limited, normally, to speaker participation (see part 238 of this  subchapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> DoD-sponsored events. Generally, DoD public affairs programs  will be performed within authorized resources. Contractor participation  in DoD-sponsored events involving a firm's product or service may be  authorized, provided such participation is in the Government's interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Jointly sponsored events. Joint DoD-industry sponsorship may be  desirable in certain instances (examples--seminars, conferences, and  symposia). Industry assistance is normally provided by a trade,  technical, or professional association. Requirements for clearance of  DoD official information prepared for disclosure (see part 159 of this  chapter and DoD Directive 5230.9, ``Clearance of Department of Defense  Public Information'' \1\) will be adhered to when applicable. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ Filed as part of the original.

Participation in industrial events of national and  international interest must be approved by the ASD(PA) in advance.  Detailed proposals, including cost estimates, will be submitted to the  ASD(PA) through the headquarters of the DoD component concerned.

Use of insignia is governed by part 237 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Themes and products. Requests for use of DoD themes and products  in commercial advertising and other promotions will be evaluated in  terms of their benefit to the DoD. A determination as to whether  cooperation should be extended will be made by the ASD (PA) (except in  the case of DoD component-controlled insignia), in accordance with the  provisions of part 237 of this subchapter. The DoD will bear only those  advertising costs authorized by section XV of the Armed Services  procurement regulation in part 15 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Filmed material. Participation in the production of motion  pictures and TV programs, including filmed commercials, will be governed  by provisions of DoD Instruction 5410.15, \1\ ``Delineation of DoD  Audio-Visual Public Affairs Responsibilities and Policies,'' and DoD  Instruction 5410.16, \1\ ``Procedures for DoD Assistance on Production  of Non-Government Motion Pictures and Television Programs.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Use of contractor product identification. DoD components may  identify contractors in their information activities whenever the major  responsibility for a product (example--an aircraft) can be clearly and  fairly credited to an identifiable contractor. In these instances, DoD  information releases will include both the manufacturer's name and the  DoD component's designation of the product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Solicitation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> DoD representatives will not solicit, or  authorize others to solicit, from contractors for advertising,  contributions, donations, subscriptions, or other emoluments.

(1) Visits to contractor  facilities will be governed by the provisions of DoD Manual 5220.22-M,  \2\ ``Industrial Security Manual for Safeguarding Classified Information  (Attachment to DD Form 441).'' ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ Available from Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government  Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402--$3.05. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When DoD Components desire to sponsor such visits by nationally  known press representatives, approval will be obtained from both the  contractor and the ASD(PA).</p>
