                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> No person or entity shall take, hold, own or control more than 246,080 acres of Federal oil and gas leases in any one State at any one time. No more than 200,000 acres of such acres may be held under option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In Alaska, the acreage that can be taken, held, owned or controlled is limited to 300,000 acres in the northern leasing district and 300,000 acres in the southern leasing district, of which no more than 200,000 acres may be held under option in each of the 2 leasing districts. The boundary between the 2 leasing districts in Alaska begins at the northeast corner of the Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge as established on December 2, 1980 (16 U.S.C. 3101), at a point on the boundary between the United States and Canada, then northwesterly along the northern boundary of the refuge to the left limit of the Tanana River (63[deg]9[min]38[sec] north latitude, 142[deg]20[min]52[sec] west longitude), then westerly along the left limit to the confluence of the Tanana and Yukon Rivers, and then along the left limit of the Yukon River from said confluence to its principal southern mouth.

Sec. 3101.2-2  Acquired lands.</p><p class="depth0">An acreage limitation separate from, but equal to the acreage limitation for public domain lands described in Sec. 3101.2-1 of this title, applies to acquired lands. Where the United States owns only a fractional interest in the mineral resources of the lands involved in a lease, only that part owned by the United States shall be charged as acreage holdings. The acreage embraced in a future interest lease shall not be charged as acreage holdings until the lease for the future interest becomes effective.


Sec. 3101.2-3  Excepted acreage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The following acreage shall not be included in computing accountable acreage:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Acreage under any lease any portion of which is committed to any Federally approved unit or cooperative plan or communitization agreement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Acreage under any lease for which royalty (including compensatory royalty or royalty in-kind) was paid in the preceding calendar year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Acreage under leases subject to an operating, drilling or development contract approved by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Acreage subject to offers to lease, overriding royalties and payments out

of production shall not be included in computing accountable acreage.
[48 FR 33662, July 22, 1983, as amended at 53 FR 17352, May 16, 1988; 71 FR 14823, Mar. 24, 2006]


Sec. 3101.2-4  Excess acreage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Where, as the result of the termination or contraction of a unit or cooperative plan, the elimination of a lease from an operating, drilling or development contract a party holds or controls excess accountable acreage, said party shall have 90 days from that date to reduce the holdings to the prescribed limitation and to file proof of the reduction in the proper BLM office. Where as a result of a merger or the purchase of the controlling interest in a corporation, acreage in excess of the amount permitted is acquired, the party holding the excess acreage shall have 180 days from the date of the merger or purchase to divest the excess acreage. If additional time is required to complete the divestiture of the excess acreage, a petition requesting additional time, along with a full justification for the additional time, may be filed with the authorized officer prior to the termination of the 180-day period provided herein.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If any person or entity is found to hold accountable acreage in violation of the provisions of these regulations, lease(s) or interests therein shall be subject to cancellation or forfeiture in their entirety, until sufficient acreage has been eliminated to comply with the acreage limitation. Excess acreage or interest shall be cancelled in the inverse order of acquisition.
[48 FR 33662, July 22, 1983, as amended at 53 FR 17353, May 16, 1988]


Sec. 3101.2-5  Computation.</p><p class="depth0">The accountable acreage of a party owning an undivided interest in a lease shall be the party's proportionate part of the total lease acreage. The accountable acreage of a party who is the beneficial owner of more than 10 percent of the stock of a corporation which holds Federal oil and gas leases shall be the party's proportionate part of the corporation's accountable acreage. Parties to a contract for development of leased lands and co-parties, except those operating, drilling or development contracts subject to Sec. 3101.2-3 of this title, shall be charged with their proportionate interests in the lease. No holding of acreage in common by the same persons in excess of the maximum acreage specified in the laws for any one party shall be permitted.
[48 FR 33662, July 22, 1983, as amended at 49 FR 2113, Jan. 18, 1984; 53 FR 17353, May 16, 1988]


Sec. 3101.2-6  Showing required.</p><p class="depth0">At any time the authorized officer may require any lessee or operator to file with the Bureau of Land Management a statement showing as of specified date the serial number and the date of each lease in which he/she has any interest, in the particular State, setting forth the acreage covered thereby.</p>
