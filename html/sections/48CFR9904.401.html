Sec. 9904.401-10  [Reserved]


Sec. 9904.401-20  Purpose.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The purpose of this Cost Accounting Standard is to ensure that each contractor's practices used in estimating costs for a proposal are consistent with cost accounting practices used by him in accumulating and reporting costs. Consistency in the application of cost accounting practices is necessary to enhance the likelihood that comparable transactions are treated alike. With respect to individual contracts, the consistent application of cost accounting practices will facilitate the preparation of reliable cost estimates used in pricing a proposal and their comparison with the costs of performance of the resulting contract. Such comparisons provide one important basis for financial control over costs during contract performance and aid in establishing accountability for cost in the manner agreed to by both parties at the time of contracting. The comparisons also provide an improved basis for evaluating estimating capabilities.


Sec. 9904.401-30  Definitions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The following are definitions of terms which are prominent in this Standard. Other terms defined elsewhere in this part 99 shall have the meanings ascribed to them in those definitions unless paragraph (b) of this subsection, requires otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Accumulating costs means the collecting of cost data in an organized manner, such as through a system of accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Actual cost means an amount determined on the basis of cost incurred (as distinguished from forecasted cost), including standard cost properly adjusted for applicable variance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Estimating costs means the process of forecasting a future result in terms of cost, based upon information available at the time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Indirect cost pool means a grouping of incurred costs identified with two or more objectives but not identified specifically with any final cost objective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Pricing means the process of establishing the amount or amounts to be paid in return for goods or services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Proposal means any offer or other submission used as a basis for pricing a contract, contract modification or termination settlement or for securing payments thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Reporting costs means provision of cost information to others.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The following modifications of terms defined elsewhere in this chapter 99 are applicable to this Standard: None.


Sec. 9904.401-40  Fundamental requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A contractor's practices used in estimating costs in pricing a proposal shall be consistent with his cost accounting practices used in accumulating and reporting costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A contractor's cost accounting practices used in accumulating and reporting actual costs for a contract shall be consistent with his practices used in estimating costs in pricing the related proposal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The grouping of homogeneous costs in estimates prepared for proposal purposes shall not per se be deemed an inconsistent application of cost accounting practices under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section when such costs are accumulated and reported in greater detail on an actual cost basis during contract performance.


Sec. 9904.401-50  Techniques for application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The standard allows grouping of homogeneous costs in order to cover those cases where it is not practicable

to estimate contract costs by individual cost element or function. However, costs estimated for proposal purposes shall be presented in such a manner and in such detail that any significant cost can be compared with the actual cost accumulated and reported therefor. In any event the cost accounting practices used in estimating costs in pricing a proposal and in accumulating and reporting costs on the resulting contract shall be consistent with respect to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The classification of elements or functions of cost as direct or indirect;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The indirect cost pools to which each element or function of cost is charged or proposed to be charged; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The methods of allocating indirect costs to the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Adherence to the requirement of 9904.401-40(a) of this standard shall be determined as of the date of award of the contract, unless the contractor has submitted cost or pricing data pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2306a or 41 U.S.C. 254(d) (Pub. L. 87-653), in which case adherence to the requirement of 9904.401-40(a) shall be determined as of the date of final agreement on price, as shown on the signed certificate of current cost or pricing data. Notwithstanding 9904.401-40(b), changes in established cost accounting practices during contract performance may be made in accordance with part 99.

Sec. 9904.401-61  Interpretation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> 9904.401, Cost Accounting Standard--Consistency in Estimating, Accumulating and Reporting Costs, requires in 9904.401-40 that a contractor's ``practices used in estimating costs in pricing a proposal shall be consistent with his cost accounting practices used in accumulating and reporting costs.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In estimating the cost of direct material requirements for a contract, it is a common practice to first estimate the cost of the actual quantities

to be incorporated in end items. Provisions are then made for additional direct material costs to cover expected material losses such as those which occur, for example, when items are scrapped, fail to meet specifications, are lost, consumed in the manufacturing process, or destroyed in testing and qualification processes. The cost of some or all of such additional direct material requirements is often estimated by the application of one or more percentage factors to the total cost of basic direct material requirements or to some other base.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Questions have arisen as to whether the accumulation of direct material costs in an undifferentiated account where a contractor estimates a significant part of such costs by means of percentage factors is in compliance with 9904.401. The most serious questions pertain to such percentage factors which are not supported by the contractor with accounting, statistical, or other relevant data from past experience, nor by a program to accumulate actual costs for comparison with such percentage estimates. The accumulation of direct costs in an undifferentiated account in this circumstance is a cost accounting practice which is not consistent with the practice of estimating a significant part of costs by means of percentage factors. This situation is virtually identical with that described in Illustration 9904.401-60(b)(5), which deals with labor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> 9904.401 does not, however, prescribe the amount of detail required in accumulating and reporting costs. The amount of detail required may vary considerably depending on the percentage factors used, the data presented in justification or lack thereof, and the significance of each situation. Accordingly, it is neither appropriate nor practical to prescribe a single set of accounting practices which would be consistent in all situations with the practices of estimating direct material costs by percentage factors. Therefore, the amount of accounting and statistical detail to be required and maintained in accounting for this portion of direct material costs has been and continues to be a matter to be decided by Government procurement authorities on the basis of the individual facts and circumstances.


Sec. 9904.401-62  Exemption.</p><p class="depth0">None for this Standard.


Sec. 9904.401-63  Effective date.</p><p class="depth0">This Standard is effective as of April 17, 1992.
