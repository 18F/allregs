                                Sec. 1610.11  Appeals to the legal counsel from initial denials.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When the Assistant Legal Counsel, FOIA Programs, the District  Director, or the District Director's designee has denied a request for  records in whole or in part, the requester may appeal within 30 calendar  days of receipt of the determination letter. The appeal must be in  writing, addressed to the Legal Counsel, or the Assistant Legal Counsel,  FOIA Programs, as appropriate, and submitted by mail to the Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission, 131 M Street, NE., Suite 5NW02E,  Washington, DC 20507, by fax to (202) 663-4679, by email to  FOIA@eeoc.gov, or by Internet to https://egov.eeoc.gov/foia/. Every  appeal filed under this section must be clearly labeled as a ``Freedom  of Information Act Appeal.'' Any appeal of a determination issued by a  District Director or the District Director's designee must include a  copy of the District Director's or the District Director's designee's  determination. If a FOIA appeal is misdirected to a District Office, the  District Office shall forward the appeal to the Legal Counsel, or the  Assistant Legal Counsel, FOIA Programs, as appropriate, within 10  business days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Legal Counsel or designee, or the Assistant Legal Counsel,  FOIA Programs, as appropriate, shall act upon the appeal within 20  business days of its receipt, and more rapidly if practicable. If the  decision is in favor of the person making the request, the decision  shall order that records be promptly made available to the person making  the request. The Legal Counsel or designee, or the Assistant Legal  Counsel, FOIA Programs, as appropriate, may extend the 20 business day  period in which to render a decision on an appeal for that period of  time which could have been claimed and used by the Assistant Legal  Counsel, FOIA Programs, the District Director, or the District  Director's designee under Sec. 1610.9, but which was not in fact used  in making the original determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The decision on appeal shall be in writing and signed by the  Legal Counsel or designee, or the Assistant Legal Counsel, FOIA  Programs, as appropriate. A denial in whole or in part of a request on  appeal shall set forth the exemption relied on, a brief explanation of  how the exemption applies to the records withheld, and the reasons for  asserting it, if different from those   described by the Assistant Legal Counsel, FOIA Programs, the District  Director, or the District Director's designee under Sec. 1610.9. The  decision on appeal shall indicate that the person making the request  may, if dissatisfied with the decision, file a civil action in the  United States District Court for the district in which the person  resides or has his principal place of business, for the district where  the records reside, or for the District of Columbia.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No personal appearance, oral argument or hearing will ordinarily  be permitted in connection with an appeal to the Legal Counsel or the  Assistant Legal Counsel, FOIA Programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> On appeal, the Legal Counsel or designee, or the Assistant Legal  Counsel, FOIA Programs, as appropriate, may reduce any fees previously  assessed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In the event that the Commission terminates its proceedings on a  charge after the District Director or the District Director's designee  denies a request, in whole or in part, for the charge file but during  consideration of the requester's appeal from that denial, the request  may be remanded for redetermination. The requester retains a right to  appeal to the Assistant Legal Counsel, FOIA Programs, from the decision  on remand.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A response to an appeal will advise the requester that the 2007  amendments to FOIA created the Office of Government Information Services  (OGIS) to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA  requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to  litigation. A requester may contact OGIS in any of the following ways:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records  Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road--OGIS, College Park, MD 20740; https:/ /ogis.archives.gov; email--ogis@nara.gov; telephone--202-741-5770;  facsimile--202-741-5769; toll-free--1-877-684-6448.
