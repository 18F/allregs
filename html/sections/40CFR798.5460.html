                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This test detects transmitted chromosomal damage which  manifests as balanced reciprocal translocations in progeny descended  from parental males treated with chemical mutagens.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A heritable translocation is one in which  distal segments of nonhomologous chromosomes are involved in a  reciprocal exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Diakinesis and metaphase I are stages of meiotic prophase scored  cytologically for the presence of multivalent chromosome association  characteristic of translocation carriers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reference substances. Not applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Test method--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Principle. When a balanced reciprocal  translocation is induced in a parental male germ cell, the resulting  progeny is translocation heterozygote.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Basis for fertility screening. Male translocation heterozygotes  may be completely sterile. This class consists of two types of  translocations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Translocations between non-homologous chromosomes in which at  least one of the breaks occurs close to one end of a chromosome.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Those that carry multiple translocations. The majority of male  translocation heterozygotes are semisterile--they carry one or (rarely)  two translocations. The degree of semisterility is dependent upon the  proportions of balanced and unbalanced   (duplication-deficiency) gametes produced in the ejaculate as a function  of meiotic segregation. Balanced and unbalanced sperm are equally  capable of fertilizing an egg. Balanced sperm lead to viable progeny.  Unbalanced sperm result in early embryonic lethality.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Basis for cytological screening. The great majority of male  translocation heterozygotes can be identified cytologically through  analysis of diakinesis metaphase I spermatocytes. Translocation  heterozygotes are characterized by the presence of multivalent  chromosome association such as a ring or chain of four chromosomes held  together by chiasmata in paired homologous regions. Some translocation  carriers can be identified by the presence of extra long and/or extra  short chromosomes in spermatogonial and somatic cell metaphase  preparations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Description. Essentially, two methods have been used to screen  for translocation heterozygosity; one method uses a mating sequence to  identify sterile and semisterile males followed by cytological  examination of suspect male individuals; the other method deletes the  mating sequence altogether and all F1 male progeny are  examined cytologically for presence of translocation. In the former  approach, the mating sequence serves as a screen which eliminates most  fully fertile animals for cytological confirmation as translocation  heterozygotes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Animal selection--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Species. The mouse is the species  generally used, and is recommended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Age. Healthy sexually mature animals shall be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Number. (A) The number of male animals necessary is determined  by the following factors:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The use of either historical or concurrent controls.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The power of the test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The minimal rate of induction required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Whether positive controls are used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The level of significance desired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Assignment to groups. Animals shall be randomized and assigned  to treatment and control groups.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Control groups--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Concurrent controls. No concurrent positive  or negative (vehicle) controls are recommended as routine parts of the  heritable translocation assay. However, investigators not experienced in  performing translocation testing shall include a substance known to  produce translocations in the assay as a positive control reference  chemical.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Historical controls. At the present time, historical control  data must be used in tests for significance. When statistically reliable  historical controls are not available, negative (vehicle) controls shall  be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Test chemicals--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Vehicle. When appropriate for the route of  administration, solid and liquid test substances should be dissolved or  suspended in distilled water or isotonic saline. Water-insoluble  chemicals may be dissolved or suspended in appropriate vehicles. The  vehicle used shall neither interfere with the test chemical nor produce  toxic effects. Fresh preparations of the test chemical should be  employed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Dose levels. At least two dose levels shall be used. The  highest dose level shall result in toxic effects (which shall not  produce an incidence of fatalities which would prevent a meaningful  evaluation) or shall be the highest dose attainable or 5g/kg body  weight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Route of administration. Acceptable routes of administration  include oral, inhalation, admixture with food or water, and IP or IV  injection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Test performance--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Treatment and mating. The animals shall be  dosed with the test substances 7 days per week over a period of 35 days.  After treatment, each male shall be caged with 2 untreated females for a  period of 1 week. At the end of 1 week, females shall be separated from  males and caged individually. When females give birth, the day of birth,  litter size, and sex of progeny shall be recorded. All male progeny  should be weaned, and all female progeny should be discarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Testing for translocation heterozygosity. When males are  sexually mature, testing for translocation heterozygosity shall begin.  One of two methods shall be used; the first method involves mating,  determining those F1 progeny which are sterile or   semisterile and subsequent cytological analysis of suspect progeny; the  other method does not involve mating and determining sterility or  semisterility; all progeny are examined cytologically.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determination of sterility or semisterility--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Conventional  method. Females are mated, usually three females for each male, and each  female is killed at midpregnancy. Living and dead implantations are  counted. Criteria for determining normal and semisterile males are  usually established for each new strain because the number of dead  implantations varies considerably among strains.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Sequential method. Males to be tested are caged individually  with females and the majority of the presumably normal males are  identified on the basis of a predetermined size of 1 or 2 litters.  Breeding pens are examined daily on weekdays beginning 18 days after  pairing. Young are discarded immediately after they are scored. Males  that sire a litter whose size is the same as or greater than the minimum  set for a translocation-free condition are discarded with their litter.  If the litter size is smaller than the predetermined number, a second  litter is produced with the same rule applying. Males that cannot be  classified as normal after production of a second litter are tested  further by the conventional method or by cytological confirmation of  translocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Cytological analysis. For cytological analysis of suspected  semisteriles, the air-drying technique is used. Observation of at least  2 diakinesis-metaphase 1 cells with mutivalent association constitutes  the required evidence for the presence of a translocation. Sterile males  are examined by one of two methods, those with testes of normal size and  sperm in the epididymis are examined by the same techniques used for  semisteriles. Animals with small testes are examined by squash  preparations or, alternatively, by examination of mitotic metaphase  preparations. If squash preparations do not yield diakinesis-metaphase 1  cells, analysis of spermatogonia or bone marrow for the presence of  unusually long or short chromosomes should be performed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Data and report--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Treatment of results. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Data shall be  presented in tabular form and shall include the number of animals at  risk, the germ cell stage treated, the number of partial steriles and  semisteriles (if the fertility test is used), the number of  cytogenetically confirmed translocation heterozygotes (if the fertility  test is used, report the number of confirmed steriles and confirmed  partial steriles), the translocation rate, and either the standard error  of the rate or the upper 95 percent confidence limit on the rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> These data shall be presented for both treated and control  groups. Historical or concurrent controls shall be specified, as well as  the randomization procedure used for concurrent controls.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Statistical evaluation. Data shall be evaluated by appropriate  statistical methods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Interpretation of results. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> There are several criteria for  determining a positive result, one of which is a statistically  significant dose-related increase in the number of heritable  translocations. Another criterion may be based upon detection of a  reproducible and statistically significant positive response for at  least one of the test points.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A test substance which does not produce either a statistically  significant dose-related increase in the number of heritable  translocations or a statistically significant and reproducible positive  response at any one of the test points is considered nonmutagenic in  this system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Both biological and statistical significance should be  considered together in the evaluation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Test evaluation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Positive results in the heritable  translocation assay indicate that under the test conditions the test  substance causes heritable chromosomal damage in the test species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Negative results indicate that under the test conditions the  test substance does not cause heritable chromosomal damage in the test  species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Test report. In addition to the reporting recommendations as  specified under 40 CFR part 792, subpart J, the following specific  information shall be reported:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Species, strain, age, weight and number of animals of each sex  in each group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Test chemical vehicle, route and schedule of administration,  toxicity data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Dosing regimen, doses tested and rationale for dosage  selection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Mating schedule, number of females mated to each male.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The use of historical or concurrent controls.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Screening procedure including the decision criteria used and  the method by which they were determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Dose-response relationship, if applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> References.
