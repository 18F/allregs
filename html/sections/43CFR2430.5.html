Land Sale Act if (1) disposal under such other authority would be consistent with local governmental comprehensive plans, or (2) in the absence of such plans, with the views of local governmental authorities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Lands outside of Alaska may be classified as suitable for homestead entry under part 2510 of this chapter if they are (1) chiefly valuable for agricultural purposes, and (2) suitable for development as a home and farm for a man and his family, and (3) the anticipated return from agricultural use of the land would support the residents. If it is determined that the irrigation of land otherwise suitable for homestead entry would endanger the supply of adequate water for existing users or cause the dissipation of water reserves, such land will not be classified for entry. Land may be classified for homestead entry only if rainfall is adequate, or if under State law, there is available to the land sufficient irrigation water, to permit agricultural development of its cultivable portions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Lands may be classified as suitable for desert land entry under part 2520 of this chapter if (1) the lands are chiefly valuable for agricultural purposes, and (2) all provisions concerning irrigation water set forth in Sec. 2430.5(d) are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Lands outside of Alaska may be classified as suitable for Indian allotment under part 2530 of this chapter if (1) the lands are valuable for agricultural purposes, and (2) the lands are on the whole suitable for a home for an Indian and his family, and (3) the anticipated return from agricultural use of the land would support the residents, and (4) the requirements for water supplies set forth in Sec. 2430.5(d) are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Lands determined to be valuable for purposes other than public purposes may be determined to be suitable for exchange if the acquisition of the offered lands, the disposition of the public lands, and the anticipated costs of consummating the exchange will not disrupt governmental operations.</p>
