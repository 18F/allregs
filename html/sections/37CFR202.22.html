                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. This section prescribes rules pertaining to the  acquisition of phonorecords and copies of unpublished audio and  audiovisual transmission programs by the Library of Congress under  section 407(e) of title 17 of the United States Code, as amended. It  also prescribes rules pertaining to the use of such phonorecords and  copies in the registration of claims to copyright, under section 408(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The terms copies, fixed, phonorecords, publication, and  transmission program and their variant forms, have the meanings given to  them in section 101 of title 17. The term network station has the  meaning given it in section 111(f) of title 17. For the purpose of this  section, the term transmission includes transmission via the Internet,  cable, broadcasting, and satellite systems, and via any other existing  or future devices or processes for the communication of a performance or  display whereby images or sounds are received beyond the place from  which they are sent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Title 17 means title 17 of the United States Code, as amended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Recording of transmission programs. (1) Library of Congress  employees, including Library of Congress contractors, acting under the  general authority of the Librarian of Congress, may make a fixation of  an unpublished audio or audiovisual transmission program directly from a  transmission to the public in the United States, in accordance with  subsections 407(e)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> and (4) of title 17 of the United States Code. The  choice of programs selected for fixation shall be based on the Library  of Congress's acquisition policies in effect at the time of fixation.  Specific notice of an intent to record a transmission program will  ordinarily not be given. In general, the Library of Congress will seek  to record a substantial portion of the television programming  transmitted by noncommercial educational broadcast stations as defined  in section 397 of title 47 of the United States Code, and will record  selected programming transmitted by commercial television broadcast  stations, both network and independent. The Library will also record a  selected portion of the radio programming transmitted by commercial and  noncommercial broadcast stations. Additionally, the Library will record  a selected portion of unpublished Internet, cable and satellite  programming transmitted to the public in the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Upon written request addressed to the Chief, Motion Picture,  Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division by a broadcast station or other  owner of the right of transmission, the Library of Congress will inform  the requestor whether a particular transmission program has been  recorded by the Library.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Library of Congress will not knowingly record any unfixed or  published transmission program under the recording authority of section  407(e) of title 17 of the United States Code.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Library of Congress is entitled under this paragraph (c) to  presume that a radio program transmitted to the public in the United  States has been fixed but not published at the time of transmission, and  that a television program transmitted to the public in the United States  by a noncommercial educational broadcast station as defined in section  397 of title 47 of the United States Code has been fixed but not  published.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The presumption established by paragraph (c)(4) of this section  may be overcome by written declaration and submission of appropriate  documentary evidence to the Chief, Motion Picture, Broadcasting and  Recorded Sound Division, either before or after recording of the  particular transmission program by the Library of Congress. Such written  submission shall contain:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The identification, by title and time of broadcast, of the  transmission program in question;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A brief statement declaring either that the program was not  fixed or that it was published at the time of transmission;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If it is declared that the program was published at the time  of transmission, a brief statement of the facts of publication,  including the date and place thereof, the method of publication, the  name of the owner of the right of first publication, and whether the  work was published in the United States; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The actual handwritten signature of an officer or other duly  authorized agent of the organization which transmitted the program in  question.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A declaration that the program was unfixed at the time of  transmission shall be accepted by the Library of Congress, unless the  Library can cite evidence to the contrary, and the copy or phonorecord  will either be</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Erased; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Retained, if requested by the owner of copyright or of any  exclusive right, to satisfy the deposit provision of section 408 of  title 17 of the United States Code.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If it is declared that the program was published at the time of  transmission, the Library of Congress is entitled under this section to  retain the copy or phonorecord to satisfy the deposit requirement of  section 407(a) of title 17 of the United States Code.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The Library of Congress shall maintain a list of the radio,  cable, Internet and satellite transmission programs that the Library has  recorded on the Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division  Web site at http://www.loc.gov/rr/record/ for audio transmission  programs, or http://www.loc.gov/rr/mopic/ for audiovisual transmission  programs, and, in making fixations of such unpublished transmission  programs, shall identify a program that the Library has recorded by  including that transmission program on the list no later than fourteen  days after such fixation has occurred. The Library of Congress in making  fixations of unpublished television transmission programs transmitted by  commercial broadcast stations shall not do so without notifying the  transmitting organization or its agent that such activity is taking  place. In the case of television network stations, the notification will  be sent to the particular network. In the case of any other commercial  television broadcasting station, the notification will be sent to the  particular broadcast station that has transmitted, or will transmit, the  program. Such notice shall, if possible, be given by the Library of  Congress prior to the time of broadcast. In every case, the Library of  Congress shall transmit such notice no later than fourteen days after  such fixation has occurred. Such notice shall contain:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The identification, by title and time of broadcast, of the  transmission program in question;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A brief statement asserting the Library of Congress' belief  that the transmission program has been, or will be by the date of  transmission, fixed and is unpublished, together with language  converting the notice to a demand for deposit under section 407 (a) and  (b) of title 17 of the United States Code, if the transmission program  has been published in the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The notice required by paragraph (c)(8) of this section shall  not cover more than one transmission program except that the notice may  cover up to thirteen episodes of one title if such episodes are  generally scheduled to be broadcast at the same time period on a   regular basis, or may cover all the episodes comprising the title if  they are scheduled to be broadcast within a period of not more than two  months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Demands for deposit of a transmission program. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Register  of Copyrights may make a written demand upon the owner of the right of  transmission in the United States to deposit a copy or phonorecord of a  specific transmission program for the benefit of the Library of Congress  under the authority of section 407(e)(2) of title 17 of the United  States Code.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Register of Copyrights is entitled to presume, unless clear  evidence to the contrary is proffered, that the transmitting  organization is the owner of the United States transmission right.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notices of demand shall be in writing and shall contain:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The identification, by title and time of broadcast, of the work  in question;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An explanation of the optional forms of compliance, including  transfer of ownership of a copy or phonorecord to the Library, lending a  copy or phonorecord to the Library for reproduction, or selling a copy  or phonorecord to the Library at a price not to exceed the cost of  reproducing and supplying the copy or phonorecord;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A ninety-day deadline by which time either compliance or a  request for an extension of a request to adjust the scope of the demand  or the method for fulfilling it shall have been received by the Register  of Copyrights;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A brief description of the controls which are placed on the use  of the copies or phonorecords;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A statement concerning the Register's perception of the  publication status of the program, together with language converting  this demand to a demand for a deposit, under 17 U.S.C. 407, if the  recipient takes the position that the work is published; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> A statement that a compliance copy, or in the case of an audio  transmission program, a compliance phonorecord, must be made and  retained if the notice is received prior to transmission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> With respect to paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, the sale  of a copy or phonorecord in compliance with a demand of this nature  shall be at a price not to exceed the cost to the Library of reproducing  and supplying the copy or phonorecord. The notice of demand should  therefore inform the recipient of that cost and set that cost, plus  reasonable shipping charges, as the maximum price for such a sale.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Copies and phonorecords transferred, lent, or sold under  paragraph (d) of this section shall be of sound physical condition as  described in Appendix A to this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Special relief. In the case of any demand made under paragraph  (d) of this section the Register of Copyrights may, after consultation  with other appropriate officials of the Library of Congress and upon  such conditions as the Register may determine after such consultation,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Extend the time period provided in subparagraph (d)(3)(iii);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Make adjustments in the scope of the demand; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Make adjustments in the method of fulfilling the demand. Any  decision as to whether to allow such extension or adjustments shall be  made by the Register of Copyrights after consultation with other  appropriate officials of the Library of Congress and shall be made as  reasonably warranted by the circumstances. Requests for special relief  under paragraph (d) of this section shall be made in writing to the  Copyright Acquisitions Division, shall be signed by or on behalf of the  owner of the right of transmission in the United States and shall set  forth the specific reasons why the request should be granted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of  title 17 of the United States Code and paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All copies and phonorecords acquired or made under this section,  except copies and phonorecords of transmission programs consisting of a  regularly scheduled newscast or on-the-spot   coverage of news events, shall be subject to the following restrictions  concerning copying and access: in the case of television or other  audiovisual transmission programs, copying and access are governed by  Library of Congress Regulation 818-17, Policies Governing the Use and  Availability of Motion Pictures and Other Audiovisual Works in the  Collections of the Library of Congress, or its successors; in the case  of audio transmission programs, copying and access are governed by  Library of Congress Regulation 818-18.1, Recorded Sound Listening and  Duplication Services, or its successors. Transmission programs  consisting of regularly scheduled newscasts or on-the-spot coverage of  news events are subject to the provisions of the ``American Television  and Radio Archives Act,'' 2 U.S.C. 170, and such regulations as the  Librarian of Congress shall prescribe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Registration of claims to copyright. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Copies and phonorecords  fixed by the Library of Congress under the provisions of paragraph (c)  of this section may be used as the deposit for copyright registration  provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The application and fee, in a form acceptable for registration,  is received by the Copyright Office not later than ninety days after  transmission of the program, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Correspondence received by the Copyright Office in the envelope  containing the application and fee states that a fixation of the instant  work was made by the Library of Congress and requests that the copy or  phonorecord so fixed be used to satisfy the registration deposit  provisions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of title 17 of the United States Code and the registration  deposit provisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Agreements modifying the terms of this section. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Library  of Congress may, at its sole discretion, enter into an agreement whereby  the provision of copies or phonorecords of unpublished audio or  audiovisual transmission programs on terms different from those  contained in this section is authorized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any such agreement may be terminated without notice by the  Library of Congress.
