                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each control must operate easily, smoothly, and positively  enough to allow proper performance of its functions. Controls must be  arranged and identified to provide for convenience of operation and to  prevent the possibility of confusion and subsequent inadvertent  operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each control system and operating device must be designed and  installed in a manner that will prevent jamming, chafing, or  interference from passengers, cargo, or loose objects. Precaution must  be taken to prevent foreign objects from jamming the controls. The  elements of the control system must have design features or must be  distinctly and permanently marked to minimize the possibility of  incorrect assembly that could result in malfunctioning of the control  system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each balloon using a captive gas as the lifting means must have  an automatic valve or appendix that is able to release gas automatically  at the rate of at least three percent of the total volume per minute  when the balloon is at its maximum operating pressure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each hot air balloon must have a means to allow the controlled  release of hot air during flight.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each hot air balloon must have a means to indicate the maximum  envelope skin temperatures occurring during operation. The indicator  must be readily visible to the pilot and marked to indicate the limiting  safe temperature of the envelope material. If the markings are on the  cover glass of the instrument, there must be provisions to maintain the  correct alignment of the glass cover with the face of the dial.  [Doc.
