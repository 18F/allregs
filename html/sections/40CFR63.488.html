                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the owner or operator of batch front-end process vents at affected sources shall determine the group status of each batch front-end process vent in accordance with the provisions of this section. This determination may be based on either organic HAP or TOC emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The procedures specified in paragraphs (b) through (g) shall be followed to determine the group status of each batch front-end process vent. This determination shall be made in accordance with either paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An owner or operator may choose to determine the group status of a batch front-end process vent based on the expected mix of products. For each product, emission characteristics of the single highest-HAP recipe, as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, for that product, shall be used in the procedures in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An owner or operator may choose to determine the group status of a batch front-end process vent based on annualized production of the single highest-HAP recipe, as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, considering all products produced or processed in the batch unit operation. The annualized production of the highest-HAP recipe shall be based exclusively on the production of the single highest-HAP recipe of all products produced or processed in the batch unit operation for a 12 month period. The production level used may be the actual production rate. It is not necessary to assume a maximum production rate (i.e., 8,760 hours per year at maximum design production).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The single highest-HAP recipe for a product means the recipe of the product with the highest total mass of HAP charged to the reactor during the production of a single batch of product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The annual uncontrolled organic HAP or TOC emissions and annual average batch vent flow rate shall be determined at the exit from the batch unit operation. For the purposes of these determinations, the primary condenser operating as a reflux condenser on a reactor or distillation column, the primary condenser recovering monomer, reaction products, by-products, or solvent from a stripper operated in batch mode, and the primary condenser recovering monomer, reaction products, by-products, or solvent from a distillation operation operated in batch mode shall be considered part of the batch unit operation. All other devices that recover or oxidize organic HAP or TOC vapors shall be considered control devices as defined in Sec. 63.482.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator of a batch front-end process vent complying with the flare provisions in Sec. 63.487(a)(1) or Sec. 63.487(b)(1) or routing the batch front-end process vent to a control device to comply with the requirements in Sec. 63.487(a)(2) or Sec. 63.487(b)(2) is not required to perform the batch front-end

process vent group determination described in this section, but shall comply with all requirements applicable to Group 1 batch front-end process vents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Determination of annual emissions. The owner or operator shall calculate annual uncontrolled TOC or organic HAP emissions for each batch front-end process vent using the methods described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(8) of this section. To estimate emissions from a batch emissions episode, owners or operators may use either the emissions estimation equations in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section, or direct measurement as specified in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. Engineering assessment may also be used to estimate emissions from a batch emission episode, but only under the conditions described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. In using the emissions estimation equations in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section, individual component vapor pressure and molecular weight may be obtained from standard references. Methods to determine individual HAP partial pressures in multicomponent systems are described in paragraph (b)(9) of this section. Other variables in the emissions estimation equations may be obtained through direct measurement, as defined in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, through engineering assessment, as defined in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section, by process knowledge, or by any other appropriate means. Assumptions used in determining these variables must be documented. Once emissions for the batch emission episode have been determined using either the emissions estimation equations, direct measurement, or engineering assessment, emissions from a batch cycle shall be calculated in accordance with paragraph (b)(7) of this section, and annual emissions from the batch front-end process vent shall be calculated in accordance with paragraph (b)(8) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> TOC or organic HAP emissions from the purging of an empty vessel shall be calculated using Equation 1.
