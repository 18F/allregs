                            <p class="depth0">A brewer having unsalable beer in packages or tanks in the brewery  may destroy, recondition, or use the beer as material. The brewer shall  report the   quantity of the beer destroyed, reconditioned, or used as materials, in  daily records and on Form 5130.9.

When reject bottled beer is to be consumed at the brewery or  sold to brewery employees, or is cased or otherwise accumulated pending  other disposition, the quantity will be included in the packaging  production and be so reported in the brewer's daily records and on Form  5130.9.
