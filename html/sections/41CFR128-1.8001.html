                            <p class="depth0">The Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 (Act), 42 U.S.C. 7701, et seq., as amended, directs the Federal government to establish and maintain an effective earthquake hazards reduction program to reduce the risks to life and property from future earthquakes. Executive Order 12699 implements certain provisions of the Act by requiring Federal agencies responsible for the design and construction of new buildings to develop and implement a seismic safety program. The regulations in this subpart implement the Executive Order, and apply to buildings designed and constructed under the responsibility of the Department of Justice. These regulations do not apply to buildings used by the Department and obtained, through purchase or lease, by the General Services Administration or other Federal agencies.</p>
