                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. For the tests prescribed in Sec. 29.1041(c), the  following apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the tests are conducted under conditions deviating from the  maximum ambient atmospheric temperature specified in paragraph (b) of  this section, the recorded powerplant temperatures must be corrected  under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, unless a more rational  correction method is applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No corrected temperature determined under paragraph (a)(1) of  this section may exceed established limits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The fuel used during the cooling tests must be of the minimum  grade approved for the engines, and the mixture settings must be those  used in normal operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The test procedures must be as prescribed in Sec. Sec. 29.1045  through 29.1049.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For the purposes of the cooling tests, a temperature is  ``stabilized'' when its rate of change is less than 2 [deg]F per minute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Maximum ambient atmospheric temperature. A maximum ambient  atmospheric temperature corresponding to sea level conditions of at  least 100 degrees F. must be established. The assumed temperature lapse  rate is 3.6 degrees F. per thousand feet of altitude above sea level  until a temperature of -69.7 degrees F. is reached, above which altitude  the temperature is considered constant at -69.7 degrees F. However, for  winterization installations, the applicant may select a maximum ambient  atmospheric temperature corresponding to sea level conditions of less  than 100 degrees F.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Correction factor (except cylinder barrels). Unless a more  rational correction applies, temperatures of engine fluids and  powerplant components (except cylinder barrels) for which temperature  limits are established, must be corrected by adding to them the  difference between the maximum ambient atmospheric temperature and the  temperature of the ambient air at the time of the first occurrence of  the maximum component or fluid temperature recorded during the cooling  test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Correction factor for cylinder barrel temperatures. Cylinder  barrel temperatures must be corrected by adding to them 0.7 times the  difference between the maximum ambient atmospheric temperature and the  temperature of the ambient air at the time of the first occurrence of  the maximum cylinder barrel temperature recorded during the cooling  test.
