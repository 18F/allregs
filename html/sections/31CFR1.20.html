                            <p class="depth0">The regulations in this subpart are issued to implement the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a). The regulations apply to all records which are contained in systems of records maintained by the Department of the Treasury and which are retrieved by an individual's name or personal identifier. They do not relate to those personnel records of Government employees, which are under the jurisdiction of the Office of Personnel Management to the extent such records are subject to regulations issued by such OPM. The regulations apply to all components of the Department of the Treasury. Any reference in this subpart to the Department or its officials, employees, or records shall be deemed to refer also to the components or their officials, employees, or records. The regulations set forth the requirements

applicable to Department of the Treasury employees maintaining, collecting, using or disseminating records pertaining to individuals. They also set forth the procedures by which individuals may request notification of whether the Department of the Treasury maintains or has disclosed a record pertaining to them or may seek access to such records maintained in any nonexempt system of records, request correction of such records, appeal any initial adverse determination of any request for amendment, or may seek an accounting of disclosures of such records. For the convenience of interested persons, the components of the Department of the Treasury may reprint these regulations in their entirety (less any appendices not applicable to the component in question) in those titles of the Code of Federal Regulations which normally contain regulations applicable to such components. In connection with such republication, and at other appropriate times, components may issue supplementary regulations applicable only to the component in question, which are consistent with these regulations. In the event of any actual or apparent inconsistency, these Departmental regulations shall govern. Persons interested in the records of a particular component should, therefore, also consult the Code of Federal Regulations for any rules or regulations promulgated specifically with respect to that component (see Appendices to this subpart for cross references). The head of each component is hereby also authorized to substitute other appropriate officials for those designated and correct addresses specified in the appendix to this subpart applicable to the component. The components of the Department of the Treasury for the purposes of this subpart are the following offices and bureaus:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Departmental Offices, which include the offices of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Secretary of the Treasury, including immediate staff;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, including immediate staff;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Chief of Staff, including immediate staff;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Executive Secretary of the Treasury and all offices reporting to such official, including immediate staff;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Under Secretary (International Affairs) and all offices reporting to such official, including immediate staff;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Assistant Secretary (International Economics and Development) and all offices reporting to such official, including immediate staff;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Assistant Secretary (Financial Markets and Investment Policy) and all offices reporting to such official, including immediate staff;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Under Secretary (Domestic Finance) and all offices reporting to such official, including immediate staff;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Fiscal Assistant Secretary and all offices reporting to such official, including immediate staff;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Assistant Secretary (Financial Institutions) and all offices reporting to such official, including immediate staff;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Assistant Secretary (Financial Markets) and all offices reporting to such official, including immediate staff;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Assistant Secretary (Financial Stability) and all offices reporting to such official, including immediate staff;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Under Secretary (Terrorism & Financial Intelligence) and all offices reporting to such official, including immediate staff;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Assistant Secretary (Terrorist Financing) and all offices reporting to such official, including immediate staff;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> Assistant Secretary (Intelligence and Analysis) and all offices reporting to such official, including immediate staff;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> General Counsel and all offices reporting to such official, including immediate staff; except legal counsel to the components listed in paragraphs (a)(23), (a)(24), and (a)(25) and (b) through (j) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(17)</em> Treasurer of the United States including immediate staff;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(18)</em> Assistant Secretary (Legislative Affairs) and all offices reporting to such official, including immediate staff;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(19)</em> Assistant Secretary (Public Affairs) and all offices reporting to such official, including immediate staff;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(20)</em> Assistant Secretary (Economic Policy) and all offices reporting to such official, including immediate staff;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(21)</em> Assistant Secretary (Tax Policy) and all offices reporting to such official, including immediate staff;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(22)</em> Assistant Secretary (Management) and Chief Financial Officer, and all offices reporting to such official, including immediate staff;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(23)</em> The Inspector General, and all offices reporting to such official, including immediate staff;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(24)</em> The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, and all offices reporting to such official, including immediate staff;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(25)</em> The Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and all offices reporting to such official, including immediate staff;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Bureau of Public Debt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Financial Management Service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Internal Revenue Service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Comptroller of the Currency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Office of Thrift Supervision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Bureau of Engraving and Printing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> United States Mint.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.
