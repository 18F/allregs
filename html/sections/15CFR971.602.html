                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determination of significant adverse environmental effects. The Administrator will determine the potential for or the occurrence of any significant adverse environmental effect or impact (for the purposes of sections 103(a)(2)(D), 105(a)(4), 106(c) and 109(b) (second sentence) of the Act), on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Basis for determination. Determinations will be based upon the best information available, including relevant environmental impact statements, NOAA-collected data, monitoring results, and other data provided by the applicant or permittee, as well as consideration of the criteria in Sec. 971.601(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Related considerations. In making a determination the Administrator may take into account any TCRs or other mitigation measures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Activities with no significant adverse environmental effect. NOAA believes that exploration-type activities, as listed in the license regulations (15 CFR 970.701), require no further environmental assessment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Activities with potential for significant adverse environmental effects. NOAA research has identified at-sea testing of recovery equipment, the recovery of manganese nodules in commercial quantities from the deep seabed, and the construction and operation of commercial-scale processing facilities as activities which may have some potential for significant adverse envirnomental effects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Related terms, conditions and restrictions. Permits will be issued with TCRs containing environmental requirements with respect to protection (pursuant to Sec. 971.419), mitigation (pursuant to Sec. 971.419), or best available technology requirements (pursuant to Sec. 971.423), as appropriate, and monitoring requirements (pursuant to Sec. 971.424) to acquire more information on the environmental effects of deep seabed mining.</p>
