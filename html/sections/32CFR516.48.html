If funding by  the United States is requested, see Sec. 516.55(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the deciding official determines that the information may be  released, the individual will be permitted to be interviewed, deposed,  or to appear as a witness in court provided such interview or appearance  is consistent with the requirements of Sec. Sec. 516.49 and 516.50.  (See, for example, figure G-2, appendix G, to this part). A JA or DA  civilian attorney should be present during any interview or testimony to  act as legal representative of the Army. If a question seeks information  not previously authorized for release, the legal representative will  advise the witness not to answer. If necessary to avoid release of the  information, the legal representative will advise the witness to  terminate the interview or deposition, or in the case of testimony in  court, advise the judge that DOD directives and Army regulations  preclude the witness from answering without HQDA approval. Every effort  should be made, however, to substitute releasable information and to  continue the interview or testimony.</p>
