For engines that use noncommercial fuels significantly different than the specified test fuel of the same type, you may ask to use the parameter-adjustment provisions of this section instead of those in Sec.  1048.115(e). Engines certified under this section must be in a separate engine family.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If we approve your request, the following provisions apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must certify the engine using the test fuel specified in Sec.  1048.501.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may produce the engine without limits or stops that keep the engine adjusted within the certified range.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must specify in-use adjustments different than the adjustable settings appropriate for the specified test fuel, consistent with the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To produce engines under this section, you must do the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Specify in-use adjustments needed so the engine's level of emission control for each regulated pollutant is equivalent to that from the certified configuration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Add the following information to the emission control information label specified in Sec.  1048.135:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Include instructions describing how to adjust the engine to operate in a way that maintains the effectiveness of the emission-control system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> State: ``THIS ENGINE IS CERTIFIED TO OPERATE IN APPLICATIONS USING NONCOMMERCIAL FUEL. MALADJUSTMENT OF THE ENGINE IS A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTY.''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Keep records to document the destinations and quantities of engines produced under this section.
