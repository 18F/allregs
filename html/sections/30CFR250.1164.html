Sec.  250.1160, 250.1161, 250.1163, and the  following additional requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For safety or air pollution prevention purposes, the Regional  Supervisor may further restrict the flaring of gas containing  H2S. The Regional Supervisor will use information provided in  the lessee's H2S Contingency Plan (Sec.  250.490(f)),  Exploration Plan, DPP, DOCD submitted to BOEM, and associated documents  to determine the need for restrictions; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Regional Supervisor determines that flaring at a facility  or group of facilities may significantly affect the air quality of an  onshore area, the Regional Supervisor may require you to conduct an air  quality modeling analysis, under 30 CFR 550.303, to determine the  potential effect of facility emissions. The Regional Supervisor may  require monitoring and reporting, or may restrict or prohibit flaring,  under 30 CFR 550.303 and 30 CFR 550.304.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Regional Supervisor may require you to submit monthly  reports of flared and vented gas containing H2S. Each report  must contain, on a daily basis:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The volume and duration of each flaring and venting occurrence;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> H2S concentration in the flared or vented gas; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The calculated amount of SO2 emitted.</p><p class="depth3">Other Requirements</p>
