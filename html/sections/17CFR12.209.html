                                Sec. 12.209  Oral testimony.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Generally. When the Judgment Officer determines that an oral  hearing is necessary and appropriate, such oral hearing will be held  either by telephone or in person in Washington, DC, as set forth below.  The Judgment Officer, in his or her discretion with consideration for  the convenience of the parties and their witnesses, will determine the  time and date of such hearing. During an oral hearing, in his or her  discretion, the Judgment Officer may regulate appropriately the course  and sequence of testimony and examination of the parties and their  witnesses and limit the issues.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Telephonic hearings. When a Judgment Officer has determined to  hold an oral hearing by telephone, an order to that effect will be  issued at least 15 days prior to the hearing notifying the parties of  the date and time of the hearing. The order will direct the parties to  confirm, at least 48 hours in advance of the hearing, that the correct  telephone numbers for the parties and their witnesses are on file with  the Office of Proceedings, and warn that failure to provide correct  telephone numbers may be deemed waiver of that party's right to  participate in the hearing, to present evidence, or to cross-examine  other witnesses. If a party is unavailable by telephone at the appointed  time, any other party in attendance may present testimony, and the  Judgment Officer also may impose any appropriate sanction listed in  Sec. 12.35. All telephonic hearings will be recorded   electronically but will be transcribed only upon direction of the  Judgment Officer (if necessary) or in the event of Commission review.  The parties may secure a copy of the recording of the hearing from the  Proceedings Clerk upon written request and payment of the cost of the  recording.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> through (f) of these rules. A party not agreeing to  appear at the hearing in Washington, DC, may be ordered to participate  by telephone. Any party not appearing in person or by telephone will be  deemed to have waived the right to participate in the hearing, to  present evidence, or to cross-examine other witnesses; further, that  party may be subject to such action under Sec. 12.35 as the Judgment  Officer may find appropriate. The Judgment Officer may order any party  who requests or agrees to appear at a hearing in Washington, DC and  fails to appear without good cause, to pay any reasonable costs  unnecessarily incurred by parties appearing at such a hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Compulsory process. An application for a subpoena requiring a  non-party to participate in a telephonic hearing or to appear at an in- person hearing in Washington, DC, may be made in writing to the Judgment  Officer without notice to the other parties. The standards for issuance  or denial of an application for a subpoena, the service and travel fee  requirements, and the method for enforcing such subpoenas are set forth  at Sec. 12.313 of these rules.
