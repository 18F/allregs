                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Prerequisites for hearing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A request for a determination  under this section may be made by a contracting agency or other person  affected or interested, including contractors or prospective contractors  and associations of contractors, representatives of employees, and  interested Governmental agencies. Such a request shall be submitted in  writing to the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, Employment  Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC  20210. Although no particular form is prescribed for submission of a  request under this section, such request shall include the following  information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A statement of the applicant's case setting forth in detail the  reasons why the applicant believes that the wages and fringe benefits  contained in the collective bargaining agreement were not reached as a  result of arm's-length negotiations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A statement regarding the status of the procurement and any  estimated procurement dates, such as bid opening, contract award,  commencement date of the contract or its follow-up option period;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Names and addresses (to the extent known) of interested  parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pursuant to section 4(b) of the Act, requests for a hearing  shall not be considered unless received as specified below except in  those situations where the Administrator determines that extraordinary  circumstances exist:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For advertised contracts, prior to ten days before the award of  the contract;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For negotiated contracts and for contracts with provisions  extending the term by option, prior to the commencement date of the  contract or the follow-up option period, as the case may be.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Administrator, on his/her own motion or after receipt of  a request for a determination, may make a finding on the issue of arm's- length negotiations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Administrator determines that there may not have been  arm's-length negotiations, but finds that there is insufficient evidence  to render a final decision thereon, the Administrator may refer the  issue to the Chief Administrative Law Judge in accordance with paragraph  (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the Administrator finds that the collective bargaining  agreement or wages and fringe benefits at issue were reached as a result  of arm's-length negotiations or that arm's-length negotiations did not  take place, the interested parties, including the parties to the  collective bargaining agreement, will be notified of the Administrator's  findings, which shall include the reasons therefor, and such parties  shall be afforded an opportunity to request that a hearing be held to  render a decision on the issue of arm's-length negotiations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Such parties shall have 20 days from the date of the  Administrator's ruling to request a hearing. A detailed statement of the  reasons why the Administrator's ruling is in error, including facts  alleged to be in dispute, if any, shall be submitted with the request  for a hearing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If no hearing is requested within the time mentioned in  paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the Administrator's ruling shall  be final, and, in the case of a finding that arm's-length negotiations  did not take place, a new wage determination will be issued for the  contract. If a hearing is requested, the decision of the Administrator  shall be inoperative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Referral to the Chief Administrative Law Judge. The  Administrator on his/her own motion, under paragraph (c)(2) of this  section or upon a request for a hearing under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of  this section where the Administrator determines that material facts are  in dispute, shall by order refer the issue to the Chief Administrative  Law Judge for designation of an Administrative Law Judge, who shall  conduct such hearings as may be necessary to render a decision solely on  the issue of arm's-length negotiations. However, in situations where  there is also a question as to whether some or all of the collectively  bargained wage rates and/or fringe benefits are substantially at  variance (see Sec. 4.10), the referral shall include both issues for  resolution in one proceeding. As provided in section 4(a) of the Act,  the provisions of sections 4 and 5 of the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts  Act (41 U.S.C. 38, 39) shall be applicable to such proceeding, which  shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures set forth at 29 CFR  part 6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Referral to the Administrative Review Board. When a party  requests a hearing under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section and the  Administrator determines that no material facts are in dispute, the  Administrator shall refer the issue and the record compiled thereon to  the Administrative Review Board to render a decision solely on the issue  of arm's-length negotiations. Such proceeding shall be conducted in  accordance with the procedures set forth at 29 CFR part 8.</p>
