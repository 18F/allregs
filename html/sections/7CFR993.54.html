The salable and reserve percentages when applied to the natural condition weight of prunes, excluding the quantity of undersized prunes determined pursuant to Sec. 993.49(c), received during the crop year by a handler from producers and dehydrators, plus that diverted tonnage (dried weight natural condition prune basis) on diversion certificates issued pursuant to Sec. 993.62 and credited to or held by him, shall determine the weight of each handler's receipts which are salable prunes and reserve prunes. The total of the salable and reserve percentages shall equal 100 percent. A cooperative marketing association may concentrate the prunes of its producer members before applying the salable and reserve percentages.
