Before any  written procedure established under Sec. 192.273(b) is used for making  plastic pipe joints by a heat fusion, solvent cement, or adhesive  method, the procedure must be qualified by subjecting specimen joints  made according to the procedure to the following tests:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The burst test requirements of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of thermoplastic pipe, paragraph 6.6 (Sustained  Pressure Test) or paragraph 6.7 (Minimum Hydrostatic Burst Test) of ASTM  D2513-99 for plastic materials other than polyethylene or ASTM D2513-09a  (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 192.7) for polyethylene plastic  materials;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of thermosetting plastic pipe, paragraph 8.5  (Minimum Hydrostatic Burst Pressure) or paragraph 8.9 (Sustained Static  Pressure Test) of ASTM D2517 (incorporated by reference, see  Sec. 192.7); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of electrofusion fittings for polyethylene (PE)  pipe and tubing, paragraph 9.1 (Minimum Hydraulic Burst Pressure Test),  paragraph 9.2 (Sustained Pressure Test), paragraph 9.3 (Tensile Strength  Test), or paragraph 9.4 (Joint Integrity Tests) of ASTM F1055  (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 192.7).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For procedures intended for lateral pipe connections, subject a  specimen joint made from pipe sections joined at right angles according  to the procedure to a force on the lateral pipe until failure occurs in  the specimen. If failure initiates outside the joint area, the procedure  qualifies for use; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For procedures intended for non-lateral pipe connections, follow  the tensile test requirements of ASTM D638 (incorporated by reference,  see Sec. 192.7), except that the test may be conducted at ambient  temperature and humidity If the specimen elongates no less than 25  percent or failure initiates outside the joint area, the procedure  qualifies for use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> is used for making mechanical plastic pipe joints  that are designed to withstand tensile forces, the procedure must be  qualified by subjecting 5 specimen joints made according to the  procedure to the following tensile test:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use an apparatus for the test as specified in ASTM D 638 (except  for conditioning), (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 192.7).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The specimen must be of such length that the distance between  the grips of the apparatus and the end of the stiffener does not affect  the joint strength.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The speed of testing is 0.20 in (5.0 mm) per minute, plus or  minus 25 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Pipe specimens less than 4 inches (102 mm) in diameter are  qualified if the pipe yields to an elongation of no less than 25 percent  or failure initiates outside the joint area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Pipe specimens 4 inches (102 mm) and larger in diameter shall be  pulled until the pipe is subjected to a tensile stress equal to or  greater than the maximum thermal stress that would be produced by a  temperature change of 100 F (38 C) or until the pipe is pulled from  the fitting. If the pipe pulls from the fitting, the lowest value of the  five test results or the manufacturer's rating, whichever is lower must  be used in the design calculations for stress.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Each specimen that fails at the grips must be retested using new  pipe.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Results obtained pertain only to the specific outside diameter,  and material of the pipe tested, except that testing of a heavier wall  pipe may be used to qualify pipe of the same material but with a lesser  wall thickness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A copy of each written procedure being used for joining plastic  pipe must be available to the persons making and inspecting joints.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Pipe or fittings manufactured before July 1, 1980, may be used  in accordance with procedures that the manufacturer certifies will  produce a joint as strong as the pipe.
