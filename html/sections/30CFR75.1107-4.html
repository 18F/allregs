Where sprinklers are used, provision shall be made  for manual application of water to the protected equipment in lieu of a  manual actuator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> (i) and (ii) of this  section, to activate fire suppression devices on attended equipment  purchased on or after the effective date of this Sec. 75.1107-4. At  least one manual actuator shall be used on equipment purchased prior to  the effective date of this Sec. 75.1107-4.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Manual actuators installed on attended equipment regularly  operated by a miner, as provided in Sec. 75.1107-1(c)(1) shall be  located at different locations on the equipment, and at least one manual  actuator shall be located within easy reach of the operator's normal  operating position.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Manual actuators to activate fire suppression devices on  attended equipment not regularly operated by a miner, as provided in  Sec. 75.1107-1(c)(2), shall be installed at different location, and at  least one manual actuator shall be installed so as to be easily reached  by the miner at the jobsite or by persons approaching the equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Sensors shall, where practicable, be installed in accordance  with the recommendations set forth in National Fire Code No. 72A ``Local  Protective Signaling Systems'' (NFPA No. 72A-1967).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> On unattended equipment the fire suppression device shall  operate independently of the power to the main motor (or equivalent) so  it will remain operative if the circuit breakers (or other protective  device) actuates. On attended equipment powered through a trailing cable  the fire suppression device shall operate independently of the  electrical power provided by the cable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Point-type sensors (such as thermocouple, bimetallic strip, or  rate of temperature rise) located in ventilated passageways shall be  installed downwind from the equipment to be protected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Sensor systems shall include a device or method for determining  their operative condition.
