                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Secretary annually makes a single consolidated grant to each  Insular Area that meets the requirements of Sec. Sec. 76.125 through  76.137 and each program under which the grant funds are to be used and  administered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Secretary may decide that one or more programs cannot be  included in the consolidated grant if the Secretary determines that the  Insular Area failed to meet the program objectives stated in its plan  for the previous fiscal year in which it carried out the programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Under a consolidated grant, an Insular Area may use a single  advisory council for any or all of the programs that require an advisory  council.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Although Pub. L. 95-134 authorizies the Secretary to consolidate  grant funds that the Department awards to an Insular Area, it does not  confer eligibility for any grant funds. The eligibility of a particular  Insular Area to receive grant funds under a Federal education program is  determined under the statute and regulations for that program.
