                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Initial acceptance of security program. Unless otherwise  authorized by TSA, each foreign air carrier required to have a security  program by this part must submit its proposed program to TSA at least 90  days before the intended date of passenger operations. TSA will notify  the foreign air carrier of the security program's acceptability, or the  need to modify the proposed security program for it to be acceptable  under this part, within 30 days after receiving the proposed security  program. The foreign air carrier may petition TSA to reconsider the  notice to modify the security program within 30 days after receiving a  notice to modify.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amendment requested by a foreign air carrier. A foreign air  carrier may submit a request to TSA to amend its accepted security  program as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The proposed amendment must be filed with the designated  official at least 45 calendar days before the date it proposes for the  amendment to become effective, unless a shorter period is allowed by the  designated official.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Within 30 calendar days after receiving a proposed amendment,  the designated official, in writing, either approves or denies the  request to amend.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An amendment to a foreign air carrier security program may be  approved if the designated official determines that safety and the  public interest will allow it, and the proposed amendment provides the  level of security required under this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Within 45 calendar days after receiving a denial, the foreign  air carrier may petition the Administrator to reconsider the denial. A  petition for reconsideration must be filed with the designated official.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated  official either approves the request to amend or transmits the petition,  together with any pertinent information, to the Administrator for  reconsideration. The Administrator disposes of the petition within 30  calendar days of receipt by either directing the designated official to  approve the amendment, or affirming the denial.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any foreign air carrier may submit a group proposal for an  amendment that is on behalf of it and other aircraft operators that co- sign the proposal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Amendment by TSA. If the safety and the public interest require  an amendment, the designated official may amend an accepted security  program as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The designated official notifies the foreign air carrier, in  writing, of the proposed amendment, fixing a period of not less than 45  calendar days within which the foreign air carrier may submit written  information, views, and arguments on the amendment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After considering all relevant material, the designated official  notifies the foreign air carrier of any amendment adopted or rescinds  the notice. If the amendment is adopted, it becomes effective not less  than 30 calendar days after the foreign air carrier receives the notice  of amendment, unless the foreign air carrier petitions the Administrator  to reconsider no later than 15 calendar days before the effective date  of the amendment. The foreign air carrier must send the petition for  reconsideration to the designated official. A timely petition for  reconsideration stays the effective date of the amendment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated  official either amends or withdraws the notice or transmits the  petition, together with any pertinent information, to the Administrator  for reconsideration. The Administrator disposes of the petition within  30 calendar days of receipt by either directing the designated official  to withdraw or amend the amendment, or by affirming the amendment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Emergency amendments. If the designated official finds that  there is an emergency requiring immediate action with respect to safety  in air transportation or in air commerce that makes procedures in this  section contrary to the public interest, the designated official may  issue an amendment, without the prior notice and comment procedures in  paragraph (c) of this section, effective without stay on the date the  foreign air carrier receives notice of it. In such a case, the  designated official will incorporate in the notice a brief statement of  the reasons and findings for the amendment to be adopted. The foreign  air carrier may file a petition for reconsideration under paragraph (c)  of this section; however, this does not stay the effectiveness of the  emergency amendment.</p>
