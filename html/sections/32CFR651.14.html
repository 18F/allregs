                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Early integration. The Army goal is to concurrently integrate  environmental reviews with other Army planning and decision-making  actions, thereby avoiding delays in mission accomplishment. To achieve  this goal, proponents shall complete NEPA analysis as part of any  recommendation or report to decision makers prior to the decision  (subject to 40 CFR 1506.1). Early planning (inclusion in Installation  Master Plans, INRMPs, ICRMPs, Acquisition Strategies, strategic plans,  etc.) will allow efficient program or project execution later in the  process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The planning process will identify issues that are likely to  have an effect on the environment, or to be controversial. In most  cases, local citizens and/or existing advisory groups should assist in  identifying potentially controversial issues during the planning  process. The planning process also identifies minor issues that have  little or no measurable environmental effect, and it is sound NEPA  practice to reduce or eliminate discussion of minor issues to help focus  analyses. Such an approach will minimize unnecessary analysis and  discussion in the NEPA process and documents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Decision makers will be informed of and consider the  environmental consequences at the same time as other factors such as  mission requirements, schedule, and cost. If permits or coordination are  required (for example, Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, Endangered  Species Act consultation, Section 106 of the National Historic  Preservation Act (NHPA), etc.), they should be initiated no later than  the scoping phase of the process and should run parallel to the NEPA  process, not sequential to it. This practice is in accordance with the  recommendations   presented in the CEQ publication entitled ``The National Environmental  Policy Act: A Study of Its Effectiveness After Twenty-five Years.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> NEPA documentation will accompany the proposal through the Army  review and decision-making processes. These documents will be forwarded  to the planners, designers, and/or implementers, ensuring that the  recommendations and mitigations upon which the decision was based are  being carried out. The implementation process will provide necessary  feedback for adaptive environmental management; responding to  inaccuracies or uncertainties in the Army's ability to accurately  predict impacts, changing field conditions, or unexpected results from  monitoring. The integration of NEPA into the ongoing planning activities  of the Army can produce considerable savings to the Army. \1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ For example, a well-executed EA or EIS on an Installation Master  Plan can eliminate the need for many case-by-case analyses and  documentation for construction projects. After the approval of an  adequate comprehensive plan (which adequately addresses the potential  for environmental effects), subsequent projects can tier off of the  Master Plan NEPA analysis (AR 210-20). Other integration of the NEPA  process and broad-level planning can lead to the ``tiering'' of NEPA,  allowing the proponent to minimize the effort spent on individual  projects, and ``incorporating by reference'' the broader level  environmental considerations. This tiering allows the development of  program level (programmatic) EAs and EISs, which can introduce greater  economies of scale. These assessments are addressed in more detail in  paragraph (c) of this section. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Time limits. The timing of the preparation, circulation,  submission, and public availability of NEPA documentation is important  to ensure that environmental values are integrated into Army planning  and decisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Categorical exclusions. When a proposed action is categorically  excluded from further environmental review (subpart D and appendix B of  this part), the proponent may proceed immediately with that action upon  receipt of all necessary approvals, (including local environmental  office confirmation that the CX applies to the proposal) and the  preparation of a REC, if required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Findings of no significant impact. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A proponent will make an  EA and draft FNSI available to the public for review and comment for a  minimum of 30 days prior to making a final decision and proceeding with  an action. If the proposed action is one of national concern, is  unprecedented, or normally requires an EIS (Sec. 651.42), the FNSI must  be published in the FR. Otherwise, the FNSI must be published in local  newspapers and be made widely available. The FNSI must articulate the  deadline for receipt of comments, availability of the EA for review, and  steps required to obtain the EA. This can include a POC, address, and  phone number; a location; a reference to a website; or some equivalent  mechanism. (In no cases will the only coordination mechanism be a  website.) At the conclusion of the appropriate comment period, as  specified in Figure 2, the decision maker may sign the FNSI and take  immediate action, unless sufficient public comments are received to  warrant more time for their resolution. Figure 2 follows:   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR29MR02.001</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A news release is required to publicize the availability of the  EA and draft FNSI, and a simultaneous announcement that includes  publication in the FR must be made by HQDA, if warranted (see Sec.  651.35 (e)). The 30-day waiting period begins at the time that the draft  FNSI is publicized (40 CFR 1506.6(b)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In cases where the 30-day comment period jeopardizes the  project and the full comment period would provide no public benefit, the  period may be shortened with appropriate approval by a higher decision  authority (such as a MACOM). In no circumstances should the public  comment period for an EA/draft FNSI be less than 15 days. A deadline and  POC for receipt of comments must be included in the draft FNSI and the  news release.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> EIS. The EPA publishes a weekly notice in the FR of the EISs  filed during the preceding week. This notice usually occurs each Friday.  An NOA reaching EPA on a Friday will be published in the following  Friday issue of the FR. Failure to deliver an NOA to EPA by close of  business on Friday will result in an additional one-week delay. A news  release publicizing the action will be made in conjunction with the  notice in the FR. The following time periods, calculated from the  publication date of the EPA notice, will be observed:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Not less than 45 days for public comment on DEISs (40 CFR  1506.10(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Not less than 15 days for public availability of DEISs prior to  any public hearing on the DEIS (40 CFR 1506(c)(2)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Not less than 90 days from filing the DEIS prior to any  decision on the proposed action. These periods may run concurrently (40  CFR 1506.10(b) and (c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The time periods prescribed here may be extended or reduced in  accordance with 40 CFR 1506.10(b)(2) and (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> When variations to these time limits are set, the Army agency  should consider the factors in 40 CFR 1501.8(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The proponent may also set time limits for other procedures or  decisions related to DEISs and FEISs as listed in 40 CFR 1501.8(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Because the entire EIS process could require more than one  year (Figure 2 in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section), the process must  begin as soon as the project is sufficiently mature to allow analysis of  alternatives and the proponent must coordinate with all staff elements  with a role to play in the NEPA process. DEIS preparation and response  to comments constitute the largest portion of time to prepare an FEIS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> A public affairs plan should be developed that provides for  periodic interaction with the community. There is a minimum public  review time of 90 days between the publication of the DEIS and the  announcement of the ROD. After the availability of the ROD is announced,  the action may proceed. This announcement must be made through the FR  for those EISs for which HQDA signs the ROD. For other EISs,  announcements in the local press are adequate. Figure 2 in paragraph  (b)(2)(i) of this section indicates typical and required time periods  for EISs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em>,  1502.20, and 1508.23). This level of analysis will eliminate repetitive  discussions of the same issues and focus on the key issues at each  appropriate level of project review. When a broad programmatic EA or EIS  has been prepared, any subsequent EIS or EA on an action included within  the entire program or policy (particularly a site-specific action) need  only summarize issues discussed in the broader statement and concentrate  on the issues specific to the subsequent action. \2\ This subsequent  document will state where the earlier document is available. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ As an example, an appropriate way to address diverse weapon  system deployments would be to produce site-specific EAs or EISs for  each major deployment installation, using the generic environmental  effects of the weapon system identified in a programmatic EA or EIS  prepared by the MATDEV. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Army proponents are normally required to prepare many types of  management plans that must include or be accompanied by appropriate NEPA  analysis. NEPA analysis for these types of plans can often be  accomplished with a programmatic approach, creating an analysis that  covers a number of smaller projects or activities. In cases where such  activities are adequately assessed as part of these normal planning  activities, a REC can be prepared for smaller actions that cite the  document in which the activities were previously assessed. Care must be  taken to ensure that site-specific or case-specific conditions are  adequately addressed in the existing programmatic document before a REC  can be used, and the REC must reflect this consideration. If additional  analyses are required, they can ``tier'' off the original analyses,  eliminating duplication. Tiering, in this manner, is often applicable to  Army actions that are long-term, multi-faceted, or multi-site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Scoping. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When the planning for an Army project or action  indicates a need for an EIS, the proponent initiates the scoping process  (see subpart G of this part for procedures and actions). This process  determines the scope of issues to address in the EIS and identifies the  significant issues related to the proposed action. During the scoping,  process participants identify the range of actions, alternatives, and  impacts to consider in the EIS (40 CFR 1508.25). For an individual  action, the scope may depend on the relationship of the proposed action  to other NEPA documents. The scoping phase of the NEPA process, as part  of project planning, will identify aspects of the proposal that are  likely to have an effect or be controversial; and will ensure that the  NEPA analyses are useful for a decision maker. For example, the early  identification and initiation of permit or coordination actions can  facilitate problem resolution, and, similarly, cumulative effects can be  addressed early in the process and at the appropriate spatial and  temporal scales.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The extent of the scoping process, including public involvement,  will depend on several factors. These factors include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The size and type of the proposed action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Whether the proposed action is of regional or national  interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Degree of any associated environmental controversy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Size of the affected environmental parameters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Significance of any effects on them.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Extent of prior environmental review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Involvement of any substantive time limits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Requirements by other laws for environmental review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Cumulative impacts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Through scoping, many future controversies can be eliminated,  and public involvement can be used to narrow the scope of the study,  concentrating on those aspects of the analysis that are truly important.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The proponent may incorporate scoping as part of the EA process,  as well. If the proponent chooses a public involvement strategy, the  extent of scoping incorporated is at the proponent's discretion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Analyses and documentation. Several statutes, regulations, and  Executive Orders require analyses, consultation, documentation, and  coordination, which duplicate various elements and/or analyses required  by NEPA and the CEQ regulations; often leading to confusion, duplication  of effort, omission, and, ultimately, unnecessary cost and delay.  Therefore, Army proponents are encouraged to identify, early in the NEPA  process, opportunities for integrating those requirements into proposed  Army programs, policies, and projects. Environmental analyses required  by this part will be integrated as much as practicable with other  environmental reviews, laws, and Executive Orders (40 CFR 1502.25).  Incorporation of these processes must ensure that the individual  requirements are met, in addition to those required by NEPA. The NEPA  process does not replace the procedural or substantive requirements of  other environmental statutes and regulations. Rather, it addresses them  in one place so the decision maker has a concise and comprehensive view  of the major environmental issues and understands the interrelationships  and potential conflicts among the environmental components. NEPA is the  ``umbrella'' that facilitates such coordination by integrating processes  that might otherwise proceed independently. Prime candidates for such  integration include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Clean Air Act, as amended (General Conformity Rule, 40 CFR parts  51 and 93).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Endangered Species Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> NHPA, sections 106 and 110.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> NAGPRA (Public Law 101-601, 104 Stat. 3048).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Clean Water Act, including Section 404(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> American Indian Religious Freedom Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and  Liability Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Pollution Prevention Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> The Sikes Act, Public Law 86-797, 74 Stat. 1052.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Federal Compliance with Right-to-Know Laws and Pollution  Prevention Requirements (Executive Order 12856, 3 CFR, 1993 Comp., p.  616).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority  Populations and Low-Income Populations (Executive Order 12898, 3 CFR,  1994 Comp., p. 859).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Indian Sacred Sites (Executive Order 13007, 3 CFR, 1996 Comp.,  p. 196).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Protection of Children From Environmental Health Risks and  Safety Risks (Executive Order 13045, 3 CFR, 1997 Comp., p. 198).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> Federal Support of Community Efforts Along American Heritage  Rivers (Executive Order 13061, 3 CFR, 1997 Comp., p. 221).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(17)</em> Floodplain Management (Executive Order 11988, 3 CFR, 1977  Comp., p. 117).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(18)</em> Protection of Wetlands (Executive Order 11990, 3 CFR, 1977  Comp., p. 121).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(19)</em> Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Federal Actions  (Executive Order 12114, 3 CFR, 1979 Comp., p. 356).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(20)</em> Invasive Species (Executive Order 13112, 3 CFR, 1999 Comp., p.  159).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(21)</em> AR 200-3, Natural Resources--Land, Forest, and Wildlife  Management.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(22)</em> Environmental analysis and documentation required by various  state laws.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(23)</em> Any cost-benefit analyses prepared in relation to a proposed  action (40 CFR 1502.23).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(24)</em> Any permitting and licensing procedures required by federal and  state law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(25)</em> Any installation and Army master planning functions and plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(26)</em> Any installation management plans, particularly those that deal  directly with the environment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(27)</em> Any stationing and installation planning, force development  planning, and materiel acquisition planning.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(28)</em> Environmental Noise Management Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(29)</em> Hazardous waste management plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(30)</em> Integrated Cultural Resource Management Plan as required by AR  200-4 and DODD 4700.4, Natural Resources Management Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(31)</em> Asbestos Management Plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(32)</em> Integrated Natural Resource Management Plans, AR 200-3, Natural  Resources--Land, Forest, and Wildlife Management, and DODD 4700.4,  Natural Resources Management Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(33)</em> Environmental Baseline Surveys.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(34)</em> Programmatic Environment, Safety, and Health Evaluation (PESHE)  as required by DOD 5000.2-R and DA Pamphlet 70-3, Army Acquisition  Procedures, supporting AR 70-1, Acquisition Policy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(35)</em> The DOD MOU to Foster the Ecosystem Approach signed by CEQ, and  DOD, on 15 December 1995; establishing the importance of ``non-listed,''  ``non-game,'' and ``non-protected'' species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(36)</em> Other requirements (such as health risk assessments), when  efficiencies in the overall Army environmental program will result.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Integration into Army acquisition. The Army acquisition  community will integrate environmental analyses into decision-making, as  required in this part ensuring that environmental considerations become  an integral part of total program planning and budgeting, PEOs, and  Program, Product, and Project Managers integrate the NEPA process early,  and acquisition planning and decisions reflect national and Army  environmental values and considerations. By integrating pollution  prevention and other aspects of any environmental analysis early into  the materiel acquisition process, the PEO and PM facilitate the  identification of environmental cost drivers at a time when they can be  most effectively controlled. NEPA program coordinators should refer to  DA Pamphlet 70-3, Army Acquisition Procedures, and the Defense  Acquisition Deskbook (DAD) for current specific implementation guidance,  procedures, and POCs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Relations with local, state, regional, and tribal agencies. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Army installation, agency, or activity environmental officers or  planners should establish a continuing relationship with other agencies,  including the staffs of adjacent local, state, regional, and tribal  governments and agencies. This relationship will promote cooperation and  resolution of mutual land use and environment-related problems, and  promote the concept of regional ecosystem management as well as general  cooperative problem solving. Many of these ``partners'' will have  specialized expertise and access to environmental baseline data, which  will assist the Army in day-to-day planning as well as NEPA-related  issues. MOUs are encouraged to identify areas of mutual interest,  establish POCs, identify lines of communication between agencies, and  specify procedures to follow in conflict resolution. Additional  coordination is available from state and area-wide planning and  development agencies. Through this process, the proponent may gain  insights on other agencies' approaches to EAs, surveys, and studies  applicable to the current proposal. These other agencies would also be  able to assist in identifying possible participants in scoping  procedures for projects requiring an EIS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In some cases, local, state, regional, or tribal governments or  agencies will have sufficient jurisdiction by law or special expertise  with respect to reasonable alternatives or significant environmental,  social, or economic impacts associated with a proposed action. When  appropriate, proponents of an action should determine whether these  entities have an interest in becoming a cooperating agency (Sec. 651.45  (b) and 40 CFR 1501.6). If cooperating agency status is established, a  memorandum of agreement is required to document specific expectations,  roles, and responsibilities, including analyses to be performed, time  schedules, availability of pre-decisional information, and other issues.  Cooperating agencies may use their own funds, and the designation of  cooperating agency status   neither enlarges nor diminishes the decision-making status of any  federal or non-federal entities (see CEQ Memorandum for Heads of Federal  Agencies entitled ``Designation of Non-Federal Agencies to be  Cooperating Agencies in Implementing the Procedural Requirements of the  National Environmental Policy Act'' dated 28 July 1999, available from  the President's Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), Executive Office  of the President of the U.S.). In determining sufficient jurisdiction or  expertise, CEQ regulations can be used as guidance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> The Army as a cooperating agency. Often, other agencies take  actions that can negatively impact the Army mission. In such cases, the  Army may have some special or unique expertise or jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Army may be a cooperating agency (40 CFR 1501.6) in order  to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Provide information or technical expertise to a lead agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Approve portions of a proposed action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Ensure the Army has an opportunity to be involved in an action  of another federal agency that will affect the Army.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Provide review and approval of the portions of EISs and RODs  that affect the Army.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Adequacy of an EIS is primarily the responsibility of the lead  agency. However, as a cooperating agency with approval authority over  portions of a proposal, the Army may adopt an EIS if review concludes  the EIS adequately satisfies the Army's comments and suggestions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the Army is a major approval authority for the proposed  action, the appropriate Army official may sign the ROD prepared by the  lead agency, or prepare a separate, more focused ROD. If the Army's  approval authority is only a minor aspect of the overall proposal, such  as issuing a temporary use permit, the Army need not sign the lead  agency's ROD or prepare a separate ROD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The magnitude of the Army's involvement in the proposal will  determine the appropriate level and scope of Army review of NEPA  documents. If the Army is a major approval authority or may be severely  impacted by the proposal or an alternative, the Army should undertake  the same level of review as if it were the lead agency. If the  involvement is limited, the review may be substantially less. The lead  agency is responsible for overall supervision of the EIS, and the Army  will attempt to meet all reasonable time frames imposed by the lead  agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If an installation (or other Army organization) should become  aware of an EIS being prepared by another federal agency in which they  may be involved within the discussion of the document, they should  notify ASA(I&E;) through the chain of command. ASA(I&E;) will advise  regarding appropriate Army participation as a cooperating agency, which  may simply involve local coordination.</p>
