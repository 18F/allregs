                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Part B of the permit application consists of the general information requirements of this section, and the specific information requirements in Sec. Sec.  0.14 through 270.29 applicable to the facility. The part B information requirements presented in Sec. Sec.  270.14 through 270.29 reflect the standards promulgated in 40 CFR part 264. These information requirements are necessary in order for EPA to determine compliance with the part 264 standards. If owners and operators of HWM facilities can demonstrate that the information prescribed in part B can not be provided to the extent required, the Director may make allowance for submission of such information on a case-by-case basis. Information required in part B shall be submitted to the Director and signed in accordance with the requirements in Sec.  270.11. Certain technical data, such as design drawings and specifications, and engineering studies shall be certified by a qualified Professional Engineer. For post-closure permits, only the information specified in

Sec.  270.28 is required in part B of the permit application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General information requirements. The following information is required for all HWM facilities, except as Sec.  264.1 provides otherwise:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A general description of the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Chemical and physical analyses of the hazardous waste and hazardous debris to be handled at the facility.

Sec.  264.227, 264.255, and 264.200.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> A description of procedures, structures, or equipment used at the facility to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Prevent hazards in unloading operations (for example, ramps, special forklifts);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Prevent runoff from hazardous waste handling areas to other areas of the facility or environment, or to prevent flooding (for example, berms, dikes, trenches);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Prevent contamination of water supplies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Mitigate effects of equipment failure and power outages;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Prevent undue exposure of personnel to hazardous waste (for example, protective clothing); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Prevent releases to atmosphere.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> A description of precautions to prevent accidental ignition or reaction of ignitable, reactive, or incompatible wastes as required to demonstrate compliance with Sec.  264.17 including documentation demonstrating compliance with Sec.  264.17(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Traffic pattern, estimated volume (number, types of vehicles) and control (for example, show turns across traffic lanes, and stacking lanes (if appropriate); describe access road surfacing and load bearing capacity; show traffic control signals).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Facility location information;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In order to determine the applicability of the seismic standard [Sec.  264.18(a)] the owner or operator of a new facility must identify the political jurisdiction (e.g., county, township, or election district) in which the facility is proposed to be located.
[Comment: If the county or election district is not listed in appendix VI of part 264, no further information is required to demonstrate compliance with Sec.  264.18(a).]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the facility is proposed to be located in an area listed in appendix VI of part 264, the owner or operator shall demonstrate compliance with the seismic standard. This demonstration may be made using either published geologic data or data obtained from field investigations carried out by the applicant. The information provided must be of such quality to be acceptable to geologists experienced in identifying and evaluating seismic activity. The information submitted must show that either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> No faults which have had displacement in Holocene time are present, or no lineations which suggest the presence of a fault (which have displacement in Holocene time) within 3,000 feet of a facility are present, based on data from:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Published geologic studies,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Aerial reconnaissance of the area within a five-mile radius from the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An analysis of aerial photographs covering a 3,000 foot radius of the facility, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If needed to clarify the above data, a reconnaissance based on walking portions of the area within 3,000 feet of the facility, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If faults (to include lineations) which have had displacement in Holocene time are present within 3,000 feet of a facility, no faults pass within 200 feet of the portions of the facility where treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste will be conducted, based on data from a comprehensive geologic analysis of the site. Unless a site analysis is otherwise conclusive concerning the absence of faults within 200 feet of such portions of the facility data shall be obtained from a subsurface exploration (trenching) of the area within a distance no less than 200 feet from portions of the facility where treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste will be conducted. Such trenching shall be performed in a direction that is perpendicular to known faults (which have had displacement in Holocene time) passing within 3,000 feet of the portions of the facility where treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste will be conducted. Such investigation shall document with supporting maps and other analyses, the location of faults found.
[Comment: The Guidance Manual for the Location Standards provides greater detail on the content of each type of seismic investigation and the appropriate conditions under which each approach or a combination of approaches would be used.]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Owners and operators of all facilities shall provide an identification of whether the facility is located within a 100-year floodplain. This identification must indicate the source of data for such determination and include a copy of the relevant Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) flood map, if used, or the calculations and maps used where an FIA map is not available. Information shall also be provided identifying the 100-year flood level and any other special flooding factors (e.g., wave action) which must be considered in designing, constructing, operating, or maintaining the facility to withstand washout from a 100-year flood.
[Comment: Where maps for the National Flood Insurance Program produced by the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) of the Federal Emergency Management Agency are available, they will normally be determinative of whether a facility is located within or outside of the 100-year floodplain. However, where the FIA map excludes an area (usually areas of the floodplain less than 200 feet in width), these areas must be considered and a determination made as to whether they are in the 100-year floodplain. Where FIA maps are not available for a proposed facility location, the owner or operator must use equivalent mapping techniques to determine whether the facility is within the 100-year floodplain, and if so located, what the 100-year flood elevation would be.]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Owners and operators of facilities located in the 100-year floodplain must provide the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Engineering analysis to indicate the various hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces expected to result at the site as consequence of a 100-year flood.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Structural or other engineering studies showing the design of operational units (e.g., tanks, incinerators) and flood protection devices (e.g., floodwalls, dikes) at the facility and how these will prevent washout.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If applicable, and in lieu of paragraphs (b)(11)(iv) (A) and (B) of this section, a detailed description of procedures to be followed to remove hazardous waste to safety before the facility is flooded, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Timing of such movement relative to flood levels, including estimated time to move the waste, to show that such movement can be completed before floodwaters reach the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A description of the location(s) to which the waste will be moved and demonstration that those facilities will be eligible to receive hazardous waste in accordance with the regulations under parts 270, 271, 124, and 264 through 266 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The planned procedures, equipment, and personnel to be used and the means to ensure that such resources will be available in time for use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The potential for accidental discharges of the waste during movement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Existing facilities NOT in compliance with Sec.  264.18(b) shall provide a plan showing how the facility will be brought into compliance and a schedule for compliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> An outline of both the introductory and continuing training programs
