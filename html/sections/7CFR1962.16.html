                            <p class="depth0">The Agency will maintain a current record of each borrower's security. Whenever an inspection is performed, the borrower must advise the Agency of any changes in the security and will complete and sign Form RD 1962-1 in accordance with Sec.  1924.56 if it has not been previously completed for the year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Agency responsibilities. Chattel security will be inspected annually except in cases where the Agency official has justified in assessment or analysis review that no undue risk exists. An FO borrower who has been current with the Agency and who has provided chattels as additional security is an example of a case where an inspection may not be needed. All inspections will be recorded in the running record of the borrower's file. More frequent inspections should be made for delinquent borrowers or borrowers that have been indebted for less then 1 full crop year. The Agency official will discuss the provisions of Sec. Sec.  1962.17 and 1962.18 and assist the borrower in completing the form. If a borrower does not plan to dispose of any chattel security, the form should be completed to show this and should be signed. When the Agency official has other contacts with the borrower, the official should also check for dispositions and acquisitions of security. Changes will be recorded on the form, dated and initialed by the borrower and the agency official. The purpose of all inspections is to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Verify that the borrower possesses all the security,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determine security is properly maintained, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Supplement security instruments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Dispositions. The County Supervisor will record all dispositions of chattel security on Form RD or its successor agency under Form RD 1962-1, and on the file copy of the security agreement or chattel mortgage. The original security instrument must not be altered. Additional acquired chattel security should be entered on the file copy of the security agreement or chattel mortgage and must be described on subsequent security instruments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unapproved dispositions. Unapproved dispositions of security will be handled in accordance with Sec. Sec.  1962.18 and 1962.49 of this subpart.
