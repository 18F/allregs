                                Sec. 503.6  Packagers' duty to withhold availability of packages
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">To clarify the requirements, under part 502 of this chapter, that a  packager or labeler will not make packages marked with retail sale price  representations available in any circumstance where he knows or should  have reason to know that it will be used as an instrumentality for  deception or for frustration of value comparison, the following  represents the opinions of the Commission:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Details of a plan to provide special packaging or special  package sizes bearing retail sale price representations should contain  the condition that customers will not be provided with such packages  unless they resell the package at a price which fully passes on to the  purchasers the represented savings or sale price advantage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A packager or labeler who, in good faith, takes reasonable and  prudent measures to verify the performance of his customers will be  deemed to have satisfied his obligation under the regulations. If the  packager has taken such steps, the fact that a particular customer has  failed to resell the packages at a price which fully passes on to the  purchaser the represented savings or sale price advantage shall not  alone place a seller in violation of the regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any packager or labeler who determines that a customer does not  intend to fulfill or has not fulfilled the conditions of an offer should  immediately refrain from further sale under that offer to the customer.  In situations where proper fulfillment of the conditions of an offer are  in question, the Commission will resolve the issue   after appropriate investigation of the facts submitted.
