The following amounts are added together--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employee tier I amount, effective on the date the employee's tier I benefit begins or, if later, on the date a reduction for other disability benefits begins or ends, as shown in Sec. 226.71 of this part. This amount is before any reduction for age or social security benefits but after including any delayed retirement credits, after any reduction for other disability benefits, and after rounding; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employee tier II rate before reduction for the railroad retirement family maximum, effective on the employee's annuity beginning date and, if later, on the date the tier II is first reduced for a vested dual benefit, as shown in Sec. 226.11 of this part; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The initial supplemental annuity rate effective on the date the supplemental annuity begins, before any reduction for a private pension, as shown in part 227 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Spouse annuity amounts. The following amounts are added together--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The spouse tier I amount, which is or would be effective on the date the employee's annuity or tier I benefit begins, as shown in Sec. 226.30. This amount is before any reduction for other disability benefits, age, or social security benefits, but after any reduction for a government pension or employee annuity; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The spouse tier II rate which is or would be effective on the employee's annuity beginning date, the date the employee's tier I benefit begins, or the

date the employee's tier II rate is reduced for a vested dual benefit, as shown in Sec. 226.11. This rate includes the restored amount but does not include any cost-of-living increase in the tier II original rate or restored amount.
