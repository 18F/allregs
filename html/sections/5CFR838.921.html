For example, a former spouse of an employee would be entitled to a maximum survivor benefit; a former spouse of a retiree (who was married to the retiree at retirement and continuously until the divorce resulting in the court order) would be entitled to the survivor benefit elected at retirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A court order that provides that ``a former spouse will keep'' or ``an employee or retiree will maintain'' the survivor annuity to which he or she was entitled at the time of the divorce satisfies the requirements of Sec. 838.805 and provides a former spouse survivor annuity in the same proportion to the maximum survivor annuity under Sec. 831.641 or Sec. 842.613 of this chapter as the former spouse had at the time of divorce.
