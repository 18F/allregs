                            <p class="depth0">The slaughtering of sheep, swine, goats, calves, cattle, horses,  mules, and other equines by using captive bolt stunners and the handling  in connection therewith, in compliance with the provisions contained in  this section, are hereby designated and approved as humane methods of  slaughtering and handling of such animals under the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application of stunners, required effect; handling. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The  captive bolt stunners shall be applied to the livestock in accordance  with this section so as to produce immediate unconsciousness in the  animals before they are shackled, hoisted, thrown, cast, or cut. The  animals shall be stunned in such a manner that they will be rendered  unconscious with a minimum of excitement and discomfort.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The driving of the animals to the stunning area shall be done  with a minimum of excitement and discomfort to   the animals. Delivery of calm animals to the stunning areas is essential  since accurate placement of stunning equipment is difficult on nervous  or injured animals. Among other things, this requires that, in driving  animals to the stunning areas, electrical equipment be used as little as  possible and with the lowest effective voltage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Immediately after the stunning blow is delivered the animals  shall be in a state of complete unconsciousness and remain in this  condition throughout shackling, sticking and bleeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Facilities and procedures--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General requirements for stunning  facilities; operator. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Acceptable captive bolt stunning instruments  may be either skull penetrating or nonpenetrating. The latter type is  also described as a concussion or mushroom type stunner. Penetrating  instruments on detonation deliver bolts of varying diameters and lengths  through the skull and into the brain. Unconsciousness is produced  immediately by physical brain destruction and a combination of changes  in intracranial pressure and acceleration concussion. Nonpenetrating or  mushroom stunners on detonation deliver a bolt with a flattened circular  head against the external surface of the animal's head over the brain.  Diameter of the striking surface of the stunner may vary as conditions  require. Unconsciousness is produced immediately by a combination of  acceleration concussion and changes in intracranial pressures. A  combination instrument utilizing both penetrating and nonpenetrating  principles is acceptable. Energizing of instruments may be accomplished  by detonation of measured charges of gunpowder or accurately controlled  compressed air. Captive bolts shall be of such size and design that,  when properly positioned and activated, immediate unconsciousness is  produced.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To assure uniform unconsciousness with every blow, compressed  air devices must be equipped to deliver the necessary constant air  pressure and must have accurate, constantly operating air pressure  gauges. Gauges must be easily read and conveniently located for use by  the stunning operator and the inspector. For purposes of protecting  employees, inspectors, and others, it is desirable that any stunning  device be equipped with safety features to prevent injuries from  accidental discharge. Stunning instruments must be maintained in good  repair.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The stunning area shall be so designed and constructed as to  limit the free movements of animals sufficiently to allow the operator  to locate the stunning blow with a high degree of accuracy. All chutes,  alleys, gates and restraining mechanisms between and including holding  pens and stunning areas shall be free from pain-producing features such  as exposed bolt ends, loose boards, splintered or broken planking, and  protruding sharp metal of any kind. There shall be no unnecessary holes  or other openings where feet or legs of animals may be injured. Overhead  drop gates shall be suitably covered on the bottom edge to prevent  injury on contact with animals. Roughened or cleated cement shall be  used as flooring in chutes leading to stunning areas to reduce falls of  animals. Chutes, alleys, and stunning areas shall be so designed that  they will comfortably accommodate the kinds of animals to be stunned.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The stunning operation is an exacting procedure and requires a  well-trained and experienced operator. He must be able to accurately  place the stunning instrument to produce immediate unconsciousness. He  must use the correct detonating charge with regard to kind, breed, size,  age, and sex of the animal to produce the desired results.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Special requirements and prohibitions. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Choice of instrument  and force required to produce immediate unconsciousness varies,  depending on kind, breed, size, age, and sex of the animal. Young swine,  lambs, and calves usually require less stunning force than mature  animals of the same kind. Bulls, rams, and boars usually require skull  penetration to produce immediate unconsciousness. Charges suitable for  smaller kinds of livestock such as swine or for young animals are not  acceptably interchanged for use on larger kinds or older livestock,  respectively.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Captive bolt stunners that deliberately inject compressed air  into the   cranium at the end of the penetration cycle shall not be used to stun  cattle.
