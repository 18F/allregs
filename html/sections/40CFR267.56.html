He may do this by observation or review of facility records or manifests, and, if necessary, by chemical analysis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assess possible hazards to human health or the environment that may result from the release, fire, or explosion. This assessment must consider both direct and indirect effects of the release, fire, or explosion. For example, the assessment would consider the effects of any toxic, irritating, or asphyxiating gases that are generated, or the effects of any hazardous surface water run-off from water or chemical agents used to control fire and heat-induced explosions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the emergency coordinator determines that the facility has had a release, fire, or explosion which could threaten human health, or the environment, outside the facility, he must report his findings as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If his assessment indicates that evacuation of local areas may be advisable, he must immediately notify appropriate local authorities. He must be available to help appropriate officials decide whether local areas should be evacuated; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> He must immediately notify either the government official designated as the on-scene coordinator for that geographical area, or the National Response Center (using their 24-hour toll-free number 800/ 424-8802). The report must include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Name and telephone number of the reporter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Name and address of facility.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Time and type of incident (for example, a release or a fire).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Name and quantity of material(s) involved, to the extent known.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The extent of injuries, if any.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The possible hazards to human health or the environment outside the facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> During an emergency, the emergency coordinator must take all reasonable measures necessary to ensure that fires, explosions, and releases do not occur, recur, or spread to other hazardous waste at the facility. These measures must include, where applicable, stopping processes and operations, collecting and containing release waste, and removing or isolating containers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the facility stops operations in response to a fire, explosion, or release, the emergency coordinator must monitor for leaks, pressure buildup, gas generation, or ruptures in valves, pipes, or other equipment, when appropriate.</p>
