                            <p class="depth0">It is HUD policy that approved MAP lenders are expected to comply at all times with HUD's underwriting and construction loan administration requirements and not to take any action that presents a risk to HUD's insurance funds. A MAP lender's improper underwriting and construction loan administration activities may lead to a warning letter or other sanction from HUD. Examples of such activities include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Minor offenses that may be the basis for a warning letter include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Failure to provide required exhibits or the submission of incomplete or inaccurate exhibits. Although the MAP lender will be permitted to correct minor errors or provide additional information, substantial inaccuracies or lack of significant information will result in a return of the application and retention of any fee collected;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Repeated failure to complete processing to firm commitment unrelated to an underwriting analysis that demonstrates that the process should not proceed to firm commitment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Preparation of an underwriting summary that is not supported by the appropriate documentation and analysis;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Failure to notify the HUD processing office promptly of changes in the mortgage loan application for a firm commitment submitted, such as changes in rents, numbers of units, or gross project area;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Failure to meet MAP closing requirements or construction loan administration requirements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Business practices that do not conform to those generally accepted by

prudent lenders or that show irresponsibility; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Failure to cooperate with a Lender Qualifications and Monitoring Division review by HUD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Serious offenses that might be a basis for a warning letter or probation, suspension, or termination include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Receipt of multiple warning letters over any one-year period. In determining which sanction to pursue as a result of prior warning letters, HUD will consider the facts and circumstances surrounding those warning letters and the corrective actions, if any, undertaken by the lender;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fraud or material misrepresentation in the lender's participation in FHA multifamily programs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Lender collusion with, or influence upon, third party contractors to modify reports affecting the contractor's independent evaluation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A violation of MAP procedures by a third party contractor, which the MAP lender knew, or should have known, was occurring and which, if performed by the MAP lender itself, would constitute a ground for a sanction under this chapter;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Evidence that a lender's inadequate or inaccurate underwriting was a cause for assignment of an FHA-insured mortgage and claim for insurance benefits to HUD;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Identity-of-interest violations as defined by Chapter 2 of the MAP Guide;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Payment by, or receipt of a payment by, a MAP lender of any kickback or other consideration, directly or indirectly, which would affect the lender's independent evaluation, or represent a conflict of interest, in connection with any FHA-insured mortgage transaction;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Failure to comply with any agreement, certification, undertaking, or condition of approval listed in a MAP lender's application for approval;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Noncompliance with any requirement or directive of the MAP Lender Review Board;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Violation of the requirements of any contract with HUD, or violation of the requirements in any statute or regulation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Submission of false information, or a false certification, to HUD in connection with any MAP mortgage transaction;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Failure of a MAP lender to respond in a timely manner to inquiries from the MAP Lender Review Board in accordance with this subpart;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Indictment or conviction of a MAP lender or any of its officers, directors, principals, or employees for an offense that reflects on the responsibility, integrity, or ability of the lender to participate in the MAP initiative;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Employing or retaining an officer, partner, director, or principal at the time when the person was suspended, debarred, ineligible, or subject to an LDP under 2 CFR part 2424, or otherwise prohibited from participation in HUD programs, when the MAP lender knew or should have known of the prohibition;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> Employing or retaining an employee who is not an officer, partner, director, or principal, and who is or will be working on HUD-FHA program matters, at a time when that person was suspended, debarred, ineligible, or subject to an LDP under 2 CFR part 2424, or otherwise prohibited from participation in HUD programs, when the MAP lender knew or should have known of the prohibition;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> Failure to cooperate with an audit or investigation by the HUD Office of Inspector General or an inquiry by HUD into the conduct of the MAP lender's FHA-insured loans; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(17)</em> Failure to fund MAP mortgage loans or any misuse of mortgage loan proceeds.
