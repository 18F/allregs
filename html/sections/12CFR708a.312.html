                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">A merging credit union must conduct its member vote on merger in a  fair and legal manner. NCUA provides the following guidelines as  suggestions to help a credit union obtain a fair and legal vote and  otherwise fulfill its regulatory obligations. These guidelines are not  an exhaustive checklist and do not by themselves guarantee a fair and  legal vote.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability of State law. While NCUA's merger rules apply to  all mergers of Federally insured credit unions, Federally insured State  chartered credit unions (FISCUs) are also subject to State law on  mergers. NCUA's position is that no merger of a State chartered credit  union is authorized unless permitted by State law, and also that a State  legislature or State supervisory authority may impose merger  requirements more stringent or restrictive than NCUA's. States that  permit mergers may have substantive and procedural requirements that  vary from Federal law. For example, there may be different voting  standards for approving a vote. While the Federal Credit Union Act  requires a simple majority of those who vote to approve a merger, some  States have higher voting standards requiring two-thirds or more of  those who vote. A FISCU should be careful to understand both Federal and  State law to navigate the merger process and conduct a proper vote.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligibility to vote. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determining who is eligible to cast a  ballot is fundamental to any vote. No merger vote can be fair and legal  if some members are improperly excluded. A merging credit union should  be cautious to identify all eligible members and make certain they are  included on its voting list. NCUA recommends that a merging credit union  establish internal procedures to manage this task.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A merging credit union should be careful to make certain its  member list is accurate and complete. For example, when a credit union  converts from paper record keeping to computer record keeping, some  member names may not transfer unless the credit   union is careful in this regard. This same problem can arise when a  credit union merges from one computer system to another where the  software is not completely compatible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Problems with keeping track of who is eligible to vote can also  arise when a credit union merges from a Federal charter to a State  charter or vice versa. NCUA is aware of an instance where a Federal  credit union used membership materials allowing two or more individuals  to open a joint account and also allowed each to become a member. The  Federal credit union later converted to a State chartered credit union  that, like most other State chartered credit unions in its State, used  membership materials allowing two or more individuals to open a joint  account but only allowed the first person listed on the account to  become a member. The other individuals did not become members as a  result of their joint account, but were required to open another account  where they were the first or only person listed on the account. Over  time, some individuals who became members of the Federal credit union as  the second person listed on a joint account were treated like those  individuals who were listed as the second person on a joint account  opened directly with the State chartered credit union. Specifically,  both of those groups were treated as non-members not entitled to vote.  This example makes the point that a credit union must be diligent in  maintaining a reliable membership list.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Scheduling the special meeting. NCUA's merger rule requires a  merging credit union to permit members to vote by written mail ballot or  in person at a special meeting held for the purpose of voting on the  merger. Although most members may choose to vote by mail, a significant  number may choose to vote in person. As a result, a merging credit union  should be careful to conduct its special meeting in a manner conducive  to accommodating all members wishing to attend, including selecting a  meeting location that can accommodate the anticipated number of  attendees and is conveniently located. The meeting should also be held  on a day and time suitable to most members' schedules. A credit union  should conduct its meeting in accordance with applicable Federal and  State law, its bylaws, Robert's Rules of Order or other appropriate  parliamentary procedures, and determine before the meeting the nature  and scope of any discussion to be permitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Voting incentives. Some credit unions may wish to offer  incentives to members, such as entry to a prize raffle, to encourage  participation in the merger vote. The credit union must exercise care in  the design and execution of such incentives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The credit union should ensure that the incentive complies with  all applicable State, Federal, and local laws.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The incentive should not be unreasonable in size. The cost of  the incentive should have a negligible impact on the credit union's net  worth ratio and the incentive should not be so large that it distracts  the member from the purpose of the vote. If the board desires to use  such incentives, the cost of the incentive should be included in the  directors' deliberation and determination that the merger is in the best  interests of the credit union's members.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The credit union should ensure that the incentive is available  to every member that votes regardless of how or when he or she votes.  All of the credit union's written materials promoting the incentive to  the membership must disclose to the members, as required by  Sec. 708a.311 of this part, that they have an equal opportunity to  participate in the incentive program regardless of whether they vote for  or against the merger. The credit union should also design its  incentives so that they are available equally to all members who vote,  regardless of whether they vote by mail or in person at the special  meeting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Solicitation of votes. Some credit unions may wish to contact  members who have not voted and encourage them to vote on the merger  proposal. NCUA believes, however, that using credit union employees to  solicit votes is problematic. Employees directed to solicit votes could  easily neglect everyday duties critical to the credit union's safe and  sound operation. Also, employees may very well feel pressured to   solicit votes for the merger, regardless of whether or not they support  the merger. Accordingly, NCUA strongly encourages credit unions to use  an independent third party to solicit votes rather than diverting credit  union employees from their usual duties.</p>
