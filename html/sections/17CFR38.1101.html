                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A designated contract market must maintain  financial resources sufficient to enable it to perform its functions in  compliance with the core principles set forth in section 5 of the Act  and regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Financial resources shall be considered sufficient if their  value is at least equal to a total amount that would enable the  designated contract market, or applicant for designation as such, to  cover its operating costs for a period of at least one year, calculated  on a rolling basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An entity that is registered with the Commission as both a  designated contract market and a derivatives clearing organization also  shall comply with the financial resource requirements of Sec. 39.11 of  this chapter, demonstrating that it has sufficient financial resources  to operate the single, combined entity as both a designated contract  market and a derivatives clearing organization. In lieu of filing  separate quarterly reports under paragraph (a)(2) of this section and  Sec. 39.11(f) of this chapter, such entity shall file single quarterly  reports in accordance with Sec. 39.11.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Types of financial resources. Financial resources available to  satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section may include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The designated contract market's own capital, calculated in  accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any other financial resource deemed acceptable by the  Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Computation of financial resource requirement. A designated  contract market must, on a quarterly basis, based upon its fiscal year,  make a reasonable calculation of its projected operating costs over a  12-month period in order to determine the amount needed to meet the  requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. The designated contract  market shall have reasonable discretion in determining the methodology  used to compute such projected operating costs. The Commission may  review the methodology and require changes as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Valuation of financial resources. At appropriate intervals, but  not less than quarterly, a designated contract market must compute the  current market value of each financial resource used to meet its  obligations under paragraph (a) of this section. Reductions in value to  reflect market and credit risk (``haircuts'') must be applied as  appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Liquidity of financial resources. The financial resources  allocated by the designated contract market to meet the requirements of  paragraph (a) of this section must include unencumbered, liquid  financial assets (i.e., cash and/or highly liquid securities) equal to  at least six months' operating costs. If any portion of such financial  resources is not sufficiently liquid, the designated contract market may  take into account a committed line of credit or similar facility for the  purpose of meeting this requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Reporting requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each fiscal quarter, or at any time  upon Commission request, a designated contract market must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Report to the Commission:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The amount of financial resources necessary to meet the  requirements of paragraph (a) of this section; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The value of each financial resource available, computed in  accordance with the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provide the Commission with a financial statement, including  the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows of the  designated contract market or of its parent company.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The calculations required by this paragraph shall be made as of  the last business day of the designated contract market's fiscal  quarter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The designated contract market must provide the Commission with:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Sufficient documentation explaining the methodology used to  compute its financial requirements under paragraph (a) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sufficient documentation explaining the basis for its  determinations regarding the valuation and liquidity requirements set  forth in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Copies of any agreements establishing or amending a credit  facility, insurance coverage, or other arrangement evidencing or  otherwise supporting the designated contract market's conclusions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The reports shall be filed not later than 40 calendar days after  the end of the designated contract market's first three fiscal quarters,  and not later than 60 calendar days after the end of the designated  contract market's fourth fiscal quarter, or at such later time as the  Commission may permit, in its discretion, upon request by the designated  contract market.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Delegation of authority. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Commission hereby delegates,  until it orders otherwise, the authority to the Director of the Division  of Market Oversight or such other employee or employees as the Director  may designate from time to time, to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Determine whether a particular financial resource under  paragraph (b)(2) may be used to satisfy the requirements of paragraph  (a)(1) and (2) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Review and make changes to the methodology used to compute the  requirements of paragraph (c) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Request financial reporting from a designated contract market  (in addition to quarterly reports) under paragraph (f)(1) of this  section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Grant an extension of time for a designated contract market to  file its quarterly financial report under paragraph (f)(4) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Director may submit to the Commission for its consideration  any matter that has been delegated in this paragraph. Nothing in this  paragraph prohibits the Commission, at its election, from exercising the  authority delegated in this paragraph.</p>
