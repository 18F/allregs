A HUBZone small business  concern may elect to waive the evaluation preference, in which case the  factor will be added to its offer for evaluation purposes.

The HUBZone offeror shall provide  the Contracting Officer a copy of the notice required by 13 CFR 126.501  if material changes occur before contract award that could affect its  HUBZone eligibility. If the apparently successful HUBZone offeror is not  a HUBZone small business concern at the time of award of this contract,  the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise  successful HUBZone small business concern or other offeror.</p><p class="depth0">(End of clause)</p><p class="depth0">Alternate I (JAN 2011).
