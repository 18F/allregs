                            <p class="depth0">The term ``targeting'' is commonly used in discussions of the requirements of section 4(f)(4) and section 203(c). ``Targeting'' refers to a system in which the minority language materials or assistance required by the Act are provided to fewer than all persons or registered voters. It is the view of the Attorney General that a targeting system will normally fulfill the Act's minority language requirements if it is designed and implemented in such a way that language minority group members who need minority language materials and assistance receive them.
