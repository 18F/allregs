Billing for reimbursement shall be made by the owner or consignee to the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. Payment for samples will not be made if the sample is found to be in violation of the Act, even though subsequently brought into compliance pursuant to terms specified in a notice of permission issued under Sec. 1005.22.
