An RLF Recipient shall  request disbursements of Grant funds only to close a loan or disburse  RLF funds to a borrower. The RLF Recipient must disburse the RLF funds  to a borrower within 30 days of receipt of the Grant funds. Any Grant  funds not disbursed within the 30 day period shall be refunded to EDA  pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Interest-bearing account.

If the RLF Recipient receives Grant funds and the RLF  loan disbursement is subsequently delayed beyond 30 days, the RLF  Recipient must notify the applicable grants officer and return such non- disbursed funds to EDA. Grant funds returned to EDA shall be available  to the RLF Recipient for future draw-downs. When returning prematurely  drawn Grant funds, the RLF Recipient must clearly identify on the face  of the check or in the written notification to the applicable grants  officer ``EDA,'' the Grant award number, the words ``Premature Draw,''  and a brief description of the reason for returning the Grant funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> * * *</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When an RLF has a combination of In-Kind Contributions and cash  Local Share, the cash Local Share and the Grant funds will be disbursed  proportionately as needed for lending activities, provided that the last  20 percent of the Grant funds may not be disbursed until all cash Local  Share has been expended. The full amount of the cash Local Share shall  remain for use in the RLF.</p>
