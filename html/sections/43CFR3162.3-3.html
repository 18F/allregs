The cement operation  monitoring report must be provided at least   48 hours prior to commencing hydraulic fracturing operations unless the  authorized officer approves a shorter time.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For any well completed pursuant to an APD that did not  authorize hydraulic fracturing operations, the operator must submit  documentation to demonstrate that adequate cementing was achieved for  all casing strings designed to isolate and protect usable water. The  operator must submit the documentation with its request for approval of  hydraulic fracturing operations, or no less than 48 hours prior to  conducting hydraulic fracturing operations if no prior approval is  required, pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. The authorized  officer may approve the hydraulic fracturing of the well only if the  documentation provides assurance that the cementing was sufficient to  isolate and to protect usable water, and may require such additional  tests, verifications, cementing or other protection or isolation  operations, as the authorized officer deems necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prior to starting hydraulic fracturing operations, the operator  must determine and document that there is adequate cement for all casing  strings used to isolate and protect usable water zones as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Surface casing. The operator must observe cement returns to  surface and document any indications of inadequate cement (such as, but  not limited to, lost returns, cement channeling, gas cut mud, failure of  equipment, or fallback from the surface exceeding 10 percent of surface  casing setting depth or 200 feet, whichever is less). If there are  indications of inadequate cement, then the operator must determine the  top of cement with a CEL, temperature log, or other method or device  approved in advance by the authorized officer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Intermediate and production casing. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If the casing is not  cemented to surface, then the operator must run a CEL to demonstrate  that there is at least 200 feet of adequately bonded cement between the  zone to be hydraulically fractured and the deepest usable water zone.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the casing is cemented to surface, then the operator must  follow the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For any well, if there is an indication of inadequate cement on  any casing used to isolate usable water, then the operator must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Notify the authorized officer within 24 hours of discovering the  inadequate cement;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Submit an NOI (Form 3160-5) to the authorized officer  requesting approval of a plan to perform remedial action to achieve  adequate cement. The plan must include the supporting documentation and  logs required under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. In emergency  situations, an operator may request oral approval from the authorized  officer for actions to be undertaken to remediate the cement. However,  such requests must be followed by a written notice filed not later than  the fifth business day following oral approval;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Verify that the remedial action was successful with a CEL or  other method approved in advance by the authorized officer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Submit a Sundry Notice and Report on Wells (Form 3160-5) as a  subsequent report for the remedial action including:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A signed certification that the operator corrected the  inadequate cement job in accordance with the approved plan; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The results from the CEL or other method approved by the  authorized officer showing that there is adequate cement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The operator must submit the results from the CEL or other  method approved by the authorized officer (see paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B)  of this section) at least 72 hours before starting hydraulic fracturing  operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Mechanical integrity testing prior to hydraulic fracturing.  Prior to hydraulic fracturing, the operator must perform a successful  mechanical integrity test, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If hydraulic fracturing through the casing is proposed, the  casing must be tested to not less than the maximum anticipated surface  pressure that will be applied during the hydraulic fracturing process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If hydraulic fracturing through a fracturing string is proposed,  the fracturing string must be inserted into a liner or run on a packer- set not less than 100 feet below the cement top of the production or  intermediate casing. The fracturing string must be tested to not less  than the maximum anticipated surface pressure minus the annulus pressure  applied between the fracturing string and the production or intermediate  casing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The mechanical integrity test will be considered successful if  the pressure applied holds for 30 minutes with no more than a 10 percent  pressure loss.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Monitoring and recording during hydraulic fracturing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During any hydraulic fracturing operation, the operator must  continuously monitor and record the annulus pressure at the bradenhead.  The pressure in the annulus between any intermediate casings and the  production casing must also be continuously monitored and recorded. A  continuous record of all annuli pressure during the fracturing operation  must be submitted with the required Subsequent Report Sundry Notice  (Form 3160-5) identified in paragraph (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If during any hydraulic fracturing operation any annulus  pressure increases by more than 500 pounds per square inch as compared  to the pressure immediately preceding the stimulation, the operator must  stop the hydraulic fracturing operation, take immediate corrective  action to control the situation, orally notify the authorized officer as  soon as practicable, but no later than 24 hours following the incident,  and determine the reasons for the pressure increase. Prior to  recommencing hydraulic fracturing operations, the operator must perform  any remedial action required by the authorized officer, and successfully  perform a mechanical integrity test under paragraph (f) of this section.  Within 30 days after the hydraulic fracturing operations are completed,  the operator must submit a report containing all details pertaining to  the incident, including corrective actions taken, as part of a  Subsequent Report Sundry Notice (Form 3160-5).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)(1)</em> and ((2) of this section, all fluids recovered between the  commencement of hydraulic fracturing operations and the authorized  officer's approval of a produced water disposal plan under BLM  requirements must be stored in rigid enclosed, covered, or netted and  screened above-ground tanks. The tanks may be vented, unless Federal  law, or State regulations (on Federal lands) or tribal regulations (on  Indian lands) require vapor recovery or closed-loop systems. The tanks  must not exceed a 500 barrel (bbl) capacity unless approved in advance  by the authorized officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The authorized officer may approve an application to use lined  pits only if the applicant demonstrates that use of a tank as described  in this paragraph (h) is infeasible for environmental, public health or  safety reasons and only if, at a minimum, all of the following  conditions apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The distance from the pit to intermittent or ephemeral streams  or water sources would be at least 300 feet;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The distance from the pit to perennial streams, springs, fresh  water sources, or wetlands would be at least 500 feet;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> There is no usable groundwater within 50 feet of the surface  in the area where the pit would be located;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The distance from the pit to any occupied residence, school,  park, school bus stop, place of business, or other areas where the  public could reasonably be expected to frequent would be greater than  300 feet;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The pit would not be constructed in fill or unstable areas;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The construction of the pit would not adversely impact the  hydrologic functions of a 100-year floodplain; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Pit use and location complies with applicable local, State (on  Federal lands), tribal (on Indian lands) and other Federal statutes and  regulations including those that are more stringent than these  regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pits approved by the authorized officer must be:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Lined with a durable, leak-proof synthetic material and equipped  with a leak detection system; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Routinely inspected and maintained, as required by the  authorized officer, to ensure that there is no fluid leakage into the  environment. The operator must document all inspections.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)(2)</em>  though (10) of this section must be submitted to the authorized officer  in a Subsequent Report Sundry Notice (Form 3160-5).
