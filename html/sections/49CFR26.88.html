                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A recipient shall immediately suspend a DBE's certification  without adhering to the requirements in Sec. 26.87(d) of this part when  an individual owner whose ownership and control of the firm are  necessary to the   firm's certification dies or is incarcerated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A recipient may immediately suspend a DBE's certification  without adhering to the requirements in Sec. 26.87(d) when there is  adequate evidence to believe that there has been a material change in  circumstances that may affect the eligibility of the DBE firm to remain  certified, or when the DBE fails to notify the recipient or UCP in  writing of any material change in circumstances as required by Sec.  26.83(i) of this part or fails to timely file an affidavit of no change  under Sec. 26.83(j).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In determining the adequacy of the evidence to issue a  suspension under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the recipient shall  consider all relevant factors, including how much information is  available, the credibility of the information and allegations given the  circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated,  and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The concerned operating administration may direct the recipient  to take action pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) this section if it  determines that information available to it is sufficient to warrant  immediate suspension.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When a firm is suspended pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of  this section, the recipient shall immediately notify the DBE of the  suspension by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last  known address of the owner(s) of the DBE.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Suspension is a temporary status of ineligibility pending an  expedited show cause hearing/proceeding under Sec. 26.87 of this part  to determine whether the DBE is eligible to participate in the program  and consequently should be removed. The suspension takes effect when the  DBE receives, or is deemed to have received, the Notice of Suspension.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> While suspended, the DBE may not be considered to meet a  contract goal on a new contract, and any work it does on a contract  received during the suspension shall not be counted toward a recipient's  overall goal. The DBE may continue to perform under an existing contract  executed before the DBE received a Notice of Suspension and may be  counted toward the contract goal during the period of suspension as long  as the DBE is performing a commercially useful function under the  existing contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Following receipt of the Notice of Suspension, if the DBE  believes it is no longer eligible, it may voluntarily withdraw from the  program, in which case no further action is required. If the DBE  believes that its eligibility should be reinstated, it must provide to  the recipient information demonstrating that the firm is eligible  notwithstanding its changed circumstances. Within 30 days of receiving  this information, the recipient must either lift the suspension and  reinstate the firm's certification or commence a decertification action  under Sec. 26.87 of this part. If the recipient commences a  decertification proceeding, the suspension remains in effect during the  proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The decision to immediately suspend a DBE under paragraph (a) or  (b) of this section is not appealable to the US Department of  Transportation. The failure of a recipient to either lift the suspension  and reinstate the firm or commence a decertification proceeding, as  required by paragraph (g) of this section, is appealable to the U.S.  Department of Transportation under Sec. 26.89 of this part, as a  constructive decertification.
