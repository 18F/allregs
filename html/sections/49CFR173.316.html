chemically with any residue in the packaging to produce an unsafe condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The jacket covering the insulation on a cylinder used to transport any flammable cryogenic liquid must be made of steel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A valve or fitting made of aluminum with internal rubbing or abrading aluminum parts that may come in contact with oxygen in the cryogenic liquid form may not be installed on any cylinder used to transport oxygen, cryogenic liquid unless the parts are anodized in accordance with ASTM Standard B 580 (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> An aluminum valve, pipe or fitting may not be installed on any cylinder used to transport any flammable cryogenic liquid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Each cylinder must be provided with one or more pressure relief devices, which must be installed and maintained in compliance with the requirements of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Each pressure relief device must be installed and located so that the cooling effect of the contents during venting will not prevent effective operation of the device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> All pressure relief device inlets must under maximum filling conditions be situated in the vapor space of the closed cryogenic receptacle and the devices must be arranged to ensure that the escaping vapor is discharged unobstructed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The maximum weight of the contents in a cylinder with a design service temperature colder than -320 F. may not exceed the design weight marked on the cylinder (see Sec. 178.35 of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Pressure control systems. Each cylinder containing a cryogenic liquid must have a pressure control system that conforms to Sec. 173.301(f) and is designed and installed so that it will prevent the cylinder from becoming liquid full.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Specification cylinder requirements and filling limits.
