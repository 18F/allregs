                            <p class="depth0">When cost-sharing is appropriate, the Contracting Officer shall use the following guidelines to determine the amount of cost participation by the contractor:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The amount of cost participation depends on the extent to which the R & D effort or results are likely to enhance the performing organization's capability, expertise, or competitive position, and the value of this enhancement to the performing organization. Therefore, contractor cost participation could reasonably range from as little as one percent or less of the total project cost to more than 50 percent of the total project cost. Ultimately, cost-sharing is a negotiable item. As

such, the amount of cost-sharing shall be proportional to the anticipated value of the contractor's gain.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the performing organization will not acquire title to, or the right to use, inventions, patents, or technical information resulting from the R & D project, it is normally appropriate to obtain less cost-sharing than in cases in which the performer acquires these rights.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A fee or profit is not normally paid to the performing organization, if the organization is to contribute to the cost of the R & D effort, but the amount of cost-sharing may be reduced to reflect the fact that the organization is foregoing its normal fee or profit in the research. However, if the R & D is expected to be of only minor value to the performing organization, and if a statute does not require cost-sharing, it may be appropriate for the performer to make a contribution in the form of a reduced fee or profit rather than sharing costs of the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The organization's participation may be considered over the total term of the project, so that a relatively high contribution in one year may be offset by a relatively low contribution in another.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A relatively low degree of cost-sharing may be appropriate, if an area of R & D requires special stimulus in the national interest.</p>
