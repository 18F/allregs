This account shall also include those improvements which will revert to the lessor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Improvements to leased telecommunications plant which are of a relatively minor cost or short life or for which the period of the lease is one year or less shall be charged to the account chargeable with the cost of repairs to such plant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Amounts contained in this account shall be amortized over the term of the related lease.
