                                Sec. 1.420-1  Significant reduction in retiree health coverage
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Notwithstanding section 420(c)(3)(A), the minimum  cost requirements of section 420(c)(3) are not   met if the employer significantly reduces retiree health coverage during  the cost maintenance period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Significant reduction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. An employer significantly  reduces retiree health coverage during the cost maintenance period if,  for any taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, that is  included in the cost maintenance period, either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The employer-initiated reduction percentage for that taxable  year exceeds 10 percent; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The sum of the employer-initiated reduction percentages for  that taxable year and all prior taxable years during the cost  maintenance period exceeds 20 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Employer-initiated reduction percentage. The employer-initiated  reduction percentage for any taxable year is the fraction B/A, expressed  as a percentage, where:  A = The total number of individuals (retired employees plus their</p><p class="depth0">spouses plus their dependents) receiving coverage for</p><p class="depth0">applicable health benefits as of the day before the first day</p><p class="depth0">of the taxable year. B = The total number of individuals included in A whose coverage for</p><p class="depth0">applicable health benefits ended during the taxable year by</p><p class="depth0">reason of employer action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special rules for taxable years beginning before January 1,  2002. The following rules apply for purposes of computing the amount in  paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section if any portion of the cost  maintenance period precedes the first day of the first taxable year  beginning on or after January 1, 2002--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Aggregation of taxable years. The portion of the cost  maintenance period that precedes the first day of the first taxable year  beginning on or after January 1, 2002 (the initial period) is treated as  a single taxable year and the employer-initiated reduction percentage  for the initial period is computed as set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of  this section, except that the words ``initial period'' apply instead of  ``taxable year.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Loss of coverage. If coverage for applicable health benefits  for an individual ends by reason of employer action at any time during  the initial period, an employer may treat that coverage as not having  ended if the employer restores coverage for applicable health benefits  to that individual by the end of the initial period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Employer action--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. For purposes of paragraph  (b)(2) of this section, an individual's coverage for applicable health  benefits ends during a taxable year by reason of employer action, if on  any day within the taxable year, the individual's eligibility for  applicable health benefits ends as a result of a plan amendment or any  other action of the employer (e.g., the sale of all or part of the  employer's business) that, in conjunction with the plan terms, has the  effect of ending the individual's eligibility. An employer action is  taken into account for this purpose regardless of when the employer  action actually occurs (e.g., the date the plan amendment is executed),  except that employer actions occurring before the later of December 18,  1999, and the date that is 5 years before the start of the cost  maintenance period are disregarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Sale transactions. If a purchaser provides coverage for  retiree health benefits to one or more individuals whose coverage ends  by reason of a sale of all or part of the employer's business, the  employer may treat the coverage of those individuals as not having ended  by reason of employer action. In such a case, for the remainder of the  year of the sale and future taxable years of the cost maintenance  period--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For purposes of computing the applicable employer cost under  section 420(c)(3), those individuals are treated as individuals to whom  coverage for applicable health benefits was provided   (for as long as the purchaser provides retiree health coverage to them),  and any amounts expended by the purchaser of the business to provide for  health benefits for those individuals are treated as paid by the  employer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For purposes of determining whether a subsequent termination of  coverage is by reason of employer action under this paragraph (b)(4),  the purchaser is treated as the employer. However, the special rule in  paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section applies only to the extent that any  terms of the plan maintained by the purchaser that have the effect of  ending retiree health coverage for an individual are the same as terms  of the plan maintained by the employer that were adopted  contemporaneously with the provision under which the individual became  eligible for retiree health coverage under the plan maintained by the  employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of  this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(C)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cost maintenance period. Cost maintenance period means the cost  maintenance period as defined in section 420(c)(3)(D).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Sale. A sale of all or part of an employer's business means a  sale or other transfer in connection with which the employees of a trade  or business of the employer become employees of another person. In the  case of such a transfer, the term purchaser means a transferee of the  trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer W maintains a defined benefit pension plan  that includes a 401(h) account and permits qualified transfers that  satisfy section 420. The number of individuals receiving coverage for  applicable health benefits as of the day before the first day of Year 1  is 100. In Year 1, Employer W makes a qualified transfer under section  420. There is no change in the number of individuals receiving health  benefits during Year 1. As of the last day of Year 2, applicable health  benefits are provided to 99 individuals, because 2 individuals became  eligible for coverage due to retirement and 3 individuals died in Year  2. During Year 3, Employer W amends its health plan to eliminate  coverage for 5 individuals, 1 new retiree becomes eligible for coverage  and an additional 3 individuals are no longer covered due to their own  decision to drop coverage. Thus, as of the last day of Year 3,  applicable health benefits are provided to 92 individuals. During Year  4, Employer W amends its health plan to eliminate coverage under its  health plan for 8 more individuals, so that as of the last day of Year  4, applicable health benefits are provided to 84 individuals. During  Year 5, Employer W amends its health plan to eliminate coverage for 8  more individuals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> There is no significant reduction in retiree health coverage in  either Year 1 or Year 2, because there is no reduction in health  coverage as a result of employer action in those years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> There is no significant reduction in Year 3. The number of  individuals whose health coverage ended during Year 3 by reason of  employer action (amendment of the plan) is 5. Since the number of  individuals receiving coverage for applicable health benefits as of the  last day of Year 2 is 99, the employer-initiated reduction percentage  for Year 3 is 5.05 percent (5/99), which is less than the 10 percent  annual limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> There is no significant reduction in Year 4. The number of  individuals whose health coverage ended during Year 4 by reason of  employer action is 8. Since the number of individuals receiving coverage  for applicable health benefits as of the last day of Year 3 is 92, the  employer-initiated reduction percentage for Year 4 is 8.70 percent (8/ 92), which is less than the 10 percent annual limit. The sum of the  employer-initiated reduction percentages for Year 3 and Year 4 is 13.75  percent, which is less than the 20 percent cumulative limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> In Year 5, there is a significant reduction under paragraph  (b)(1)(ii) of this section. The number of individuals whose health  coverage ended during Year 5 by reason of employer action (amendment of  the plan) is 8. Since the number of individuals receiving coverage for  applicable health benefits as of the last day of Year 4 is 84, the  employer-initiated reduction percentage for Year 5 is 9.52 percent (8/ 84), which is less than the 10 percent annual limit. However, the sum of  the employer-initiated reduction percentages for Year 3, Year 4, and  Year 5 is 5.05 percent + 8.70 percent + 9.52 percent = 23.27 percent,  which exceeds the 20 percent cumulative limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer X, a calendar year taxpayer, maintains a  defined benefit pension plan that includes a 401(h) account and permits  qualified transfers that satisfy section 420. X also provides lifetime  health benefits to employees who retire from Division A as a result of a  plant shutdown, no health benefits to employees who retire from Division  B, and lifetime health benefits to all employees who retire from  Division C. In 2000, X amends its health plan to provide   coverage for employees who retire from Division B as a result of a plant  shutdown, but only for the 2-year period coinciding with their severance  pay. Also in 2000, X amends the health plan to provide that employees  who retire from Division A as a result of a plant shutdown receive  health coverage only for the 2-year period coinciding with their  severance pay. A plant shutdown that affects Division A and Division B  employees occurs in 2000. The number of individuals receiving coverage  for applicable health benefits as of the last day of 2001 is 200. In  2002, Employer X makes a qualified transfer under section 420. As of the  last day of 2002, applicable health benefits are provided to 170  individuals, because the 2-year period of benefits ends for 10 employees  who retired from Division A and 20 employees who retired from Division B  as a result of the plant shutdown that occurred in 2000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section, coverage for those 20 retirees  from Division B is not treated as having ended by reason of employer  action. Thus, the number of individuals whose health benefits ended by  reason of employer action in 2002 is 10. Since the number of individuals  receiving coverage for applicable health benefits as of the last day of  2001 is 200, the employer-initiated reduction percentage for 2002 is 5  percent (10/200), which is less than the 10 percent annual limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Regulatory effective date. This section is applicable to  transfers of excess pension assets occurring on or after December 18,  1999.  [T.D. 8948, 66 FR 32900, June 19, 2001]</p><p class="depth0">Certain Stock Options</p>
