                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Combined B-1/B-2 visitor visa and border crossing identification  card (B-1/B-2 Visa/BCC)--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Authorization for issuance. Consular  officers assigned to a consular office in Mexico designated by the  Deputy Assistant Secretary for Visa Services for such purpose may issue  a border crossing identification card, as that term is defined in INA  101(a)(6), in combination with a B-1/B-2 nonimmigrant visitor visa (B-1/ B-2 Visa/BCC), to a nonimmigrant alien who:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is a citizen and resident of Mexico;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Seeks to enter the United States as a temporary visitor for  business or pleasure as defined in INA 101(a)(15)(B) for periods of stay  not exceeding six months;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Is otherwise eligible for a B-1 or a B-2 temporary visitor  visa.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Procedure for application. Mexican applicants shall apply for a  B-1/B-2 Visa/BCC at any U.S. consular office in Mexico designated by the  Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Visa Services pursuant to  paragraph (a) of this section to accept such applications. The  application shall be submitted electronically on Form DS-160 or, as  directed by a consular officer, on Form DS-156. If submitted  electronically, it must be signed electronically by clicking the box  designated ``Sign Application'' in the certification section of the  application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Personal appearance. Each applicant shall appear in person  before a consular officer to be interviewed regarding eligibility for a  visitor visa, unless the consular officer waives personal appearance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Issuance and format. A B-1/B-2 Visa/BCC issued on or after April  1, 1998, shall consist of a card, Form DSP-150, containing a machine- readable biometric identifier. It shall contain the following data:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Post symbol;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Number of the card;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Date of issuance;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Indicia ``B-1/B-2 Visa and Border Crossing Card'';</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Name, date of birth, and sex of the person to whom issued; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Date of expiration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Validity. A BCC previously issued by a consular officer in  Mexico on Form I-186, Nonresident Alien Mexican Border Crossing Card, or  Form I-586, Nonresident Alien Border Crossing Card, is valid until the  expiration date on the card (if any) unless previously revoked, but not  later than the date, currently October 1, 2001, on which a machine- readable, biometric identifier in the card is required in order for the  card to be usable for entry. The BCC portion of a B-1/B-2 Visa/BCC  issued to a Mexican national pursuant to provisions of this section  contained in the 22 CFR, parts 1 to 299, edition revised as of April 1,  1998 is valid until the date of expiration, unless previously revoked,  but not later than the date, currently October 1, 2001, on which a  machine-readable, biometric identifier in the card is required in order  for the card to be usable for entry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Revocation. A consular or immigration officer may revoke a BCC  issued on Form I-186 or Form I-586, or a B-1/B-2 Visa/BCC under the  provisions of Sec. 41.122, or if the consular or immigration officer  determines that the alien to whom any such document was issued has  ceased to be a resident and/or a citizen of Mexico. Upon revocation, the  consular or immigration officer shall notify the issuing consular or  immigration office. If the revoked document is a card, the consular or  immigration officer shall take possession of the card and physically  cancel it under standard security conditions. If the revoked document is  a stamp in a passport the consular or immigration officer shall write or  stamp ``canceled'' on the face of the document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Voidance. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The voiding pursuant to INA 222(g) of the visa  portion of a B-1/B-2 Visa/BCC issued at any time by a consular officer  in Mexico under provisions of this section contained in the 22 CFR,  parts 1 to 299, edition revised as of April 1, 1998, also voids the BCC  portion of that document.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A BCC issued at any time by a consular officer in Mexico under  any provisions of this section contained in the 22 CFR, parts 1 to 299,  edition revised as of April 1, 1998, is void if a consular or  immigration officer determines that the alien has violated the  conditions of the alien's admission into the United States, including  the period of stay authorized by the Secretary of Homeland Security.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A consular or immigration officer shall immediately take  possession of a card determined to be void under paragraphs (d) (1) or  (2) of this section and physically cancel it under standard security  conditions. If the document voided in paragraphs (d) (1) or (2) is in  the form of a stamp in a passport the officer shall write or stamp  ``canceled'' across the face of the document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Replacement. When a B-1/B-2 Visa/BCC issued under the provisions  of this section, or a BCC or B-1/B-2 Visa/BCC issued under any  provisions of this section contained in the 22 CFR, parts 1 to 299,  edition revised as of April 1, 1998, has been lost, mutilated,  destroyed, or expired, the person to whom such card was issued may apply  for a new B-1/B-2 Visa/BCC as provided in this section.
