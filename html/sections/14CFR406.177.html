                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Any party may petition the FAA decisionmaker to  reconsider or modify a final decision and order issued by the FAA  decisionmaker on appeal from an initial decision. A party must file a  petition to reconsider or modify with the Federal Docket Management  System not later than 30 days after service of the FAA decisionmaker's  final decision and order on appeal and must serve a copy of the petition  on each party. The FAA decisionmaker will not reconsider or modify an  initial decision and order issued by an administrative law judge that  has not been appealed by any party to the FAA decisionmaker.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contents. A party must state briefly and specifically the  alleged errors in the final decision and order on appeal, the relief  sought by the party, and the grounds that support, the petition to  reconsider or modify.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the petition is based, in whole or in part, on allegations  regarding the   consequences of the FAA decisionmaker's decision, the party must  describe these allegations and must describe, and support, the basis for  the allegations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the petition is based, in whole or in part, on new material  not previously raised in the proceedings, the party must set forth the  new material and include affidavits of prospective witnesses and  authenticated documents that would be introduced in support of the new  material. The party must explain, in detail, why the new material was  not discovered through due diligence prior to the hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Repetitious and frivolous petition. The FAA decisionmaker will  not consider a repetitious or frivolous petition. The FAA decisionmaker  may summarily dismiss any repetitious or frivolous petition to  reconsider or modify.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reply to petition. Any other party may reply to a petition to  reconsider or modify, not later than 10 days after service of the  petition on that party, by filing a reply. A party must serve a copy of  the reply on each party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effect of filing petition. Unless otherwise ordered by the FAA  decisionmaker, filing a petition under this section stays the effective  date of the FAA decisionmaker's final decision and order on appeal, and  tolls the time allowed for judicial review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> FAA decisionmaker's decision on petition. The FAA decisionmaker  may affirm, modify, or reverse the final decision and order on appeal,  or may remand the case for any proceedings that the FAA decisionmaker  determines may be necessary.
