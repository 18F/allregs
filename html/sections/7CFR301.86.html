Sec.  301.86-3  Quarantined areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Designation of quarantined areas. In accordance with the criteria listed in paragraph (c) of this section, the Administrator will designate as a quarantined area each field that has been found to be infested with pale cyst nematode, each field that has been found to be associated with an infested field, and any area that the Administrator considers necessary to quarantine because of its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from infested or associated fields. The Administrator will publish the description of the quarantined area on the Plant Protection and Quarantine Web site, http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant--health/plant--pest--info/potato/pcn.shtml. The description of the quarantined area will include the date the description was last updated and a description of the changes that have been made to the quarantined area. The description of the quarantined area may also be obtained by request from any local office of PPQ; local offices are listed in telephone directories. After a change is made to the quarantined area, we will publish a notice in the Federal Register informing the public that the change has occurred and describing the change to the quarantined area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Designation of an area less than an entire State as a quarantined area. Less than an entire State will be designated as a quarantined area only if the Administrator determines that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles that are equivalent to those imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of regulated articles; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The designation of less than the entire State as a quarantined area will prevent the interstate spread of the pale cyst nematode.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Criteria for designation of fields as infested fields and associated fields. (1)

Infested fields. The Administrator will designate a field as an infested field when a pale cyst nematode is found in the field.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Associated fields. The Administrator will designate a field as an associated field when pale cyst nematode host crops, as listed in Sec.  301.86-2(b), have been grown in the field in the last 10 years and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The field shares a border with an infested field; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The field came into contact with a regulated article listed in Sec.  301.86-2 from an infested field within the last 10 years; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Within the last 10 years, the field shared ownership, tenancy, seed, drainage or runoff, farm machinery, or other elements of shared cultural practices with an infested field that could allow spread of the pale cyst nematode, as determined by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Removal of fields from quarantine--(1) Infested fields. An infested field will be removed from quarantine when a protocol approved by the Administrator as sufficient to support removal of infested fields from quarantine has been completed and the field has been found to be free of pale cyst nematode.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Associated fields. An associated field will be removed from quarantine when the field has been found to be free of pale cyst nematode according to a protocol approved by the Administrator as sufficient to support removal of associated fields from quarantine.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Removal of other areas from quarantine. If the Administrator has quarantined any area other than infested or associated fields because of its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from infested or associated fields, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, that area will be removed from quarantine when the relevant infested or associated fields are removed from quarantine.

Articles found to be infested by an inspector, and articles not in compliance with the regulations in this subpart, may be seized, quarantined, treated, subjected to other remedial measures, destroyed, or otherwise disposed of.


Sec.  301.86-5  Issuance and cancellation of certificates and limited permits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Certificates. An inspector \3\ or person operating under a compliance agreement may issue a certificate for the interstate movement of a regulated article if the inspector determines that

An inspector may issue a certificate for the interstate movement of nursery stock of non-host crops moved without soil if the inspector finds the nursery stock to be free of soil on its roots and on all other parts of the plant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Certification requirements for potatoes for consumption, root crops for consumption, garden or dry beans, and peas. An inspector may issue a certificate for the movement of potatoes intended for consumption, root crops intended for consumption, garden or dry beans, or peas from the quarantined area only if the field in which the potatoes, root crops, garden or dry beans, or peas were grown meets the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The field has been surveyed by an inspector for pale cyst nematode at least once in the last 3 years and prior to the planting of the potatoes or root crops;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pale cyst nematode has not been found in the field; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> No more than one pale cyst nematode host crop, as listed in Sec.  301.86-2(b), has been grown in the field in the last 3 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Certification requirements for soil and associated products.

An inspector may issue a certificate for the movement of

hay, straw, or fodder from the quarantined area only if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The field where the hay, straw, or fodder was produced meets the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The field has been surveyed by an inspector for pale cyst nematode at least once in the last 3 years;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The pale cyst nematode has not been found in the field; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> No more than one pale cyst nematode host crop, as listed in Sec.  301.86-2(b), has been grown in the field in the last 3 years; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The hay, straw, or fodder is produced according to procedures judged by an inspector to be sufficient to isolate it from soil throughout its production.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Certification requirements for equipment used in infested or associated fields. An inspector may issue a certificate for the interstate movement of equipment that has been used in an infested or associated field and that can carry soil if moved out of the field only after the equipment has been pressure-washed under the supervision of an inspector to remove all soil or steam-treated in accordance with part 305 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Limited permits--(1) General conditions.

If the withdrawal is oral, the withdrawal and the reasons for the withdrawal will be confirmed in writing as promptly as circumstances allow. Any person whose certificate or limited permit has been withdrawn may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after receiving the written notification of the withdrawal. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons upon which

the person relies to show that the certificate or limited permit was wrongfully withdrawn. As promptly as circumstances allow, the Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision. A hearing will be held to resolve any conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice concerning a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.
