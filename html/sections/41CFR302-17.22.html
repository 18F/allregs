                                Sec.  302-17.22  What relocation expenses does the WTA not cover?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The WTA does not cover the following relocation expenses:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any reimbursement, allowance, or direct payment to a vendor that  should not be reported as taxable income when you file your Federal tax  return; this includes but is not limited to en route lodging and  transportation, HHG transportation, and transportation of POVs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reimbursed expenses for extended storage of household goods  during an OCONUS assignment, if reimbursement is permitted under your  agency's policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> State and local withholding tax obligations. To the extent that  your state or local tax authority requires periodic (such as quarterly)  tax payments, you are responsible to pay these from your own funds. Your  agency reimburses you for substantially all of these payments through  the RITA process, but your agency does not provide a WTA for them. If  required to by state or local law, your agency may withhold these from  your reimbursement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Additional taxes due under the Federal Insurance Contributions  Act including Social Security tax, if applicable, and Medicare tax.  Current law does not allow Federal agencies to reimburse transferees for  these employment taxes on relocation benefits. However, your agency will  deduct for these taxes from your reimbursements for taxable items.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Any reimbursement amount that exceeds the actual expense paid or  incurred. For example, if your reimbursement for the movement of  household goods is based on the commuted rate schedule but your actual  relocation expenses are less than that, your tax liability for the  difference is not covered by the WTA or RITA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Home marketing incentive payment. In accordance with FTR part  302-14, your agency may not provide you either a WTA or RITA for this  incentive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Any recruitment, relocation, or retention incentive payment that  you receive. Any withholding of taxes for such payments is outside the  scope of this regulation. Rather, it is covered by regulations issued by  the Office of Personnel Management, Treasury's Financial Management  Service, and the IRS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Any allowances, reimbursements, and/or direct payments to  vendors not related to your relocation; for example, a reimbursement for  office supplies would not be covered by the WTA, even if it occurred  during your relocation.</p>
