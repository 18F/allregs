                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Under the Act there is no requirement that a Federal employee  have a regularly scheduled administrative workweek. However, under title  5 United States Code, and part 610 of this chapter, the head of an  agency is required to establish work schedules for his or her employees.  In determining what activities constitute hours of work under the Act,  there is generally a distinction based on whether the activity is  performed by an employee during regular working hours or outside regular  working hours. For purposes of this part, ``regular working hours''  means the days and hours of an employee's regularly scheduled  administrative workweek established under part 610 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]  [45 FR 85664, Dec. 30, 1980, as amended at 48 FR 36806, Aug. 15, 1983]</p>
