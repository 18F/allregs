The  sponsored alien shall provide the State agency with any information and  documentation necessary for such determination and obtain any  cooperation necessary from the sponsor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The provisions of this section shall not apply to any alien who  is:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Admitted as a conditional entrant refugee to the United States  as a result of the application, of the provisions of section 203(a)(7)  (in effect prior to April 1, 1980) of the Immigration and Nationality  Act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Admitted as a refugee to the United States as a result of the  application of the provisions of section 207(c) (in effect after March  31, 1980) of the Immigration and Nationality Act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Paroled into the United States as a refugee under section  212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Granted political asylum by the Attorney General under section  208 of the Immigration and Nationality Act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A Cuban or Haitian entrant, as defined in section 501(e) of the  Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980 (Pub.
