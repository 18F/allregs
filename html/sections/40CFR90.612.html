                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Individuals shall be eligible for importing engines into the United States under the provisions of this section, unless otherwise specified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Notwithstanding other requirements of this subpart, an engine entitled to one of the temporary exemptions of this paragraph may be conditionally admitted into the United States if prior written approval for the conditional admission is obtained from the Administrator. Conditional admission is to be under U.S. Customs Service bond. The Administrator may request that the U.S. Customs Service require a specific bond amount to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Act and this subpart. A written request for approval from the Administrator is to contain the identification required in Sec. 90.604(c) and information that demonstrates that the importer is entitled to the exemption. Noncompliance with provisions of this section may result in the forfeiture of the total amount of the bond or exportation of the engine. The following temporary exemptions are permitted by this paragraph:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Exemption for repairs or alterations. A person may conditionally import under bond a nonconforming engine solely for purpose of repairs or alterations. The engine may not be operated in the United States other than for the sole purpose of repair or alteration or shipment to the point of repair or alteration and to the port of export. It may not be sold or leased in the United States and is to be exported upon completion of the repairs or alterations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Testing exemption. A test engine may be conditionally imported by a person subject to the requirements of Sec. 90.905. A test engine may be operated in the United States provided that the operation is an integral part of the test. This exemption is limited to a period not exceeding one year from the

date of importation unless a request is made by the appropriate importer concerning the engine in accordance with Sec. 90.905(f) for a subsequent one-year period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Display exemptions. (i) An engine intended solely for display may be conditionally imported subject to the requirements of Sec. 90.907.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A display engine may be imported by any person for purposes related to a business or the public interest. Such purposes do not include collections normally inaccessible or unavailable to the public on a daily basis, display of an engine at a dealership, private use, or other purpose that the Administrator determines is not appropriate for display exemptions. A display engine may not be sold in the United States and may not be operated in the United States except for the operation incident and necessary to the display purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A temporary display exemption will be granted for 12 months (one year) or for the duration of the display purpose, whichever is shorter. Two extensions of up to 12 months (one year) each are available upon approval by the Administrator. In no circumstances, however, may the total period of exemption exceed 36 months (three years).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Notwithstanding any other requirement of this subpart, an engine may be finally admitted into the United States under this paragraph if prior written approval for such final admission is obtained from the Administrator. Conditional admission of these engines under this subpart is not permitted for the purpose of obtaining such written approval from the Administrator. A request for approval is to contain the identification information required in Sec. 90.604(c) and information that demonstrates that the importer is entitled to the exemption or exclusion. The following exemptions or exclusions are permitted by this paragraph:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> National security exemption. An engine may be imported under the national security exemption found at Sec. 90.908.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Hardship exemption. The Administrator may exempt on a case-by-case basis an engine from federal emission requirements to accommodate unforeseen cases of extreme hardship or extraordinary circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exemption for engines identical to United States certified versions. (i) A person (including businesses) is eligible for importing an engine into the United States under the provisions of this paragraph. An exemption will be granted if the engine:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> is owned by the importer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> is not offered for importation for the purpose of resale; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> is proven to be identical, in all material respects, to an engine certified by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for sale in the United States or is proven to have been modified to be identical, in all material respects, to an engine certified by the OEM for sale in the United States according to complete written instructions provided by the OEM's United States representative, or his/her designee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Proof of Conformity. (A) Documentation submitted pursuant to this section for the purpose of proving conformity of individual engines is to contain sufficiently organized data or evidence demonstrating that the engine identified pursuant to Sec. 90.604(c) is identical, in all material respects, to an engine identified in an OEM's application for certification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the documentation does not contain all the information required by this part, or is not sufficiently organized, EPA will notify the importer of any areas of inadequacy, and that the documentation will not receive further consideration until the required information or organization is provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If EPA determines that the documentation does not clearly or sufficiently demonstrate that an engine is eligible for importation, EPA will notify the importer in writing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If EPA determines that the documentation clearly and sufficiently demonstrates that an engine is eligible for importation, EPA will grant approval for importation and notify the importer in writing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Foreign diplomatic and military personnel may import a nonconforming engine without bond. At the time of admission, the importer shall submit to the Administrator the written report required in Sec. 90.604(a) and a statement

from the U.S. Department of State confirming qualification for this exemption. Foreign military personnel may, in lieu of a statement from the U.S. Department of State, submit to the Administrator a copy of their orders for duty in the United States. The engine may not be sold in the United States and must be exported if the individual's diplomatic status is no longer applicable, as determined by the Department of State, or the foreign military orders for duty in the United States are no longer applicable, unless subsequently brought into conformity with U.S. emission requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Competition exclusion. A nonconforming engine may be conditionally admitted by any person provided the importer demonstrates to the Administrator that the engine is used to propel a nonroad vehicle used solely for competition and obtains prior written approval from the Administrator. A nonconforming engine imported pursuant to this paragraph may not be operated in the United States except for that operation incident and necessary for the competition purpose, unless subsequently brought into conformity with United States emission requirements in accordance with Sec. 90.612(c)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Exclusions/exemptions based on date of original manufacture. (1) Notwithstanding any other requirements of this subpart, engines originally manufactured prior to model year 1997 are excluded from the requirements of the Act in accordance with section 213 of the Act and may be imported by any person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding other requirements of this subpart, an engine not subject to an exclusion under Sec. 90.612(f)(1) but greater than 20 original production (OP) years old is entitled to an exemption from the requirements of the Act, provided that it has not been modified in those 20 OP years. At the time of admission, the importer shall submit to the Administrator the written report required in Sec. 90.604(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Applications for exemptions and exclusions provided for in paragraphs (b), (c), and (e) of this section are to be mailed to: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Mobile Sources, Engine Compliance Programs Group (6403-J), Washington, DC 20460, Attention: Imports.
