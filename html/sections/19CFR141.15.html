                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When appropriate. If the person desiring to make entry is unable to present a bill of lading, air waybill, or other evidence of right to make entry in accordance with Sec. 141.11, the port director may accept a bond for the production of a bill of lading or air waybill under the provisions of section 484(c), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1484(c)). The bond shall be for the production of a bill of lading or air waybill, unless the person making entry intends to produce a carrier's certificate or certified duplicate bill of lading or air waybill. In that case, no bond is required because section 484(c) does not apply to entries made on a carrier's certificate or certified duplicate bill of lading or air waybill. If the port director is in doubt as to the propriety of accepting entry on a bond for the production of a bill of lading or air waybill, he shall request authority to do so from the Commissioner of Customs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form. The bond shall be on Customs Form 301 and contain the bond conditions set forth in Sec. 113.69 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Documents acceptable to satisfy bond. A bond given for the production of a bill of lading or air waybill shall be considered as canceled upon production of a bill of lading or air waybill, and may be considered as satisfied but shall not be canceled upon the production of a carrier's certificate or certified duplicate bill of lading or air waybill.
