If good engineering judgment dictates that you account for gas compressibility, you may either use an appropriate equation of state to determine values of Z as a function of measured pressure and temperature, or you may develop your own calibration equations based on good engineering judgment. Note that the equation for the flow coefficient, Cf, is based on the ideal gas assumption that the isentropic exponent, g, is equal to the ratio of specific heats, Cp/Cv.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.117</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Create an equation for Cd as a function of Re#, using paired values of the two quantities. The equation may involve any mathematical expression, including a polynomial or a power series. The following equation is an example of a commonly used mathematical expression for relating Cd and Re#:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.118</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Perform a least-squares regression analysis to determine the best-fit coefficients for the equation and calculate SEE as described in 40 CFR 1065.602.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> If the equation meets the criterion of SEE <= 0.5% [sdot] Cdmax, you may use the equation for the corresponding range of Re#, as described in Sec.  1066.630(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> If the equation does not meet the specified statistical criteria, you may use good engineering judgment to omit calibration data points; however, you must use at least seven calibration data points to demonstrate that you meet the criterion. For example, this may involve narrowing the range of flow rates for a better curve fit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Take corrective action if the equation does not meet the specified

statistical criterion even after omitting calibration data points. For example, select another mathematical expression for the Cd versus Re# equation, check for leaks, or repeat the calibration process. If you must repeat the calibration process, we recommend applying tighter tolerances to measurements and allowing more time for flows to stabilize.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> Once you have an equation that meets the specified statistical criterion, you may use the equation only for the corresponding range of flow rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> CFV calibration. Some CFV flow meters consist of a single venturi and some consist of multiple venturis where different combinations of venturis are used to meter different flow rates. For CFV flow meters that consist of multiple venturis, either calibrate each venturi independently to determine a separate calibration coefficient, Kv, for each venturi, or calibrate each combination of venturis as one venturi by determining Kv for the system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To determine Kv for a single venturi or a combination of venturis, perform the following steps:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Calculate an individual Kv for each calibration set point for each restrictor position using the following equation:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.119
Where:
Qirefstd = mean flow rate from the reference flow meter,</p><p class="depth0">corrected to standard reference conditions.Tin = mean temperature at the venturi inlet.pin = mean static absolute pressure at the venturi inlet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Calculate the mean and standard deviation of all the Kv values (see 40 CFR 1065.602). Verify choked flow by plotting Kv as a function of Pin. Kv will have a relatively constant value for choked flow; as vacuum pressure increases, the venturi will become unchoked and Kv will decrease. Paragraphs (c)(1)(iii) through (viii) of this section describe how to verify your range of choked flow.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the standard deviation of all the Kv values is less than or equal to 0.3% of the mean Kv, use the mean Kv in Eq. 1066.630-7, and use the CFV only up to the highest venturi pressure ratio, r, measured during calibration using the following equation:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.120
Where:
[Delta]pCFV = differential static pressure; venturi inlet</p><p class="depth0">minus venturi outlet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If the standard deviation of all the Kv values exceeds 0.3% of the mean Kv, omit the Kv value corresponding to the data point collected at the highest r measured during calibration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If the number of remaining data points is less than seven, take corrective action by checking your calibration data or repeating the calibration process. If you repeat the calibration process, we recommend checking for leaks, applying tighter tolerances to measurements and allowing more time for flows to stabilize.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> If the number of remaining Kv values is seven or greater, recalculate the mean and standard deviation of the remaining Kv values.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> If the standard deviation of the remaining Kv values is less than or equal to 0.3% of the mean of the remaining Kv, use that mean Kv in Eq 1066.630-7, and use the CFV values only up to the highest r associated with the remaining Kv.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> If the standard deviation of the remaining Kv still exceeds 0.3% of the mean of the remaining Kv values, repeat the steps in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) through (vii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> During exhaust emission tests, monitor sonic flow in the CFV by monitoring r. Based on the calibration data selected to meet the standard deviation criterion in paragraphs (c)(1)(iv) and (vii) of this section, in which Kv is constant, select the data values associated with the calibration point with the lowest absolute venturi inlet pressure to determine the r limit. Calculate r during the exhaust emission test using Eq. 1066.625-8 to demonstrate that the value of r during all emission tests is less than or equal to the r limit derived from the CFV calibration data.</p>
