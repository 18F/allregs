Abandoned junk and junkyards, worthless junk, and the like are not similarly protected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the location of a nonconforming junkyard is changed as a result of a right-of-way taking or for any other reason, it ceases to be a nonconforming junkyard, and shall be treated as a new junkyard at a new location.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The nonconforming junkyard must have been lawful on the effective date of the State law or regulations and must continue to be lawfully maintained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The nonconforming junkyard may continue as long as it is not extended, enlarged, or changed in use. Once a junkyard has been made conforming, the placement of junk so that it may be seen above or beyond a screen, or otherwise becomes visible, shall be treated the same as the establishment of a new junkyard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The nonconforming junkyard may continue as long as it is not abandoned, destroyed, or voluntarily discontinued. Each State should develop criteria to define these terms.</p>
