                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The owner or operator must prevent the unknowing entry, and minimize the possibility for the unauthorized entry, of persons or livestock onto the active portion of his facility, unless he can demonstrate to the Regional Administrator that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Physical contact with the waste, structures, or equipment within the active portion of the facility will not injure unknowing or unauthorized persons or livestock which may enter the active portion of a facility; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disturbance of the waste or equipment, by the unknowing or unauthorized entry of persons or livestock onto the active portion of a facility, will not cause a violation of the requirements of this part.
[Comment: Part 270 of this chapter requires that an owner or operator who wishes to make the demonstration referred to above must do so with part B of the permit application.]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unless the owner or operator has made a successful demonstration under paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section, a facility must have:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A 24-hour surveillance system (e.g., television monitoring or surveillance by guards or facility personnel) which continuously monitors and controls entry onto the active portion of the facility; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> An artificial or natural barrier (e.g., a fence in good repair or a fence combined with a cliff), which completely surrounds the active portion of the facility; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An artificial or natural barrier (e.g., a fence in good repair or a fence combined with a cliff), which completely surrounds the active portion of the facility; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A means to control entry, at all times, through the gates or other entrances to the active portion of the facility (e.g., an attendant, television monitors, locked entrance, or controlled roadway access to the facility).
[Comment: The requirements of paragraph (b) of this section are satisfied if the facility or plant within which the active portion is located itself has a surveillance system, or a barrier and a means to control entry, which complies with the requirements of paragraph (b) (1) or (2) of this section.]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unless the owner or operator has made a successful demonstration under paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section, a sign with the legend, ``Danger--Unauthorized Personnel Keep Out'', must be posted at each entrance to the active portion of a facility, and at other locations, in sufficient numbers to be seen from any approach to this active portion. The legend must be written in English and in any other language predominant in the area surrounding the facility (e.g., facilities in counties bordering the Canadian province of Quebec must post signs in French; facilities in counties bordering Mexico must post signs in Spanish), and must be legible from a distance of at least 25 feet. Existing signs with a legend other than ``Danger--Unauthorized Personnel Keep Out'' may be used if the legend on the sign indicates that only authorized personnel are allowed to enter the active portion, and that entry onto the active portion can be dangerous.



[Comment: See Sec. 264.117(b) for discussion of security requirements at disposal facilities during the post-closure care period.]
