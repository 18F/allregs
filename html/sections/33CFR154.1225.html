To receive this credit, the facility owner or operator must identify in the plan and ensure, by contract or other approved means as described in Sec. 154.1228(a), the availability of specified resources to apply the dispersants and to monitor their effectiveness. The extent of the credit for dispersants will be based on the volumes of the dispersants available to sustain operations at the manufacturers' recommended dosage rates. Other spill mitigation techniques, including mechanical dispersal, may be identified in the response plan provided they are in accordance with the NCP and the applicable ACP. Resources identified for plan credit should be capable of being on scene within 12 hours of a discovery of a discharge. Identification of these resources does not imply that they will be authorized for use. Actual authorization for use during a spill response will be governed by the provisions of the NCP and the applicable ACP.
