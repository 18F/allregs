                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>, or subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code  (relating to insurance companies), if its income tax under such sections  or such subchapter L for the taxable year can reasonably be expected to  exceed the sum of $100,000 plus the amount of any estimated credits  allowable under section 32 (relating to tax withheld at source on  nonresident aliens and foreign corporations and on tax-free covenant  bonds), section 33 (relating to taxes of foreign countries and  possessions of the United States), and section 38 (relating to  investment in certain depreciable property).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(3)(C)(v)</em> and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The application of this section may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. M, a corporation subject to tax under section 11,  reasonably anticipates that it will have taxable income of $224,000 for  the calendar year 1964. The normal tax and surtax result in an expected  liability of $105,000. M determines that it will not have any allowable  credits under sections 32, 33, and 38 for 1964. Since M's expected tax  ($105,000) exceeds the exemption ($100,000), a declaration of estimated  tax is required to be filed, reporting an estimated tax of $5,000  ($105,000-$100,000) for the calendar year 1964.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Under the facts stated in example (1), except that M  estimates it will have an allowable foreign tax credit under section 33  in the amount of $4,000 and an allowable investment credit under section  38 in the   amount of $3,000, no declaration is required, since M's expected tax  ($105,000) does not exceed the $100,000 plus the allowable credits  totaling $7,000.
