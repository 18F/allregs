A covered noncareer employee may receive compensation for teaching only when specifically authorized in advance by the designated agency ethics official.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definition. For purposes of this section ``teaching'' means any activity that involves oral presentation or personal interaction, the primary function of which is to instruct or otherwise impart knowledge or skill. It is not limited to teaching that occurs in a formal setting, such as a classroom, but extends to instruction on an individual basis or in an informal setting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Request for authorization. An employee may request authorization to engage in compensated teaching activities by forwarding a written request to the designated agency ethics official. The request shall describe the employee's official duties, the subject matter of the teaching activity, the entity sponsoring the course, and the student, class or audience to be taught. In addition, it shall set forth the terms of the compensation arrangement and identify the source of the payment. The request shall be accompanied by any contract or employment agreement and any literature describing, publicizing or otherwise promoting the class, classes or course.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Standard for authorization. Compensated teaching may be approved by the designated agency ethics official only when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The teaching will not interfere with the performance of the employee's official duties or give rise to an appearance that the teaching opportunity was extended to the employee principally because of his official position;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employee's receipt of compensation does not violate any of the limitations and prohibitions on honoraria, compensation or outside earned income contained in this part; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Neither the teaching activity nor the employee's receipt of compensation therefor will violate applicable standards of conduct or any statute or regulation related to conflicts of interests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Determination and authorization. The determination by the designated agency ethics official to grant or deny authorization to engage in teaching for compensation shall be in writing and shall be final. The authority of the designated agency ethics official to authorize compensated teaching may not be delegated to any person other than the alternate designated agency ethics official described in Sec. 2638.202(b).</p>
