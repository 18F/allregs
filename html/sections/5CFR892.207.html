                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Subject to the exceptions described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, you can make changes to your FEHB enrollment for the same reasons and with the same effective dates listed in Sec. 890.301 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> However, if you are participating in premium conversion there are two exceptions: you must have a qualifying life event to change from self and family enrollment to self only enrollment or to drop FEHB coverage entirely. (See Sec. 892.209 and Sec. 892.210.) Your change in enrollment must be consistent with and correspond to your qualifying life event as described in Sec. 892.101. These limitations apply only to changes you may wish to make outside open season.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you are subject to a court or administrative order as discussed in Sec. 890.301(g)(3) of this chapter, your employing agency can limit a change to your enrollment as long as the court or administrative order is still in effect and you have at least one child identified in the order who is still eligible under the FEHB Program, unless you provide documentation to your agency that you have other coverage for your child or children. See also Sec. 892.208 and Sec. 892.209.
