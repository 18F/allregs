A subcutaneous, implanted, intravascular  infusion port and catheter is a device that consists of a subcutaneous,  implanted reservoir that connects to a long-term intravascular catheter.  The device allows for repeated access to the vascular system for the  infusion of fluids and medications and the sampling of blood. The device  consists of a portal body with a resealable septum and outlet made of  metal, plastic, or combination of these materials and a long-term  intravascular catheter is either preattached to the port or attached to  the port at the time of device placement. The device is available in  various profiles and sizes and can be of a single or multiple lumen  design.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification.
