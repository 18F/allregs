                            <p class="depth0">A variety of construction materials such as wood, metal plate, or pipe may be used for stalls, crates, or pens aboard ocean vessels. Pipe fittings have the advantage of smooth surfaces, easy maintenance, long range economy and spaces between pipe rails to allow for feeding, watering, cleaning and better ventilation. Material used for stalls, crates, or pens shall be properly formed, closely fitted, and rigidly secured in place. Special care shall be taken to design and finish all edges, welds, and hardware that are accessible to animals. A combination of wood and steel pipe or other steel profile construction may be accepted if the construction complies with the regulations in this part. Where the sides of pens are adjacent to the ship's sides which have steel casing, frames, stays or similar fittings, the carrier shall cover these profiles with wooden battens of at least 2 inch thick lumber or plywood of similar strength to prevent animals from injury.
