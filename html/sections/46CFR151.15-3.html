                            <p class="depth0">This section lists the requirements for construction of the types of  cargo tanks defined in Sec.  151.15-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Gravity type tanks. Gravity type cargo tanks vented at a  pressure of 4 pounds per square inch gauge or less shall be constructed  and tested as required by standards established by the American Bureau  of Shipping or other recognized classification society. Gravity type  tanks vented at a pressure exceeding 4 but not exceeding 10 pounds per  square inch gauge will be given special consideration by the Commandant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Pressure vessel type tanks. Pressure vessel type tanks shall be  designed and tested in accordance with the requirements of Part 54 of  this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Uninsulated cargo tanks, where the cargo is transported, at or  near ambient temperatures, shall be designed for a pressure not less  than the vapor pressure of the cargo at 115 [deg]F. The design shall  also be based on the minimum internal pressure (maximum vacuum), plus  the maximum external static head to which the tank may be subjected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When cargo tanks, in which the cargo is transported at or near  ambient temperature, are insulated with an insulation material of a  thickness to provide a thermal conductance of not more than 0.075 B.t.u.  per square foot per degree Fahrenheit differential in temperature per  hour, the tanks shall be designed for a pressure of not less than the  vapor pressure of the cargo at 105 [deg]F. The insulation shall also  meet the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cargo tanks in which the temperature is maintained below the  normal atmospheric temperature by refrigeration or other acceptable  means shall be designed for a pressure of not less than 110 percent of  the vapor pressure corresponding to the temperature of the liquid at  which the system is maintained, or the pressure corresponding to the  greatest dynamic and static loads expected to be encountered in service.  For mechanically stressed relieved cargo tanks, additional factors  relating design pressure and maximum allowable pressure shall be as  specified by the Commandant. The material of the tank shall meet the  material requirements specified in part 54 of this chapter for the  service temperature, and this temperature shall be permanently marked on  the tank as prescribed in Sec.  54.10-20 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The maximum allowable temperature of the cargo is defined as the  boiling temperature of the liquid at a pressure equal to the setting of  the relief valve.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The service temperature is the minimum temperature of a product  at which it may be contained, loaded and/or transported. However, the  service temperature shall in no case be taken higher than given by the  following formula.  tz=tw-0.25(tw-tB)  where: tz = Service temperature. tw = Boiling temperature of gas at normal working pressure of</p><p class="depth3">container but not higher than + 32 [deg]F. tB = Boiling temperature of gas at atmospheric pressure.   Under normal circumstances, only temperatures due to refrigerated  service will be considered in determining the service temperature.  Refrigerated service for purposes of this paragraph is defined as  service where the temperature is controlled in the process rather than  being caused by atmospheric conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Heat transmission studies, where required, shall assume the  minimum ambient temperatures of 0 [deg]F still air and 32 [deg]F still  water, and maximum ambient temperatures of 115 [deg]F still air and 90  [deg]F still water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Where applicable, the design of the cargo tanks shall  investigate the thermal stresses induced in the tanks at the service  temperature.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Calculations showing the stress level in the tanks under dynamic  loading conditions for ocean service barges (see Sec.  151.10-20(b)(4))  and grounding conditions for inland service barges (see Sec.  151.10-20- (b)(2)) shall be submitted to the Commandant for approval. These  calculations shall take into account the local stresses due to the  interaction between the barge hull and the tanks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> High density cargo. Cargoes with a specific gravity greater than  that for which the scantlings of the tank are designed may be carried  provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The maximum cargo weight (tons) in a specific tank does not  exceed the maximum cargo weight (tons) endorsed on the certificate of  inspection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The scantlings of the tank are sufficient to prevent rupture  under a full head of the higher density cargo. Scantlings meeting  ordinary bulkhead requirements for the full head will satisfy this  requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Arrangements--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Collision protection. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Tanks containing  cargoes which are required to be carried in Type I hulls by Table 151.05  shall be located a minimum of 4 feet inboard from the side shell and box  end of the vessel. Tanks containing cargoes which are required to be  carried in Type II   hulls by Table 151.05 shall be located a minimum of 3 feet inboard from  the side shell and box end of the vessel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All independent cargo tanks installed on Type I or Type II  barge hulls shall be protected with suitable collision chocks or  collision straps. A longitudinal collision load of one and one half  times the combined weight of the tank and the cargo shall be assumed.  All other independent cargo tanks shall be provided with suitable  collision chocks or collision straps assuming a longitudinal collision  load equal to the combined weight of the tank and the cargo. The design  bearing stress shall not exceed 2 times the yield strength or 1.5 times  the minimum ultimate strength, whichever is less.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Tanks containing cargoes, which are required to be carried in  Type I or Type II hulls by Table 151.05, shall be located a minimum of  25 feet from the head log at the bow. Box barges and trail barges need  not comply with this requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inspection clearances. The distance between tanks or between a  tank and the vessel's structure shall be such as to provide adequate  access for inspection and maintenance of all tank surfaces and hull  structure; but shall not normally be less than 15 inches except in way  of web frames or similar major structural members where the minimum  clearance shall be equal to the flange or faceplate width.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Access openings. Each tank shall be provided with at least a  15 x 18 diameter manhole, fitted with a cover  located above the maximum liquid level as close as possible to the top  of the tank. Where access trunks are fitted to tanks, the diameter of  the trunks shall be at least 30 inches.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Low temperature protection. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When low temperature cargoes are  to be carried in gravity type tanks at a temperature lower than that for  which the hull steel is adequate, a secondary barrier designed to  contain leaked cargo temporarily shall be provided. The design of the  cargo containment system shall be such that under normal service  conditions, or upon failure of the primary tank, the hull structure  shall not be cooled down to a temperature which is unsafe for the  materials involved. The secondary barrier and structural components of  the hull which may be exposed to low temperatures shall meet the  material requirements (i.e., chemistry and physical properties)  specified in part 54 of this chapter for the service temperature  involved. Heat transmission studies and tests may be required to  demonstrate that the structural material temperatures in the hull are  acceptable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The design shall take into consideration the thermal stresses  induced in the cargo tank at the service temperature during loading.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Where necessary, devices for spray loading or other methods of  precooling or cooling during loading shall be included in the design.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Pressure-vessel type tanks shall be radiographed in accordance  with the requirements of part 54 of this chapter. For gravity type  tanks, all weld intersections or crossings in joints of primary tank  shells shall be radiographed for a distance of 10 thicknesses from the  intersection. All other welding in the primary tank and in the secondary  barrier, shall be spot radiographed in accordance with the requirements  specified in part 54 of this chapter for Class II-L pressure vessels.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> For nonpressure vessel type containment systems, access shall be  arranged to permit inspection one side each of the primary tank and  secondary barrier, under normal shipyard conditions. Containment systems  which, because of their peculiar design, cannot be visually inspected to  this degree, may be specially considered provided an equivalent degree  of safety is attained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Installation of cargo tanks. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cargo tanks shall be supported  on foundations of steel or other suitable material and securely anchored  in place to prevent the tanks from shifting when subjected to external  forces. Each tank shall be supported so as to prevent the concentration  of excessive loads on the supporting portions of the shell or head.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Foundations, and stays where required, shall be designed for  support and constraint of the weight of the full tank, and the dynamic  loads imposed thereon. Thermal movement shall also be considered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Foundations and stays shall be suitable for the temperatures  they will experience at design conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Cargo tanks may be installed ``on deck,'' ``under deck,'' or  with the tanks protruding through the deck. All tanks shall be installed  with the manhole openings located in the open above the weather deck.  Provided an equivalent degree of safety is attained, the Commandant may  approve cargo tanks installed with manhole openings located below the  weather deck. Where a portion of the tank extends above the weather  deck, provision shall be made to maintain the weathertightness of the  deck, except that the weathertightness of the upper deck need not be  maintained on:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Vessels operating on restricted routes which are sufficiently  protected; or,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Open hopper type barges of acceptable design.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> No welding shall be performed on tanks which require and have  been stress relieved unless authorized by the Commandant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Materials. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Materials used in the construction of cargo tanks  shall be suitable for the intended application and shall be in  accordance with the applicable requirements of part 54 of this chapter.  For cargoes carried at low temperatures, the tank supports and  foundations, and portions of the hull which may be exposed to low  temperature, shall also meet the applicable requirements of that part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When required, cargo tanks shall be lined with rubber or other  material acceptable to the Commandant. The interior surfaces of the  cargo tanks shall be made smooth, welds chipped or ground smooth, and  the surfaces thoroughly cleaned before the lining is applied. The lining  material shall be resistive to attack by the cargo, not less elastic  than the metal of the tank proper, and nonporous when tested after  application. It shall be of substantially uniform thickness. The lining  shall be directly bonded to the tank plating, or attached by other  satisfactory means acceptable to the Commandant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Insulation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Insulation, when provided, shall be compatible  with the cargo and the tank materials.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Insulation in a location exposed to possible high temperature or  source of ignition shall be one of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Incombustible, complying with the requirements of Subpart  164.009 of Part 164 of this chapter; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Fire retardant, having a flame spread rating of 50 or less as  determined by ASTM Specification E 84 (incorporated by reference, see  Sec.  151.01-2) (Tunnel Test); or,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Nonburning or ``self-extinguishing'' as determined by ASTM  Specification D 4986, ``Horizontal Burning Characteristics of Cellular  Polymeric Materials'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  151.01-2)  and covered by a steel jacket having a minimum thickness of 18 gauge  (0.0428 inches) (U.S. Standard Gauge) or an equivalent means of  protection acceptable to the Commandant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Insulation in a location protected against high temperature or  source of ignition need satisfy no requirement for combustibility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Insulation shall be impervious to water vapor, or have a vapor- proof coating of a fire-retardant material acceptable to the Commandant.  Unless the vapor barrier is inherently weather resistant, tanks exposed  to the weather shall be fitted with a removable sheet metal jacket of  not less than 18 gauge over the vapor-proof coating and flashed around  all openings so as to be weathertight. Insulation which is not exposed  to the weather when installed on tanks carrying cargoes above ambient  temperatures need not be impervious to water vapor nor be covered with a  vapor-proof coating.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Insulation shall be adequately protected in areas of possible  mechanical damage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Fire exposure protection. Tanks which are provided with fire  exposure protection of one of the following categories may be allowed a  reduction in the size of relief valves.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Approved incombustible insulation meeting the requirements of  subpart 164.007 of part 164 of this chapter which is secured to the tank  with steel bands.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Located in a hold or protected by a self-supporting steel jacket  or cover (such as a hopper cover) of at least 10 gauge (0.1345) for  insulation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Tanks not protected against fire exposure as described in this  paragraph shall not be permitted a reduction in size of relief valves.
