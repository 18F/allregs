                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Permit application submittal timeframe for existing facilities.  </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator of a facility subject to this subpart whose  currently effective permit expires after July 14, 2018, must submit to  the Director the information required in the applicable provisions of 40  CFR 122.21(r) when applying for a subsequent permit (consistent with the  owner or operator's duty to reapply pursuant to 40 CFR 122.21(d)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator of a facility subject to this subpart  whose currently effective permit expires prior to or on July 14, 2018,  may request the Director to establish an alternate schedule for the  submission of the information required in 40 CFR 122.21(r) when applying  for a subsequent permit (consistent with the owner or operator's duty to  reapply pursuant to 40 CFR 122.21(d)). If the owner or operator of the  facility demonstrates that it could not develop the required information  by the applicable date for submission, the Director must establish an  alternate schedule for submission of the required information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Director may waive some or all of the information  requirements of 40 CFR 122.21(r) if the intake is located in a manmade  lake or reservoir and the fisheries are stocked and managed by a State  or Federal natural resources agency or the equivalent. If the manmade  lake or reservoir contains Federally-listed threatened and endangered  species, or is designated critical habitat, such a waiver shall not be  granted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Permit application submittal timeframe for new units. For the  owner or operator of any new unit at an existing facility subject to  this subpart:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must submit the information required in 40 CFR 122.21(r) for  the new unit to the Director no later than 180 days before the planned  commencement of cooling water withdrawals for the operation of the new  unit. If you have already submitted the required information in your  previous permit application, you may choose to submit an update to the  required information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator is encouraged to submit their permit  applications well in advance of the 180 day requirement to avoid delay.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Permit applications. After the initial submission of the 40 CFR  122.21(r) permit application studies after October 14, 2014, the owner  or operator of a facility may, in subsequent permit applications,  request to reduce the information required, if conditions at the  facility and in the waterbody remain substantially unchanged since the  previous application so long as the relevant previously submitted  information remains representative of current source water, intake  structure, cooling water system, and operating conditions. Any habitat  designated as critical or species listed as threatened or endangered  after issuance of the current permit whose range of habitat or  designated critical habit includes waters where a facility intake is  located constitutes potential for a substantial change that must be  addressed by the owner/operator in subsequent permit applications,  unless the facility received an exemption pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 1536(o)  or a permit pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 1539(a) or there is no reasonable  expectation of take. The owner or operator of a facility must submit its  request for reduced cooling water intake structure and waterbody  application information to the Director at least two years and six  months prior to the expiration of its NPDES permit. The owner or  operator's request must identify each element in this subsection that it  determines has not substantially changed since the previous permit  application and the basis for the determination. The Director has the  discretion to accept or reject any part of the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Director has the discretion to request additional  information to supplement the permit application, including a request to  inspect a facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Permit application records. The owner or operator of a facility  must keep records of all submissions that are part of its permit  application until the subsequent permit is issued to document compliance  with the requirements of this section. If the Director approves a  request for reduced permit application studies under Sec. 125.95(a) or  (c) or Sec. 125.98(g), the owner or operator of a facility must keep  records of all submissions that are part of the previous permit  application until the subsequent permit is issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In addition, in developing its permit application, the owner or  operator of an existing facility or new unit at an existing facility  must, based on readily available information at the time of the permit  application, instead of the information required at Sec.  122.21(r)(4)(vi) of this chapter identify all Federally-listed  threatened and endangered species and/or designated critical habitat  that are or may be present in the action area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Certification. The owner or operator of a facility must certify  that its permit application is true, accurate and complete pursuant to  Sec. 122.22(d) of this chapter.</p>
