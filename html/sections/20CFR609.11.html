                                Sec.  609.11  Overpayments; penalties for fraud.

                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> False statements and representations. Section 8507(a) of the Act provides that if a State agency, the Department, or a court of competent jurisdiction finds that an individual--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Knowingly has made, or caused to be made by another, a false statement or representation of a material fact, or knowingly has failed, or caused another to fail, to disclose a material fact; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> As a result of that action has received an amount as UCFE to which the individual was not entitled; the individual shall repay the amount to the State agency or the Department. Instead of requiring repayments, the State agency or the Department may recover the amount by deductions from UCFE payable to the individual during the 2-year period after the date of the finding. A finding by a State agency or the Department may be made only after an opportunity for a fair hearing, subject to such further review as may be appropriate under Sec.  609.7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Prosecution for fraud. Section 1919 of title 18, United States Code, provides that whoever makes a false statement or representation of a material fact knowing it to be false, or knowingly fails to disclose a material fact, to obtain or increase for himself or for any other individual any payment authorized to be paid under chapter 85 of title 5, United States Code, or under an agreement thereunder, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Absence of fraud. If a State agency or court of competent jurisdiction finds that an individual has received a payment of UCFE to which the individual was not entitled under the Act and this part, which was not due to a false statement or representation as provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the individual shall be liable to repay to the applicable State the total sum of the payment to which the individual was not entitled, and the State agency shall take all reasonable measures authorized under any State law or Federal law to recover for the account of the United States the total sum of the payment to which the individual was not entitled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Recovery by offset. (1) The State agency shall recover, insofar as is possible, the amount of any overpayment which is not repaid by the individual, by deductions from any UCFE payable to the individual under the Act and this part, or from any unemployment compensation payable to the individual under any Federal unemployment compensation law administered by the State agency, or from any assistance or allowance payable to the individual with respect to unemployment under any other Federal law administered by the State agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A State agency shall also recover, insofar as is possible, the amount of any overpayment of UCFE made to the individual by another State, by deductions from any UCFE payable by the State agency to the individual under the Act and this part, or from any unemployment compensation payable to the individual under any Federal unemployment compensation law administered by the State agency, or from any assistance or allowance payable to the individual with respect to unemployment under any other Federal law administered by the State agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Recoupment of fraudulent overpayments referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall be limited to the 2-year period stated in that paragraph. Recoupment of fraudulent overpayments referred to in paragraph (b) of this section, and nonfraudulent overpayments referred to in paragraph (c) of this section shall be subject to any time limitation on recoupment provided for in the State law that applies to the case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Debts due the United States. UCFE payable to an individual shall be applied by the State agency for the recovery by offset of any debt due to the United States from the individual, but shall not be applied or used by the State agency in any manner for the payment of any debt of the individual to any State or any other entity or person except pursuant to a court order for child support or alimony in accordance with the law of the State and section 459 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 659.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Application of State law. (1) Except as indicated in paragraph (a) of this section, any provision of State law that may be applied for the recovery of overpayments or prosecution for fraud, and any provision of State law authorizing waiver of recovery of overpayments of unemployment compensation, shall be applicable to UCFE.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of any finding of false statement or representation under the Act and paragraph (a) of this section, or prosecution for fraud under 18 U.S.C. 1919 or pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the individual shall be disqualified or penalized in accordance with the provisions of the applicable State law relating to fraud in connection with a claim for State unemployment compensation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Final decision. Recovery of any overpayment of UCFE shall not be enforced by the State agency until the determination or redetermination establishing the overpayment has become final, or if appeal is taken from the determination or redetermination, until the decision after opportunity for a fair hearing has become final.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Procedural requirements. (1) The provisions of paragraphs (c), (d), and (g)

of Sec.  609.6 shall apply to determinations and redeterminations made pursuant to this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The provisions of Sec.  609.7 shall apply to determinations and redeterminations made pursuant to this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Fraud detection and prevention. Provisions in the procedures of each State with respect to detection and prevention of fraudulent overpayments of UCFE shall be, as a minimum, commensurate with the procedures adopted by the State with respect to State unemployment compensation and consistent with the Secretary's ``Standard for Fraud and Overpayment Detection'' (Employment Security Manual, part V, section 7510 et seq.).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Recovered overpayments. An amount repaid or recouped under this section shall be--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Deposited in the fund from which payment was made, if the repayment was to a State agency; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Returned to the Treasury of the United States and credited to the current applicable appropriation, fund, or account from which payment was made, if the repayment was to the Department.</p>
