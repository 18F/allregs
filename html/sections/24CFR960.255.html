agencies administering temporary assistance for needy families (TANF) and Welfare-to-Work (WTW) programs. The TANF program is not limited to monthly income maintenance, but also includes such benefits and services as one-time payments, wage subsidies and transportation assistance--provided that the total amount over a six-month period is at least $500.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disallowance of increase in annual income--(1) Initial twelve month exclusion. During the cumulative twelve month period beginning on the date a member of a qualified family is first employed or the family first experiences an increase in annual income attributable to employment, the PHA must exclude from annual income (as defined in Sec. 5.609 of this title) of a qualified family any increase in income of the family member as a result of employment over prior income of that family member.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Initial twelve month exclusion.

The disallowance of increased income of an individual family member as provided in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section is limited to a lifetime 48 month period. It only applies for a maximum of twelve months for disallowance under paragraph (b)(1) and a maximum of twelve months for disallowance under paragraph (b)(2), during the 48 month period starting from the initial exclusion under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Inapplicability to admission. The disallowance of increases in income as a result of employment under this section does not apply for purposes of admission to the program (including the determination of income eligibility and income targeting).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Individual Savings Accounts.
