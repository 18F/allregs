                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope and purpose. This subpart applies to all claims filed by  or on behalf of employees of SSA for loss of, or damage to, personal  property incident to their service with SSA under the Military Personnel  and Civilian Employees Claims Act of 1964, as amended, 31 U.S.C. 3721  (MPCECA). A claim must be substantiated and the possession of the  property determined to be reasonable, useful, or proper.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Maximum payment under this part. The maximum amount that can be  paid for any claim under the Act is $40,000 or, in extraordinary  circumstances, $100,000, and property may be replaced in kind at the  discretion of the Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Policy. SSA is not an insurer and does not underwrite all  personal property losses that an employee may sustain incident to  employment. We encourage employees to carry private insurance to the  maximum extent practicable to avoid losses that may not be recoverable  from SSA. The procedures set forth in this subpart are designed to  enable you to obtain the proper amount of compensation from SSA and/or a  private insurer for the loss or damage. If you fail to comply with these  procedures it could reduce or preclude payment of your claim under this  subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Definitions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ``Quarters,'' unless otherwise indicated, means  a house, apartment, or other residence that is an SSA employee's  principal residence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ``State,'' unless otherwise indicated, is defined by  Sec. 404.2(c)(5) of title 20 of the Code of Federal Regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ``SSA Claims Officer'' means the SSA official designated to  determine claims under the MPCECA. The current designee is the Associate  General Counsel for General Law.</p>
