Once a DRG initially  qualifies, the DRG is subject to the criteria specified in paragraphs  (d)(1)(i) through (d)(1)(iv) of this section for each subsequent fiscal  year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of paragraph (c), a discharge is also considered to  be a transfer if it meets the following conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The discharge is assigned to a DRG that contains only cases that  were assigned to a DRG that qualified under this paragraph within the  previous 2 years; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The latter DRG was split or otherwise modified within the  previous 2 fiscal years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For fiscal years beginning with FY 2006, for purposes of  paragraph (c) of this section--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The qualifying DRGs must meet the following criteria using data  from the March 2005 update of the FY 2004 MedPAR file and Version 23.0  of the DRG Definitions Manual (FY 2006):</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The DRG has at least 2,050 total postacute care transfer cases;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> At least 5.5 percent of the cases in the DRG are discharged to  postacute care prior to the geometric mean length of stay for the DRG;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The DRG must have a geometric mean length of stay greater than 3  days;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The DRG is paired with a DRG based on the presence or absence of  a comorbidity or complication or major cardiovascular condition that, it  meets the criteria specified in paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(A) and  (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a DRG did not exist in Version 23.0 of the DRG Definitions  Manual or   a DRG included in Version 23.0 of the DRG Definitions Manual is revised,  the DRG will be a qualifying DRG if it meets the following criteria  based on the version of the DRG Definitions Manual in use when the new  or revised DRG first becomes effective, using the most recent complete  year of MedPAR data:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The total number of discharges to postacute care in the DRG must  equal or exceed the 55th percentile for all DRGs;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The proportion of short-stay discharges to postacute care to  total discharges in the DRG exceeds the 55th percentile for all DRGs;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The DRG is paired with a DRG based on the presence or absence of  a comorbidity or a complication or major cardiovascular condition that  meets the criteria specified under paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(A) and  (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> In the case of MS-DRGs that share the same base MS-DRG, if one  MS-DRG meets the criteria specified under paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) of  this section, every MS-DRG that shares the same base MS-DRG is a  qualifying DRG.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Payment for discharges.

Except as provided in  paragraph (f)(2) or (f)(3) of this section, a hospital that transfers an  inpatient under the circumstances described in paragraph (b) or (c) of  this section, is paid a graduated per diem rate for each day of the  patient's stay in that hospital, not to exceed the amount that would  have been paid under subparts D and M of this part if the patient had  been discharged to another setting. The per diem rate is determined by  dividing the appropriate prospective payment rate (as determined under  subparts D and M of this part) by the geometric mean length of stay for  the specific DRG to which the case is assigned. Payment is graduated by  paying twice the per diem amount for the first day of the stay, and the  per diem amount for each subsequent day, up to the full DRG payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Special rule for DRGs 209, 210, and 211 for fiscal years prior  to FY 2006. For fiscal years prior to FY 2006, a hospital that transfers  an inpatient under the circumstances described in paragraph (c) of this  section and the transfer is assigned to DRGs 209, 210, or 211 is paid as  follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 50 percent of the appropriate prospective payment rate (as  determined under subparts D and M of this part) for the first day of the  stay; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 50 percent of the amount calculated under paragraph (f)(1) of  this section for each day of the stay, up to the full DRG payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Transfer assigned to DRG for newborns that die or are  transferred to another hospital. If a transfer is classified into CMS  DRG 385 (Neonates, Died or Transferred) prior to October 1, 2007, or  into MS-DRG 789 (Neonates, Died or Transferred to Another Acute Care  Facility) on or after October 1, 2007, the transferring hospital is paid  in accordance with Sec. 412.2(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Outliers. Effective with discharges occurring on or after  October 1, 1984, a transferring hospital may qualify for an additional  payment for extraordinarily high-cost cases that meet the criteria for  cost outliers as described in subpart F of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Special rule for DRGs meeting specific criteria. For discharges  occurring on or after October 1, 2005, and prior to October 1, 2007, a  hospital that transfers an inpatient under the circumstances described  in paragraph (c) of this section is paid using the provisions of  paragraphs (f)(2)(i) and (f)(2)(ii) of this section if the transfer case  is assigned to one of the DRGs meeting the following criteria:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> or  (d)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The average charges of the 1-day discharge cases in the DRG  must be at least 50 percent of the average charges for all cases in the  DRG; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The geometric mean length of stay for the DRG is greater than  4 days; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If a DRG is paired with a DRG based on the presence or absence  of a comorbidity or complication or a major cardiovascular complication  that meets the criteria specified in   paragraphs (f)(5)(i) through (f)(5)(iii) of this section, that DRG will  also be paid under the provisions of paragraphs (f)(2)(i) and (f)(2)(ii)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Special rule for DRGs meeting specific criteria. For discharges  occurring on or after October 1, 2007, a hospital that transfers an  inpatient under the circumstances described in paragraph (c) of this  section is paid using the provisions of paragraphs (f)(2)(i) and  (f)(2)(ii) of this section if the transfer case is assigned to one of  the DRGs meeting the following criteria:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> or  (d)(3)(ii) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The average charges of the 1-day discharge cases in the DRG  must be at least 50 percent of the average charges for all cases in the  DRG; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The geometric mean length of stay for the DRG is greater than  4 days.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If a DRG is part of an MS-DRG group that meets the criteria  specified in paragraphs (f)(6)(i) through (f)(6)(iii) of this section,  that DRG will also be paid under the provisions of paragraphs (f)(2)(i)  and (f)(2)(ii) of this section.
