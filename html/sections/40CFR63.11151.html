                            <p class="depth0">Terms used in this subpart are defined in the CAA, in 40 CFR 63.2, and in this section as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Anode refining department means the area at a primary copper smelter in which anode copper refining operations are performed. Emissions sources in the anode refining department include

anode refining furnaces and anode shaft furnaces.</p><p class="depth0">Baghouse means a control device that collects particulate matter by filtering the gas stream through bags. A baghouse is also referred to as a ``fabric filter.''</p><p class="depth0">Bag leak detection system means a system that is capable of continuously monitoring relative particulate matter (dust) loadings in the exhaust of a baghouse in order to detect bag leaks and other upset conditions. A bag leak detection system includes, but is not limited to, an instrument that operates on triboelectric, light scattering, transmittance or other effect to continuously monitor relative particulate matter loadings.</p><p class="depth0">Batch copper converter means a converter in which molten copper matte is charged and then oxidized to form blister copper by a process that is performed in discrete batches using a sequence of charging, blowing, skimming, and pouring.</p><p class="depth0">Capture system means the collection of components used to capture gases and fumes released from one or more emissions points and then convey the captured gas stream to a control device. A capture system may include, but is not limited to, the following components as applicable to a given capture system design: Duct intake devices, hoods, enclosures, ductwork, dampers, manifolds, plenums, and fans.</p><p class="depth0">Charging means the operating mode for a batch copper converter during which molten or solid material is added into the vessel.</p><p class="depth0">Control device means air pollution control equipment used to remove PM from a gas stream.</p><p class="depth0">Converting vessel means a furnace, reactor, or other type of vessel in which copper matte is oxidized to form blister copper.</p><p class="depth0">Copper concentrate means copper ore that has been beneficiated to increase its copper content.</p><p class="depth0">Copper concentrate dryer means a vessel in which copper concentrates are heated in the presence of air to reduce the moisture content of the material. Supplemental copper-bearing feed materials and fluxes may be added or mixed with the copper concentrates fed to a copper concentrate dryer.</p><p class="depth0">Copper concentrate feed means the mixture of copper concentrate, secondary copper-bearing materials, recycled slags and dusts, fluxes, and other materials blended together for feeding to the smelting vessel.</p><p class="depth0">Copper matte means a material predominately composed of copper and iron sulfides produced by smelting copper ore concentrates.</p><p class="depth0">Deviation means any instance in which an affected source subject to this subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Fails to meet any requirement or obligation established by this subpart, including but not limited to any emissions limitation or work practice standard;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Fails to meet any term or condition that is adopted to implement an applicable requirement in this subpart and that is included in the operating permit for any affected source required to obtain such a permit; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Fails to meet any emissions limitation or work practice standard in this subpart during startup, shutdown, or malfunction, regardless of whether or not such failure is permitted by this subpart.</p><p class="depth2">Holding means the operating mode for a batch copper converter or a holding furnace associated with a smelting furnace during which the molten bath is maintained in the vessel but no blowing or smelting is performed nor is material added into or removed from the vessel.</p><p class="depth2">Matte drying and grinding plant means the area at a primary copper smelter in which wet granulated matte copper is ground in a mill, dried by blowing heated air through the mill, and then separated from the drying air stream using a control device such as a baghouse.</p><p class="depth2">Pouring means the operating mode for a batch copper converter during which molten copper is removed from the vessel.</p><p class="depth2">Primary copper smelter means any installation or any intermediate process engaged in the production of copper from copper sulfide ore concentrates through the use of pyrometallurgical techniques.</p><p class="depth2">Responsible official means responsible official as defined at 40 CFR 70.2.</p><p class="depth2">Secondary gas system means a capture system that collects the gases and fumes released when removing and transferring molten materials from one or more vessels using tapping ports, launders, and other openings in the vessels. Examples of molten material include, but are not limited to: Copper matte, slag, and blister copper.</p><p class="depth2">Skimming means the batch copper converter operating mode during which molten slag is removed from the vessel.</p><p class="depth2">Smelting vessel means a furnace, reactor, or other type of vessel in which copper ore concentrate and fluxes are smelted to form a molten mass of material containing copper matte and slag. Other copper-bearing materials may also be charged to the smelting vessel.</p><p class="depth2">Work practice standard means any design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard, or combination thereof.</p>
