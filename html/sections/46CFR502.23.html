                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Upon filing of a complaint instituting proceedings or filing of  an answer to an order or complaint, the party filing shall notify the  Commission of the name(s), address(es), telephone number(s), and email  address(es) of the person or persons who will represent the party in the  pending proceeding. Each person who appears in a representative capacity  in a proceeding must deliver a written notice of appearance to the  Secretary stating for whom the appearance is made. Such notice must  indicate whether the representative wishes to be notified of notices,  orders and decisions by either email or facsimile transmission. All  appearances shall be noted in the record. Motions for leave to intervene  must indicate the name(s), address(es), telephone number(s), and email  address(es) of the person or persons who will represent the intervenor  in the pending proceeding if the motion is granted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A Notice of Appearance should follow the form set forth in  Exhibit No. 1 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An attorney must represent in the Notice of Appearance that he  is admitted to practice and in good standing. A non-attorney must  describe his or her authority to act in such capacity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If an attorney or other representative of record is superseded,  there shall be filed a stipulation of substitution signed both by the  attorney(s) or representative(s) and by the party,   or a written notice from the party to the Commission with a Notice of  Appearance included. Substitution of counsel or representative will not,  by itself, be considered good cause for delaying a proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If an attorney wishes to withdraw from representing a party, and  written consent is not obtained, or if the party is not otherwise  represented, the withdrawing attorney shall file an appropriate motion  seeking permission to withdraw and provide appropriate reasons for  making the motion. Such motion will be decided in consideration of the  factors and standards set forth in Rule 1.16 of the American Bar  Association's Model Rules of Professional Conduct and by the courts.  [Rule 23.]  [64 FR 7807, Feb. 17, 1999, as amended at 78 FR 45069, July 26, 2013]</p>
