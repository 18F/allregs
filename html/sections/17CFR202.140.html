                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Board or PCAOB means the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Registered public accounting firm or Firm shall have the meaning set forth in 15 U.S.C. 7201(a)(12).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Associated person means a person associated with the registered public accounting firm as defined in 15 U.S.C. 7201(a)(9).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reviewable matters. A registered public accounting firm may request interim Commission review of an assessment or determination by the PCAOB contained in an inspection report prepared under 15 U.S.C. 7214 and relating to that firm, if the firm:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Has provided the PCAOB with a response, pursuant to the rules of the PCAOB, to the substance of particular items in a draft inspection report and disagrees with the assessments relating to those items contained in any final inspection report prepared by the PCAOB following such response;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disagrees with an assessment contained in any final inspection report that was not contained in the draft inspection report provided to the firm under 15 U.S.C. 7214(f) or the rules of the PCAOB; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disagrees with the determination of the PCAOB that criticisms or defects in the quality control systems of the firm that were identified in an inspection report, but not disclosed to the public, have not been addressed to the satisfaction of the PCAOB within 12 months after the date of that inspection report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedures for requesting interim Commission review. (1) A request for interim Commission review with respect to matters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be submitted to the Commission's Office of the Secretary within 30 calendar days of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A request for interim Commission review with respect to matters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be submitted to the Commission's Office of the Secretary within 30 calendar days of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date the firm is provided a copy of the final inspection report described in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date the firm receives notice of the PCAOB's determination described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The PCAOB shall not make publicly available the final inspection report or criticisms or defects in the quality control systems of the firm subject to a determination described in paragraph (b) of this section, as applicable, during the 30-day period during which the firm may request interim Commission review, unless the firm consents in writing to earlier publication of the report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A request for interim Commission review (``request'' or ``submission'') must be marked ``Request for Interim Commission Review With Respect to PCAOB Inspection Report.'' The request must focus on the specific matters for which relief is requested and succinctly address the issues raised by the PCAOB. The request, to the extent possible, should include, for example:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A copy of the particular inspection report that is the subject of the request;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The specific assessments or determinations that are the subject of the request;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The alleged errors or deficiencies in the PCAOB's assessments or determination and the reasons for the firm's position;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the matter is being reviewed under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, any actions taken by the registered public accounting firm to address criticisms or defects identified in the inspection report; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any supporting documentation relevant to the review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The firm must provide a copy of its review request to the PCAOB simultaneously with its submission to the Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A timely review request by a firm will operate as a stay of publication of those portions of the final inspection report or criticisms or defects in the quality control systems of the firm subject to a determination described in paragraph (b) of this section, as applicable, that are the subject of the firm's review request, unless the Commission otherwise determines in its own discretion. Upon expiration of the 30-day period during which the firm may request interim Commission review, the PCAOB shall make publicly available the remainder of the final inspection report or criticisms or defects in the quality control systems of the firm that were indentified in an inspection report, as applicable, that are not the subject of the firm's review request, unless the Commission otherwise determines that such a result would not be necessary or appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the firm fails to make a timely review request, pursuant to Section 104(g)(2) of the Act, the PCAOB shall make publicly available the final inspection report or criticisms or defects in the quality control systems of the

firm that were indentified in an inspection report, as applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedures for granting or denying the review request. Within 30 calendar days of a timely review request, the Commission will notify the firm and the PCAOB as to whether the Commission will exercise its discretion to grant the request for an interim review. If the Commission does not grant the review request, the stay of publication is terminated upon notification to the firm and the PCAOB. If the Commission does grant the review request, the stay of publication shall continue unless the Commission determines otherwise in its own discretion, or unless the firm consents in writing to the PCAOB, with a copy to the Commission, to earlier publication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Procedures where a review request has been granted. (1) Where the Commission has notified the firm and the PCAOB that it is granting the request for an interim review, the PCAOB may submit responsive information and documents with the Commission within 15 calendar days of receipt of such notice. The PCAOB must provide a copy of such information and documents simultaneously to the firm.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where the Commission has notified the firm and the PCAOB that it is granting the request for an interim review, the PCAOB may submit responsive information and documents with the Commission within 15 calendar days of receipt of such notice. The PCAOB must provide a copy of such information and documents simultaneously to the firm.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> During the course of the interim review, the Commission may request additional information relating to the PCAOB's assessments or determination under review, and provide a period of up to seven calendar days to respond to such request, from the PCAOB, the firm, and any associated person of the firm. The Commission may grant the firm or the PCAOB a period of up to seven calendar days to respond to any information obtained pursuant to this paragraph. The firm or the PCAOB, as applicable, shall provide simultaneously to the other party all information provided as a result of a request for additional information or responses thereto. The firm with which any associated person from whom information is requested shall provide simultaneously to the PCAOB all information provided as a result of a request for additional information or responses thereto. If the firm (including any associated person) or the PCAOB fails to respond timely to a request from the Commission, such failure may serve as the basis for the Commission to conclude its review and make a determination adverse to the non-responsive party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Commission, based on the information submitted by the firm, the PCAOB and any associated persons, shall consider whether the PCAOB's assessments or determination are arbitrary and capricious, or otherwise not consistent with the purposes of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> At the conclusion of its review, the Commission shall inform the firm and the PCAOB in writing that the Commission:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Does not object to all or part of the assessments or determination of the PCAOB and the stay of publication is terminated; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Remands to the PCAOB with instructions that the stay of publication is permanent or that the PCAOB take such other actions as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate with respect to publication, including, but not limited to, revising the final inspection report or determinations before publication.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The review pursuant to this section shall be completed and a written notice pursuant to this section shall be sent no more than 75 calendar days after notification to the firm and the PCAOB that the Commission is granting the request for an interim review, unless the Commission extends the period for good cause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Treatment of review. (1) Time periods in this section shall be computed as provided in the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 CFR 201.160.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Time periods in this section shall be computed as provided in the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 CFR 201.160.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unless otherwise determined by the Commission, the decision to grant or deny a review request and the conclusions of the Commission's review shall be non-public, and the information or documents submitted, created, or obtained by the Commission or its staff in the course of the review shall be deemed non-public. Nothing in this rule shall be construed to impair or limit the ability of any party to request confidential treatment under the Freedom of Information Act, 15 U.S.C. 7215(b)(5), or any other applicable law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 7214(h)(2), any decision of the Commission as a result of an interim review with respect

to a PCAOB inspection report, including whether a request for review is granted or denied, shall not be reviewable under 15 U.S.C. 78y and shall not be deemed to be ``final agency action'' for purposes of 5 U.S.C. 704.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any action taken by the Commission relates solely to the publication of the relevant inspection report and does not affect the ability of the Commission or PCAOB to take appropriate action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Designation of address; Representation. (1) When a registered public accounting firm first submits a request for interim Commission review, or an associated person first submits information related to a request, the firm or associated person shall submit to the Commission, and keep current, an address at which any notice or other written communication furnished to the firm or associated person may be sent, a contact name and telephone number where the firm or associated person may be reached during business hours and, if represented, the representative's name, business address, and telephone number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When a registered public accounting firm first submits a request for interim Commission review, or an associated person first submits information related to a request, the firm or associated person shall submit to the Commission, and keep current, an address at which any notice or other written communication furnished to the firm or associated person may be sent, a contact name and telephone number where the firm or associated person may be reached during business hours and, if represented, the representative's name, business address, and telephone number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the firm, PCAOB, or associated person will be represented by a representative, the initial submission of that person shall be accompanied by the notice of appearance required by Sec. 201.102(d). The other provisions of Sec. 201.102 with respect to representation before the Commission shall apply.
