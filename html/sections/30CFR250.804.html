                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Inspection and testing. The safety-system devices shall be successfully inspected and tested by the lessee at the interval specified below or more frequently if operating conditions warrant. Testing must be in accordance with API RP 14C, Appendix D (as incorporated by reference in Sec.  250.198), and the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Testing requirements for subsurface safety devices are as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each surface-controlled subsurface safety device installed in a well, including such devices in shut-in and injection wells, shall be tested in place for proper operation when installed or reinstalled and thereafter at intervals not exceeding 6 months. If the device does not operate properly, or if a liquid leakage rate in excess of 200 cubic centimeters per minute or a gas leakage rate in excess of 5 cubic feet per minute is observed, the device shall be removed, repaired and reinstalled, or replaced. Testing shall be in accordance with API RP 14B (as incorporated by reference in Sec.  250.198) to ensure proper operation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each subsurface-controlled SSSV installed in a well shall be removed, inspected, and repaired or adjusted, as necessary, and reinstalled or replaced at intervals not exceeding 6 months for those valves not installed in a landing nipple and 12 months for those valves installed in a landing nipple.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Each tubing plug installed in a well shall be inspected for leakage by opening the well to possible flow at intervals not exceeding 6 months. If a liquid leakage rate in excess of 200 cubic centimeters per minute or a gas leakage rate in excess of 5 cubic feet per minute is observed, the device shall be removed, repaired and reinstalled, or replaced. An additional tubing plug may be installed in lieu of removal.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Injection valves shall be tested in the manner as outlined for testing tubing plugs in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section. Leakage rates outlined in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section shall apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All PSV's shall be tested for operation at least once every 12 months. These valves shall be either bench-tested or equipped to permit testing with an external pressure source. Weighted disk vent valves used as PSV's on atmospheric tanks may be disassembled and inspected in lieu of function testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The following safety devices (excluding electronic pressure transmitters and level sensors) must be tested at least once each calendar month, but at no time will more than 6 weeks elapse between tests:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All PSH and PSL,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All LSH and LSL controls,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> All automatic inlet SDV's which are actuated by a sensor on a vessel or compressor, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> All SDV's in liquid discharge lines and actuated by vessel low-level sensors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The following electronic pressure transmitters and level sensors must be tested at least once every 3 months, but at no time may more than 120 days elapse between tests:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All PSH and PSL, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All LSH and LSL controls.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> All SSV's and USV's shall be tested for operation and for leakage at least once each calendar month, but at no time shall more than 6 weeks elapse between tests. The SSV's and USV's must be tested in accordance with the test procedures specified in API RP 14H (as incorporated by reference in Sec.  250.198). If the SSV or USV does not operate properly or if any fluid flow is observed during the leakage test, the valve shall be repaired or replaced.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> All flowline Flow Safety Valves (FSV) shall be checked for leakage at least once each calendar month, but at no time shall more than 6 weeks elapse between tests. The FSV's must be tested for leakage in accordance with the test procedures specified in API RP 14C, Appendix D, section D4, table D2, subsection D (as incorporated by reference in Sec.  250.198). If the leakage measured exceeds a liquid flow of 200 cubic centimeters per minute or a gas flow of 5 cubic feet per minute, the FSV's shall be repaired or replaced.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The TSH shutdown controls installed on compressor installations which can be nondestructively tested shall be tested every 6 months and repaired or replaced as necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> All pumps for firewater systems shall be inspected and operated weekly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> All fire- (flame, heat, or smoke) detection systems shall be tested for operation and recalibrated every 3 months provided that testing can be performed in a nondestructive manner. Open flame or devices operating at temperatures which could ignite a methane-air mixture shall not be used. All combustible gas-detection systems shall be calibrated every 3 months.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> All TSH devices shall be tested at least once every 12 months, excluding those addressed in paragraph (a)(7) of this section and those which would be destroyed by testing. Burner safety low and flow safety low devices shall also be tested at least once every 12 months.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> The ESD shall be tested for operation at least once each calendar month, but at no time shall more than 6 weeks elapse between tests. The test shall be conducted by alternating ESD stations monthly to close at least one wellhead SSV and verify a surface-controlled SSSV closure for that well as indicated by control circuitry actuation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Prior to the commencement of production, the lessee shall notify the District Manager when the lessee is ready to conduct a preproduction test and inspection of the integrated safety system. The lessee shall also notify the District Manager upon commencement of production in order that a complete inspection may be conducted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Records. The lessee shall maintain records for a period of 2 years for each subsurface and surface safety device installed. These records shall be maintained by the lessee at the lessee's field office nearest the OCS facility or other locations conveniently available to the District Manager. These records shall be available for review by a representative of BSEE. The records shall show the present status and history of each device, including dates and details of

installation, removal, inspection, testing, repairing, adjustments, and reinstallation.</p>
