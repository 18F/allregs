If a Customs power of attorney is not on a  Customs Form 5291, it shall be either a general power of attorney with  unlimited authority or a limited power of attorney as explicit in its  terms and executed in the same manner as a Customs Form 5291. The  following is an example of an acceptable general power of attorney with  unlimited authority:</p><p class="depth0">KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS, THAT  --------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">(Name of principal) ---------------------------------------- , (State legal designation, such as corporation, individual, etc.)  residing at ------------------------------ and doing business under the  laws of the State of ------------, hereby appoints______________________ ________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">(Name, legal designation, and address) as a true and lawful agent and attorney of the principal named above  with full power and authority to do and perform every lawful act and  thing the said agent and attorney may deem requisite and necessary to be  done for and on behalf of the said principal without limitation of any  kind as fully as said principal could do if present and acting, and  hereby ratify and confirm all that said agent and attorney shall  lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue of these presents until and  including ------------, (date) or until notice of revocation in writing  is duly given before that date.</p><p class="depth0">Date --------------------, 19----;. ________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">(Principal's signature)</p>
