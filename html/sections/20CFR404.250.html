                            <p class="depth0">If you were disabled at some time in your life, received disability  insurance benefits, and those benefits were terminated because you  recovered from your disability or because you engaged in substantial  gainful activity, special rules apply in computing your primary  insurance amount when you become eligible after 1978 for old-age  insurance benefits or if you become re-entitled to disability insurance  benefits or die. (For purposes of Secs. 404.250 through 404.252, we use  the term second entitlement to refer to this situation.) There are two  sets of rules:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Second entitlement within 12 months. If 12 months or fewer pass  between the last month for which you received a disability insurance  benefit and your second entitlement, see the rules in Sec. 404.251; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Second entitlement after more than 12 months. If more than 12  months pass between the last month for which you received a disability  insurance benefit and your second entitlement, see the rules in  Sec. 404.252.</p>
