                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Production. (1) Effective January 21, 2003, no person may produce class II controlled substances for which EPA has apportioned baseline production and consumption allowances, in excess of the quantity of unexpended production allowances, unexpended Article 5 allowances, unexpended export production allowances, or conferred unexpended HCFC-141b exemption allowances held by that person for that substance under the authority of this subpart at that time in that control period, unless the substances are transformed or destroyed domestically or by a person of another Party, or unless they are produced using an exemption granted in paragraph (f) of this section. Every kilogram of excess production constitutes a separate violation of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effective January 21, 2003, no person may use production allowances to produce a quantity of class II controlled substance unless that person holds under the authority of this subpart at the same time consumption allowances sufficient to cover that quantity of class II controlled substances. No person may use consumption allowances to produce a quantity of class II controlled substances unless the person holds under authority of this subpart at the same time production allowances sufficient to cover that quantity of class II controlled substances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Import. (1) Effective January 21, 2003, no person may import class II controlled substances (other than transhipments, heels or used class II controlled substances) for which EPA has apportioned baseline production and consumption allowances , in excess of the quantity of unexpended consumption allowances, or conferred unexpended HCFC-141b exemption allowances held by that person under the authority of this subpart at that time in that control period, unless the substances are for use in a process resulting in their transformation or their destruction, or unless they are produced using an exemption granted in paragraph (f) of this section. Every kilogram of excess import constitutes a separate violation of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effective January 21, 2003, no person may import, at any time in any control period, a used class II controlled substance for which EPA has apportioned baseline production and consumption allowances, without having submitted a petition to the Administrator and received a non-objection notice in accordance with Sec. 82.24(c)(3) and (4). A person issued a non-objection notice for the import of an individual shipment of used class II controlled substances may not transfer or confer the right to import, and may not import any more than the exact quantity (in kilograms) of the used class II controlled substance stated in the non-objection notice. Every kilogram of import of used class II controlled substance in excess of the quantity stated in the non-objection notice issued by the Administrator in accordance with Sec. 82.24(c)(3) and (4) constitutes a separate violation of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Production with Article 5 allowances. No person may introduce into U.S. interstate commerce any class II controlled substance produced with Article 5 allowances, except for export to an Article 5 Party as listed in Appendix E of this subpart. Every kilogram of a class II controlled substance produced with Article 5 allowances that is introduced into interstate commerce other than for export to an Article 5 Party constitutes a separate violation under this subpart. No person may export any class II controlled substance produced with Article 5 allowances to a non-Article 5 Party. Every kilogram of a class II controlled substance that was produced with Article 5 allowances that is exported to a non-Article 5 Party constitutes a separate violation under this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Production with export production allowances. No person may introduce into U.S. interstate commerce any class II controlled substance produced with export production allowances. Every kilogram of a class II controlled substance that was produced with export production allowances that is introduced into U.S. interstate commerce constitutes a separate violation under this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Trade with Parties.
