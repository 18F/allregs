                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Employee solicitations shall be conducted during duty hours  using methods that permit true voluntary giving and shall reserve to the  individual the option of disclosing any gift or keeping it confidential.  Campaign kick-offs, victory events, awards, and other non-solicitation  events to build support for the CFC are encouraged.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Special CFC events are permitted during the campaign if approved  by the appropriate agency head or government official, consistent with  agency ethics regulations. No costs for food or entertainment at a  special event may be charged to the CFC. CFC special events must be  undertaken in the spirit of generating interest in the CFC and be open  to all individuals without regard to whether an individual participates  in the CFC. If prizes are offered, they must be modest in nature and  value. Examples of appropriate prizes may include opportunities for  lunch with agency officials, agency parking spaces for a specific time  period, and gifts of minimal financial value. Any special CFC event and  associated prize or gift must be approved in advance by the Agency's  ethics official to ensure that the special event is consistent with  Office of Government Ethics regulations and its own regulations and  policy. No funds may be raised or collected at these events.</p>
