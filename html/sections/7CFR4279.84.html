                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Agency may issue a replacement Loan Note Guarantee or  Assignment Guarantee Agreement which was lost, stolen, destroyed,  mutilated, or defaced to the lender or holder upon receipt of an  acceptable certificate of loss and an indemnity bond.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When a Loan Note Guarantee or Assignment Guarantee Agreement is  lost, stolen, destroyed, mutilated, or defaced while in the custody of  the lender or holder, the lender will coordinate the activities of the  party who seeks the replacement documents and will submit the required  documents to the Agency for processing. The requirements for replacement  are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A certificate of loss, notarized and containing a jurat, which  includes:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Name and address of owner;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Name and address of the lender of record;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Capacity of person certifying;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Full identification of the Loan Note Guarantee or Assignment  Guarantee Agreement including the name of the borrower, the Agency's  case number, date of the Loan Note Guarantee or Assignment Guarantee  Agreement, face amount of the evidence of debt purchased, date of  evidence of debt, present balance of the loan, percentage of guarantee,  and, if an Assignment Guarantee Agreement, the original named holder and  the percentage of the guaranteed portion of the loan assigned to that  holder. Any existing parts of the document to be replaced must be  attached to the certificate;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A full statement of circumstances of the loss, theft, or  destruction of the Loan Note Guarantee or Assignment Guarantee  Agreement; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> For the holder, evidence demonstrating current ownership of the  Loan Note Guarantee and Note or the Assignment Guarantee Agreement. If  the present holder is not the same as the original holder, a copy of the  endorsement of each successive holder in the chain of transfer from the  initial holder to present holder must be included if in existence. If  copies of the endorsement cannot be obtained, best available records of  transfer must be submitted to the Agency (e.g., order confirmation,  canceled checks, etc.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An indemnity bond acceptable to the Agency shall accompany the  request for replacement except when the holder is the United States, a  Federal Reserve Bank, a Federal corporation, a State or territory, or  the District of Columbia. The bond shall be with surety except when the  outstanding principal balance and accrued interest due the present  holder is less than $1 million verified by the lender in writing in a  letter of certification of balance due. The surety shall be a qualified  surety company holding a certificate of authority from the Secretary of  the Treasury and listed in Treasury Department Circular 580.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All indemnity bonds must be issued and payable to the United  States of America acting through the USDA. The bond shall be in an  amount not less than the unpaid principal and interest. The bond shall  hold USDA harmless against any claim or demand which might arise or  against any damage, loss, costs, or expenses which might be sustained or  incurred by reasons of the loss or replacement of the instruments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In those cases where the guaranteed loan was closed under the  provision of the multinote system, the Agency will not attempt to  obtain, or participate in the obtaining of, replacement notes from the  borrower. It will be the responsibility of the holder to bear costs of  note replacement if the borrower agrees to issue a replacement  instrument. Should such note be replaced, the terms of the note cannot  be changed. If the evidence of debt has been lost, stolen, destroyed,  mutilated or defaced, such evidence of debt must be replaced before the  Agency will replace any instruments.    Sec. Sec. 4279.85-4279.99  [Reserved]</p>
