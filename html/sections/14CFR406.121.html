                            <p class="depth0">Before an appeal is filed with the FAA decisionmaker, the parties  may seek an extension of time as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Extension of time by agreement of the parties. The parties may  agree to extend for a reasonable period of time for filing a document  under this subpart with the agreement of the administrative law judge.  The party seeking the extension of time must submit a draft order to the  administrative law judge for signature, file it with the Federal Docket  Management System, and serve it on each party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Motion for extension of time. If the parties do not agree to an  extension of time for filing a document, a party desiring an extension  may file with the Federal Docket Management System and serve a written  motion for an extension of time not later than 7 days before the  document is due unless good cause for the late filing is shown. The  administrative law judge may grant the extension of time if good cause  for the extension is shown.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Failure to rule. If the administrative law judge fails to rule  on a written motion for an extension of time by the date the document is  due, the motion for an extension of time is granted for   no more than 20 days after the original date the document was to be  filed.
