Sec. 75.1714, 75.1714-1, 75.1714-2, and 75.1714-3 of this part, the mine operator shall provide the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At least one additional SCSR, which provides protection for a period of one hour or longer, for each person at a fixed underground work location.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Additional SCSRs along the normal travel routes for pumpers, examiners, and other persons who do not have a fixed work location to be stored at a distance an average miner could walk in 30 minutes. The SCSR storage locations shall be determined by using one of the methods found under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additional SCSRs on mantrips. If a mantrip or mobile equipment is used to enter or exit the mine, at least one additional SCSR, which provides protection for a period of one hour or longer, shall be available for each person who uses such transportation from portal to portal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Additional SCSRs in escapeways. When each person underground cannot safely evacuate the mine within 30 minutes, the mine operator shall provide additional SCSRs stored in each required escapeway.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each storage location shall contain at least one SCSR, which provides protection for a period of one hour or longer, for every person who will be inby that location.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Storage locations shall be spaced along each escapeway at 30-minute travel distances no greater than the distances determined by--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Calculating the distance an average miner walks in 30 minutes by using the time necessary for each miner in a sample of typical miners to walk a typical length of each escapeway; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Using the SCSR storage location spacing specified in the following table, except for escapeways with grades over 5 percent.

A sign made of reflective material with the words ``SCSRs'' or ``SELF-RESCUERS'' shall be conspicuously posted at each storage location. Direction signs made of a reflective material shall be posted leading to each storage location.
