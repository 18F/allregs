See  32.1110(d) for instructions for use of the appropriate clause when  payment under a written contract will be made through use of the card.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Governmentwide commercial purchase card may be used to--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Make micro-purchases;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Place a task or delivery order (if authorized in the basic  contract, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchase agreement); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Make payments, when the contractor agrees to accept payment by  the card (but see 32.1108(b)(2)).
