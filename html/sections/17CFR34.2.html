Commodity-independent component  means the component of a hybrid instrument, the payments of which do not  result from indexing to, or calculation by reference to, the price of a  commodity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Commodity-independent value. Commodity-independent value means  the present value of the payments attributable to the commodity- independent component calculated as of the time of issuance of the  hybrid instrument.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Commodity-dependent component. A commodity-dependent component  means a component of a hybrid instrument, the payment of which results  from indexing to, or calculation by reference to, the price of a  commodity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Commodity-dependent value. For purposes of application of Rule  34.3(a)(2), a commodity-dependent value means the value of a commodity  dependent-component, which when decomposed into an option payout or  payouts, is measured by the absolute net value of the put option premia  with strike prices less than or equal to the reference price plus the  absolute net value of the call option premia with strike prices greater  than or equal to the reference price, calculated as of the time of  issuance of the hybrid instrument.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Option premium. Option premium means the value of an option on  the referenced commodity of the hybrid instrument, and calculated using  the same method as that used to determine the issue price of the  instrument, or where such premia are not explicitly calculated in  determining the issue price of the instrument, the value of such options  calculated using a commercially reasonable method appropriate to the  instrument being priced.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Reference price. A reference price means a price nearest the  current spot or forward price, whichever is used to price instrument, at  which a commodity-dependent payment becomes non-zero, or, in the case  where two potential reference prices exist, the price that results in  the greatest commodity-dependent value.</p>
