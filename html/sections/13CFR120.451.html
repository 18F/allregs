                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An SBA field office serving the area in which a Lender's office is located can nominate the Lender, or a Lender can request a field office to consider it for PLP status. The SBA field office will forward its recommendation to an SBA centralized loan processing center which will submit its recommendation and supporting documentation to the appropriate Office of Capital Access official in accordance with Delegations of Authority for final decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In making its decision, SBA considers whether the Lender:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Has the required ability to process, close, service and liquidate loans;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Has the ability to develop and analyze complete loan packages; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Has satisfactory SBA performance, as determined by SBA in its discretion. The Lender's Risk Rating, among other factors, will be considered in determining satisfactory SBA performance. Other factors may include, but are not limited to, on-site review/examination assessments, historical performance measures (like default rate, purchase rate and loss rate), loan volume to the extent that it impacts performance measures, and other performance related measurements and information (such as contribution toward SBA mission).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Before it can operate as a PLP Lender, the approved Lender must execute a Supplemental Guarantee Agreement, which will specify a term not to exceed two years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When a PLP's Supplemental Guarantee Agreement expires, SBA may recertify it as a PLP Lender for an additional term not to exceed two years. Prior to recertification, SBA will review a PLP Lender's loans, policies and procedures. The recertification decision is made by the appropriate Office of Capital Access official in accordance with Delegations of Authority and is final.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When a PLP Lender's Supplemental Guaranty Agreement expires, SBA may recertify the Lender as a PLP Lender for an additional term not to exceed two years. Prior to recertification, SBA will review a PLP Lender's loans, policies, procedures, SBA performance, Risk Rating, review or examination results, and other risk related information as determined by SBA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A PLP Lender may request an expansion of the territory in which it can process PLP loans by submitting its request to a loan processing center. The center will obtain the recommendation of each SBA office in the area into which the PLP Lender would like to expand its PLP operations. The center

will forward the recommendations to the D/FA for final decision. If a PLP Lender is not a CLP Lender in a territory into which it seeks to expand its PLP status, it automatically obtains CLP status in that territory when it is granted PLP status for the territory.
