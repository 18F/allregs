                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, if the intermediary, carrier, or CMS has determined that an offset or recoupment of payments under Sec. 405.371(a)(2) should be put into effect, the Medicare contractor must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notify the provider or supplier of its intention to offset or recoup payment, in whole or in part, and the reasons for making the offset or recoupment; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Give the provider or supplier an opportunity for rebuttal in accordance with Sec. 405.374.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply if the intermediary, after furnishing a provider a written notice of the amount of program reimbursement in accordance with Sec. 405.1803, recoups payment under paragraph (c) of Sec. 405.1803. (For provider rights in this circumstance, see Sec. Sec. 405.1809, 405.1811, 405.1815, 405.1835, and 405.1843.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Actions following receipt of rebuttal statement. If a provider or supplier submits, in accordance with Sec. 405.374, a statement as to why an offset or recoupment should not be put into effect on the date specified in the notice, the Medicare contractor must comply with the time limits and notification requirements of Sec. 405.375.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No rebuttal statement received. If, by the end of the time period specified in the notice, no statement has been received, the recoupment or offset goes into effect automatically.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Duration of recoupment or offset. Except as provided in Sec. 405.379, if a recoupment or offset is put into effect, it remains in effect until the earliest of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The overpayment and any assessed interest are liquidated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Medicare contractor obtains a satisfactory agreement from the provider or supplier for liquidation of the overpayment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Medicare contractor, on the basis of subsequently acquired evidence or otherwise, determines that there is no overpayment.
