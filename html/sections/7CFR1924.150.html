Public reporting burden for this  collection of information is estimated to vary from 5 minutes to 10  minutes per response, with an average of .13 hours per response,  including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data  sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and  reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this  burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information,  including suggestions for reducing this burden to the Department of  Agriculture, Clearance Officer, OIRM, Ag Box 7630, Washington, DC 20250;  and to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project  (OMB 0575-0164), Washington, DC 20503.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Exhibit A to Subpart C of Part 1924 [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Exhibit B to Subpart C of Part 1924--Site Development Design</p><p class="depth0">Requirements</p><p class="depth0">This exhibit prescribes site development requirements to be used in  developing residential sites in all housing programs. These requirements  cover only those areas which involve health and safety concerns. They  are not intended to cover all aspects of site development. Applicants  and developers are expected to follow local practice, as a minimum, in  all areas of site development not addressed in this exhibit. When State,  local, or other requirements are applicable in addition to FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354's requirements, the most  stringent requirement shall apply.</p><p class="depth0">Proper integration of the natural features of a site with the  manmade improvements is one of the most critical aspects of residential  development. Poor site planning in large scale subdivisions, rental  projects and individual sites, has resulted in a loss of valuable  private and public natural resources and caused economic burdens and  conditions unsuitable for healthy and pleasant living. Proper site  design can preserve desirable natural features of the site, minimize  expenses for streets and utilities, and provide a safe and pleasant  living environment.</p><p class="depth0">Table of Contents</p><p class="depth0">I.

Drainage</p><p class="depth0">A. General--1. Collection and Disposal. Surface and subsurface  drainage systems shall be provided, as appropriate, for collection and  disposal of storm drainage and subsurface water. These systems shall  provide for the safety and convenience of occupants. They shall protect  dwellings, other improvements and useable lot areas from water damage,  flooding, and erosion.</p><p class="depth0">2. Concentrated Flow. Where storm drainage flow is concentrated,  permanently maintained facilities shall be provided to prevent  significant erosion and other damage or flooding on site or on adjacent  properties.</p><p class="depth0">B. Drainage Design and Flood Hazard Exposure--1. Storm Frequency.  Drainage facilities shall be designed for a 10 year storm frequency of  24-hour duration. Full potential development of all contributing areas  shall be used as a basis for this determination.</p><p class="depth0">2. Street Drainage. Streets shall be useable during runoff  equivalent to a 10-year return frequency. Where drainage outfall is  inadequate to prevent runoff equivalent to a 10-year return frequency  from ponding over 6 inches deep, streets shall be made passable for  local commonly used emergency vehicles during runoff equivalent to a 25- year return frequency except where an alternative access street not  subject to such ponding is available.</p><p class="depth0">3. Foundation Drainage. Appropriate crawl space and foundation  drainage shall be provided for the removal of subsurface moisture.</p><p class="depth0">C. Primary Storm Sewer--1. Pipe Size. Pipe size for the primary  storm sewer (any storm sewer or inlet lateral located in a street or  other public right-of-way) shall have an inside diameter based on design  analysis but not less than 15 inches. Where anticipated runoff from the  five-year return frequency rainfall will not fill a 15 inch pipe, a  primary storm sewer system usually is unnecessary.</p><p class="depth0">2. Minimum Gradient. Minimum gradient shall be selected to provide  for self-scouring of the conduit under low-flow conditions and for  removal of sediments foreseeable from the drainage area.</p><p class="depth0">3. Easements. Easements for storm sewers shall be a minimum of 10  feet in width.</p><p class="depth0">D. Drainage Swals and Gutters--1. Design. Paved gutters shall have a  minimum grade of 0.5 percent. Paved gutters and unpaved drainage swales  shall have adequate depth and width to accommodate the maximum  foreseeable runoff without overflow. Swales and gutters shall be seeded,  sodded, sprigged or paved as appropriate to minimize potential erosion.  Side slopes shall be no steeper than 2:1.</p><p class="depth0">2. Easements. Surface channels shall have an easement which is at  least the width of the channel plus 10 feet.</p><p class="depth0">E. Downspouts--1. Outfall. Where downspouts are provided, they shall  either be connected to an available storm sewer, provided with suitable  splash blocks, or empty at acceptable locations onto paved areas so that  water drains away from buildings. Downspouts shall not connect to  sanitary sewers.</p><p class="depth0">2. Piped Drainage. Piped roof drainage from buildings shall be  connected to available storm sewers or empty at locations where no  erosion or other damage will be caused.</p><p class="depth0">F. Storm Inlets and Catch Basins--1. Openings. Where inlets are  accessible to small children, openings shall have one dimension limited  to 6 inch access. Inlet openings in paved areas shall be designed to  avoid entrapment or impedence of bicycles, baby carriages, etc.</p><p class="depth0">2. Access. Access for cleaning shall be provided to all inlet boxes  and catch basins.</p><p class="depth0">G. Drywells--Drywells for the disposal of water from foundation  drains, crawl spaces, and other small quantity sources shall be  permissible where the bottom of drywells project into strata of  undistributed porous soil at a level where the bottom of the drywell  will be above the ground water table at its highest seasonal elevation.</p><p class="depth0">V. Water Supply Systems</p><p class="depth0">A. Individual Water Systems--1. General. a. In this subpart, an  individual water system is a system which serves fewer customers or  connections than the lower threshold for community systems stated in the  Safe Drinking Water Act.</p><p class="depth0">b. The system for an individual household should be capable of  delivering a sustained flow of 5 gpm. A system supplying water to  multiple household shall be designed by a Professional Engineer and have  sufficient capacity to serve estimated demand. A test of at least 4  hours duration shall be conducted to determine the yield and maximum  drawdown for all wells developed as part of an individual water system.  This test may be waived by the State Office based on the hydrologic and  geologic conditions in the area.</p><p class="depth0">c. Water that requires continual or repetitive treatment to be safe  bacterially is not acceptable.</p><p class="depth0">d. After installation, the system should be disinfected in  accordance with the recommendations of the health authority. In the  absence of a health authority, system cleaning and disinfection should  conform with the current EPA Manual of Individual Water Supply Systems.</p><p class="depth0">e. Any method for individual water supply contained herein which is  not permitted by the local health authority having jurisdiction shall  not be used.</p><p class="depth0">2. Well Location--a. A well located within the foundation walls of a  dwelling is not acceptable except in arctic and sub-arctic regions.</p><p class="depth0">b. Water which comes from soil formation which may be polluted or  contaminated or is fissured or creviced or which is less than 20 feet  below the natural ground surface (subject to the requirements of the  local health authority) is not acceptable.</p><p class="depth0">c. Individual water supply systems are not acceptable for individual  lots in areas where chemical soil poisoning is practiced if the  overburden of soil between the ground surface and the water bearing  strata is coarse-grained sand, gravel, or porous rock, or is creviced in  a manner which will permit the recharge water to carry the toxicants  into the zone of saturation.</p><p class="depth0">d. Table 5 shall be used in establishing the minimum acceptable  distances between wells and sources of pollution located on either the  same or adjoining lots. These distances may be increased by either the  health authority having jurisdiction or the FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 State Director.</p><p class="depth0">Table 5--Distance From Source of Pollution ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Minimum</p><p class="depth0">horizontal</p><p class="depth0">Source of pollution                        distance</p><p class="depth0"><em>(feet)</em> ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Property Line..............................................           10 Septic Tank................................................           50 Absorption field...........................................       \1\100 Seepage pit................................................       \1\100 Absorption Bed.............................................       \1\100 Sewer Lines w/Permanent Watertight Joints..................           10 Other Sewer Lines..........................................           50 Chemically Poisoned Soil...................................       \1\100 Dry Well...................................................           50 Other......................................................      (\2\)-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Notes: \1\ The horizontal distance between the sewage absorption system and the</p><p class="depth0">well, or the chemically poisoned soil and the well, may be reduced to</p><p class="depth0">50 feet only where the ground surface is effectively separated from</p><p class="depth0">the water bearing formation by an extensive, continuous impervious</p><p class="depth0">strata of clay, hard-pan, or rock. The well shall be constructed so as</p><p class="depth0">to prevent the entrance of surface water and contaminants. \2\ Other sources of pollution could be fuel oil or gasoline storage</p><p class="depth0">tanks, farm yards or chemical storage tanks, etc. The well should be</p><p class="depth0">separated from these sources of pollution a distance recommended by</p><p class="depth0">the local health authority.</p><p class="depth0">3. Well Construction--a. The well shall be constructed to allow the  pump to be easily placed and to function properly.</p><p class="depth0">b. All drilled wells shall be provided with a sound, durable and  watertight casing capable of sustaining the loads imposed. The casing  shall extend from a point several feet below the water level at drawdown  or from an impervious strata above the water level, to 12 inches above  either the ground surface or the pump room floor. The casing shall be  sealed at the upper opening.</p><p class="depth0">c. Bored wells shall be lined with concrete, vitrified clay, or  equivalent materials.</p><p class="depth0">d. The space between the casing or liner and the wall of the well  hole shall be sealed with cement grout.</p><p class="depth0">e. The well casing shall not be used to convey water except under  positive pressure. A separate drop pipe shall be used for suction line.</p><p class="depth0">f. When sand or silt is encountered in the water-bearing formation,  the well shall either be gravel packed, or a removable strainer or  screen shall be installed.</p><p class="depth0">g. The surface of the ground above and around the well shall be  graded to drain surface water away from the well.</p><p class="depth0">h. Openings in the casing, cap, or concrete cover for the entrance  of pipes, pump or manholes, shall be made watertight.</p><p class="depth0">i. If a breather is provided, it shall extend above the highest  level to which surface water may rise. The breather shall be watertight,  and the open end shall be screened and positioned to prevent entry of  dust, insects and foregin objects.</p><p class="depth0">4. Pumps and Equipment--a. Pumps shall be capable of delivering the  volume of water required herein under normal operating pressures within  the living unit. Well pump capacity shall not exceed the output of the  well.</p><p class="depth0">b. Pumps and equipment shall be mounted to be free of objectionable  noises, vibrations, flooding, pollution, and freezing.</p><p class="depth0">c. Suction lines shall terminate below maximum drawdown of the water  level in the well.</p><p class="depth0">d. Horizontal segments of suction line shall be placed below the  frost line in a sealed casing pipe or in at least 4 inches of concrete.  The distance from suction line to sources of pollution shall be not less  than shown in table 5.</p><p class="depth0">5. Storage Tanks--a. A system for an individual household shall  include a pressure tank having a minimum capacity of 42-gallons.  However, prepressured tanks and other pressurizing devices are  acceptable provided that delivery between pump cycles equals or exceeds  that of a 42 gallon tank. Storage capacity on a system for multiple  households must be sufficient to meet estimated peak demands.</p><p class="depth0">b. Tanks shall be equipped with a clean-out plug at the lowest  point, and if pressurized, a suitable pressure relief valve.</p><p class="depth0">c.
