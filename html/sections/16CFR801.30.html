                                Sec. 801.30  Tender offers and acquisitions of voting securities
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This section applies to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Acquisitions on a national securities exchange or through an  interdealer quotation system registered with the United States  Securities and Exchange Commission;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Acquisitions described by Sec. 801.31;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Tender offers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Secondary acquisitions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> All acquisitions (other than mergers and consolidations) in  which voting securities or non-corporate interests are to be acquired  from a holder or holders other than the issuer or unincorporated entity  or an entity included within the same person as the issuer or  unincorporated entity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Conversions; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Acquisitions of voting securities resulting from the exercise of  options or warrants which are--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Issued by the issuer whose voting securities are to be acquired  (or by any entity included within the same person as the issuer); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The subject of a currently effective registration statement  filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission under  the Securities Act of 1933.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For acquisitions described by paragraph (a) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The waiting period required under the act shall commence upon  the filing of notification by the acquiring person as provided in Sec.  803.10(a); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The acquired person shall file the notification required by the  act, in accordance with these rules, no later than 5 p.m. Eastern Time  on the 15th (or, in the case of cash tender offers, the 10th) calendar  day following the date of receipt, as defined by Sec. 803.10(a), by the  Federal Trade Commission and   Assistant Attorney General of the notification filed by the acquiring  person. Should the 15th (or, in the case of cash tender offers, the  10th) calendar day fall on a weekend day or federal holiday, the  notification shall be filed no later than 5 p.m. Eastern Time on the  next following business day.</p><p class="depth3">Examples: 1. Acquiring person ``A'' proposes to acquire from  corporation B the voting securities of B's wholly owned subsidiary,  corporation S. Since ``A'' is acquiring the shares of S from its parent,  this section does not apply, and the waiting period does not begin until  both ``A'' and ``B'' file notification.</p><p class="depth3">2. Acquiring person ``A'' proposes to acquire in excess of $50  million (as adjusted) of the voting securities of corporation X on a  securities exchange. The waiting period begins when ``A'' files  notification. ``X'' must file notification within 15 calendar days  thereafter. The seller of the X shares is not subject to any obligations  under the act.</p><p class="depth3">3. Suppose that acquiring person ``A'' proposes to acquire 50  percent of the voting securities of corporation B which in turn owns 30  percent of the voting securities of corporation C. Thus ``A's''  acquisition of C's voting securities is a secondary acquisition (see  Sec. 801.4) to which this section applies because ``A'' is acquiring  C's voting securities from a third party (B). Therefore, the waiting  period with respect to ``A's'' acquisition of C's voting securities  begins when ``A'' files its separate Notification and Report Form with  respect to C, and ``C'' must file within 15 days (or in the case of a  cash tender offer, 10 days) thereafter. ``A's'' primary and secondary  acquisitions of the voting securities of B and C are subject to separate  waiting periods; see Sec. 801.4.
