                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Required denial of admission--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Persons evicted for drug- related criminal activity. The PHA standards must prohibit admission of  an applicant to the PHA's public housing program for three years from  the date of the eviction if any household member has been evicted from  federally assisted housing for drug-related criminal activity. However,  the PHA may admit the household if the PHA determines:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The evicted household member who engaged in drug-related  criminal activity has successfully completed a supervised drug  rehabilitation program approved by the PHA; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The circumstances leading to the eviction no longer exist (for  example, the criminal household member has died or is imprisoned).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Persons engaging in illegal use of a drug. The PHA must  establish standards that prohibit admission of a household to the PHA's  public housing program if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The PHA determines that any household member is currently  engaging in illegal use of a drug (For purposes of this section, a  household member is ``currently engaged in'' the criminal activity if  the person has engaged in the behavior recently enough to justify a  reasonable belief that the behavior is current); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The PHA determines that it has reasonable cause to believe that  a household member's illegal use or pattern of illegal use of a drug may  threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the  premises by other residents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Persons convicted of methamphetamine production. The PHA must  establish standards that permanently prohibit admission to the PHA's  public housing program if any household member has ever been convicted  of   drug-related criminal activity for manufacture or production of  methamphetamine on the premises of federally assisted housing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Persons subject to sex offender registration requirement. The  PHA must establish standards that prohibit admission to the PHA's public  housing program if any member of the household is subject to a lifetime  registration requirement under a State sex offender registration  program. In the screening of applicants, the PHA must perform necessary  criminal history background checks in the State where the housing is  located and in other States where household members are known to have  resided. (See part 5, subpart J of this title for provisions concerning  access to sex offender registration records.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Persons that abuse or show a pattern of abuse of alcohol. The  PHA must establish standards that prohibit admission to the PHA's public  housing program if the PHA determines that it has reasonable cause to  believe that a household member's abuse or pattern of abuse of alcohol  may threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the  premises by other residents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Use of criminal records. Before a PHA denies admission to the  PHAs public housing program on the basis of a criminal record, the PHA  must notify the household of the proposed action to be based on the  information and must provide the subject of the record and the applicant  with a copy of the criminal record and an opportunity to dispute the  accuracy and relevance of that record. (See part 5, subpart J of this  title for provisions concerning access to criminal records.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Cost of obtaining criminal record. The PHA may not pass along to  the applicant the costs of a criminal records check.</p>
