                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Credit use stipulations. Motor vehicle diesel fuel credits generated under Sec. 80.531 may be used to meet the volume limit of Sec. 80.530(a)(3) provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The motor vehicle diesel fuel credits were generated and reported according to the requirements of this subpart; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The conditions of this section are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Use of credits generated under Sec. 80.531. Motor vehicle diesel fuel credits generated under Sec. 80.531 may be used by a refiner or by an importer to comply with Sec. 80.530 by applying one credit for every gallon of motor vehicle diesel fuel needed to meet compliance with the volume limit of Sec. 80.530(a)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Credit banking. Motor vehicle diesel fuel credits generated may be banked for use or transfer in a later compliance period or may be transferred to another refiner or importer for use as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Credit transfers. (1) Motor vehicle diesel fuel credits obtained from another refiner or from another importer, including early motor vehicle diesel fuel credits and small refiner motor vehicle diesel fuel credits as described in Sec. 80.531(b) through (e), may be used to satisfy the volume limit of Sec. 80.530(a)(3) if all the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Motor vehicle diesel fuel credits obtained from another refiner or from another importer, including early motor vehicle diesel fuel credits and small refiner motor vehicle diesel fuel credits as described in Sec. 80.531(b) through (e), may be used to satisfy the volume limit of Sec. 80.530(a)(3) if all the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The motor vehicle diesel fuel credits were generated in the same CTA as the CTA in which motor vehicle diesel fuel credits are used to achieve compliance, except as provided in Sec. 80.531(c)(5);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The motor vehicle diesel fuel credits are used in compliance with the time period limitations for credit use in this subpart;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any credit transfer takes place no later than the August 31 following the compliance period when the motor vehicle diesel fuel credits are used;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> No credit may be transferred more than twice, as follows: The first transfer by the refiner or importer who generated the credit may only be made to a refiner or importer who intends to use the credit; if the transferee cannot use the credit, it may make a second and final transfer only to a refiner or importer who intends to use the credit. In no case may a credit be transferred more than twice before being used or terminated;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The credit transferor must apply any motor vehicle diesel fuel credits necessary to meet the transferor's annual compliance requirements before transferring motor vehicle diesel fuel credits to any other refinery or importer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> No motor vehicle diesel fuel credits may be transferred that would result in the transferor having a negative credit balance; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Each transferor must supply to the transferee records indicating the year the motor vehicle diesel fuel credits were generated, the identity of the refiner (and refinery) or importer who generated the motor vehicle diesel fuel credits, the CTA of credit generation, and the identity of the transferring entity, if it is not the same entity who generated the motor vehicle diesel fuel credits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of motor vehicle diesel fuel credits that have been calculated or created improperly, or are otherwise determined to be invalid, the following provisions apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Invalid motor vehicle diesel fuel credits cannot be used to achieve compliance with the transferee's volume requirements regardless of the transferee's good faith belief that the motor vehicle diesel fuel credits were valid.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The refiner or importer who used the motor vehicle diesel fuel credits, and any transferor of the motor vehicle diesel fuel credits, must adjust their credit records, reports and compliance calculations as necessary to reflect the proper motor vehicle diesel fuel credits.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any properly created motor vehicle diesel fuel credits existing in the transferor's credit balance after correcting the credit balance, and after the transferor applies motor vehicle diesel fuel credits as needed to meet the compliance requirements at the end of the compliance period, must first be applied to correct the invalid

transfers before the transferor trades or banks the motor vehicle diesel fuel credits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Limitations on credit use. (1) Motor vehicle diesel fuel credits may not be used to achieve compliance with any requirements of this subpart other than the volume limit of Sec. 80.530(a)(3), unless specifically approved by the Administrator pursuant to a hardship relief petition under Sec. 80.560 or 80.561.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Motor vehicle diesel fuel credits may not be used to achieve compliance with any requirements of this subpart other than the volume limit of Sec. 80.530(a)(3), unless specifically approved by the Administrator pursuant to a hardship relief petition under Sec. 80.560 or 80.561.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A refiner or importer possessing motor vehicle diesel fuel credits must use all motor vehicle diesel fuel credits in its possession prior to applying the credit deficit provisions of Sec. 80.530(a)(6).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No motor vehicle diesel fuel credits may be used to meet compliance with this subpart subsequent to the compliance period ending May 31, 2010.
