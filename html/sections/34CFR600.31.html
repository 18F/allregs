                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a  private nonprofit, private for-profit, or public institution that  undergoes a change in ownership that results in a change in control  ceases to qualify as an eligible institution upon the change in  ownership and control. A change in ownership that results in a change in  control includes any change by which a person who has or thereby  acquires an ownership interest in the entity that owns the institution  or the parent corporation of that entity, acquires or loses the ability  to control the institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If a private nonprofit, private for-profit, or public  institution has undergone a change in ownership that results in a change  in control, the Secretary may, under the provisions of Sec.  600.20(g)  and (h), continue the institution's participation in the title IV, HEA  programs on a provisional basis, provided that the institution submits,   under the provisions of Sec.  600.20(g), a materially complete  application--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> No later than 10 business days after the change occurs; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For an institution owned by a publicly-traded corporation, no  later than 10 business days after the institution knew, or should have  known of the change based upon SEC filings, that the change occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In order to reestablish eligibility and to resume participation  in the title IV, HEA programs, the institution must demonstrate to the  Secretary that after the change in ownership and control--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The institution satisfies all the applicable requirements  contained in Sec. Sec.  600.4, 600.5, and 600.6, except that if the  institution is a proprietary institution of higher education or  postsecondary vocational institution, it need not have been in existence  for two years before seeking eligibility; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The institution qualifies to be certified to participate under  34 CFR part 668, subpart B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply to terms used in  this section:</p><p class="depth0">Closely-held corporation. Closely-held corporation (including the  term close corporation) means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A corporation that qualifies under the law of the State of its  incorporation as a closely-held corporation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the State of incorporation has no definition of closely-held  corporation, a corporation the stock of which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is held by no more than 30 persons; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Has not been and is not planned to be publicly offered.</p><p class="depth0">Control. Control (including the terms controlling, controlled by and  under common control with) means the possession, direct or indirect, of  the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and  policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting  securities, by contract, or otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Ownership or ownership interest  means a legal or beneficial interest in an institution or its corporate  parent, or a right to share in the profits derived from the operation of  an institution or its corporate parent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Ownership or ownership interest does not include an ownership  interest held by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A mutual fund that is regularly and publicly traded;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A U.S. institutional investor, as defined in 17 CFR 240.15a- 6(b)(7);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A profit-sharing plan of the institution or its corporate  parent, provided that all full-time permanent employees of the  institution or corporate parent are included in the plan; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> An Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).</p><p class="depth0">Parent. The parent or parent corporation of a specified corporation  is the corporation or partnership that controls the specified  corporation directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries.</p><p class="depth0">Person.

A change in ownership and control of a  corporation that is neither closely-held nor required to be registered  with the SEC occurs when--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A person who has or acquires an ownership interest acquires both  control of at least 25 percent of the total outstanding voting stock of  the corporation and control of the corporation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A person who holds both ownership or control of at least 25  percent of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and  control of the corporation, ceases to own or control that proportion of  the stock of the corporation, or to control the corporation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For a membership corporation, a person who is or becomes a  member acquires or loses control of 25 percent of the voting interests  of the corporation and control of the corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Partnership or sole proprietorship. A change in ownership and  control occurs when a person who has or acquires an ownership interest  acquires or loses control as described in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Parent corporation. An institution that is a wholly-owned  subsidiary changes ownership and control when the parent corporation  changes ownership and control as described in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Nonprofit institution. A nonprofit institution changes ownership  and control when a change takes place that is described in paragraph (d)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Public institution. The Secretary does not consider that a  public institution undergoes a change in ownership that results in a  change of control if there is a change in governance and the institution  after the change remains a public institution, provided--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The new governing authority is in the same State as included in  the institution's program participation agreement; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The new governing authority has acknowledged the public  institution's continued responsibilities under its program participation  agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Covered transactions. For the purposes of this section, a change  in ownership of an institution that results in a change of control may  include, but is not limited to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The sale of the institution;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The transfer of the controlling interest of stock of the  institution or its parent corporation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The merger of two or more eligible institutions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The division of one institution into two or more institutions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The transfer of the liabilities of an institution to its parent  corporation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A transfer of assets that comprise a substantial portion of the  educational business of the institution, except where the transfer  consists exclusively in the granting of a security interest in those  assets; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> A change in status as a for-profit, nonprofit, or public  institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Excluded transactions. A change in ownership and control  reported under Sec.  600.21 and otherwise subject to this section does  not include a transfer of ownership and control of all or part of an  owner's equity or partnership interest in an institution, the  institution's parent corporation, or other legal entity that has signed  the institution's Program Participation Agreement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> From an owner to a ``family member'' of that owner as defined in  Sec.  600.21(f); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Upon the retirement or death of the owner, to a person with an  ownership interest in the institution who has been involved in  management of the institution for at least two years preceding the  transfer and who has established and retained the ownership interest for  at least two years prior to the transfer.
