                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Department's Voluntary Consumer Product Information Labeling  Program makes available to consumers, at the point of sale, information  on consumer product performance in an understandable and useful form so  as to facilitate accurate consumer purchasing decisions and enhance  consumer satisfaction. It also educates consumers, distributors and  retailers in the use of the product performance information displayed  and provides manufacturers and other persons who participate in the  program with an opportunity to convey to the public the particular  advantages of their products. These objectives are accomplished by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Selecting or developing standardized test methods by which  selected product performance characteristics can be measured;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Developing labeling methods by which information concerning  product performance can be transmitted in useful form to consumers at  the point of sale;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Encouraging manufacturers and other participants in the program  voluntarily to test and label their products according to the selected  or developed methods; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Encouraging consumers through various informational and  educational programs to utilize the product performance information  provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The program involves voluntary labeling by enrolled participants  of selected categories of consumer products with information concerning  selected performance characteristics of those products. The performance  characteristics selected are those that are of demonstrable importance  to consumers, that consumers cannot evaluate through mere inspection of  the product, and that can be measured objectively and reported  understandably to consumers. The consumer products covered include those  for which incorrect purchase decision can result in financial loss,  dissatisfaction, or inconvenience. The program seeks to avoid the  duplication of other Federal programs under which performance  characteristics are labeled by exempting those performance  characteristics from this program. However, where the Federal agency  concerned agrees, the Department of Commerce may include information  about those performance characteristics in CPILP labels if, by doing so,  product comparison at the point of sale is simplified for consumers, and  the complexity of product labeling is reduced for the manufacturers by  enabling them to comply with the labeling requirements of other Federal  agencies through participation in CPILP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For selected categories of consumer products, the program  includes advertising guidelines covering situations where quantitative  performance values are stated in advertising or where qualitative  comparisons are made of the performance of different products.
