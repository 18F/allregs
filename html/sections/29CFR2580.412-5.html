                                Sec. 2580.412-5  Determining when ``funds or other property''
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">With respect to any contribution to a plan from any source, including employers, employees or employee organizations, the point at which any given item or amount becomes ``funds or other property'' of a plan for purposes of the bonding provisions shall be determined as described in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where the plan administrator is a board of trustees, person or body other than the employer or employee organization establishing the plan, a contribution to the plan from any source shall become ``funds or other property'' of the plan at the time it is received by the plan administrator. Employee contributions collected by an employer and later turned over to the plan administrator would not become ``funds or other property'' of the plan until receipt by the plan administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where the employer or employee organization establishing the plan is itself the plan administrator:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contributions from employees or other persons who are plan participants would normally become ``funds or other property'' of the plan at the time they are received by the employer or employee organization, except however that contributions made by withholding from employees' salaries shall not be considered ``funds or other property'' of the plan for purposes of the bonding provisions so long as they are retained in and not segregated in any way from the general assets of the withholding employer or employee organization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Contributions made to a plan by such employer or employee organization and contributions made by withholdings from employees' salaries would normally become ``funds or other property'' of the plan if and when they are taken out of the general assets of the employer or employee organization and placed in a special bank account or investment account; or identified on a separate set of books and records; or paid over to a corporate trustee or used to purchase benefits from an insurance carrier or service or other organization; or otherwise segregated, paid out or used for plan purposes, whichever shall occur first. Thus, if a plan is operated by a corporate trustee and no segregation from general assets is made of monies to be turned over to the corporate trustee prior to the actual transmittal of such monies, the contribution represented in the transmission becomes ``funds or other property'' of the plan at the time of receipt by the corporate trustee. On the other hand, if a special fund is first established from which monies are paid over to the corporate trustee, a given item would become ``funds or other property'' of the plan at the time it is placed in the special fund. Similarly, if plan benefits are provided through the medium of an insurance carrier or service or other organization and no segregation from general assets of monies used to purchase such benefits is made prior to turning such monies over to the organization contracting to provide benefits, plan funds or other property come into being at the time of receipt of payment for such benefits by the insurance carrier or service or other organization. In such a case, the ``funds or other property'' of the plan would be represented by the insurance contract or other obligations to pay benefits and would not be normally subject to ``handling''. Bonding would not be required for any person with respect to the purchase of such benefits directly from general assets nor with respect to

the bare existence of the contract obligation to pay benefits. However, if the particular, arrangement were such that monies derived from, or by virtue of, the contract did subsequently flow back to the plan, bonding may be required if such monies returning to the plan are handled by plan administrators, officers or employees. (Further discussion on bonding of insured plans is contained in Sec. 2580.412-6(b)(7)).</p>
