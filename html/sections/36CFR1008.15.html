                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Decisions on requests. A request made under this part for access  to a record shall be granted promptly unless the record:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Was compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or  proceeding; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is contained in a system of records which has been excepted from  the access provisions of the Privacy Act by rulemaking.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Authority to deny requests. A decision to deny a request for  access under this part shall be made by the Privacy Act Officer in  consultation with the General Counsel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Form of decision. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No particular form is required for a  decision granting access to a record. The decision shall, however,  advise the individual requesting the record as to where and when the  record is available for inspection or, as the case may be, where and  when copies will be available. If fees are due under Sec. 1008.15(d),  the individual requesting the record shall also be notified of the  amount of fees due or, if the exact amount has not been determined, the  approximate amount of fees due.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A decision denying a request for access, in whole or part, shall  be in writing and shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> State the basis for denial of the request;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Contain a statement that the denial may be appealed to the  Executive Director pursuant to Sec. 1008.16 by writing to the Executive  Director, The Presidio Trust, P.O. Box 29052, San Francisco, CA 94129- 0052; and (iii) State that the appeal must be received by the foregoing  official within 20 working days of the date of the decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the decision denying a request for access involves records  which fall under the jurisdiction of another agency, the individual  shall be informed in a written response which shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> State the reasons for the denial;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Include the name, position title, and address of the official  responsible for the denial; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Advise the individual that an appeal of the declination may be  made only to the appropriate official of the relevant agency, and  include that official's name, position title, and address.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Copies of decisions denying requests for access made pursuant to  paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section will be provided to the  Privacy Act Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Fees. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No fees may be charged for the cost of searching for  or reviewing a record in response to a request made under Sec. 1008.14.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unless the Privacy Act Officer determines that reduction or  waiver of fees is appropriate, fees for copying a record in response to  a request made under Sec. 1008.14 shall be charged in accordance with  the provisions of this section and the current schedule of charges  determined by the Executive Director and published in the compilation  provided under Sec. 1001.7(b) of this chapter. Such charges shall be  set at the level necessary to recoup the full allowable direct costs to  the Trust.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where it is anticipated that fees chargeable in connection with  a request will exceed the amount the person submitting the request has  indicated a willingness to pay, the Privacy Act Officer shall notify the  requester and shall not complete processing of the request until the  requester has agreed, in writing, to pay fees as high as are  anticipated.</p>
