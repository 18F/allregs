                                Sec.  98.25-40  Valves, fittings, and accessories.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All valves, flanges, fittings and accessory equipment shall be  of a type suitable for use with anhydrous ammonia and shall be made of  steel, or malleable or nodular iron meeting the requirements of Sec.   56.60-1 of subchapter F (Marine Engineering) of this chapter. Valves  shall be fitted with noncorrosive material suitable for ammonia service.  Valves, flanges, and pipe fittings shall be of the square or round  tongue and groove type or raised-face, United States of America Standard  300-pound standard minimum, fitted with suitable soft gasket material.  Welded fittings shall be used wherever possible and the number of pipe  joints shall be held to a minimum. Screwed joints are not permitted for  pipe diameters exceeding 2 inches. Nonferrous materials, such as copper,  copper alloys and aluminum alloys, shall not be used in the construction  of valves, fittings or accessory equipment. Brazed joints are  prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each tank shall be provided with the necessary fill and  discharge liquid and vapor shut-off valves, safety relief valves, liquid  level gaging devices, thermometer well and pressure gage, and shall be  provided with suitable access for convenient operation. Connections to  tanks installed below the weather deck shall be made to a trunk or dome  extending above the weather deck. Connections to the tanks shall be  protected against mechanical damage and tampering. Other openings in the  tanks, except as specifically permitted by this part, are prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All connections to the tanks, except safety devices and liquid  level gaging devices, shall have manually operated shut-off valves  located as close to the tank as possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Excess flow valves where required by this section shall close  automatically at the rated flow of vapor or liquid as specified by the  manufacturer. The piping, including valves, fittings and appurtenances,  protected by an excess flow valve, shall have a greater capacity than  the rated flow of the excess flow valve.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Liquid level gaging devices which are so constructed that  outward flow of tank contents shall not exceed that passed by a No. 54  drill size opening, need not be equipped with excess flow valves.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Pressure gage connections need not be equipped with excess flow  valves if the openings are not larger than No. 54 drill size.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Excess flow valves may be designed with a bypass, not to exceed  a No. 60 drill size opening, to allow equalization of pressure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Prior to disconnecting shore lines, the pressure in the liquid  and vapor lines shall be relieved through   suitable valves installed at the loading header.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Relief valves shall be fitted in liquid lines which may be  subject to excessive pressure caused by liquid full condition, and the  escape from the relief valves shall be piped to the venting system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The pressure gage shall be located at the highest practical  point. The thermometer well shall terminate in the liquid space and be  attached to the shell by welding with the end of the fitting being  provided with a gas-tight screwed plug or bolted cover.
