                            <p class="depth0">A demand for testimony and/or documents by a Library employee must be in writing, must state the nature of the requested testimony and/or specify documents, and must meet the requirements of Sec. 703.15. A demand must also show that the desired testimony or document is not reasonably available from any other source and must show that no document could be provided and used in lieu of testimony. When an employee of the Library receives such a request the employee will immediately forward it, with the recommendation of the employee's supervisors, to the appropriate deciding official under Sec. 703.22 of this part. The deciding official, in consultation with the appropriate offices of the Library or congressional offices, will determine whether or not compliance with the request would be appropriate and will respond as soon as practicable.</p>
