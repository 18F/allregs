                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A person who has appealed from a decision suspending outright or  revoking a credential or endorsement, except for revocation resulting  from an offense enumerated in Sec. 5.59, may file a written request for  a temporary credential or endorsement. This request must be submitted to  the Administrative Law Judge who presided over the case, or to any  Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection for forwarding to the  Administrative Law Judge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Action on the request is taken by the ALJ unless the hearing  transcript has been forwarded to the Commandant, in which case, the  Commandant will make the final action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A determination as to the request will take into consideration  whether the service of the individual is compatible with the  requirements for safety at sea and consistent with applicable laws. If  one of the offenses enumerated in Sec. 5.61(a) has been found proved,  the continued service of the appellant will be presumed not compatible  with safety at sea, subject to rebuttal by the appellant. A temporary  credential or endorsement may be denied for that reason alone.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All temporary credentials or endorsements will provide that they  expire not more than six months after issuance or upon service of the  Commandant's decision on appeal, whichever occurs first. If a temporary  credential or endorsement expires before the Commandant's decision is  rendered, it may be renewed, if authorized by the Commandant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the request for a temporary credential or endorsement is  denied by the Administrative Law Judge, the individual may appeal the  denial, in writing, to the Commandant within 30 days after notification  of such denial. Any decision by the Commandant to deny is the final  agency action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Copies of the temporary credential issued become a part of the  record on appeal.
