The requirements for an application under section 1(a) of the Act are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The applicant's verified statement that the mark is in use in commerce. If the verified statement is not filed with the initial application, the verified statement must also allege that the mark was in use in commerce as of the application filing date;</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The date of the applicant's first use of the mark in commerce;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> One specimen showing how the applicant uses the mark in commerce; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If the application specifies more than one item of goods or services in a class, the dates of use in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section are required for only one item of goods or services specified in that class.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Intent-to-use under section 1(b) of the Act. In an application under section 1(b) of the Act, the applicant must verify that the applicant has a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce. If the verified statement is not filed with the initial application, the verified statement must also allege that the applicant had a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce as of the application filing date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Registration of a mark in a foreign applicant's country of origin under section 44(e) of the Act. The requirements for an application under section 44(e) of the Act are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The applicant's verified statement that the applicant has a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce. If the verified statement is not filed with the initial application, the Office will require submission of the verified statement, which must also allege that the applicant had a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce as of the application filing date.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the record indicates that the foreign registration will expire before the U.S. registration will issue, the applicant must submit a true copy, a photocopy, a certification, or a certified copy of a proof of renewal from the applicant's country of origin to establish that the foreign registration has been renewed and will be in full force and effect at the time the U.S. registration will issue. If the proof of renewal is not in the English language, the applicant must submit a translation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Claim of priority, based upon an earlier-filed foreign application, under section 44(d) of the Act.

If the verified statement is not filed with the initial application, the Office will require submission of the verified statement, which must also allege that the applicant had a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce as of the application filing date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Before the application can be approved for publication, or for registration on the Supplemental Register, the applicant must establish a basis under section 1 or 44 of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Extension of protection of an international registration under section 66(a) of the Act.
