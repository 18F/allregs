                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Property distributed. Section 355 applies to a distribution only  if the property distributed consists solely of stock, or stock and  securities, of a controlled corporation. If additional property  (including an excess principal amount of securities received over  securities surrendered) is received, see section 356.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Independent business purpose--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Independent business purpose  requirement. Section 355 applies to a transaction only if it is carried  out for one or more corporate business purposes. A transaction is  carried out for a corporate business purpose if it is motivated, in  whole or substantial part, by one or more corporate business purposes.  The potential for the avoidance of Federal taxes by the distributing or  controlled corporations (or a corporation controlled by either) is  relevant in   determining the extent to which an existing corporate business purpose  motivated the distribution. The principal reason for this business  purpose requirement is to provide nonrecognition treatment only to  distributions that are incident to readjustments of corporate structures  required by business exigencies and that effect only readjustments of  continuing interests in property under modified corporate forms. This  business purpose requirement is independent of the other requirements  under section 355.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of  paragraph (b)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> and (4) of paragraph (b)(5) of this  section. For rules with respect to the requirement of a business purpose  for a transfer of assets to a controlled corporation in connection with  a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D), See Sec. 1.368- 1(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Business purpose as evidence of nondevice. The corporate  business purpose or purposes for a transaction are evidence that the  transaction was not used principally as a device for the distribution of  earnings and profits within the meaning of section 355(a)(1)(B). See  paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (b) may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Corporation X is engaged in the production,  transportation, and refining of petroleum products. In 1985, X acquires  all of the properties of corporation Z, which is also engaged in the  production, transportation, and refining of petroleum products. In 1991,  as a result of antitrust litigation, X is ordered to divest itself of  all of the properties acquired from Z. X transfers those properties to  new corporation Y and distributes the stock of Y pro rata to X's  shareholders. In view of the divestiture order, the distribution is  carried out for a corporate business purpose. See paragraph (b)(1) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Corporation X is engaged in two businesses: The  manufacture and sale of furniture and the sale of jewelry. The  businesses are of equal value. The outstanding stock of X is owned  equally by unrelated individuals A and B. A is more interested in the  furniture business, while B is more interested in the jewelry business.  A and B decide to split up the businesses and go their separate ways. A  and B anticipate that the operations of each business will be enhanced  by the separation because each shareholder will be able to devote his  undivided attention to the business in which he is more interested and  more proficient. Accordingly, X transfers the jewelry business to new  corporation Y and distributes the stock of Y to B in exchange for all of  B's stock in X. The distribution is carried out for a corporate business  purpose, notwithstanding that it is also carried out in part for  shareholder purposes. See paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Corporation X is engaged in the manufacture and sale of  toys and the manufacture and sale of candy. The shareholders of X wish  to protect the candy business from the risks and vicissitudes of the toy  business. Accordingly, X transfers the toy business to new corporation Y  and distributes the stock of Y to X's shareholders. Under applicable  law, the purpose of protecting the   candy business from the risks and vicissitudes of the toy business is  achieved as soon as X transfers the toy business to Y. Therefore, the  distribution is not carried out for a corporate business purpose. See  paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Corporation X is engaged in a regulated business in State  T. X owns all of the stock of corporation Y, a profitable corporation  that is not engaged in a regulated business. Commission C sets the rates  that X may charge its customers, based on its total income. C has  recently adopted rules according to which the total income of a  corporation includes the income of a business if, and only if, the  business is operated, directly or indirectly, by the corporation. Total  income, for this purpose, includes the income of a wholly owned  subsidiary corporation but does not include the income of a parent or  ``brother/sister'' corporation. Under C's new rule, X's total income  includes the income of Y, with the result that X has suffered a  reduction of the rates that it may charge its customers. It would not be  impractical or unduly expensive to create in a nontaxable transaction  (such as a transaction qualifying under section 351) a holding company  to hold the stock of X and Y. X distributes the stock of Y to X's  shareholders. The distribution is not carried out for the purpose of  increasing the rates that X may charge its customers because that  purpose could be achieved through a nontaxable transaction, the creation  of a holding company, that does not involve the distribution of stock of  a controlled corporation and which is neither impractical nor unduly  expensive. See paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. The facts are the same as in Example (4), except that C  has recently adopted rules according to which the total income of a  corporation includes not only the income included in Example (3), but  also the income of any member of the affiliated group to which the  corporation belongs. In order to avoid a reduction in the rates that it  may charge its customers, X distributes the stock of Y to X's  shareholders. The distribution is carried out for a corporate business  purpose. See paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation X owns all of the one class of stock of  corporation Y. X distributes the stock of Y pro rata to its five  shareholders, all of whom are individuals, for the sole purpose of  enabling X and/or Y to elect to become an S corporation. The  distribution does not meet the corporate business purpose requirement.  See paragraph (b)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 6(i), except that the  business of Y is operated as a division of X. X transfers this division  to new corporation Y and distributes the stock of Y pro rata to its  shareholders, all of whom are individuals, for the sole purpose of  enabling X and/or Y to elect to become an S corporation. The  distribution does not meet the corporate business purpose requirement.  See paragraph (b)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. The facts are the same as in Example (6)(i), except that  the distribution is made to enable X to elect to become an S corporation  both for Federal tax purposes and for purposes of the income tax imposed  by State M. State M has tax law provisions similar to subchapter S of  the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. An election to be an S corporation  for Federal tax purposes will effect a substantial reduction in Federal  taxes that is greater than the reduction of State M taxes pursuant to an  election to be an S corporation for State M purposes. The purpose of  reducing State M taxes is not a corporate business purpose. The  distribution does not meet the corporate business purpose requirements.  See paragraph (b)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. The facts are the same as Example (7), except that the  distribution also is made to enable A, a key employee of Y, to acquire  stock of Y without investing in X. A is considered to be critical to the  success of Y and he has indicated that he will seriously consider  leaving the company if he is not given the opportunity to purchase a  significant amount of stock of Y. As a matter of state law, Y could not  issue stock to the employee while it was a subsidiary of X. As in  Example (7), the purpose of reducing State M taxes is not a corporate  business purpose. In order to determine whether the issuance of stock to  the key employee, in fact, motivated the distribution of the Y stock,  the potential avoidance of Federal taxes is a relevant factor to take  into account. If the facts and circumstances establish that the  distribution was substantially motivated by the need to issue stock to  the employee, the distribution will meet the corporate business purpose  requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Continuity of interest requirement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Requirement. Section 355  applies to a separation that effects only a readjustment of continuing  interests in the property of the distributing and controlled  corporations. In this regard section 355 requires that one or more  persons who, directly or indirectly, were the owners of the enterprise  prior to the distribution or exchange own, in the aggregate, an amount  of stock establishing a continuity of interest in each of the modified  corporate forms in which the enterprise is conducted after the  separation. This continuity of interest requirement is independent of  the other requirements under section 355.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. For more than five years, corporation X has been engaged  directly in one business, and indirectly in a different business through  its wholly owned subsidiary, S. The businesses are equal in value. At  all times, the outstanding stock of X has been owned equally by  unrelated individuals A and B. For valid business reasons, A and B cause  X to distribute all of the stock of S to B in exchange for all of B's  stock in X. After the transaction, A owns all the stock of X and B owns  all the stock of S. The continuity of interest requirement is met  because one or more persons who were the owners of X prior to the  distribution (A and B) own, in the aggregate, an amount of stock  establishing a continuity of interest in each of X and S after the  distribution.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that  pursuant to a plan to acquire a stock interest in X without acquiring,  directly or indirectly, an interest in S, C purchased one-half of the X  stock owned by A and immediately thereafter X distributed all of the S  stock to B in exchange for all of B's stock in X. After the  transactions, A owns 50 percent of X and B owns 100 percent of S. The  distribution by X of all of the stock of S to B in exchange for all of  B's stock in X will satisfy the continuity of interest requirement for  section 355 because one or more persons who were the owners of X prior  to the distribution (A and B) own, in the aggregate, an amount of stock  establishing a continuity of interest in each of X and S after the  distribution.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Examples (1) and (2), except  that C purchased all of the X stock owned by A. After the transactions,  neither A nor B own any of the stock of X, and B owns all the stock of  S. The continuity of interest requirement is not met because the owners  of X prior to the distribution (A and B) do not, in the aggregate, own  an amount of stock establishing a continuity of interest in each of X  and S after the distribution, i.e., although A and B collectively have  retained 50 percent of their equity interest in the former combined  enterprise, they have failed to continue to own the minimum stock  interest in the distributing corporation, X, that would be required in  order to meet the continuity of interest requirement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Assume the same facts as in Examples (1) and (2), except  that C purchased 80 percent of the X stock owned by A. After the  transactions, A owns 20 percent of the stock of X, B owns no X stock,  and B owns 100 percent of the S stock. The continuity of interest  requirement is not met because the owners of X prior to the distribution  (A and B) do not, in the aggregate, have a continuity of interest in  each of X and S after the distribution, i.e., although A and B  collectively have retained 60 percent of their equity interest in the  former combined enterprise, the 20 percent interest of A in X is less  than the minimum equity interest in the distributing corporation, X,  that would be required in order to meet the continuity of interest  requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Device for distribution of earnings and profits--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.  Section 355 does not apply to a transaction used principally as a device  for the distribution of the earnings and profits of the distributing  corporation, the controlled corporation, or both (a ``device''). Section  355 recognizes that a tax-free distribution of the stock of a controlled  corporation presents a potential for tax avoidance by facilitating the  avoidance of the dividend provisions of the Code through the subsequent  sale or exchange of stock of one corporation and the retention of the  stock of another corporation. A device can include a transaction that  effects a recovery of basis. In this paragraph (d), ``exchange''  includes transactions, such as redemptions, treated as exchanges under  the Code. Generally, the determination of whether a transaction was used  principally as a device will be made from all of the facts and  circumstances, including, but not limited to, the presence of the device  factors specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section (``evidence of  device''), and the presence of the nondevice factors specified in  paragraph (d)(3) of this section (``evidence of nondevice''). However,  if a transaction is specified in paragraph (d)(5) of this section, then  it is ordinarily considered not to have been used principally as a  device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Device factors--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The presence of any of the  device factors specified in this subparagraph (2) is evidence of device.  The strength of this evidence depends on the facts and circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pro rata distribution. A distribution that is pro rata or  substantially pro rata among the shareholders of the distributing  corporation presents the greatest potential for the avoidance of the  dividend provisions of the Code and, in contrast to other types of  distributions, is more likely to be used principally as a device.  Accordingly, the fact that a distribution is pro rata or substantially  pro rata is evidence of device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Subsequent sale or exchange of stock--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. A sale  or exchange of stock of the distributing or the controlled corporation  after the distribution (a ``subsequent sale or exchange'') is evidence  of device. Generally, the greater the percentage of the stock sold or  exchanged after the distribution, the stronger the evidence of device.  In addition, the shorter the period of time between the distribution and  the sale or exchange, the stronger the evidence of device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Sale or exchange negotiated or agreed upon before the  distribution. A subsequent sale or exchange pursuant to an arrangement  negotiated or agreed upon before the distribution is substantial  evidence of device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Sale or exchange not negotiated or agreed upon before the  distribution. A subsequent sale or exchange not pursuant to an  arrangement negotiated or agreed upon before the distribution is  evidence of device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Negotiated or agreed upon before the distribution. For purposes  of this subparagraph (2), a sale or exchange is always pursuant to an  arrangement negotiated or agreed upon before the distribution if  enforceable rights to buy or sell existed before the distribution. If a  sale or exchange was discussed by the buyer and the seller before the  distribution and was reasonably to be anticipated by both parties, then  the sale or exchange will ordinarily be considered to be pursuant to an  arrangement negotiated or agreed upon before the distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Exchange in pursuance of a plan of reorganization. For purposes  of this subparagraph (2), if stock is exchanged for stock in pursuance  of a plan of reorganization, and either no gain or loss or only an  insubstantial amount of gain is recognized on the exchange, then the  exchange is not treated as a subsequent sale or exchange, but the stock  received in the exchange is treated as the stock surrendered in the  exchange. For this purpose, gain treated as a dividend pursuant to  sections 356(a)(2) and 316 shall be disregarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Nature and use of assets--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. The determination of  whether a transaction was used principally as a device will take into  account the nature, kind, amount, and use of the assets of the  distributing and the controlled corporations (and corporations  controlled by them) immediately after the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Assets not used in a trade or business meeting the requirement  of section 355(b). The existence of assets that are not used in a trade  or business that satisfies the requirements of section 355(b) is  evidence of device. For this purpose, assets that are not used in a  trade or business that satisfies the requirements of section 355(b)  include, but are not limited to, cash and other liquid assets that are  not related to the reasonable needs of a business satisfying such  section. The strength of the evidence of device depends on all the facts  and circumstances, including, but not limited to, the ratio for each  corporation of the value of assets not used in a trade or business that  satisfies the requirements of section 355(b) to the value of its  business that satisfies such requirements. A difference in the ratio  described in the preceding sentence for the distributing and controlled  corporation is ordinarily not evidence of device if the distribution is  not pro rata among the shareholders of the distributing corporation and  such difference is attributable to a need to equalize the value of the  stock distributed and the value of the stock or securities exchanged by  the distributees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Related function. There is evidence of device if a business of  either the distributing or controlled corporation (or a corporation  controlled by it) is (1) a ``secondary business'' that continues as a  secondary business for a significant period after the separation, and  (2) can be sold without adversely affecting the business of the other  corporation (or a corporation controlled by it). A secondary business is  a business of either the distributing or controlled corporation, if its  principal function is to serve the business of the other corporation (or  a corporation controlled by it). A secondary business can include a  business transferred to a newly-created subsidiary or a business which  serves a business transferred to a newly-created subsidiary. The  activities of the secondary business may consist of providing property  or performing services. Thus, in Example (11) of Sec. 1.355-3(c),  evidence of device would be presented if   the principal function of the coal mine (satisfying the requirements of  the steel business) continued after the separation and the coal mine  could be sold without adversely affecting the steel business. Similarly,  in Example (10) of Sec. 1.355-3(c), evidence of device would be  presented if the principal function of the sales operation after the  separation is to sell the output from the manufacturing operation and  the sales operation could be sold without adversely affecting the  manufacturing operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Nondevice factors--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The presence of any of the  nondevice factors specified in this subparagraph (3) is evidence of  nondevice. The strength of this evidence depends on all of the facts and  circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Corporate business purpose. The corporate business purpose for  the transaction is evidence of nondevice. The stronger the evidence of  device (such as the presence of the device factors specified in  paragraph (d)(2) of this section), the stronger the corporate business  purpose required to prevent the determination that the transaction was  used principally as a device. Evidence of device presented by the  transfer or retention of assets not used in a trade or business that  satisfies the requirements of section 355(b) can be outweighed by the  existence of a corporate business purpose for those transfers or  retentions. The assessment of the strength of a corporate business  purpose will be based on all of the facts and circumstances, including,  but not limited to, the following factors:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The importance of achieving the purpose to the success of the  business;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The extent to which the transaction is prompted by a person not  having a proprietary interest in either corporation, or by other outside  factors beyond the control of the distributing corporation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The immediacy of the conditions prompting the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Distributing corporation publicly traded and widely held. The  fact that the distributing corporation is publicly traded and has no  shareholder who is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more  than five percent of any class of stock is evidence of nondevice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Distribution to domestic corporate shareholders. The fact that  the stock of the controlled corporation is distributed to one or more  domestic corporations that, if section 355 did not apply, would be  entitled to a deduction under section 243(a)(1) available to  corporations meeting the stock ownership requirements of section 243(c),  or a deduction under section 243(a)(2) or (3) or 245(b) is evidence of  nondevice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The provisions of paragraph (d)(1) through (3) of this  section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Individual A owns all of the stock of corporation X,  which is engaged in the warehousing business. X owns all of the stock of  corporation Y, which is engaged in the transportation business. X  employs individual B, who is extremely knowledgeable of the warehousing  business in general and the operations of X in particular. B has  informed A that he will seriously consider leaving the company if he is  not given the opportunity to purchase a significant amount of stock of  X. Because of his knowledge and experience, the loss of B would  seriously damage the business of X. B cannot afford to purchase any  significant amount of stock of X as long as X owns Y. Accordingly, X  distributes the stock of Y to A and A subsequently sells a portion of  his X stock to B. However, X could have issued additional shares to B  sufficient to give B an equivalent ownership interest in X. There is no  other evidence of device or evidence of nondevice. In light of the fact  that X could have issued additional shares to B, the sale of X stock by  A is substantial evidence of device. The transaction is considered to  have been used principally as a device. See paragraph (d)(1), (2)(ii),  (iii)(A), (B) and (D), and (3)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Corporation X owns and operates a fast food restaurant in  State M and owns all of the stock of corporation Y, which owns and  operates a fast food restaurant in State N. X and Y operate their  businesses under franchises granted by D and E, respectively. X owns  cash and marketable securities that exceed the reasonable needs of its  business but whose value is small relative to the value of its business.  E has recently changed its franchise policy and will no longer grant or  renew franchises to subsidiaries (or other members of the same  affiliated group) of corporations operating businesses under franchises  granted by its competitors. Thus, Y will lose its franchise if it  remains a subsidiary of X. The franchise is about to expire.  Accordingly, X distributes the stock of Y pro rata among X's  shareholders. X retains its business and transfers cash and marketable  securities to Y in an amount proportional to the value of Y's business.  There is no other evidence of device or   evidence of nondevice. The transfer by X to Y and the retention by X of  cash and marketable securities is relatively weak evidence of device  because after the transfer X and Y hold cash and marketable securities  in amounts proportional to the values of their businesses. The fact that  the distribution is pro rata is evidence of device. A strong corporate  business purpose is relatively strong evidence of nondevice.  Accordingly, the transaction is considered not to have been used  principally as a device. See paragraph (d)(1), (2)(ii), (iv)(A), and (B)  and (3)(i) and (ii)(A), (B) and (C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Corporation X is engaged in a regulated business in State  M and owns all of the stock of corporation Y, which is not engaged in a  regulated business in State M. State M has recently amended its laws to  provide that affiliated corporations operating in M may not conduct both  regulated and unregulated businesses. X transfers cash not related to  the reasonable needs of the business of X or Y to Y and then distributes  the stock of Y pro rata among X's shareholders. As a result of the  transfer of cash, the ratio of the value of its assets not used in a  trade or business that satisfies the requirements of section 355(b) to  the value of its business is substantially greater for Y than for X.  There is no other evidence of device or evidence of nondevice. The  transfer of cash by X to Y is relatively strong evidence of device  because after the transfer Y holds disproportionately many assets that  are not used in a trade or business that satisfies the requirements of  section 355(b). The fact that the distribution is pro rata is evidence  of device. The strong business purpose is relatively strong evidence of  nondevice, but it does not pertain to the transfer. Accordingly, the  transaction is considered to have been used principally as a device. See  paragraph (d)(1), (2)(ii), (iv)(A) and (B), and (3) and (i) and (ii) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in Example (3), except that,  instead of transferring cash to Y, X purchases operating assets  unrelated to the business of Y and transfers them to Y prior to the  distribution. There is no other evidence of device or evidence of  nondevice. The transaction is considered to have been used principally  as a device. See paragraph (d)(1), (2)(ii), (iv)(A) and (B), and (3)(i)  and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Transactions ordinarily not considered as a device--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In  general. This subparagraph (5) specifies three distributions that  ordinarily do not present the potential for tax avoidance described in  paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Accordingly, such distributions are  ordinarily considered not to have been used principally as a device,  notwithstanding the presence of any of the device factors described in  paragraph (d)(2) of this section. A transaction described in paragraph  (d)(5)(iii) or (iv) of this section is not protected by this  subparagraph (5) from a determination that it was used principally as a  device if it involves the distribution of the stock of more than one  controlled corporation and facilitates the avoidance of the dividend  provisions of the Code through the subsequent sale or exchange of stock  of one corporation and the retention of the stock of another  corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Absence of earnings and profits. A distribution is ordinarily  considered not to have been used principally as a device if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The distributing and controlled corporations have no accumulated  earnings and profits at the beginning of their respective taxable years,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The distributing and controlled corporations have no current  earnings and profits as of the date of the distribution, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> No distribution of property by the distributing corporation  immediately before the separation would require recognition of gain  resulting in current earnings and profits for the taxable year of the  distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Section 303(a) transactions. A distribution is ordinarily  considered not to have been used principally as a device if, in the  absence of section 355, with respect to each shareholder distributee,  the distribution would be a redemption to which section 303(a) applied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Section 302(a) transactions. A distribution is ordinarily  considered not to have been used principally as a device if, in the  absence of section 355, with respect to each shareholder distributee,  the distribution would be a redemption to which section 302(a) applied.  For purposes of the preceding sentence, section 302(c)(2)(A)(ii) and  (iii) shall not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Examples. The provisions of this subparagraph (5) may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. The facts are the same as in Example (3) of paragraph  (d)(4) of this section, except that X and Y had no accumulated earnings  and profits at the beginning of its   taxable year, X and Y have no current earnings and profits as of the  date of the distribution, and no distribution of property by X  immediately before the separation would require recognition of gain that  would result in earnings and profits for the taxable year of the  distribution. The transaction is considered not to have been used  principally as a device. See paragraph (d)(5)(i) and (ii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Corporation X is engaged in three businesses: a hotel  business, a restaurant business, and a rental real estate business.  Individuals A, B, and C own all of the stock of X. X transfers the  restaurant business to new corporation Y and transfers the rental real  estate business to new corporation Z. X then distributes the stock of Y  and Z pro rata between B and C in exchange for all of their stock in X.  In the absence of section 355, the distribution would be a redemption to  which section 302(a) applied. Since this distribution involves the stock  of more than one controlled corporation and facilitates the avoidance of  the dividend provisions of the Code through the subsequent sale or  exchange of stock in one corporation and the retention of the stock of  another corporation, it is not protected by paragraph (d)(5)(i) and (iv)  of this section from a determination that it was used principally as a  device. Thus, the determination of whether the transaction was used  principally as a device must be made from all the facts and  circumstances, including the presence of the device factors and  nondevice factors specified in paragraph (d)(2) and (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Stock and securities distributed--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Section 355  applies to a distribution only if the distributing corporation  distributes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All of the stock and securities of the controlled corporation  that it owns, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At least an amount of the stock of the controlled corporation  that constitutes control as defined in section 368(c). In such a case,  all, or any part, of the securities of the controlled corporation may be  distributed, and paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Additional rules. Where a part of either the stock or the  securities of the controlled corporation is retained under paragraph  (e)(1)(ii) of this section, it must be established to the satisfaction  of the Commissioner that the retention by the distributing corporation  was not in pursuance of a plan having as one of its principal purposes  the avoidance of Federal income tax. Ordinarily, the corporate business  purpose or purposes for the distribution will require the distribution  of all of the stock and securities of the controlled corporation. If the  distribution of all of the stock and securities of a controlled  corporation would be treated to any extent as a distribution of ``other  property'' under section 356, this fact tends to establish that the  retention of stock or securities is in pursuance of a plan having as one  of its principal purposes the avoidance of Federal income tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Principal amount of securities--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Securities received. Section  355 does not apply to a distribution if, with respect to any shareholder  or security holder, the principal amount of securities received exceeds  the principal amount of securities surrendered, or securities are  received but no securities are surrendered. In such cases, see section  356.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Only stock received. If only stock is received in a distribution  to which section 355(a)(1)(A) applies, the principal amount of the  securities surrendered, if any, and the par value or stated value of the  stock surrendered, if any, are not relevant to the application of that  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions. Paragraph (g)(1) of this section does not apply to  an acquisition of stock of the controlled corporation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the controlled corporation is a DSAG member at any time after  the acquisition (but prior to the distribution); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Described in Sec. 1.355-3(b)(4)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> DSAG. For purposes of this paragraph (g), a DSAG is the  distributing corporation's separate affiliated group (the affiliated  group which would be determined under section 1504(a) if such  corporation were the common parent and section 1504(b) did not apply)  that consists of the distributing corporation as the common parent and  all corporations affiliated with the distributing corporation through  stock ownership described in section 1504(a)(1)(B) (regardless of  whether the corporations are includible corporations under section  1504(b)). For purposes of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, any  reference to the DSAG is a reference to the distributing corporation if  it is not the common parent of a separate affiliated group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Taxable transaction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Generally. For purposes of this  paragraph (g), a taxable transaction is a transaction in which gain or  loss was recognized in whole or in part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Dunn Trust and predecessor issues. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph (g).  Assume that C, D, P, and S are corporations, X is an unrelated  individual, each of the transactions is unrelated to any other  transaction and, but for the issue of whether C stock is treated as  ``other property'' under section 355(a)(3)(B), the distributions satisfy  all of the requirements of section 355. No inference should be drawn  from any of these examples as to whether any requirements of section 355  other than section 355(a)(3)(B), as specified, are satisfied.  Furthermore, the following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Purchase is an acquisition that is a taxable transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 368(c) stock is stock constituting control within the  meaning of section 368(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Section 1504(a)(2) stock is stock meeting the requirements of  section 1504(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Hot stock. For more than five years, D has owned section  368(c) stock but not section 1504(a)(2) stock of C. In year 6, D  purchases additional C stock from X. However, D does not own section  1504(a)(2) stock of C after the year 6 purchase. If D distributes all of  its C stock within five years after the year 6 purchase, for purposes of  section 355(a)(1)(A), section 355(c), and so much of section 356 as  relates to section 355, the C stock purchased in year 6 would be treated  as ``other property.'' See paragraph (g)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. C becomes a DSAG member. For more than five years, D has  owned section 368(c) stock but not section 1504(a)(2) stock of C. In  year 6, D purchases additional C stock from X such that D's total  ownership of C is section 1504(a)(2) stock. If D distributes all of its  C stock within five years after the year 6 purchase, the distribution of  the C stock purchased in year 6 would not be treated as ``other  property'' because C becomes a DSAG member. See paragraph (g)(2)(i) of  this section. The result would be the same if D did not own any C stock  prior to year 6 and D purchased all of the C stock in year 6. See  paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section. Similarly, if D did not own any C  stock prior to year 6, D purchased 20 percent of the C stock in year 6,  and then acquired all of the remaining C stock in year 7, the C stock  purchased in year 6 and the C stock acquired in year 7 (even if  purchased) would not be treated as ``other property'' because C becomes  a DSAG member. See paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Intra-SAG transaction. For more than five years, D has  owned all of the stock of S. D and S, in the aggregate, have owned  section 368(c) stock but not section 1504(a)(2) stock of C. Therefore, D  and S are DSAG members, but C is not. In year 6, D purchases S's C  stock. If D distributes all of its C stock within five years after the  year 6 purchase, the distribution of the C stock purchased in year 6  would not be treated as ``other property.'' D's purchase of the C stock  from S is disregarded for purposes of paragraph (g)(1) of this section  because that C stock was owned by the DSAG immediately before and  immediately after the purchase. See paragraph (g)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Affiliate exception. For more than five years, P has  owned 90 percent of the sole outstanding class of the stock of D and a  portion of the stock of C, and X has owned the remaining 10 percent of  the D stock. Throughout this period, D has owned section 368(c) stock  but not section 1504(a)(2) stock of C. In year 6, D purchases P's C  stock. However, D does not own section 1504(a)(2) stock of C after the  year 6 purchase. If D distributes all of its C stock to X in exchange  for X's D stock within five years after the year 6 purchase, the  distribution of the C stock purchased in year 6 would not be treated as  ``other property'' because the C stock was purchased from a member (P)  of the affiliated group (as defined in Sec. 1.355-3(b)(4)(iv)) of which  D is a member, and P did not purchase that C stock within the pre- distribution period. See paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Active conduct of a trade or business. Section 355 applies to a  distribution only if the requirements of Sec. 1.355-3 (relating to the  active conduct of a trade or business) are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>, as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised as  of April 1, 2011.
