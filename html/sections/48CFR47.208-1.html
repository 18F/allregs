                            <p class="depth0">Military (and as required, civilian agency) storage and distribution  points, depots, and other receiving activities require advance notice of  shipments en route from contractors' plants. Generally, this  notification is required only for classified material; sensitive,  controlled, and certain other protected material; explosives, and some  other hazardous materials; selected shipments requiring movement  control; or minimum carload or truckload shipments. It facilitates  arrangements for transportation control, labor, space, and use of  materials handling equipment at destination. Also, timely receipt of  notices by the consignee transportation office precludes the incurring  of demurrage and vehicle detention charges.  [71 FR 205, Jan. 3, 2006]</p>
