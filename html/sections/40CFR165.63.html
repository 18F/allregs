(1) EPA may determine that an antimicrobial pesticide product otherwise exempted by paragraph (c) of this section must be subject to the repackaging regulations in this subpart to prevent an unreasonable adverse effect on the environment if all of the following conditions exist:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> EPA obtains information, data or other evidence of a problem with the containers of a certain pesticide product or related group of products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The information, data or other evidence is reliable and factual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The problem causes or could reasonably be expected to cause an unreasonable adverse effect on the environment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Complying with the container regulations could reasonably be expected to eliminate the problem.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If EPA determines that an antimicrobial pesticide product otherwise exempted by paragraph (c) of this section must be subject to the repackaging regulations in this subpart to prevent an unreasonable adverse effect on the environment, EPA may require, by rule, that the product be repackaged in compliance with all or some of the requirements in this subpart. Alternatively, EPA may notify the applicant or registrant of its intent to make such a determination. After allowing the applicant or registrant a reasonable amount of time to reply, EPA may require, by notification and as a condition of registration, that the product be repackaged in compliance with all or some of the requirements in this subpart. For the purpose of the previous sentence, 60 days would be a reasonable amount of time to reply, although EPA may, in its discretion, provide more time. EPA may deny registration or initiate cancellation proceedings if the registrant fails to comply with the repackaging regulations within the time frames established by EPA in the rule or in its notification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> What other pesticide products are subject to the regulations in this subpart? The regulations in this subpart apply to all pesticide products other than manufacturing use products, plant-incorporated protectants, and antimicrobial products that are exempt paragraph (c) of this section. Antimicrobial products covered under paragraph (d) of this section are subject to the regulations indicated in that section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> What does ``pesticide product'' or ``pesticide'' mean in the rest of this subpart? In Sec. Sec. 165.63(h) through 165.70, the term ``pesticide product'' or ``pesticide'' refers only to a pesticide product or a pesticide that is subject to the regulations in this subpart as described in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Are there any other exceptions? (1) The regulations in this subpart do not apply to transport vehicles that contain pesticide in pesticide-holding tanks that are an integral part of the transport vehicle and that are the primary containment for the pesticide.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Custom blending is not subject to the regulations in this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The regulations in this subpart do not apply to containers that hold pesticides that are gaseous at atmospheric temperature and pressure.
