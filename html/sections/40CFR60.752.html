The NMOC emission rate shall be recalculated annually, except as provided in Sec. 60.757(b)(1)(ii) of this subpart. The owner or operator of an MSW landfill subject to this subpart with a design capacity greater than or equal to 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters is subject to part 70 or 71 permitting requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the calculated NMOC emission rate is less than 50 megagrams per year, the owner or operator shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Submit an annual emission report to the Administrator, except as provided for in Sec. 60.757(b)(1)(ii); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Recalculate the NMOC emission rate annually using the procedures specified in Sec. 60.754(a)(1) until such time as the calculated NMOC emission rate is equal to or greater than 50 megagrams per year, or the landfill is closed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the NMOC emission rate, upon recalculation required in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, is equal to or greater than 50 megagrams per year, the owner or operator shall install a collection and control system in compliance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the landfill is permanently closed, a closure notification shall be submitted to the Administrator as provided for in Sec. 60.757(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the calculated NMOC emission rate is equal to or greater than 50 megagrams per year, the owner or operator shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Submit a collection and control system design plan prepared by a professional engineer to the Administrator within 1 year:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The collection and control system as described in the plan shall meet the design requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The collection and control system design plan shall include any alternatives to the operational standards, test methods, procedures, compliance measures, monitoring, recordkeeping or reporting provisions of Sec.

For purposes of submitting a timely application for an operating permit under part 70 or 71, the owner or operator of a MSW landfill subject to this subpart with a design capacity greater than or equal to 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters, and not otherwise subject to either part 70 or 71, becomes subject to the requirements of Sec.
