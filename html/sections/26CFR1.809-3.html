                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Gain from operations. For purposes of part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, section 809(b)(1) defines the term gain from operations as the excess of the sum of (1) the life insurance company's share of each and every item of investment yield (including tax-exempt interest, partially tax-exempt interest, and dividends received), (2) the items of gross amount taken into account under section 809(c) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.809-4, and (3) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1961, the amount (if any) by which the net long-term capital gain exceeds the net short-term capital loss, over the sum of the deductions provided by section 809(d) and Sec. 1.809-5.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Loss from operations. For purposes of part I, section 809(b)(2) defines the term loss from operations as the excess of the sum of the deductions provided by section 809(d) and Sec. 1.809-5 over the sum of (1) the life insurance company's share of each and every item of investment yield (including tax-exempt interest, partially tax-exempt interest, and dividends received), (2) the items of gross amount taken into account under section 809(c) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.809-4, and (3) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1961, the amount (if any) by which the net long-term capital gain exceeds the net short-term capital loss.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Illustration of principles. The provisions of section 809(b) (1) through (3) and paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth2">Example. For the taxable year 1958, T, a life insurance company, had investment yield of $900,000, including $150,000 of dividends received from domestic corporations subject to taxation under chapter 1 of the Code, $10,000 of wholly tax-exempt interest, and $78,000 of partially tax-exempt interest. T also had items of gross amount under section 809(c) in the amount of $12,000,000 and deductions under section 809(d) of $6,963,500 (exclusive of any deductions for wholly tax-exempt interest, partially tax-exempt interest, and dividends received). For such taxable year, the

share of each and every item of investment yield set aside for policyholders was 80 percent and the company's share of each and every item of investment yield was 20 percent. Based upon these figures, T had a gain from operations of $5,180,000 for the taxable year 1958, computed as follows:
