                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Parts 1065 and 1066 of this chapter describe procedures and  equipment specifications for testing engines and vehicles to measure  exhaust emissions. Subpart F of this part 1037 describes how to apply  the provisions of part 1065 and part 1066 of this chapter to determine  whether vehicles meet the exhaust emission standards in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As described in Sec.  1037.601, certain requirements and  prohibitions of part 1068 of this chapter apply to everyone, including  anyone who manufactures, imports, installs, owns, operates, or rebuilds  any of the vehicles subject to this part 1037. Part 1068 of this chapter  describes general provisions that apply broadly, but do not necessarily  apply for all vehicles or all persons. The issues addressed by these  provisions include these seven areas:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prohibited acts and penalties for manufacturers and others.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rebuilding and other aftermarket changes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exclusions and exemptions for certain vehicles.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Importing vehicles.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Selective enforcement audits of your production.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Recall.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Procedures for hearings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Part 86 of this chapter applies for certain vehicles as  specified in this part. For example, the test procedures and most of  part 86, subpart S, apply for vehicles subject to Sec.  1037.104;  including the following paragraphs of 40 CFR 86.1865-12 apply: (a),  (h)(1), (h)(3), (j)(1), (j)(4), (k)(1) through (4), (k)(7)(ii), (k)(8),  (k)(9), (l)(1), (l)(2)(i), (l)(2)(ii), (l)(2)(vi) through (viii), and  (l)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other parts of this chapter apply if referenced in this part.
