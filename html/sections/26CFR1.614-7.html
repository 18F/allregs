                            <p class="depth0">Sections 1.614-2 to 1.614-5, inclusive, require certain acts to be  performed on or before May 1, 1961 (the first day of the first month  which begins more than 90 days after the regulations under section 614  were published in the Federal Register as a Treasury decision). The  district director may, upon good cause shown, extend for a period not  exceeding 6 months the period within which such acts are to be  performed, and shall, if the interests of the Government would otherwise  be jeopardized thereby, grant such an extension only if the taxpayer and  the district director agree in writing to a corresponding or greater  extension of the period prescribed for the assessment of the tax, or in  the case of taxable years described in section 614(c)(3)(E), the  assessment of the tax resulting from the exercise or change in an  election.
