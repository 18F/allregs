The  Contracting Officer will consider cost of money that would be allowable  under FAR 31.205-10 as an incurred cost for progress payment purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount of financing and other payments for supplies and  services purchased directly for the contract are limited to the amounts  that have been paid by cash, check, or other forms of payment, or that  are determined due and will be paid to subcontractors--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In accordance with the terms and conditions of a subcontract or  invoice; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Ordinarily within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor's  payment request to the Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Government will exclude accrued costs of Contractor  contributions under employee pension plans until actually paid unless--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Contractor's practice is to make contributions to the  retirement fund quarterly or more frequently; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The contribution does not remain unpaid 30 days after the end  of the applicable quarter or shorter payment period (any contribution  remaining unpaid shall be excluded from the Contractor's total costs for  progress payments until paid).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The Contractor shall not include the following in total costs  for progress payment purposes in paragraph (a)(1) of this clause:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Costs that are not reasonable, allocable to this contract, and  consistent with sound and generally accepted accounting principles and  practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Costs incurred by subcontractors or suppliers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Costs ordinarily capitalized and subject to depreciation or  amortization except for the properly depreciated or amortized portion of  such costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Payments made or amounts payable to subcontractors or  suppliers, except for--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Completed work, including partial deliveries, to which the  Contractor has acquired title; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Work under cost-reimbursement or time-and-material subcontracts  to which the Contractor has acquired title.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The amount of unliquidated progress payments may exceed neither  (i) the progress payments made against incomplete work (including  allowable unliquidated progress payments to subcontractors) nor (ii) the  value, for progress payment purposes, of the incomplete work. Incomplete  work shall be considered to be the supplies and services required by  this contract, for which delivery and invoicing by the Contractor and  acceptance by the Government are incomplete.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The total amount of progress payments shall not exceed 80  percent of the total contract price.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> If a progress payment or the unliquidated progress payments  exceed the amounts permitted by subparagraphs (a)(4) or (a)(5) above,  the Contractor shall repay the amount of such excess to the Government  on demand.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Notwithstanding any other terms of the contract, the Contractor  agrees not to request progress payments in dollar amounts of less than  $2,500. The Contracting Officer may make exceptions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The costs applicable to items delivered, invoiced, and accepted  shall not include costs in excess of the contract price of the items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Liquidation. Except as provided in the Termination for  Convenience of the Government clause, all progress payments shall be  liquidated by deducting from any payment under this contract, other than  advance or progress payments, the unliquidated progress payments, or 80  percent of the amount invoiced, whichever is less. The Contractor shall  repay to the Government any amounts required by a retroactive price  reduction, after computing liquidations and payments on past invoices at  the reduced prices and adjusting the unliquidated progress payments  accordingly. The Government reserves the right to unilaterally change  from the ordinary liquidation rate to an alternate rate when deemed  appropriate for proper contract financing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reduction or suspension. The Contracting Officer may reduce or  suspend progress payments, increase the rate of liquidation, or take a  combination of these actions, after finding on substantial evidence any  of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Contractor failed to comply with any material requirement of  this contract (which includes paragraphs (f) and (g) below).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Performance of this contract is endangered by the Contractor's  (i) failure to make progress or (ii) unsatisfactory financial condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Inventory allocated to this contract substantially exceeds  reasonable requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The Contractor is delinquent in payment of the costs of  performing this contract in the ordinary course of business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The fair value of the undelivered work is less than the amount  of unliquidated progress payments for that work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The Contractor is realizing less profit than that reflected in  the establishment of any alternate liquidation rate in paragraph (b)  above, and that rate is less than the progress payment rate stated in  subparagraph (a)(1) above.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Title. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Title to the property described in this paragraph (d)  shall vest in the Government. Vestiture shall be immediately upon the  date of this contract, for property acquired or produced before that  date. Otherwise, vestiture shall occur when the property is or should  have been allocable or properly chargeable to this contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Property, as used in this clause, includes all of the below- described items acquired or produced by the Contractor that are or  should be allocable or properly chargeable to this contract under sound  and generally accepted accounting principles and practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Parts, materials, inventories, and work in process;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special tooling and special test equipment to which the  Government is to acquire title;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Nondurable (i.e., noncapital) tools, jigs, dies, fixtures,  molds, patterns, taps,   gauges, test equipment, and other similar manufacturing aids, title to  which would not be obtained as special tooling under subparagraph (ii)  above; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Drawings and technical data, to the extent the Contractor or  subcontractors are required to deliver them to the Government by other  clauses of this contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Although title to property is in the Government under this  clause, other applicable clauses of this contract, e.g., the termination  clauses, shall determine the handling and disposition of the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The Contractor may sell any scrap resulting from production  under this contract without requesting the Contracting Officer's  approval, but the proceeds shall be credited against the costs of  performance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> To acquire for its own use or dispose of property to which title  is vested in the Government under this clause, the Contractor must  obtain the Contracting Officer's advance approval of the action and the  terms. The Contractor shall (i) exclude the allocable costs of the  property from the costs of contract performance, and (ii) repay to the  Government any amount of unliquidated progress payments allocable to the  property. Repayment may be by cash or credit memorandum.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> When the Contractor completes all of the obligations under this  contract, including liquidation of all progress payments, title shall  vest in the Contractor for all property (or the proceeds thereof) not--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Delivered to, and accepted by, the Government under this  contract; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Incorporated in supplies delivered to, and accepted by, the  Government under this contract and to which title is vested in the  Government under this clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The terms of this contract concerning liability for Government- furnished property shall not apply to property to which the Government  acquired title solely under this clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Risk of loss. Before delivery to and acceptance by the  Government, the Contractor shall bear the risk of loss for property, the  title to which vests in the Government under this clause, except to the  extent the Government expressly assumes the risk. The Contractor shall  repay the Government an amount equal to the unliquidated progress  payments that are based on costs allocable to property that is lost (see  45.101).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Control of costs and property. The Contractor shall maintain an  accounting system and controls adequate for the proper administration of  this clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Reports, forms, and access to records. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Contractor shall  promptly furnish reports, certificates, financial statements, and other  pertinent information (including estimates to complete) reasonably  requested by the Contracting Officer for the administration of this  clause. Also, the Contractor shall give the Government reasonable  opportunity to examine and verify the Contractor's books, records, and  accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Contractor shall furnish estimates to complete that have  been developed or updated within six months of the date of the progress  payment request. The estimates to complete shall represent the  Contractor's best estimate of total costs to complete all remaining  contract work required under the contract. The estimates shall include  sufficient detail to permit Government verification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Each Contractor request for progress payment shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Be submitted on Standard Form 1443, Contractor's Request for  Progress Payment, or the electronic equivalent as required by agency  regulations, in accordance with the form instructions and the contract  terms; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Include any additional supporting documentation requested by  the Contracting Officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Special terms regarding default. If this contract is terminated  under the Default clause, (i) the Contractor shall, on demand, repay to  the Government the amount of unliquidated progress payments and (ii)  title shall vest in the Contractor, on full liquidation of progress  payments, for all property for which the Government elects not to  require delivery under the Default clause. The Government shall be  liable for no payment except as provided by the Default clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Reservations of rights. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> No payment or vesting of title under  this clause shall (i) excuse the Contractor from performance of  obligations under this contract or (ii) constitute a waiver of any of  the rights or remedies of the parties under the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Government's rights and remedies under this clause (i) shall  not be exclusive but rather shall be in addition to any other rights and  remedies provided by law or this contract and (ii) shall not be affected  by delayed, partial, or omitted exercise of any right, remedy, power, or  privilege, nor shall such exercise or any single exercise preclude or  impair any further exercise under this clause or the exercise of any  other right, power, or privilege of the Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Financing payments to subcontractors. The financing payments to  subcontractors mentioned in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this clause  shall be all financing payments to subcontractors or divisions, if the  following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The amounts included are limited to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The unliquidated remainder of financing payments made; plus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any unpaid subcontractor requests for financing payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The subcontract or interdivisional order is expected to involve  a minimum of approximately 6 months between the beginning of   work and the first delivery; or, if the subcontractor is a small  business concern, 4 months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the financing payments are in the form of progress payments,  the terms of the subcontract or interdivisional order concerning  progress payments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Are substantially similar to the terms of this clause for any  subcontractor that is a large business concern, or this clause with its  Alternate I for any subcontractor that is a small business concern;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Are at least as favorable to the Government as the terms of  this clause;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Are not more favorable to the subcontractor or division than  the terms of this clause are to the Contractor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Are in conformance with the requirements of FAR 32.504(e); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Subordinate all subcontractor rights concerning property to  which the Government has title under the subcontract to the Government's  right to require delivery of the property to the Government if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The Contractor defaults; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The subcontractor becomes bankrupt or insolvent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the financing payments are in the form of performance-based  payments, the terms of the subcontract or interdivisional order  concerning payments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Are substantially similar to the Performance-Based Payments  clause at FAR 52.232-32 and meet the criteria for, and definition of,  performance-based payments in FAR Part 32;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Are in conformance with the requirements of FAR 32.504(f); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Subordinate all subcontractor rights concerning property to  which the Government has title under the subcontract to the Government's  right to require delivery of the property to the Government if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The Contractor defaults; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The subcontractor becomes bankrupt or insolvent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If the financing payments are in the form of commercial item  financing payments, the terms of the subcontract or interdivisional  order concerning payments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Are constructed in accordance with FAR 32.206(c) and included in  a subcontract for a commercial item purchase that meets the definition  and standards for acquisition of commercial items in FAR Parts 2 and 12;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Are in conformance with the requirements of FAR 32.504(g); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Subordinate all subcontractor rights concerning property to  which the Government has title under the subcontract to the Government's  right to require delivery of the property to the Government if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The Contractor defaults; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The subcontractor becomes bankrupt or insolvent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If financing is in the form of progress payments, the progress  payment rate in the subcontract is the customary rate used by the  contracting agency, depending on whether the subcontractor is or is not  a small business concern.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Concerning any proceeds received by the Government for property  to which title has vested in the Government under the subcontract terms,  the parties agree that the proceeds shall be applied to reducing any  unliquidated financing payments by the Government to the Contractor  under this contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> If no unliquidated financing payments to the Contractor remain,  but there are unliquidated financing payments that the Contractor has  made to any subcontractor, the Contractor shall be subrogated to all the  rights the Government obtained through the terms required by this clause  to be in any subcontract, as if all such rights had been assigned and  transferred to the Contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> To facilitate small business participation in subcontracting  under this contract, the Contractor shall provide financing payments to  small business concerns, in conformity with the standards for customary  contract financing payments stated in FAR 32.113. The Contractor shall  not consider the need for such financing payments as a handicap or  adverse factor in the award of subcontracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Limitations on undefinitized contract actions. Notwithstanding  any other progress payment provisions in this contract, progress  payments may not exceed 80 percent of costs incurred on work  accomplished under undefinitized contract actions. A contract action is  any action resulting in a contract, as defined in subpart 2.1, including  contract modifications for additional supplies or services, but not  including contract modifications that are within the scope and under the  terms of the contract, such as contract modifications issued pursuant to  the Changes clause, or funding and other administrative changes. This  limitation shall apply to the costs incurred, as computed in accordance  with paragraph (a) of this clause, and shall remain in effect until the  contract action is definitized. Costs incurred which are subject to this  limitation shall be segregated on Contractor progress payment requests  and invoices from those costs eligible for higher progress payment  rates. For purposes of progress payment liquidation, as described in  paragraph (b) of this clause, progress payments for undefinitized  contract actions shall be liquidated at 80 percent of the amount  invoiced for work performed under the undefinitized contract action as  long as the contract action remains undefinitized. The amount of  unliquidated progress payments for undefinitized contract actions shall  not exceed 80 percent of the maximum liability of the Government under  the undefinitized contract action or such   lower limit specified elsewhere in the contract. Separate limits may be  specified for separate actions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Due date. The designated payment office will make progress  payments on the -------- [Contracting Officer insert date as prescribed  by agency head; if not prescribed, insert ``30th''] day after the  designated billing office receives a proper progress payment request. In  the event that the Government requires an audit or other review of a  specific progress payment request to ensure compliance with the terms  and conditions of the contract, the designated payment office is not  compelled to make payment by the specified due date. Progress payments  are considered contract financing and are not subject to the interest  penalty provisions of the Prompt Payment Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Progress payments under indefinite--delivery contracts. The  Contractor shall account for and submit progress payment requests under  individual orders as if the order constituted a separate contract,  unless otherwise specified in this contract.</p><p class="depth0">(End of clause)</p><p class="depth0">Alterate I (MAR 2000). If the contract is with a small business  concern, change each mention of the progress payment and liquidation  rates excepting paragraph (k) to the customary rate of 85 percent for  small business concerns (see FAR 32.501-1).</p><p class="depth0">Alterate II (APR 2003). If the contract is a letter contract, add  paragraphs (n) and (o). The amount specified in paragraph (o) shall not  exceed 80 percent of the maximum liability of the Government under the  letter contract. The contracting officer may specify separate limits for  separate parts of the work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> The Contracting Officer will liquidate progress payments made  under this letter contract, unless previously liquidated under paragraph  (b) of this clause, using the following procedures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If this letter contract is superseded by a definitive contract,  unliquidated progress payments made under this letter contract shall be  liquidated by deducting the amount from the first progress or other  payments made under the definitive contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If this letter contract is not superseded by a definitive  contract calling for the furnishing of all or part of the articles or  services covered under the letter contract, unliquidated progress  payments made under the letter contract shall be liquidated by deduction  from the amount payable under the Termination clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If this letter contract is partly terminated and partly  superseded by a contract, the Government will allocate the unliquidated  progress payments to the terminated and unterminated portions as the  Government deems equitable, and will liquidate each portion under the  relevant procedure in paragraphs (n)(1) and (n)(2) of this clause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the method of liquidating progress payments provided in this  clause does not result in full liquidation, the Contractor shall  immediately pay the unliquidated balance to the Government on demand.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> The amount of unliquidated progress payments shall not exceed -- ------ [Contracting Officer specify dollar amount].</p><p class="depth0">Alterate III (APR 2003). As prescribed in 32.502-4(d), add the  following paragraph (n) to the basic clause. If Alternate II is also  being used, redesignate the following paragraph as paragraph (p):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> The provisions of this clause will not be applicable to  individual orders at or below the simplified acquisition threshold.
