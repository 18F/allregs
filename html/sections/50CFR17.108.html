When manatees exceed the capacity of an existing manatee sanctuary or shift usage around an existing manatee sanctuary or shift usage to Three Sisters Springs, House Spring, Jurassic Spring, and Idiot's Delight Number 2 Spring, due to water or weather or other conditions, we will designate ``no-entry'' areas from November 15 through March 31 as appropriate and necessary around any of these sites. The determination to designate and subsequently remove no-entry areas around existing manatee sanctuaries and Three Sisters Springs, House Spring, Jurassic Spring, and Idiot's Delight Number 2 Spring within the Kings Bay Manatee Refuge will be based on aerial survey observations of manatees using the existing sanctuary sites, current weather information, and other sources of credible, relevant information.

We specifically identify and prohibit the activities set forth in this paragraph to prevent the take of one or

more manatees by individuals engaged in waterborne activities while in the water, in boats, or on-shore within the Kings Bay Manatee Refuge. In regard to these prohibited activities, we consider a resting manatee to be a mostly motionless manatee that rises to breathe from the water bottom, in the water column, or on the water's surface. While resting, a manatee may make minor changes in its posture and may slightly shift its position. Minor changes in posture occur when resting manatees breathe or roll. Resting manatees may also make slight movements with their flippers or tail to compensate for drift, etc. Prohibited activities include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Chasing or pursuing manatee(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Disturbing or touching a resting or feeding manatee(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Diving from the surface on to a resting or feeding manatee(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Cornering or surrounding or attempting to corner or surround a manatee(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Riding, holding, grabbing, or pinching or attempting to ride, hold, grab, or pinch a manatee(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Poking, prodding, or stabbing or attempting to poke, prod, or stab a manatee(s) with anything, including your hands and feet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Standing on or attempting to stand on manatee(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Separating a mother and calf or attempting to separate a mother and calf.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Separating manatee(s) from a group or attempting to separate manatee(s) from a group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(J)</em> Giving manatee(s) anything to eat or drink or attempting to give manatee(s) anything to eat or drink.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(K)</em> Actively initiating contact with belted or tagged manatee(s) and associated gear, including any belts, harnesses, tracking devices, or antennae.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(L)</em> Interfering with rescue and research activities.

The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</p><p class="depth0">Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1</p><p class="depth0">The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
LEGAL STATUS</p><p class="depth0">The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</p><p class="depth0">The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</p><p class="depth0">To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2015), consult the ``List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</p><p class="depth0">Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</p><p class="depth0">The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</p><p class="depth0">Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a ``List of CFR Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY</p><p class="depth0">The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a ``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.
INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</p><p class="depth0">What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</p><p class="depth0">What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</p><p class="depth0">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES</p><p class="depth0">A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.</p><p class="depth0">An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within that volume.</p><p class="depth0">The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in the daily Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0">A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL</p><p class="depth0">There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.
