Appeals to the Executive Director shall be in  writing, shall be addressed to the Executive Director, Advisory Council  on Historic Preservation, 1522 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20005, and  shall be clearly marked ``FREEDOM OF INFORMATION APPEAL.'' Requests that  are not so marked will be honored, but will be deemed not to have been  received by the Council, for purposes of computing the response time,  until the date on which they are identified by a member of the Council  staff as being an appeal pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The appeal will be acted on within 20 working days of receipt. A  written decision shall be issued. Where the decision upholds an initial  denial of information, the decision shall include a reference to the  specific exemption in the Freedom of Information Act which authorizes  withholding the information, a brief explanation of how the exemption  applies to the record withheld, and a brief statement of why a  discretionary release is not appropriate. The decision shall also inform  the requester of the right to seek judicial review in the U.S. District  Court where the requester resides or has his principal place of  business, or in which the agency records are situated, or in the  District of Columbia.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If no decision has been issued within 20 working days, the  requester is deemed to have exhausted his administrative remedies.</p>
