                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. A penile inflatable implant is a device that consists of two inflatable cylinders implanted in the penis, connected to a reservoir filled with radiopaque fluid implanted in the abdomen, and a subcutaneous manual pump implanted in the scrotum. When the cylinders are inflated, they provide rigidity to the penis. This device is used in the treatment of erectile impotence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class III (premarket approval).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Date premarket approval application (PMA) or notice of completion of a product development protocol (PDP) is required. A PMA or a notice of completion of a PDP is required to be filed with the Food and Drug Administration on or before July 11, 2000, for any penile inflatable implant that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, or that has, on or before July 11, 2000, been found to be substantially equivalent to a penile inflatable implant that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976. Any other penile inflatable implant shall have an approved PMA or a declared completed PDP in effect before being placed in commercial distribution.
