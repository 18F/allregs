                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Notice--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Before a written determination is made  open to public inspection or subject to inspection upon written request,  or before a background file document is subject to inspection upon  written request, the person to whom the written determination pertains  or background file document relates shall be notified by the  Commissioner of intention to disclose such written determination or  background file document. The notice with respect to a written  determination, other than a written determination described in Sec.  301.6110-1(b) (2) or (3) shall be mailed when such written determination  is issued. The notice with respect to any written determination relating  to accounting or funding periods and methods, any technical advice  memoranda involving civil fraud and criminal investigations, and  jeopardy and termination assessments, and any background file document  shall be mailed within a reasonable time after the receipt of the first  written request for inspection thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contents of notice. The notice required by paragraph (a)(1) of  this section shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Include a copy of the text of the written determination or  background file document, which the Commissioner proposes to make open  to public inspection or subject to inspection pursuant to a written  request, on which is indicated (A) the material that the Commissioner  proposes to delete pursuant to section 6110(c), (B) any substitutions  proposed to be made therefor, and (C) any third-party communication  notations required to be placed pursuant to Sec. 301.6110-4(a) on the  face of the written determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> State that the written determination or background file  document is to be open to public inspection or subject to inspection  pursuant to a written request pursuant to section 6110.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> State that the recipient of the notice has the right to seek  administrative remedies pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section and  to commence judicial proceedings pursuant to section 6110(f)(3) within  indicated time periods, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Prominently indicate the date on which the notice is mailed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Actions to restrain disclosure--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Administrative remedies. Any  person to whom a written determination pertains or background file  document relates, and any successor in interest, executor or authorized  representative of such person may pursue the administrative remedies  described in Sec. 601.105(b)(5) (iii)(i) and (vi)(f) and Sec.  601.201(e) (11) and (16) of this chapter. Any person who has a direct  interest in maintaining the confidentiality of any written determination  or background file document or portion thereof may pursue the  administrative remedies described in Sec. 601.105(b)(5)(vi)(f) and  Sec. 601.201(e)(16) of this chapter. No person about whom a third-party  communication notation has been made pursuant to Sec. 301.6110-4(a) may  pursue any administrative remedy for the purpose of restraining  disclosure of the identity of such person where such identity appears  with respect to the making of such third-party communication.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Judicial remedy. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this  section, any person permitted to resort to administrative remedies  pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section may, if such person  proposes any deletion not made pursuant to Sec. 301.6110-3 by the  Commissioner, file a petition in the United States Tax Court pursuant to  section 6110(f)(3) for a determination with respect to such proposed  deletion. If appropriate, such petition may be filed anonymously. Any  petition filed pursuant to section 6110(f)(3) must be filed within 60  days after the date on which the Commissioner mails the notice of  intention to disclose required by section 6110(f)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> by any person who has received  a notice with respect to such written determination or background file  document pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> within 15 days  after notice of the petition filed pursuant to section 6110(f)(3) is  served on the Secretary. For further guidance regarding the definition  of last known address, see Sec. 301.6212-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Intervention. Any person who is entitled to receive notice  pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section shall have the right to  intervene in any action brought pursuant to this section. If  appropriate, such person shall be permitted to intervene anonymously.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(2)</em> of this section, the  text of any written determination or background file document open to  public inspection or available for inspection upon written request  pursuant to section 6110 shall be made open to or available for  inspection no earlier than 75 days and no later than 90 days after the  date on which the Commissioner mails the notice required by paragraph  (a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section. However, if an action is brought pursuant to  section 6110(f)(3) to restrain disclosure of any portion of such written  determination or background file document the disputed portion of such  written determination or background file document shall be made open to  or available for inspection pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Limitations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Court order. The portion of the text of any  written determination or background file document that was subject to an  action pursuant to section 6110(f)(3) to restrain disclosure in which  the court determined that such disclosure should not be restrained shall  be made open to or available for inspection within 30 days of the date  that the court order becomes final. However, in no event shall such  portion of the text of such written determination or background file  document be made open to or available for inspection earlier than 75  days after the date on which the Commissioner mails the notice of  intention to disclose required by section 6110(f)(1) and paragraph  (a)(1) of this section. Such 30-day period may be extended for such time  as the court finds necessary to allow the Commissioner to comply with  its decision. Any portion of a written determination or background file  document which a court orders open to public inspection or subject to  inspection upon written request pursuant to section 6110(f)(4) or  disclosed pursuant to section 6110(d)(3) shall be made open or subject  to inspection or disclosed within such time as the court provides.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Postponement based on incomplete status of underlying  transaction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Initial period not to exceed 90 days. The time period  set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section within which a written  determination shall be made open to public inspection or available for  inspection upon written request shall be extended, upon the written  request of the person to whom such written determination pertains or the  authorized representative of such person, until 15 days after the date  on which the transaction set forth in the written determination is  scheduled to be completed, but such day shall be no later than 180 days  after the date on which the Commissioner mails the notice of intention  to disclose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> exists if the  person requesting the delay in inspection demonstrates to the  satisfaction of the Commissioner that it is likely that the lack of such  extension will cause interference with consummation of the pending  transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Written request for extension. The written request for extension  of the time when a written determination is to be made open to public  inspection or available for inspection upon written request shall set  forth the date on which it is expected that the underlying transaction  will be completed, and, with respect to the additional extension  described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, set forth the  reason for requesting such extension. A request for extension of time  may not be submitted until the notice of intention to disclose is mailed  and must be received by the Internal Revenue Service office which issued  such written determination no later than--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the case of the initial extension, 60 days after the date on  which the Commissioner mails the notice of intention to disclose, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(ii)(A)</em> of this section, the  transaction set forth in the written determination was expected to have  been completed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Notice and determination of actual completion. If an extension  of time for inspection has been granted, and the transaction is  completed prior to the day on which it was expected to have been  completed, the Internal Revenue Service office which issued such written  determination shall be so notified by the person who requested such  extension. In such event, the written determination shall be made open  to public inspection or available for inspection upon written request on  the earlier of (1) 30 days after the day on which the Commissioner is  notified that the transaction is completed, or (2) the day on which the  written determination was scheduled to be made open to public inspection  or available for inspection upon written request pursuant to paragraph  (c)(2)(ii) of this section. Similarly, if the Commissioner determines  that the transaction was completed prior to the day on which it was  expected to have been completed, even if the person requesting such  extension has not so notified the Internal Revenue Service, the written  determination shall be made open to public inspection or available for  inspection upon written request on the earlier of (1) the day which is  30 days after the Commissioner ascertains that the transaction is  completed sooner than has been expected, or (2) the day on which the  written determination was scheduled to be made open to public inspection  or available for inspection upon written request pursuant to paragraph  (c)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section do not agree to  the additional disclosure or do not respond to such notice, the Internal  Revenue Service shall within a reasonable time so notify the person  requesting such disclosure, and deny the request for additional  disclosure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Judicial remedy. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this  section, any person who seeks to obtain additional disclosure of  information contained in any written determination or background file  document may file a petition pursuant to section 6110(f)(4) in the  United States Tax Court or a complaint in the United States District  Court for the District of Columbia for an order requiring that such  information be made open or subject to inspection. Nothing in this  paragraph shall prevent the Commissioner from disposing of written  determinations and related background file documents pursuant to Sec.  301.6110-7(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Limitations on right to bring judicial action--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Exhaustion of  administrative remedies. No petition or complaint shall be filed  pursuant to section 6110(f)(4) unless the administrative remedies  provided by paragraph (d)(1) of this section have been exhausted.  However, if the Internal Revenue Service does not approve or deny the  request for additional disclosure within 180 days after the request is  submitted, the person making the request may file a petition pursuant to  section 6110(f)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Actions to obtain identity. No petition or complaint shall be  filed pursuant to section 6110(f)(4) to obtain disclosure of the  identity of any person to whom a written determination on which a third- party communication notation has been placed pursuant to Sec. 301.6110- 4(a) pertains. Such actions shall be brought pursuant to section  6110(d)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> is served on  the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Intervention. Any person who is entitled to receive notice  pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section shall have the right to  intervene in any action brought pursuant to this section. If  appropriate, such person shall be permitted to intervene anonymously.  [T.D. 7524, 42 FR 63415, Dec. 16, 1977, as amended by T.D. 8939, 66 FR  2819, Jan. 12, 2001]</p>
