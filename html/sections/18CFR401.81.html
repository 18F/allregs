                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope of subpart. This subpart shall apply to contested cases  required to be held under subparts C and E of this part, to the conduct  of other administrative hearings involving contested cases and to  proceedings which Commission regulation or the Commission directs be  conducted pursuant to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definition of contested case. ``Contested case'' means a  proceeding in which the legal rights, duties, obligations, privileges,  benefits or other legal relations of specific parties are involved. Such  a proceeding may involve personnel matters, project applications and  docket decisions but shall not extend to the review of any proposed or  adopted rule or regulation of the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requests for hearings. Any person seeking a hearing to review  the action or decision of the Commission or the Executive Director may  request a hearing pursuant to the provisions of this subpart provided  such a request is received by the Commission within thirty (30) days of  the action or decision which is the subject of the requested hearing.  Requests shall be submitted in writing to the Secretary of the  Commission and shall identify the specific action or decision for which  a hearing is requested, the date of the action or   decision, the interest of the person requesting the hearing in the  subject matter of the proposed hearing and a summary statement setting  forth the basis for objecting to or seeking review of the action or  decision. Any request filed more than thirty days after an action or  decision will be deemed untimely and such request for a hearing shall be  considered denied unless the Commission by unanimous vote otherwise  directs. Receipt of requests for hearings, pursuant to this subpart,  whether timely filed or not, shall be submitted by the Secretary to the  Commissioners for their information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Optional joint hearings. Whenever designated by a department,  agency or instrumentality of a signatory party, and within any  limitations prescribed by the designation, a Hearing Officer designated  pursuant to this subpart may also serve as a Hearing Officer, examiner  or agent pursuant to such additional designation and may conduct joint  hearings for the Commission and for such other department, agency or  instrumentality. Pursuant to the additional designation, a Hearing  Officer shall cause to be filed with the department, agency or  instrumentality making the designation, a certified copy of the  transcript of the evidence taken before him and, if requested, of his  findings and recommendations. Neither the Hearing Officer nor the  Delaware River Basin Commission shall have or exercise any power or duty  as a result of such additional designation to decide the merits of any  matter arising under the separate laws of a signatory party (other than  the Delaware River Basin Compact).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Schedule. The Executive Director shall cause the schedule for  each hearing to be listed in advance upon a ``hearing docket'' which  shall be posted in public view at the office of the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notice of hearing. Notice of any hearing to be conducted  pursuant to this subpart shall comply with the provisions of Section  14.4(b) of the Compact relating to public notice unless otherwise  directed by the Commission.</p>
