                            <p class="depth0">Temperatures and procedures which are necessary for cooling and  freezing of rabbits in accordance with sound commercial practice shall  be maintained in the coolers and freezers, and chilling temperatures and  procedures shall also be in accordance with sound commercial practice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Cooling. Immediately after evisceration and washing of the  carcass, it shall be placed in a cooling tank containing running cold  tap water to remove the animal heat from the carcass. Carcasses shall  not be allowed to remain in the cooling tank for longer than 1 hour.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Air chilling. Immediately after the initial water chilling, the  carcasses shall be placed in cooling racks and thereupon placed in a  refrigerated cooler with moderate air movements and a temperature which  will reduce the internal temperature of the carcasses to from 36 [deg]F.  to 40 [deg]F., both inclusive, within 24 hours.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Freezing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When ready-to-cook rabbits are packaged in bulk or  shipping containers, the carcasses should be individually wrapped or  packaged in water-vapor resistant cartons or the containers should be  lined with heavy water-vapor resistant paper so as to assure adequate  overlapping of the lining to completely surround the carcasses and to  permit unsealed closure or sealing in such a manner that water-vapor  loss from the product is considerably retarded or prevented. The rabbit  carcasses should receive an initial rapid freezing under such packaging,  temperature, air circulation, and stacking conditions which will result  in freezing the carcasses solid in less than 48 hours.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Frozen ready-to-cook rabbits shall be held under conditions  which will maintain the product in a solidly frozen state with  temperature maintained as constant as possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Refrigeration. Immediately after packaging, all ready-to-cook  rabbits, other than those which are shipped from the plant in a  refrigerated carrier, should be moved into the freezer, except that a  period not exceeding 72 hours will be permitted for transportation and  temporary holding before   placing in the freezer provided such rabbits are held at not above 36  [deg]F.</p>
