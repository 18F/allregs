                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Right to appeal. Recipients whose financial assistance has been  suspended or terminated, or whose non-competing continuation  applications for refunding have been denied, may appeal such decisions  using the procedures described in this section. Denial of an application  for refunding means the refusal to fund a non-competing continuation  application for a budget period within a previously approved project  period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Suspension, termination, and denial of funding. Procedures for  and definitions of suspension and termination of financial assistance  are published in 45 CFR 74.110-74.116. Appeals from a denial of  refunding will be treated the same procedurally as appeals to  termination of financial assistance. The term ``denial of refunding''  does not include policy decisions to eliminate one or more activities of  an approved project. A decision not to fund an application at the end of  the recipients's project period is not a ``denial of refunding'' and is  not subject to appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Hearings. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A recipient shall be given an initial written  notice at least thirty (30) days prior to the suspension or termination  of financial assistance except in emergency situations, which occur when  Federal property is in imminent danger of dissipation, or when life,  health, or safety is endangered. During this period of time, the  recipient has the opportunity to show cause to ANA why such action  should not be taken.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A recipient who has received final written notice of termination  or denial of refunding, or whose financial assistance will be suspended  for more than 30 days, or who has other appealable disputes with ANA as  provided by 45 CFR part 16 may request review by the Departmental Grant  Appeals Board under the provisions of 45 CFR part 16.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a recipient appeals a suspension of more than 30 days which  subsequently results in termination of financial assistance, both  actions may be considered simultaneously by the Departmental Grant  Appeals Board.</p>
