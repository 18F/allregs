Such a modification or substitution of a model may be made on a case-by-case basis or, where appropriate, on a generic basis for a specific State program. Written approval of the Administrator must be obtained for any modification or substitution. In addition, use of a modified or substituted model must be subject to notice and opportunity for public comment under procedures set forth in Sec. 51.102.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The demonstration must include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A summary of the computations, assumptions, and judgments used to determine the degree of reduction of emissions (or reductions in the growth of emissions) that will result from the implementation of the control strategy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A presentation of emission levels expected to result from implementation of each measure of the control strategy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A presentation of the air quality levels expected to result from implementation of the overall control strategy presented either in tabular form or as an isopleth map showing expected maximum pollutant concentrations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A description of the dispersion models used to project air quality and to evaluate control strategies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For interstate regions, the analysis from each constituent State must, where practicable, be based upon the same regional emission inventory and air quality baseline.
