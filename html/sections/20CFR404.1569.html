                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The Dictionary of Occupational Titles includes information about  jobs (classified by their exertional and skill requirements) that exist  in the national economy. Appendix 2 provides rules using this data  reflecting major functional and vocational patterns. We apply these  rules in cases where a person is not doing substantial gainful activity  and is prevented by a severe medically determinable impairment from  doing vocationally relevant past work. (See Sec. 404.1520(h) for an  exception to this rule.) The rules in appendix 2 do not cover all  possible variations of factors. Also, as we explain in Sec. 200.00 of  appendix 2, we do not apply these rules if one of the findings of fact  about the person's vocational factors and residual functional capacity  is not the same as the corresponding criterion of a rule. In these  instances, we give full consideration to all relevant facts in  accordance with the definitions and discussions under vocational  considerations. However, if the findings of fact made about all factors  are the same as the rule, we use that rule to decide whether a person is  disabled.  [45 FR 55584, Aug. 20, 1980, as amended at 77 FR 43494, July 25, 2012]    Sec. 404.1569a  Exertional and nonexertional limitations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Your impairment(s) and related symptoms, such as pain,  may cause limitations of function or restrictions which limit your  ability to meet certain demands of jobs. These limitations may be  exertional, nonexertional, or a combination of both. Limitations are  classified as exertional if they affect your ability to meet the  strength demands of jobs. The classification of a limitation as  exertional is related to the United States Department of Labor's  classification of jobs by various exertional levels (sedentary, light,  medium, heavy, and very heavy) in terms of the strength demands for  sitting, standing, walking, lifting, carrying, pushing, and pulling.  Sections 404.1567 and 404.1569 explain how we use the classification of  jobs by exertional levels (strength demands) which is contained in the  Dictionary of Occupational Titles published by the Department of Labor,  to determine the exertional requirements of work which exists in the  national economy. Limitations or restrictions which affect your ability  to meet the demands of jobs other than the strength demands, that is,  demands other than sitting, standing, walking, lifting, carrying,  pushing or pulling, are considered nonexertional. When we decide whether  you can do your past relevant work (see Secs. 404.1520(f) and  404.1594(f)(7)), we will compare our assessment of your residual  functional capacity with the demands of your past relevant work. If you  cannot do your past relevant work, we will use the same residual  functional capacity assessment along with your age, education, and work  experience to decide if you can adjust to any other work which exists in  the national economy. (See Secs. 404.1520(g) and 404.1594(f)(8).)  Paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section explain how we apply the  medical-vocational guidelines in appendix 2 of this subpart in making  this determination, depending on whether the limitations or restrictions  imposed by your impairment(s) and related symptoms, such as pain, are  exertional, nonexertional, or a combination of both.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exertional limitations. When the limitations and restrictions  imposed by your impairment(s) and related symptoms, such as pain, affect  only your ability to meet the strength demands of jobs (sitting,  standing, walking, lifting, carrying, pushing, and pulling), we consider  that you have only exertional limitations. When your impairment(s) and  related symptoms only impose exertional limitations and your specific  vocational profile is listed in a rule contained in appendix 2 of this  subpart, we will directly apply that rule to decide whether you are  disabled.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Nonexertional limitations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the limitations and  restrictions imposed by your impairment(s) and related symptoms, such as  pain, affect only your ability to meet the demands of jobs other than  the strength demands, we consider that you have only nonexertional  limitations or restrictions. Some examples of nonexertional limitations  or restrictions include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You have difficulty functioning because you are nervous,  anxious, or depressed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You have difficulty maintaining attention or concentrating;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You have difficulty understanding or remembering detailed  instructions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> You have difficulty in seeing or hearing;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> You have difficulty tolerating some physical feature(s) of  certain work settings, e.g., you cannot tolerate dust or fumes; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> You have difficulty performing the manipulative or postural  functions of some work such as reaching, handling, stooping, climbing,  crawling, or crouching.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If your impairment(s) and related symptoms, such as pain, only  affect your ability to perform the nonexertional aspects of work-related  activities, the rules in appendix 2 do not direct factual conclusions of  disabled or not disabled. The determination as to whether disability  exists will be based on the principles in the appropriate sections of  the regulations, giving consideration to the rules for specific case  situations in appendix 2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Combined exertional and nonexertional limitations. When the  limitations and restrictions imposed by your impairment(s) and related  symptoms, such as pain, affect your ability to meet both the strength  and demands of jobs other than the strength demands, we consider that  you have a combination of exertional and nonexertional limitations or  restrictions. If your impairment(s) and related symptoms, such as pain,  affect your ability to meet both the strength and demands of jobs other  than the strength demands, we will not directly apply the rules in  appendix 2 unless there is a rule that directs a conclusion that you are  disabled based upon your strength limitations; otherwise the rules  provide a framework to guide our decision.
