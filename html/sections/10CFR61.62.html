                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The applicant shall provide assurance that sufficient funds will  be available to carry out disposal site closure and stabilization,  including: (1) Decontamination or dismantlement of land disposal  facility structures; and (2) closure and stabilization of the disposal  site so that following transfer of the disposal site to the site owner,  the need for ongoing active maintenance is eliminated to the extent  practicable and only minor custodial care, surveillance, and monitoring  are required. These assurances shall be based on Commission-approved  cost estimates reflecting the Commission-approved plan for disposal site  closure and stabilization. The applicant's cost estimates must take into  account total capital costs that would be incurred if an independent  contractor were hired to perform the closure and stabilization work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In order to avoid unnecessary duplication and expense, the  Commission will accept financial sureties that have been consolidated  with earmarked financial or surety arrangements established to meet  requirements of other Federal or State agencies and/or local governing  bodies for such decontamination, closure and stabilization. The  Commission will accept this arrangement only if they are considered  adequate to satisfy these requirements and that the portion of the  surety which covers the closure of the disposal site is clearly  identified and committed for use in accomplishing these activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The licensee's surety mechanism will be annually reviewed by the  Commission to assure that sufficient funds are available for completion  of the closure plan, assuming that the work has to be performed by an  independent contractor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The amount of surety liability should change in accordance with  the predicted cost of future closure and stabilization. Factors  affecting closure and stabilization cost estimates include: inflation;  increases in the amount of disturbed land; changes in engineering plans;  closure and stabilization that has already been accomplished and any  other conditions affecting costs. This will yield a surety that is at  least sufficient at all times to cover the costs of closure of the  disposal units that are expected to be used before the next license  renewal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The term of the surety mechanism must be open ended unless it  can be demonstrated that another arrangement would provide an equivalent  level of assurance. This assurance could be provided with a surety  mechanism which is written for a specified period of time (e.g., five  years) yet which must be automatically renewed unless the party who  issues the surety notifies the Commission and the beneficiary (the site  owner) and the principal (the licensee) not less than 90 days prior to  the renewal date of its intention not to renew. In such a situation the  licensee must submit a replacement surety within 30 days after  notification of cancellation. If the licensee fails to provide a  replacement surety acceptable to the Commission, the site owner may  collect on the original surety.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Proof of forfeiture must not be necessary to collect the surety  so that in the event that the licensee could not provide an acceptable  replacement surety within the required time, the surety shall be  automatically collected prior to its expiration. The conditions   described above would have to be clearly stated on any surety instrument  which is not open-ended, and must be agreed to by all parties. Liability  under the surety mechanism must remain in effect until the closure and  stabilization program has been completed and approved by the Commission  and the license has been transferred to the site owner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Financial surety arrangements generally acceptable to the  Commission include: surety bonds, cash deposits, certificates of  deposits, deposits of government securities, escrow accounts,  irrevocable letters or lines of credit, trust funds, and combinations of  the above or such other types of arrangements as may be approved by the  Commission. However, self-insurance, or any arrangement which  essentially constitutes pledging the assets of the licensee, will not  satisfy the surety requirement for private sector applicants since this  provides no additional assurance other than that which already exists  through license requirements.</p>
