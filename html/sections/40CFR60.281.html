Regeneration of the cooking chemicals through a recovery  process is also considered part of the kraft pulp mill.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Neutral sulfite semichemical pulping operation means any  operation in which pulp is produced from wood by cooking (digesting)  wood chips in a solution of sodium sulfite and sodium bicarbonate,  followed by mechanical defibrating (grinding).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Total reduced sulfur (TRS) means the sum of the sulfur compounds  hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, dimethyl sulfide, and dimethyl  disulfide, that are released during the kraft pulping operation and  measured by Method 16.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Digester system means each continuous digester or each batch  digester used for the cooking of wood in white liquor, and associated  flash tank(s), blow tank(s), chip steamer(s), and condenser(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Brown stock washer system means brown stock washers and  associated knotters, vacuum pumps, and filtrate tanks used to wash the  pulp following the digester system. Diffusion washers are excluded from  this definition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Multiple-effect evaporator system means the multiple-effect  evaporators and associated condenser(s) and hotwell(s) used to  concentrate the spent cooking liquid that is separated from the pulp  (black liquor).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Black liquor oxidation system means the vessels used to oxidize,  with air or oxygen, the black liquor, and associated storage tank(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Recovery furnace means either a straight kraft recovery furnace  or a cross recovery furnace, and includes the direct-contact evaporator  for a direct-contact furnace.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Straight kraft recovery furnace means a furnace used to recover  chemicals consisting primarily of sodium and sulfur compounds by burning  black liquor which on a quarterly basis contains 7 weight percent or  less of the total pulp solids from the neutral sulfite semichemical  process or has green liquor sulfidity of 28 percent or less.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Cross recovery furnace means a furnace used to recover chemicals  consisting primarily of sodium and sulfur compounds by burning black  liquor which on a quarterly basis contains more than 7 weight percent of  the total pulp solids from the neutral sulfite semichemical process and  has a green liquor sulfidity of more than 28 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Black liquor solids means the dry weight of the solids which  enter the recovery furnace in the black liquor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Green liquor sulfidity means the sulfidity of the liquor which  leaves the smelt dissolving tank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Smelt dissolving tank means a vessel used for dissolving the  smelt collected from the recovery furnace.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Lime kiln means a unit used to calcine lime mud, which consists  primarily of calcium carbonate, into quicklime, which is calcium oxide.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Condensate stripper system means a column, and associated  condensers, used to strip, with air or steam, TRS compounds from  condensate streams from various processes within a kraft pulp mill.
