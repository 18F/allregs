If your choke manifold has buffer tanks downstream of choke assemblies, you must install isolation valves on any bleed lines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Valves, pipes, flexible steel hoses, and other fittings upstream of the choke manifold must have a rated working pressure at least as great as the rated working pressure of the ram BOPs.</p>
