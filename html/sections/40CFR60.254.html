The owner or operator must select, for inclusion in the fugitive coal dust emissions control plan, the control measure or measures listed in this paragraph that are most appropriate for site conditions. The plan must also explain how the measure or measures selected are applicable and appropriate for site conditions. In addition, the plan must be revised as needed to reflect any changing conditions at the source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any owner or operator of an affected facility that is required to have a fugitive coal dust emissions control plan may petition the Administrator to approve, for inclusion in the plan for the affected facility, alternative control measures other than those specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section as specified in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The petition must include a description of the alternative control measures, a copy of the fugitive coal dust emissions control plan for the affected facility that includes the alternative control measures, and information sufficient for EPA to evaluate the demonstrations required by paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The owner or operator must either demonstrate that the fugitive coal dust emissions control plan that includes the alternate control measures will provide equivalent overall environmental protection or demonstrate that it is either economically or technically infeasible for the affected facility to use the control measures specifically identified in paragraph (c)(2).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> While the petition is pending, the owner or operator must comply with the fugitive coal dust emissions control plan including the alternative control measures submitted with the petition. Operation in accordance with the plan submitted with the petition shall be deemed to constitute compliance with the requirement to operate in accordance with a fugitive coal dust emissions control plan that contains one of the control measures specifically identified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section while the petition is pending.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the petition is approved by the Administrator, the alternative control measures will be approved for inclusion in the fugitive coal dust emissions control plan for the affected facility. In lieu of amending this subpart, a letter will be sent to the facility describing the specific control measures approved. The facility shall make any such letters and the applicable fugitive coal dust emissions control plan available to the public. If the Administrator determines it is appropriate, the conditions and requirements of the letter can be reviewed and changed at any point.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The owner or operator must submit the fugitive coal dust emissions control plan to the Administrator or

delegated authority as specified in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (c)(4)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The plan must be submitted to the Administrator or delegated authority prior to startup of the new, reconstructed, or modified affected facility, or 30 days after the effective date of this rule, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The plan must be revised as needed to reflect any changing conditions at the source. Such revisions must be dated and submitted to the Administrator or delegated authority before a source can operate pursuant to these revisions. The Administrator or delegated authority may also object to such revisions as specified in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Administrator or delegated authority may object to the fugitive coal dust emissions control plan as specified in paragraphs (c)(5)(i) and (c)(5)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Administrator or delegated authority may object to any fugitive coal dust emissions control plan that it has determined does not meet the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If an objection is raised, the owner or operator, within 30 days from receipt of the objection, must submit a revised fugitive coal dust emissions control plan to the Administrator or delegated authority. The owner or operator must operate in accordance with the revised fugitive coal dust emissions control plan. The Administrator or delegated authority retain the right, under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, to object to the revised control plan if it determines the plan does not meet the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Where appropriate chemical dust suppression agents are selected by the owner or operator as a control measure to minimize fugitive coal dust emissions, (1) only chemical dust suppressants with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)-compliant material safety data sheets (MSDS) are to be allowed; (2) the MSDS must be included in the fugitive coal dust emissions control plan; and (3) the owner or operator must consider and document in the fugitive coal dust emissions control plan the site-specific impacts associated with the use of such chemical dust suppressants.</p>
