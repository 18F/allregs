                                Sec. 134.212  Summary judgment.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> On motion by a party. At any time before the close of record, a  party may move for summary judgment as to all or any portion of the  case, on the grounds that there is no genuine issue as to any material  fact, and that the moving party is entitled to a decision in its favor  as a matter of law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contents of motion. The motion must include a statement of the  material facts believed to be undisputed and the party's legal  arguments. The motion may include supporting statements in accordance  with 28 U.S.C. 1746. The motion must be filed, served, and accompanied  by a certificate of service (see Sec. 134.204).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Response. No later than 15 days after the service of a motion  for summary judgment, all non-moving parties must file and serve a  response to the motion or be deemed to have consented to the motion for  summary judgment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cross-motions. In its response to a motion for summary judgment,  a party may cross-move for summary judgment. The initial moving party  must file and serve a response to any cross-motion for summary judgment  within 15 days after the service of that cross-motion or be deemed to  have consented to the cross-motion for summary judgment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Stay. If an answer or response to the appeal petition has not  yet been filed, the motion for summary judgment stays the respondent's  time to answer or respond. If the Judge denies the motion and an answer  or response has not yet been filed, the respondent must file the answer  or response within   15 days after the order deciding the motion unless otherwise ordered by  the Judge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> On the Judge's own initiative. The Judge may issue an order  granting summary judgment as to all or any portion of the case in  absence of a motion if there is no genuine issue to any material fact,  and a party is entitled to a decision in its favor as a matter of law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Appeal of an SBA determination. If the SBA determination being  appealed was based on multiple grounds, SBA may move for summary  judgment on one or more of those grounds. If the Judge finds, as to any  ground, that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the SBA  is entitled to a decision in its favor as a matter of law, the Judge  will grant the motion for summary judgment and dismiss the rest of the  appeal.
