                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An SBA field office may nominate a Lender or a Lender may request a field office to consider it for CLP status. SBA district directors may approve and renew a Lender's CLP status. The district director will consider whether the Lender:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Has the ability to process, close, service and liquidate loans;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Has a satisfactory performance history with SBA, including the submission of complete and accurate loan guarantee application packages;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Has an acceptable SBA purchase rate; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Has shown the ability to work well with the local SBA office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the district director does not approve a request for CLP status, the Lender may appeal to the D/FA, whose decision will be final. If SBA grants CLP status, it applies only in the field office that processed the CLP designation. A CLP Lender must execute a Supplemental Guarantee Agreement that will specify a term not to exceed two years.</p><p class="depth2">Preferred Lenders Program (PLP)</p>
