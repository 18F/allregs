                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Civil Air Patrol (CAP). A federally chartered, non-profit  corporation which was designated by Congress in 1948 as a volunteer  civilian auxiliary of the Air Force.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Air Force noncombat mission. Although not defined in any  statute, an Air Force noncombat mission is any mission for which the Air  Force is tasked, by statute, regulation, or higher authority, which does  not involve actual combat, combat operations or combat training. The Air  Force, in lieu of using Air Force resources, can use the services of the  Civil Air Patrol to fulfill these type missions. When performing an Air  Force noncombat mission, the Civil Air Patrol is deemed to be an  instrumentality of the United States. In order for a mission to be a  noncombat mission of the Air Force under this part, it must either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Have a special Air Force mission order assigned, and, the Air  Force must exercise operational control over the mission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Involve a peacetime mission the Air Force is tasked to perform  by higher authority which requires the expenditure of Air Force  resources to accomplish, and the Air Force specifically approves the  mission as a noncombat mission, and assigns the mission to the Civil Air  Patrol to perform.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> CAP members. CAP members are private citizens who volunteer  their time, services, and resources to accomplish CAP objectives and  purposes. The two primary categories of members are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cadets. Youths, 13 years (or having satisfactorily completed the  sixth grade) through 17 years of age, who meet such prerequisites as the  CAP corporation may establish from time to time. Cadet status may be  retained until age 21.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Seniors. Adults, 18 years of age or older (there is no maximum  age), who meet such prerequisites as the CAP corporation may establish  from time to   time, and who have not retained cadet status.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Liaison officers. Active duty Air Force officers assigned to  liaison duty at the national, regional, and wing (state) levels of CAP.</p>
