                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rules. The card issuer shall provide the disclosures  required under this section on or with a solicitation or an application  to open a credit or charge card account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Definition of solicitation. For purposes of this section, the  term solicitation means an offer by the card issuer to open a credit or  charge card account that does not require the consumer to complete an  application. A ``firm offer of credit'' as defined in section 603(l) of  the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681a(l)) for a credit or  charge card is a solicitation for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Form of disclosures; tabular format. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The disclosures in  paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) (except for (b)(1)(iv)(B)) and (b)(7)  through (15) of this section made pursuant to paragraph (c), (d)(2),  (e)(1) or (f) of this section generally shall be in the form of a table  with headings, content, and format substantially similar to any of the  applicable tables found in G-10 in appendix G to this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The table described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section  shall contain only the information required or permitted by this  section. Other information may be presented on or with an application or  solicitation, provided   such information appears outside the required table.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Disclosures required by paragraphs (b)(1)(iv)(B),  (b)(1)(iv)(C) and (b)(6) of this section must be placed directly beneath  the table.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> When a tabular format is required, any annual percentage rate  required to be disclosed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section,  any introductory rate required to be disclosed pursuant to paragraph  (b)(1)(ii) of this section, any rate that will apply after a premium  initial rate expires required to be disclosed under paragraph  (b)(1)(iii) of this section, and any fee or percentage amounts or  maximum limits on fee amounts disclosed pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2),  (b)(4), (b)(8) through (b)(13) of this section must be disclosed in bold  text. However, bold text shall not be used for: The amount of any  periodic fee disclosed pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section that  is not an annualized amount; and other annual percentage rates or fee  amounts disclosed in the table.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For an application or a solicitation that is accessed by the  consumer in electronic form, the disclosures required under this section  may be provided to the consumer in electronic form on or with the  application or solicitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(vi)(B) of this  section, the table described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section must  be provided in a prominent location on or with an application or a  solicitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the table described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section is  provided electronically, it must be provided in close proximity to the  application or solicitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fees based on a percentage. If the amount of any fee required to  be disclosed under this section is determined on the basis of a  percentage of another amount, the percentage used and the identification  of the amount against which the percentage is applied may be disclosed  instead of the amount of the fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Fees that vary by state. Card issuers that impose fees referred  to in paragraphs (b)(8) through (12) of this section that vary by state  may, at the issuer's option, disclose in the table required by paragraph  (a)(2)(i) of this section: The specific fee applicable to the consumer's  account; or the range of the fees, if the disclosure includes a  statement that the amount of the fee varies by state and refers the  consumer to a disclosure provided with the table where the amount of the  fee applicable to the consumer's account is disclosed. A card issuer may  not list fees for multiple states in the table.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Exceptions. This section does not apply to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Home-equity plans accessible by a credit or charge card that are  subject to the requirements of Sec. 1026.40;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Overdraft lines of credit tied to asset accounts accessed by  check-guarantee cards or by debit cards;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Lines of credit accessed by check-guarantee cards or by debit  cards that can be used only at automated teller machines;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Lines of credit accessed solely by account numbers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Additions of a credit or charge card to an existing open-end  plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> General purpose applications unless the application, or  material accompanying it, indicates that it can be used to open a credit  or charge card account; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Consumer-initiated requests for applications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(2)</em>, (4), (7) through (12), and (15) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Annual percentage rate. Each periodic rate that may be used to  compute the finance charge on an outstanding balance for purchases, a  cash advance, or a balance transfer, expressed as an annual percentage  rate (as determined by Sec. 1026.14(b)). When more than one rate  applies for a category of transactions, the range of balances to which  each rate is applicable shall also be disclosed. The annual percentage  rate for purchases disclosed pursuant to this paragraph shall be in at  least 16-point   type, except for the following: Oral disclosures of the annual  percentage rate for purchases; or a penalty rate that may apply upon the  occurrence of one or more specific events.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Variable rate information. If a rate disclosed under paragraph  (b)(1) of this section is a variable rate, the card issuer shall also  disclose the fact that the rate may vary and how the rate is determined.  In describing how the applicable rate will be determined, the card  issuer must identify the type of index or formula that is used in  setting the rate. The value of the index and the amount of the margin  that are used to calculate the variable rate shall not be disclosed in  the table. A disclosure of any applicable limitations on rate increases  shall not be included in the table.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, the card  issuer must disclose in the table the introductory rate, the time period  during which the introductory rate will remain in effect, and must use  the term ``introductory'' or ``intro'' in immediate proximity to the  introductory rate. The card issuer also must disclose the rate that  would otherwise apply to the account pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of  this section. Where the rate is not tied to an index or formula, the  card issuer must disclose the rate that will apply after the  introductory rate expires. In a variable-rate account, the card issuer  must disclose a rate based on the applicable index or formula in  accordance with the accuracy requirements set forth in paragraphs  (c)(2), (d)(3), or (e)(4) of this section, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Premium initial rate. If the initial rate is temporary and is  higher than the rate that will apply after the temporary rate expires,  the card issuer must disclose the premium initial rate pursuant to  paragraph (b)(1) of this section and the time period during which the  premium initial rate will remain in effect. Consistent with paragraph  (b)(1) of this section, the premium initial rate for purchases must be  in at least 16-point type. The issuer must also disclose in the table  the rate that will apply after the premium initial rate expires, in at  least 16-point type.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Penalty rates--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph  (b)(1)(iv)(B) and (C) of this section, if a rate may increase as a  penalty for one or more events specified in the account agreement, such  as a late payment or an extension of credit that exceeds the credit  limit, the card issuer must disclose pursuant to this paragraph (b)(1)  the increased rate that may apply, a brief description of the event or  events that may result in the increased rate, and a brief description of  how long the increased rate will remain in effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Introductory rates. If the issuer discloses an introductory  rate, as that term is defined in Sec. 1026.16(g)(2)(ii), in the table  or in any written or electronic promotional materials accompanying  applications or solicitations subject to paragraph (c) or (e) of this  section, the issuer must briefly disclose directly beneath the table the  circumstances, if any, under which the introductory rate may be revoked,  and the type of rate that will apply after the introductory rate is  revoked.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Employee preferential rates. If a card issuer discloses in the  table a preferential annual percentage rate for which only employees of  the card issuer, employees of a third party, or other individuals with  similar affiliations with the card issuer or third party, such as  executive officers, directors, or principal shareholders are eligible,  the card issuer must briefly disclose directly beneath the table the  circumstances under which such preferential rate may be revoked, and the  rate that will apply after such preferential rate is revoked.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Rates that depend on consumer's creditworthiness. If a rate  cannot be determined at the time disclosures are given because the rate  depends, at least in part, on a later determination of the consumer's  creditworthiness, the card issuer must disclose the specific rates or  the range of rates that could apply and a statement that the rate for  which the consumer may qualify at account opening will depend on the  consumer's creditworthiness, and other factors if applicable. If the  rate that depends, at least in part, on a later determination of the  consumer's creditworthiness is a penalty rate, as described in paragraph  (b)(1)(iv) of this   section, the card issuer at its option may disclose the highest rate  that could apply, instead of disclosing the specific rates or the range  of rates that could apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> APRs that vary by state. Issuers imposing annual percentage  rates that vary by state may, at the issuer's option, disclose in the  table: the specific annual percentage rate applicable to the consumer's  account; or the range of the annual percentage rates, if the disclosure  includes a statement that the annual percentage rate varies by state and  refers the consumer to a disclosure provided with the table where the  annual percentage rate applicable to the consumer's account is  disclosed. A card issuer may not list annual percentage rates for  multiple states in the table.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fees for issuance or availability. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any annual or other  periodic fee that may be imposed for the issuance or availability of a  credit or charge card, including any fee based on account activity or  inactivity; how frequently it will be imposed; and the annualized amount  of the fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any non-periodic fee that relates to opening an account. A card  issuer must disclose that the fee is a one-time fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fixed finance charge; minimum interest charge. Any fixed finance  charge and a brief description of the charge. Any minimum interest  charge if it exceeds $1.00 that could be imposed during a billing cycle,  and a brief description of the charge. The $1.00 threshold amount shall  be adjusted periodically by the Bureau to reflect changes in the  Consumer Price Index. The Bureau shall calculate each year a price level  adjusted minimum interest charge using the Consumer Price Index in  effect on June 1 of that year. When the cumulative change in the  adjusted minimum value derived from applying the annual Consumer Price  level to the current minimum interest charge threshold has risen by a  whole dollar, the minimum interest charge will be increased by $1.00.  The issuer may, at its option, disclose in the table minimum interest  charges below this threshold.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Transaction charges. Any transaction charge imposed by the card  issuer for the use of the card for purchases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Grace period. The date by which or the period within which any  credit extended for purchases may be repaid without incurring a finance  charge due to a periodic interest rate and any conditions on the  availability of the grace period. If no grace period is provided, that  fact must be disclosed. If the length of the grace period varies, the  card issuer may disclose the range of days, the minimum number of days,  or the average number of days in the grace period, if the disclosure is  identified as a range, minimum, or average. In disclosing in the tabular  format a grace period that applies to all types of purchases, the phrase  ``How to Avoid Paying Interest on Purchases'' shall be used as the  heading for the row describing the grace period. If a grace period is  not offered on all types of purchases, in disclosing this fact in the  tabular format, the phrase ``Paying Interest'' shall be used as the  heading for the row describing this fact.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Balance computation method. The name of the balance computation  method listed in paragraph (g) of this section that is used to determine  the balance for purchases on which the finance charge is computed, or an  explanation of the method used if it is not listed. In determining which  balance computation method to disclose, the card issuer shall assume  that credit extended for purchases will not be repaid within the grace  period, if any.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Statement on charge card payments. A statement that charges  incurred by use of the charge card are due when the periodic statement  is received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Cash advance fee. Any fee imposed for an extension of credit in  the form of cash or its equivalent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Late payment fee. Any fee imposed for a late payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Over-the-limit fee. Any fee imposed for exceeding a credit  limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Balance transfer fee. Any fee imposed to transfer an  outstanding balance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Returned-payment fee. Any fee imposed by the card issuer for a  returned payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Required insurance, debt cancellation or debt suspension  coverage. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A fee for insurance described in Sec. 1026.4(b)(7)   or debt cancellation or suspension coverage described in Sec.  1026.4(b)(10), if the insurance or debt cancellation or suspension  coverage is required as part of the plan; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A cross reference to any additional information provided about  the insurance or coverage accompanying the application or solicitation,  as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Available credit. If a card issuer requires fees for the  issuance or availability of credit described in paragraph (b)(2) of this  section, or requires a security deposit for such credit, and the total  amount of those required fees and/or security deposit that will be  imposed and charged to the account when the account is opened is 15  percent or more of the minimum credit limit for the card, a card issuer  must disclose the available credit remaining after these fees or  security deposit are debited to the account, assuming that the consumer  receives the minimum credit limit. In determining whether the 15 percent  threshold test is met, the issuer must only consider fees for issuance  or availability of credit, or a security deposit, that are required. If  fees for issuance or availability are optional, these fees should not be  considered in determining whether the disclosure must be given.  Nonetheless, if the 15 percent threshold test is met, the issuer in  providing the disclosure must disclose the amount of available credit  calculated by excluding those optional fees, and the available credit  including those optional fees. This paragraph does not apply with  respect to fees or security deposits that are not debited to the  account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Web site reference. A reference to the Web site established by  the Bureau and a statement that consumers may obtain on the Web site  information about shopping for and using credit cards.

An accurate variable annual percentage rate is one in effect  within 60 days before mailing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Disclosures provided in electronic form must be accurate as of  the time they are sent, in the case of disclosures sent to a consumer's  email address, or as of the time they are viewed by the public, in the  case of disclosures made available at a location such as a card issuer's  Web site. An accurate variable annual percentage rate provided in  electronic form is one in effect within 30 days before it is sent to a  consumer's email address, or viewed by the public, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Telephone applications and solicitations--(1) Oral disclosure.  The card issuer shall disclose orally the information in paragraphs  (b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> through (7) and (b)(14) of this section, to the extent  applicable, in a telephone application or solicitation initiated by the  card issuer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Alternative disclosure.

A variable annual percentage rate is one that is accurate if  it was:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In effect at the time the disclosures are mailed or delivered;  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In effect as of a specified date (which rate is then updated  from time to time, but no less frequently than each calendar month).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Disclosure of required credit information.

A variable  annual percentage rate is accurate if it was in effect within 30 days  before printing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> In-person applications and solicitations. A card issuer shall  disclose the information in paragraph (b) of this section, to the extent  applicable, on or with an application or solicitation that is initiated  by the card issuer and given to the consumer in person.

This balance  is figured by adding the outstanding balance (including new purchases  and deducting payments and credits) for each day in the billing cycle,  and then dividing by the number of days in the billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Average daily balance (excluding new purchases). This balance  is figured by adding the outstanding balance (excluding new purchases  and deducting payments and credits) for each day in the billing cycle,  and then dividing by the number of days in the billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Adjusted balance. This balance is figured by deducting payments  and credits made during the billing cycle from the outstanding balance  at the beginning of the billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Previous balance. This balance is the outstanding balance at the  beginning of the billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Daily balance.

The term ``related  person'' refers to, for example, a franchised or licensed seller of a  creditor's product or service or a seller who assigns or sells sales  accounts to a creditor or arranges for credit under a plan that allows  the consumer to use the credit only in transactions with that seller.

(Where a portion of the finance  charge is determined by application of one or more daily periodic rates,  the phrase ``sum of the balances'' shall also mean the ``average of  daily balances.'') In every case, the full amount of transactions  subject to specific transaction charges shall be included in the  denominator. Other balances or parts of balances shall be included  according to the manner of determining the balance subject to a periodic  rate, as illustrated in the following examples of accounts on monthly  billing cycles:</p><p class="depth0">1. Previous balance--none.</p><p class="depth0">A specific transaction of $100 occurs on the first day of the  billing cycle. The average daily balance is $100. A specific transaction  charge of 3% is applicable to the specific transaction. The periodic  rate is 1\1/2\% applicable to the average daily balance. The numerator  is the amount of the finance charge, which is $4.50. The denominator is  the amount of the transaction (which is $100), plus the amount by which  the balance subject to the periodic rate exceeds the amount of the  specific transactions (such excess in this case is 0), totaling $100.</p><p class="depth0">The annual percentage rate is the quotient (which is 4\1/2\%)  multiplied by 12 (the number of months in a year), i.e., 54%.</p><p class="depth0">2. Previous balance--$100.</p><p class="depth0">A specific transaction of $100 occurs at the midpoint of the billing  cycle. The average daily balance is $150. A specific transaction charge  of 3% is applicable to the specific transaction. The periodic rate is  1\1/2\% applicable to the average daily balance. The numerator is the  amount of the finance charge   which is $5.25. The denominator is the amount of the transaction (which  is $100), plus the amount by which the balance subject to the periodic  rate exceeds the amount of the specific transaction (such excess in this  case is $50), totaling $150. As explained in example 1, the annual  percentage rate is 3\1/2\% x 12 = 42%.</p><p class="depth0">3. If, in example 2, the periodic rate applies only to the previous  balance, the numerator is $4.50 and the denominator is $200 (the amount  of the transaction, $100, plus the balance subject only to the periodic  rate, the $100 previous balance). As explained in example 1, the annual  percentage rate is 2\1/4\% x 12 = 27%.</p><p class="depth0">4. If, in example 2, the periodic rate applies only to an adjusted  balance (previous balance less payments and credits) and the consumer  made a payment of $50 at the midpoint of the billing cycle, the  numerator is $3.75 and the denominator is $150 (the amount of the  transaction, $100, plus the balance subject to the periodic rate, the  $50 adjusted balance). As explained in example 1, the annual percentage  rate is 2\1/2\% x 12 = 30%.</p><p class="depth0">5. Previous balance--$100.</p><p class="depth0">A specific transaction (check) of $100 occurs at the midpoint of the  billing cycle. The average daily balance is $150. The specific  transaction charge is $.25 per check. The periodic rate is 1\1/2\%  applied to the average daily balance. The numerator is the amount of the  finance charge, which is $2.50 and includes the $.25 check charge and  the $2.25 resulting from the application of the periodic rate. The  denominator is the full amount of the specific transaction (which is  $100) plus the amount by which the average daily balance exceeds the  amount of the specific transaction (which in this case is $50), totaling  $150. As explained in example 1, the annual percentage rate would be 1- 2/3% x 12 = 20%.</p><p class="depth0">6. Previous balance--none.</p><p class="depth0">A specific transaction of $100 occurs at the midpoint of the billing  cycle. The average daily balance is $50. The specific transaction charge  is 3% of the transaction amount or $3.00. The periodic rate is 1\1/2\%  per month applied to the average daily balance. The numerator is the  amount of the finance charge, which is $3.75, including the $3.00  transaction charge and $.75 resulting from application of the periodic  rate. The denominator is the full amount of the specific transaction  ($100) plus the amount by which the balance subject to the periodic rate  exceeds the amount of the transaction ($0). Where the specific  transaction amount exceeds the balance subject to the periodic rate, the  resulting number is considered to be zero rather than a negative number  ($50 - $100 = -$50). The denominator, in this case, is $100. As  explained in example 1, the annual percentage rate is 3\3/4\% x 12 =  45%.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.

Creditors are required to disclose a series of  total annual loan cost rates for each reverse mortgage transaction. This  appendix contains the equations creditors must use in computing the  total annual loan cost rate for various transactions, as well as  instructions, explanations, and examples for various transactions. This  appendix is modeled after appendix J of this part (Annual Percentage  Rates Computations for Closed-end Credit Transactions); creditors should  consult appendix J of this part for additional guidance in using the  formulas for reverse mortgages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Instructions and equations for the total annual loan cost rate-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. The total annual loan cost rate shall be the nominal  total annual loan cost rate determined by multiplying the unit-period  rate by the number of unit-periods in a year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Term of the transaction. For purposes of total annual loan cost  disclosures, the term of a reverse mortgage transaction is assumed to  begin on the first of the month in which consummation is expected to  occur. If a loan cost or any portion of a loan cost is initially  incurred beginning on a date later than consummation, the term of the  transaction is assumed to begin on the first of the month in which that  loan cost is incurred. For purposes of total annual loan cost  disclosures, the term ends on each of the assumed loan periods specified  in Sec. 1026.33(c)(6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Definitions of time intervals. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A period is the interval of  time between advances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A common period is any period that occurs more than once in a  transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A standard interval of time is a day, week, semimonth, month,  or a multiple of a week or a month up to, but not exceeding, 1 year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> All months shall be considered to have an equal number of days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Unit-period. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In all transactions other than single-advance,  single-payment transactions, the unit-period shall be that common  period, not to exceed one year, that occurs most frequently in the  transaction, except that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If two or more common periods occur with equal frequency, the  smaller of such common periods shall be the unit-period; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If there is no common period in the transaction, the unit-period  shall be that period which is the average of all periods rounded to the  nearest whole standard interval of time.

The number of full unit-periods shall  be determined by dividing the number of days by 15 in the case of a  semimonthly unit-period or by the appropriate multiple of 30 in the case  of a multimonthly unit-period. If the unit-period is a semimonth, the  number of unit-periods per year shall be 24.

The total annual loan cost rate shall  be based on the assumption that 50 percent of the principal loan amount  is advanced at closing, or in the case of an open-end transaction, at  the time the consumer becomes obligated under the plan. Creditors shall  assume the advances are made at the interest rate then in effect and  that no further advances are made to, or repayments made by, the  consumer during the term of the transaction or plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Assumption for variable-rate reverse mortgage transactions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix M1 to Part 1026--Repayment Disclosures</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> ``Promotional terms'' means terms of a  cardholder's account that will expire in a fixed period of time, as set  forth by the card issuer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> ``Deferred interest or similar plan'' means a plan where a  consumer will not be obligated to pay interest that accrues on balances  or transactions if those balances or transactions are paid in full prior  to the expiration of a specified period of time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Calculating minimum payment repayment estimates--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Minimum  payment formulas. When calculating the minimum payment repayment  estimate, card issuers must use the minimum payment formula(s) that  apply to a cardholder's account. If more than one minimum payment  formula applies to an account, the issuer must apply each minimum  payment formula to the portion of the balance to which the formula  applies. In this case, the issuer must disclose the longest repayment  period calculated. For example, assume that an issuer uses one minimum  payment formula to calculate the minimum payment amount for a general  revolving feature, and another minimum payment formula to calculate the  minimum payment amount for special purchases, such as a ``club plan  purchase.'' Also, assume that based on a consumer's balances in these  features and the annual percentage rates that apply to such features,  the repayment period calculated pursuant to this appendix for the  general revolving feature is 5 years, while the repayment period  calculated for the special purchase feature is 3 years. This issuer must  disclose 5 years as the repayment period for the entire balance to the  consumer. If any promotional terms related to payments apply to a  cardholder's account, such as a deferred billing plan where minimum  payments are not required for 12 months, card issuers may assume no  promotional terms apply to the account. For example, assume that a  promotional minimum payment of $10 applies to an account for six months,  and then after the promotional period expires, the minimum payment is  calculated as 2 percent of the outstanding balance on the account or $20  whichever is greater. An issuer may assume during the promotional period  that the $10 promotional minimum payment does not apply, and instead  calculate the minimum payment disclosures based on the minimum payment  formula of 2 percent of the outstanding balance or $20, whichever is  greater. Alternatively, during the promotional period, an issuer in  calculating the minimum payment repayment estimate may apply the  promotional minimum payment until it expires and then apply the minimum  payment formula that applies after the promotional minimum payment  expires. In the above example, an issuer could calculate the minimum  payment repayment estimate during the promotional period by applying the  $10 promotional minimum payment for the first six months and then  applying the 2 percent or $20 (whichever is greater) minimum payment  formula after the promotional minimum payment expires. In calculating  the minimum payment repayment estimate during a promotional period, an  issuer may not assume that the promotional minimum payment will apply  until the outstanding balance is paid off by making only minimum  payments (assuming the repayment estimate is longer than the promotional  period). In the above example, the issuer may not calculate the minimum  payment repayment estimate during the promotional period by assuming  that the $10 promotional minimum payment will apply beyond the six  months until the outstanding balance is repaid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Annual percentage rate. When calculating the minimum payment  repayment estimate, a card issuer must use the annual percentage rates  that apply to a cardholder's account, based on the portion of the  balance to which the rate applies. If any promotional terms related to  annual percentage rates apply to a cardholder's account, other than  deferred interest or similar plans, a card issuer in calculating the  minimum payment repayment estimate during the promotional period must  apply the promotional annual percentage rate(s) until it expires and  then must apply the rate that applies after the   promotional rate(s) expires. If the rate that applies after the  promotional rate(s) expires is a variable rate, a card issuer must  calculate that rate based on the applicable index or formula. This  variable rate is accurate if it was in effect within the last 30 days  before the minimum payment repayment estimate is provided. For deferred  interest plans or similar plans, if minimum payments under the deferred  interest or similar plan will repay the balances or transactions in full  prior to the expiration of the specified period of time, a card issuer  must assume that the consumer will not be obligated to pay the accrued  interest. This means, in calculating the minimum payment repayment  estimate, the card issuer must apply a zero percent annual percentage  rate to the balance subject to the deferred interest or similar plan.  If, however, minimum payments under the deferred interest plan or  similar plan may not repay the balances or transactions in full prior to  the expiration of the specified period of time, a card issuer must  assume that a consumer will not repay the balances or transactions in  full prior to the expiration of the specified period of time and thus  the consumer will be obligated to pay the accrued interest. This means,  in calculating the minimum payment repayment estimate, the card issuer  must apply the annual percentage rate at which interest is accruing to  the balance subject to the deferred interest or similar plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Beginning balance. When calculating the minimum payment  repayment estimate, a card issuer must use as the beginning balance the  outstanding balance on a consumer's account as of the closing date of  the last billing cycle. When calculating the minimum payment repayment  estimate, a card issuer may round the beginning balance as described  above to the nearest whole dollar.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Assumptions. When calculating the minimum payment repayment  estimate, a card issuer for each of the terms below, may either make the  following assumption about that term, or use the account term that  applies to a consumer's account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Only minimum monthly payments are made each month. In addition,  minimum monthly payments are made each month--for example, a debt  cancellation or suspension agreement, or skip payment feature does not  apply to the account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> No additional extensions of credit are obtained, such as new  purchases, transactions, fees, charges or other activity. No refunds or  rebates are given.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The annual percentage rate or rates that apply to a  cardholder's account will not change, through either the operation of a  variable rate or the change to a rate, except as provided in paragraph  (b)(2) of this Appendix. For example, if a penalty annual percentage  rate currently applies to a consumer's account, a card issuer may assume  that the penalty annual percentage rate will apply to the consumer's  account indefinitely, even if the consumer may potentially return to a  non-penalty annual percentage rate in the future under the account  agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> There is no grace period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The final payment pays the account in full (i.e., there is no  residual finance charge after the final month in a series of payments).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The average daily balance method is used to calculate the  balance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> All months are the same length and leap year is ignored. A  monthly or daily periodic rate may be assumed. If a daily periodic rate  is assumed, the issuer may either assume (1) a year is 365 days long,  and all months are 30.41667 days long, or (2) a year is 360 days long,  and all months are 30 days long.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Payments are credited either on the last day of the month or  the last day of the billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Payments are allocated to lower annual percentage rate balances  before higher annual percentage rate balances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> The account is not past due and the account balance does not  exceed the credit limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> When calculating the minimum payment repayment estimate, the  assumed payments, current balance and interest charges for each month  may be rounded to the nearest cent, as shown in appendix M2 to this  part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Tolerance. A minimum payment repayment estimate shall be  considered accurate if it is not more than 2 months above or below the  minimum payment repayment estimate determined in accordance with the  guidance in this appendix (prior to rounding described in Sec.  1026.7(b)(12)(i)(B) and without use of the assumptions listed in  paragraph (b)(4) of this appendix to the extent a card issuer chooses  instead to use the account terms that apply to a consumer's account).  For example, assume the minimum payment repayment estimate calculated  using the guidance in this appendix is 28 months (2 years, 4 months),  and the minimum payment repayment estimate calculated by the issuer is  30 months (2 years, 6 months). The minimum payment repayment estimate  should be disclosed as 2 years, due to the rounding rule set forth in  Sec. 1026.7(b)(12)(i)(B). Nonetheless, based on the 30-month estimate,  the issuer disclosed 3 years, based on that rounding rule. The issuer  would be in compliance with this guidance by disclosing 3 years, instead  of 2 years, because the issuer's estimate is within the 2 months'  tolerance, prior to rounding. In addition, even if an issuer's estimate  is more than 2 months above or below the minimum payment repayment  estimate calculated using the guidance in this Appendix, so long as the  issuer discloses the   correct number of years to the consumer based on the rounding rule set  forth in Sec. 1026.7(b)(12)(i)(B), the issuer would be in compliance  with this guidance. For example, assume the minimum payment repayment  estimate calculated using the guidance in this appendix is 32 months (2  years, 8 months), and the minimum payment repayment estimate calculated  by the issuer is 38 months (3 years, 2 months). Under the rounding rule  set forth in Sec. 1026.7(b)(12)(i)(B), both of these estimates would be  rounded and disclosed to the consumer as 3 years. Thus, if the issuer  disclosed 3 years to the consumer, the issuer would be in compliance  with this guidance even though the minimum payment repayment estimate  calculated by the issuer is outside the 2 months' tolerance amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Calculating the minimum payment total cost estimate. When  calculating the minimum payment total cost estimate, a card issuer must  total the dollar amount of the interest and principal that the consumer  would pay if he or she made minimum payments for the length of time  calculated as the minimum payment repayment estimate under paragraph (b)  of this Appendix. The minimum payment total cost estimate is deemed to  be accurate if it is based on a minimum payment repayment estimate that  is within the tolerance guidance set forth in paragraph (b)(5) of this  Appendix. For example, assume the minimum payment repayment estimate  calculated using the guidance in this appendix is 28 months (2 years, 4  months), and the minimum payment repayment estimate calculated by the  issuer is 30 months (2 years, 6 months). The minimum payment total cost  estimate will be deemed accurate even if it is based on the 30 month  estimate for length of repayment, because the issuer's minimum payment  repayment estimate is within the 2 months' tolerance, prior to rounding.  In addition, assume the minimum payment repayment estimate calculated  under this appendix is 32 months (2 years, 8 months), and the minimum  payment repayment estimate calculated by the issuer is 38 months (3  years, 2 months). Under the rounding rule set forth in Sec.  1026.7(b)(12)(i)(B), both of these estimates would be rounded and  disclosed to the consumer as 3 years. If the issuer based the minimum  payment total cost estimate on 38 months (or any other minimum payment  repayment estimate that would be rounded to 3 years), the minimum  payment total cost estimate would be deemed to be accurate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Calculating the estimated monthly payment for repayment in 36  months--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. When calculating the estimated monthly payment  for repayment in 36 months, a card issuer must calculate the estimated  monthly payment amount that would be required to pay off the outstanding  balance shown on the statement within 36 months, assuming the consumer  paid the same amount each month for 36 months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Weighted annual percentage rate. In calculating the estimated  monthly payment for repayment in 36 months, an issuer may use a weighted  annual percentage rate that is based on the annual percentage rates that  apply to a cardholder's account and the portion of the balance to which  the rate applies, as shown in appendix M2 to this part. If a card issuer  uses a weighted annual percentage rate and any promotional terms related  to annual percentage rates apply to a cardholder's account, other than  deferred interest plans or similar plans, in calculating the weighted  annual percentage rate, the issuer must calculate a weighted average of  the promotional rate and the rate that will apply after the promotional  rate expires based on the percentage of 36 months each rate will apply,  as shown in appendix M2 to this part. For deferred interest plans or  similar plans, if minimum payments under the deferred interest or  similar plan will repay the balances or transactions in full prior to  the expiration of the specified period of time, if a card issuer uses a  weighted annual percentage rate, the card issuer must assume that the  consumer will not be obligated to pay the accrued interest. This means,  in calculating the weighted annual percentage rate, the card issuer must  apply a zero percent annual percentage rate to the balance subject to  the deferred interest or similar plan. If, however, minimum payments  under the deferred interest plan or similar plan may not repay the  balances or transactions in full prior to the expiration of the  specified period of time, a card issuer in calculating the weighted  annual percentage rate must assume that a consumer will not repay the  balances or transactions in full prior to the expiration of the  specified period of time and thus the consumer will be obligated to pay  the accrued interest. This means, in calculating the weighted annual  percentage rate, the card issuer must apply the annual percentage rate  at which interest is accruing to the balance subject to the deferred  interest or similar plan. A card issuer may use a method of calculating  the estimated monthly payment for repayment in 36 months other than a  weighted annual percentage rate, so long as the calculation results in  the same payment amount each month and so long as the total of the  payments would pay off the outstanding balance shown on the periodic  statement within 36 months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Assumptions. In calculating the estimated monthly payment for  repayment in 36 months, a card issuer must use the same terms described  in paragraph (b) of this Appendix, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Tolerance. An estimated monthly payment for repayment in 36  months shall be considered accurate if it is not more than 10 percent  above or below the estimated monthly payment for repayment in 36 months  determined in accordance with the guidance in   this appendix (after rounding described in Sec.  1026.7(b)(12)(i)(F)(1)(i)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Calculating the total cost estimate for repayment in 36 months.  When calculating the total cost estimate for repayment in 36 months, a  card issuer must total the dollar amount of the interest and principal  that the consumer would pay if he or she made the estimated monthly  payment calculated under paragraph (d) of this appendix each month for  36 months. The total cost estimate for repayment in 36 months shall be  considered accurate if it is based on the estimated monthly payment for  repayment in 36 months that is calculated in accordance with paragraph  (d) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Calculating the savings estimate for repayment in 36 months.  When calculating the savings estimate for repayment in 36 months, if a  card issuer chooses under Sec. 1026.7(b)(12)(i) to round the  disclosures to the nearest whole dollar when disclosing them on the  periodic statement, the card issuer must calculate the savings estimate  for repayment in 36 months by subtracting the total cost estimate for  repayment in 36 months calculated under paragraph (e) of this appendix  (rounded to the nearest whole dollar) from the minimum payment total  cost estimate calculated under paragraph (c) of this appendix (rounded  to the nearest whole dollar). If a card issuer chooses under Sec.  1026.7(b)(12)(i), however, to round the disclosures to the nearest cent  when disclosing them on the periodic statement, the card issuer must  calculate the savings estimate for repayment in 36 months by subtracting  the total cost estimate for repayment in 36 months calculated under  paragraph (e) of this appendix (rounded to the nearest cent) from the  minimum payment total cost estimate calculated under paragraph (c) of  this appendix (rounded to the nearest cent). The savings estimate for  repayment in 36 months shall be considered accurate if it is based on  the total cost estimate for repayment in 36 months that is calculated in  accordance with paragraph (e) of this appendix and the minimum payment  total cost estimate calculated under paragraph (c) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.

Appendix Q to Part 1026--Standards for Determining Monthly Debt and</p><p class="depth0">Income</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.43(e)(2)(vi) provides that, to satisfy the requirements  for a qualified mortgage under Sec. 1026.43(e)(2), the ratio of the  consumer's total monthly debt payments to total monthly income at the  time of consummation cannot exceed 43 percent. Section  1026.43(e)(2)(vi)(A) requires the creditor to calculate the ratio of the  consumer's total monthly debt payments to total monthly income using the  following standards, with additional requirements for calculating debt  and income appearing in Sec. 1026.43(e)(2)(vi)(B). Where guidance  issued by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the U.S.  Department of Veterans Affairs, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or  the Rural Housing Service, or issued by the Federal National Mortgage  Association (Fannie Mae) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation  (Freddie Mac) while operating under the conservatorship or receivership  of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or issued by a limited-life  regulatory entity succeeding the charter of either Fannie Mae or Freddie  Mac (collectively, Agency or GSE guidance) is in accordance with  appendix Q, creditors may look to that guidance as a helpful resource in  applying appendix Q. Moreover, when the following standards do not  resolve how a specific kind of debt or income should be treated, the  creditor may either (1) exclude the income or include the debt, or (2)  rely on Agency or GSE guidance to resolve the issue. The following  standards resolve the appropriate treatment of a specific kind of debt  or income where the standards provide a discernible answer to the  question of how to treat the debt or income. However, a creditor may not  rely on Agency or GSE guidance to reach a resolution contrary to that  provided by the following standards, even if such Agency or GSE guidance  specifically addresses the particular type of debt or income but the  following standards provide more generalized guidance.</p><p class="depth0">I. Consumer Employment Related Income</p><p class="depth0">A. Stability of Income</p><p class="depth0">1. Effective Income. Income may not be used in calculating the  consumer's debt-to-income ratio if it comes from any source that cannot  be verified, is not stable, or will not continue.</p><p class="depth0">2. Verifying Employment History.</p><p class="depth0">a. The creditor must verify the consumer's employment for the most  recent two full years, and the creditor must require the consumer to:</p><p class="depth0">i. Explain any gaps in employment that span one or more months, and</p><p class="depth0">ii. Indicate if he/she was in school or the military for the recent  two full years, providing evidence supporting this claim, such as  college transcripts, or discharge papers.</p><p class="depth0">b. Allowances can be made for seasonal employment, typical for the  building trades and agriculture, if documented by the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">Note: A consumer with a 25 percent or greater ownership interest in  a business is considered self-employed and will be evaluated as a self- employed consumer.</p><p class="depth0">3. Analyzing a Consumer's Employment Record.</p><p class="depth0">a. When analyzing a consumer's employment, creditors must examine:</p><p class="depth0">i. The consumer's past employment record; and</p><p class="depth0">ii. The employer's confirmation of current, ongoing employment  status.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Creditors may assume that employment is ongoing if a  consumer's employer verifies current employment and does not indicate  that employment has been, or is set to be terminated. Creditors should  not rely upon a verification of current employment that includes an  affirmative statement that the employment is likely to cease, such as a  statement that indicates the employee has given (or been given) notice  of employment suspension or termination.</p><p class="depth0">b. Creditors may favorably consider the stability of a consumer's  income if he/she changes jobs frequently within the same line of work,  but continues to advance in income or benefits. In this analysis, income  stability takes precedence over job stability.</p><p class="depth0">4. Consumers Returning to Work After an Extended Absence. A  consumer's income may be considered effective and stable when recently  returning to work after an extended absence if he/she:</p><p class="depth0">a. Is employed in the current job for six months or longer; and</p><p class="depth0">b. Can document a two year work history prior to an absence from  employment using:</p><p class="depth0">i. Traditional employment verifications; and/or</p><p class="depth0">ii. Copies of IRS Form W-2s or pay stubs.</p><p class="depth0">Note: An acceptable employment situation includes individuals who  took several years off from employment to raise children, then returned  to the workforce.</p><p class="depth0">c. Important: Situations not meeting the criteria listed above may  not be used in qualifying. Extended absence is defined as six months.</p><p class="depth0">B. Salary, Wage and Other Forms of Income</p><p class="depth0">1. General Policy on Consumer Income Analysis.</p><p class="depth0">a. The income of each consumer who will be obligated for the  mortgage debt and whose income is being relied upon in determining  ability to repay must be analyzed to determine whether his/her income  level can be reasonably expected to continue.</p><p class="depth0">b. In most cases, a consumer's income is limited to salaries or  wages. Income from other sources can be considered as effective, when  properly verified and documented by the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">Notes: i. Effective income for consumers planning to retire during  the first three-year period must include the amount of:</p><p class="depth0">a. Documented retirement benefits;</p><p class="depth0">b. Social Security payments; or</p><p class="depth0">c. Other payments expected to be received in retirement.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Creditors must not ask the consumer about possible, future  maternity leave.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Creditors may assume that salary or wage income from employment  verified in accordance with section I.A.3 above can be reasonably  expected to continue if a consumer's employer verifies current  employment and income and does not indicate that employment has been, or  is set to be terminated. Creditors should not assume that income can be  reasonably expected to continue if a verification of current employment  includes an affirmative statement that the employment is likely to  cease, such as a statement that indicates the employee has given (or  been given) notice of employment suspension or termination.</p><p class="depth0">2. Overtime and Bonus Income.</p><p class="depth0">a. Overtime and bonus income can be used to qualify the consumer if  he/she has received this income for the past two years, and  documentation submitted for the loan does not indicate this income will  likely cease. If, for example, the employment verification states that  the overtime and bonus income is unlikely to continue, it may not be  used in qualifying.</p><p class="depth0">b. The creditor must develop an average of bonus or overtime income  for the past two years. Periods of overtime and bonus income less than  two years may be acceptable, provided the creditor can justify and  document in writing the reason for using the income for qualifying  purposes.</p><p class="depth0">3. Establishing an Overtime and Bonus Income Earning Trend.</p><p class="depth0">a. The creditor must establish and document an earnings trend for  overtime and bonus income. If either type of income shows a continual  decline, the creditor must document in writing a sound rationalization  for including the income when qualifying the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">b. A period of more than two years must be used in calculating the  average overtime and bonus income if the income varies significantly  from year to year.</p><p class="depth0">4. Qualifying Part-Time Income.</p><p class="depth0">a. Part-time and seasonal income can be used to qualify the consumer  if the creditor documents that the consumer has worked the part-time job  uninterrupted for the past two years, and plans to continue. Many low  and moderate income families rely on part-time and seasonal income for  day to day needs, and creditors should not restrict consideration of  such income when qualifying the income of these consumers.</p><p class="depth0">b. Part-time income received for less than two years may be included  as effective income, provided that the creditor justifies and documents  that the income is likely to continue.</p><p class="depth0">c. Part-time income not meeting the qualifying requirements may not  be used in qualifying.</p><p class="depth0">Note: For qualifying purposes, ``part-time'' income refers to  employment taken to supplement the consumer's income from regular  employment; part-time employment is not a primary job and it is worked  less than 40 hours.</p><p class="depth0">5. Income from Seasonal Employment.</p><p class="depth0">a. Seasonal income is considered uninterrupted, and may be used to  qualify the consumer, if the creditor documents that the consumer:</p><p class="depth0">i. Has worked the same job for the past two years, and</p><p class="depth0">ii. Expects to be rehired the next season.</p><p class="depth0">b. Seasonal employment includes, but is not limited to:</p><p class="depth0">i. Umpiring baseball games in the summer; or</p><p class="depth0">ii. Working at a department store during the holiday shopping  season.</p><p class="depth0">6. Primary Employment Less Than 40 Hour Work Week.</p><p class="depth0">a. When a consumer's primary employment is less than a typical 40- hour work week, the creditor should evaluate the stability of that  income as regular, on-going primary employment.</p><p class="depth0">b. Example: A registered nurse may have worked 24 hours per week for  the last year. Although this job is less than the 40-hour work week, it  is the consumer's primary employment, and should be considered effective  income.</p><p class="depth0">7. Commission Income.</p><p class="depth0">a. Commission income must be averaged over the previous two years.  To qualify commission income, the consumer must provide:</p><p class="depth0">i. Copies of signed tax returns for the last two years; and</p><p class="depth0">ii. The most recent pay stub.</p><p class="depth0">b. Consumers whose commission income was received for more than one  year, but less than two years may be considered favorably if the  underwriter can:</p><p class="depth0">i. Document the likelihood that the income will continue, and</p><p class="depth0">ii. Soundly rationalize accepting the commission income.</p><p class="depth0">Notes: i. Unreimbursed business expenses must be subtracted from  gross income.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A commissioned consumer is one who receives more than 25 percent  of his/her annual income from commissions.</p><p class="depth0">iii. A tax transcript obtained directly from the IRS may be used in  lieu of signed tax returns.</p><p class="depth0">8. Qualifying Commission Income Earned for Less Than One Year.</p><p class="depth0">a. Commission income earned for less than one year is not considered  effective income. Exceptions may be made for situations in which the  consumer's compensation was changed from salary to commission within a  similar position with the same employer.</p><p class="depth0">b. A consumer's income may also qualify when the portion of earnings  not attributed to commissions would be sufficient to qualify the  consumer for the mortgage.</p><p class="depth0">9. Employer Differential Payments.</p><p class="depth0">If the employer subsidizes a consumer's mortgage payment through  direct payments, the amount of the payments:</p><p class="depth0">a. Is considered gross income, and</p><p class="depth0">b. Cannot be used to offset the mortgage payment directly, even if  the employer pays the servicing creditor directly.</p><p class="depth0">10. Retirement Income.</p><p class="depth0">Retirement income must be verified from the former employer, or from  Federal tax returns. If any retirement income, such as employer pensions  or 401(k)'s, will cease within the first full three years of the  mortgage loan, such income may not be used in qualifying.</p><p class="depth0">11. Social Security Income.</p><p class="depth0">Social Security income must be verified by a Social Security  Administration benefit verification letter (sometimes called a ``proof  of income letter,'' ``budget letter,'' ``benefits letter,'' or ``proof  of award letter''). If any benefits expire within the first full three  years of the loan, the income source may not be used in qualifying.</p><p class="depth0">Notes: i. If the Social Security Administration benefit verification  letter does not indicate a defined expiration date within three years of  loan origination, the creditor shall consider the income effective and  likely to continue. Pending or current re-evaluation of medical  eligibility for benefit payments is not considered an indication that  the benefit payments are not likely to continue.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Some portion of Social Security income may be ``grossed up'' if  deemed nontaxable by the IRS.</p><p class="depth0">12. Automobile Allowances and Expense Account Payments.</p><p class="depth0">a. Only the amount by which the consumer's automobile allowance or  expense account payments exceed actual expenditures may be considered  income.</p><p class="depth0">b. To establish the amount to add to gross income, the consumer must  provide the following:</p><p class="depth0">i. IRS Form 2106, Employee Business Expenses, for the previous two  years; and</p><p class="depth0">ii. Employer verification that the payments will continue.</p><p class="depth0">c. If the consumer uses the standard per-mile rate in calculating  automobile expenses, as opposed to the actual cost method, the portion  that the IRS considers depreciation may be added back to income.</p><p class="depth0">d. Expenses that must be treated as recurring debt include:</p><p class="depth0">i. The consumer's monthly car payment; and</p><p class="depth0">ii. Any loss resulting from the calculation of the difference  between the actual expenditures and the expense account allowance.</p><p class="depth0">C. Consumers Employed by a Family Owned Business.</p><p class="depth0">1. Income Documentation Requirement.</p><p class="depth0">In addition to normal employment verification, a consumer employed  by a family owned business is required to provide evidence that he/she  is not an owner of the business, which may include:</p><p class="depth0">a. Copies of signed personal tax returns, or</p><p class="depth0">b. A signed copy of the corporate tax return showing ownership  percentage.</p><p class="depth0">Note: A tax transcript obtained directly from the IRS may be used in  lieu of signed tax returns.</p><p class="depth0">D. General Information on Self-Employed Consumers and Income Analysis.</p><p class="depth0">1. Definition: Self-Employed Consumer.</p><p class="depth0">A consumer with a 25 percent or greater ownership interest in a  business is considered self-employed.</p><p class="depth0">2. Types of Business Structures.</p><p class="depth0">There are four basic types of business structures. They include:</p><p class="depth0">a. Sole proprietorships;</p><p class="depth0">b. Corporations;</p><p class="depth0">c. Limited liability or ``S'' corporations; and</p><p class="depth0">d. Partnerships.</p><p class="depth0">3. Minimum Length of Self Employment.</p><p class="depth0">a. Income from self-employment is considered stable, and effective,  if the consumer has been self-employed for two or more years.</p><p class="depth0">b. Due to the high probability of failure during the first few years  of a business, the requirements described in the table below are  necessary for consumers who have been self-employed for less than two  years. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR24JY13.000</p><p class="depth0">4. General Documentation Requirements for Self-Employed Consumers.</p><p class="depth0">Self-employed consumers must provide the following documentation:</p><p class="depth0">a. Signed, dated individual tax returns, with all applicable tax  schedules for the most recent two years;</p><p class="depth0">b. For a corporation, ``S'' corporation, or partnership, signed  copies of Federal business income tax returns for the last two years,  with all applicable tax schedules; and</p><p class="depth0">c. Year to date profit and loss (P&L;) statement and balance sheet.</p><p class="depth0">5. Establishing a Self-Employed Consumer's Earnings Trend.</p><p class="depth0">a. When qualifying income, the creditor must establish the  consumer's earnings trend from the previous two years using the  consumer's tax returns.</p><p class="depth0">b. If a consumer:</p><p class="depth0">i. Provides quarterly tax returns, the income analysis may include  income through the period covered by the tax filings, or</p><p class="depth0">ii. Is not subject to quarterly tax returns, or does not file them,  then the income shown on the P&L; statement may be included in the  analysis, provided the income stream based on the P&L; is consistent with  the previous years' earnings.</p><p class="depth0">c. If the P&L; statements submitted for the current year show an  income stream considerably greater than what is supported by the  previous year's tax returns, the creditor must base the income analysis  solely on the income verified through the tax returns.</p><p class="depth0">d. If the consumer's earnings trend for the previous two years is  downward and the most recent tax return or P&L; is less than the prior  year's tax return, the consumer's most recent year's tax return or P&L;  must be used to calculate his/her income.</p><p class="depth0">6. Analyzing the Business's Financial Strength.</p><p class="depth0">The creditor must consider the business's financial strength by  examining annual earnings. Annual earnings that are stable or increasing  are acceptable, while businesses that show a significant decline in  income over the analysis period are not acceptable.</p><p class="depth0">E. Income Analysis: Individual Tax Returns (IRS Form 1040).</p><p class="depth0">1. General Policy on Adjusting Income Based on a Review of IRS Form  1040.</p><p class="depth0">The amount shown on a consumer's IRS Form 1040 as adjusted gross  income must either be increased or decreased based on the creditor's  analysis of the individual tax return and any related tax schedules.</p><p class="depth0">2. Guidelines for Analyzing IRS Form 1040.</p><p class="depth0">The table below contains guidelines for analyzing IRS Form 1040:   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR24JY13.001</p><p class="depth0">F. Income Analysis: Corporate Tax Returns (IRS Form 1120).</p><p class="depth0">1. Description: Corporation.</p><p class="depth0">A corporation is a State-chartered business owned by its  stockholders.</p><p class="depth0">2. Need To Obtain Consumer Percentage of Ownership Information.</p><p class="depth0">a. Corporate compensation to the officers, generally in proportion  to the percentage of ownership, is shown on the:</p><p class="depth0">i. Corporate tax return IRS Form 1120; and</p><p class="depth0">ii. Individual tax returns.</p><p class="depth0">b. When a consumer's percentage of ownership does not appear on the  tax returns, the creditor must obtain the information from the  corporation's accountant, along with evidence that the consumer has the  right to any compensation.</p><p class="depth0">3. Analyzing Corporate Tax Returns.</p><p class="depth0">a. In order to determine a consumer's self-employed income from a  corporation the adjusted business income must:</p><p class="depth0">i. Be determined; and</p><p class="depth0">ii. Multiplied by the consumer's percentage of ownership in the  business.</p><p class="depth0">b. The table below describes the items found on IRS Form 1120 for  which an adjustment must be made in order to determine adjusted business  income. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR24JY13.002</p><p class="depth0">G. Income Analysis: ``S'' Corporation Tax Returns (IRS Form 1120S).</p><p class="depth0">1. Description: ``S'' Corporation.</p><p class="depth0">a. An ``S'' corporation is generally a small, start-up business,  with gains and losses passed to stockholders in proportion to each  stockholder's percentage of business ownership.</p><p class="depth0">b. Income for owners of ``S'' corporations comes from IRS Form W-2  wages, and is taxed at the individual rate. The IRS Form 1120S,  Compensation of Officers line item is transferred to the consumer's  individual IRS Form 1040.</p><p class="depth0">2. Analyzing ``S'' Corporation Tax Returns.</p><p class="depth0">a. ``S'' corporation depreciation and depletion may be added back to  income in proportion to the consumer's share of the corporation's  income.</p><p class="depth0">b. In addition, the income must also be reduced proportionately by  the total obligations payable by the corporation in less than one year.</p><p class="depth0">c. Important: The consumer's withdrawal of cash from the corporation  may have a severe negative impact on the corporation's ability to  continue operating, and must be considered in the income analysis.</p><p class="depth0">H. Income Analysis: Partnership Tax Returns (IRS Form 1065).</p><p class="depth0">1. Description: Partnership.</p><p class="depth0">a. A partnership is formed when two or more individuals form a  business, and share in profits, losses, and responsibility for running  the company.</p><p class="depth0">b. Each partner pays taxes on his/her proportionate share of the  partnership's net income.</p><p class="depth0">2. Analyzing Partnership Tax Returns.</p><p class="depth0">a. Both general and limited partnerships report income on IRS Form  1065, and the partners' share of income is carried over to Schedule E of  IRS Form 1040.</p><p class="depth0">b. The creditor must review IRS Form 1065 to assess the viability of  the business. Both depreciation and depletion may be added back to the  income in proportion to the consumer's share of income.</p><p class="depth0">c. Income must also be reduced proportionately by the total  obligations payable by the partnership in less than one year.</p><p class="depth0">d. Important: Cash withdrawals from the partnership may have a  severe negative impact on the partnership's ability to continue  operating, and must be considered in the income analysis.</p><p class="depth0">II. Non-Employment Related Consumer Income</p><p class="depth0">A. Alimony, Child Support, and Maintenance Income Criteria.</p><p class="depth0">Alimony, child support, or maintenance income may be considered  effective, if:</p><p class="depth0">1. Payments are likely to be received consistently for the first  three years of the mortgage;</p><p class="depth0">2. The consumer provides the required documentation, which includes  a copy of the:</p><p class="depth0">i. Final divorce decree;</p><p class="depth0">ii. Legal separation agreement;</p><p class="depth0">iii. Court order; or</p><p class="depth0">iv. Voluntary payment agreement; and</p><p class="depth0">3. The consumer can provide acceptable evidence that payments have  been received during the last 12 months, such as:</p><p class="depth0">i. Cancelled checks;</p><p class="depth0">ii. Deposit slips;</p><p class="depth0">iii. Tax returns; or</p><p class="depth0">iv. Court records.</p><p class="depth0">Notes: i. Periods less than 12 months may be acceptable, provided  the creditor can adequately document the payer's ability and willingness  to make timely payments.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Child support may be ``grossed up'' under the same provisions as  non-taxable income sources.</p><p class="depth0">B. Investment and Trust Income.</p><p class="depth0">1. Analyzing Interest and Dividends.</p><p class="depth0">a. Interest and dividend income may be used as long as tax returns  or account statements support a two-year receipt history. This income  must be averaged over the two years.</p><p class="depth0">b. Subtract any funds that are derived from these sources, and are  required for the cash investment, before calculating the projected  interest or dividend income.</p><p class="depth0">2. Trust Income.</p><p class="depth0">a. Income from trusts may be used if constant payments will continue  for at least the first three years of the mortgage term as evidenced by  trust income documentation.</p><p class="depth0">b. Required trust income documentation includes a copy of the Trust  Agreement or other trustee statement, confirming the:</p><p class="depth0">i. Amount of the trust;</p><p class="depth0">ii. Frequency of distribution; and</p><p class="depth0">iii. Duration of payments.</p><p class="depth0">c. Trust account funds may be used for the required cash investment  if the consumer provides adequate documentation that the withdrawal of  funds will not negatively affect income. The consumer may use funds from  the trust account for the required cash investment, but the trust income  used to determine repayment ability cannot be affected negatively by its  use.</p><p class="depth0">3. Notes Receivable Income.</p><p class="depth0">a. In order to include notes receivable income, the consumer must  provide:</p><p class="depth0">i. A copy of the note to establish the amount and length of payment,  and</p><p class="depth0">ii. Evidence that these payments have been consistently received for  the last 12 months through deposit slips, deposit receipts, cancelled  checks, bank or other account statements, or tax returns.</p><p class="depth0">b. If the consumer is not the original payee on the note, the  creditor must establish that the consumer is able to enforce the note.</p><p class="depth0">4. Eligible Investment Properties.</p><p class="depth0">Follow the steps in the table below to calculate an investment  property's income or loss if the property to be subject to a mortgage is  an eligible investment property. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR24JY13.003</p><p class="depth0">C. Military, Government Agency, and Assistance Program Income.</p><p class="depth0">1. Military Income.</p><p class="depth0">a. Military personnel not only receive base pay, but often times are  entitled to additional forms of pay, such as:</p><p class="depth0">i. Income from variable housing allowances;</p><p class="depth0">ii. Clothing allowances;</p><p class="depth0">iii. Flight or hazard pay;</p><p class="depth0">iv. Rations; and</p><p class="depth0">v. Proficiency pay.</p><p class="depth0">b. These types of additional pay are acceptable when analyzing a  consumer's income as long as the probability of such pay to continue is  verified in writing.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The tax-exempt nature of some of the above payments should  also be considered.</p><p class="depth0">2. VA Benefits.</p><p class="depth0">a. Direct compensation for service-related disabilities from the  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is acceptable, provided the creditor  receives documentation from the VA.</p><p class="depth0">b. Education benefits used to offset education expenses are not  acceptable.</p><p class="depth0">3. Government Assistance Programs.</p><p class="depth0">a. Income received from government assistance programs is acceptable  as long as the paying agency provides documentation indicating that the  income is expected to continue for at least three years.</p><p class="depth0">b. If the income from government assistance programs will not be  received for at least three years, it may not be used in qualifying.</p><p class="depth0">c. Unemployment income must be documented for two years, and there  must be reasonable assurance that this income will continue. This  requirement may apply to seasonal employment.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Social Security income is acceptable as provided in section  I.B.11.</p><p class="depth0">4. Mortgage Credit Certificates.</p><p class="depth0">a. If a government entity subsidizes the mortgage payments either  through direct payments or tax rebates, these payments may be considered  as acceptable income.</p><p class="depth0">b. Either type of subsidy may be added to gross income, or used  directly to offset the mortgage payment, before calculating the  qualifying ratios.</p><p class="depth0">5. Homeownership Subsidies.</p><p class="depth0">a. A monthly subsidy may be treated as income, if a consumer is  receiving subsidies under the housing choice voucher home ownership  option from a public housing agency (PHA). Although continuation of the  homeownership voucher subsidy beyond the first year is subject to  Congressional appropriation, for the purposes of underwriting, the  subsidy will be assumed to continue for at least three years.</p><p class="depth0">b. If the consumer is receiving the subsidy directly, the amount  received is treated as income. The amount received may also be treated  as nontaxable income and be ``grossed up'' by 25 percent, which means  that the amount of the subsidy, plus 25 percent of that subsidy may be  added to the consumer's income from employment and/or other sources.</p><p class="depth0">c. Creditors may treat this subsidy as an ``offset'' to the monthly  mortgage payment (that is, reduce the monthly mortgage payment by the  amount of the home ownership assistance payment before dividing by the  monthly income to determine the payment-to-income and debt-to-income  ratios). The subsidy payment must not pass through the consumer's hands.</p><p class="depth0">d. The assistance payment must be:</p><p class="depth0">i. Paid directly to the servicing creditor; or</p><p class="depth0">ii. Placed in an account that only the servicing creditor may  access.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Assistance payments made directly to the consumer must be  treated as income.</p><p class="depth0">D. Rental Income.</p><p class="depth0">1. Analyzing the Stability of Rental Income.</p><p class="depth0">a. Rent received for properties owned by the consumer is acceptable  as long as the creditor can document the stability of the rental income  through:</p><p class="depth0">i. A current lease;</p><p class="depth0">ii. An agreement to lease; or</p><p class="depth0">iii. A rental history over the previous 24 months that is free of  unexplained gaps greater than three months (such gaps could be explained  by student, seasonal, or military renters, or property rehabilitation).</p><p class="depth0">b. A separate schedule of real estate is not required for rental  properties as long as all properties are documented on the Uniform  Residential Loan Application.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The underwriting analysis may not consider rental income from  any property being vacated by the consumer, except under the  circumstances described below.</p><p class="depth0">2. Rental Income From Consumer Occupied Property.</p><p class="depth0">a. The rent for multiple unit property where the consumer resides in  one or more units and charges rent to tenants of other units may be used  for qualifying purposes.</p><p class="depth0">b. Projected rent for the tenant-occupied units only may:</p><p class="depth0">i. Be considered gross income, only after deducting vacancy and  maintenance factors, and</p><p class="depth0">ii. Not be used as a direct offset to the mortgage payment.</p><p class="depth0">3. Income from Roommates or Boarders in a Single Family Property.</p><p class="depth0">a. Rental income from roommates or boarders in a single family  property occupied as the consumer's primary residence is acceptable.</p><p class="depth0">b. The rental income may be considered effective if shown on the  consumer's tax return. If not on the tax return, rental income paid by  the roommate or boarder may not be used in qualifying.</p><p class="depth0">4. Documentation Required To Verify Rental Income.</p><p class="depth0">Analysis of the following required documentation is necessary to  verify all consumer rental income:</p><p class="depth0">a. IRS Form 1040 Schedule E; and</p><p class="depth0">b. Current leases/rental agreements.</p><p class="depth0">5. Analyzing IRS Form 1040 Schedule E.</p><p class="depth0">a. The IRS Form 1040 Schedule E is required to verify all rental  income. Depreciation shown on Schedule E may be added back to the net  income or loss.</p><p class="depth0">b. Positive rental income is considered gross income for qualifying  purposes, while negative income must be treated as a recurring  liability.</p><p class="depth0">c. The creditor must confirm that the consumer still owns each  property listed, by comparing Schedule E with the real estate owned  section of the Uniform Residential Loan Application (URLA).</p><p class="depth0">6. Using Current Leases To Analyze Rental Income.</p><p class="depth0">a. The consumer can provide a current signed lease or other rental  agreement for a property that was acquired since the last income tax  filing, and is not shown on Schedule E.</p><p class="depth0">b. In order to calculate the rental income:</p><p class="depth0">i. Reduce the gross rental amount by 25 percent for vacancies and  maintenance;</p><p class="depth0">ii. Subtract PITI and any homeowners association dues; and</p><p class="depth0">iii. Apply the resulting amount to income, if positive, or recurring  debts, if negative.</p><p class="depth0">7. Exclusion of Rental Income From Property Being Vacated by the  Consumer. Underwriters may not consider any rental income from a  consumer's principal residence that is being vacated in favor of another  principal residence, except under the conditions described below:</p><p class="depth0">Notes: i. This policy assures that a consumer either has sufficient  income to make both mortgage payments without any rental income, or has  an equity position not likely to result in defaulting on the mortgage on  the property being vacated.</p><p class="depth0">ii. This applies solely to a principal residence being vacated in  favor of another principal residence. It does not apply to existing  rental properties disclosed on the loan application and confirmed by tax  returns (Schedule E of form IRS 1040).</p><p class="depth0">8. Policy Exceptions Regarding the Exclusion of Rental Income From a  Principal Residence Being Vacated by a Consumer.</p><p class="depth0">When a consumer vacates a principal residence in favor of another  principal residence, the rental income, reduced by the appropriate  vacancy factor, may be considered in the underwriting analysis under the  circumstances listed in the table below. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR24JY13.004</p><p class="depth0">E. Non-Taxable and Projected Income</p><p class="depth0">1. Types of Non-Taxable Income.</p><p class="depth0">Certain types of regular income may not be subject to Federal tax.  Such types of non-taxable income include:</p><p class="depth0">a. Some portion of Social Security, some Federal government employee  retirement income, Railroad Retirement Benefits, and some State  government retirement income;</p><p class="depth0">b. Certain types of disability and public assistance payments;</p><p class="depth0">c. Child support;</p><p class="depth0">d. Military allowances; and</p><p class="depth0">e. Other income that is documented as being exempt from Federal  income taxes.</p><p class="depth0">2. Adding Non-Taxable Income to a Consumer's Gross Income.</p><p class="depth0">a. The amount of continuing tax savings attributed to regular income  not subject to Federal taxes may be added to the consumer's gross  income.</p><p class="depth0">b. The percentage of non-taxable income that may be added cannot  exceed the appropriate tax rate for the income amount. Additional  allowances for dependents are not acceptable.</p><p class="depth0">c. The creditor:</p><p class="depth0">i. Must document and support the amount of income grossed up for any  non-taxable income source, and</p><p class="depth0">ii. Should use the tax rate used to calculate the consumer's last  year's income tax.</p><p class="depth0">Note: If the consumer is not required to file a Federal tax return,  the tax rate to use is 25 percent.</p><p class="depth0">3. Analyzing Projected Income.</p><p class="depth0">a. Projected or hypothetical income is not acceptable for qualifying  purposes. However, exceptions are permitted for income from the  following sources:</p><p class="depth0">i. Cost-of-living adjustments;</p><p class="depth0">ii. Performance raises; and</p><p class="depth0">iii. Bonuses.</p><p class="depth0">b. For the above exceptions to apply, the income must be:</p><p class="depth0">i. Verified in writing by the employer; and</p><p class="depth0">ii. Scheduled to begin within 60 days of loan closing.</p><p class="depth0">4. Projected Income for New Job.</p><p class="depth0">a. Projected income is acceptable for qualifying purposes for a  consumer scheduled to start a new job within 60 days of loan closing if  there is a guaranteed, non-revocable contract for employment.</p><p class="depth0">b. The creditor must verify that the consumer will have sufficient  income or cash reserves to support the mortgage payment and any other  obligations between loan closing and the start of employment. Examples  of this type of scenario are teachers whose contracts begin with the new  school year, or physicians beginning a residency after the loan closes.</p><p class="depth0">c. The income does not qualify if the loan closes more than 60 days  before the consumer starts the new job.</p><p class="depth0">III. Consumer Liabilities: Recurring Obligations</p><p class="depth0">1. Types of Recurring Obligation. Recurring obligations include:</p><p class="depth0">a. All installment loans;</p><p class="depth0">b. Revolving charge accounts;</p><p class="depth0">c. Real estate loans;</p><p class="depth0">d. Alimony;</p><p class="depth0">e. Child support; and</p><p class="depth0">f. Other continuing obligations.</p><p class="depth0">2. Debt to Income Ratio Computation for Recurring Obligations.</p><p class="depth0">a. The creditor must include the following when computing the debt  to income ratios for recurring obligations:</p><p class="depth0">i. Monthly housing expense; and</p><p class="depth0">ii. Additional recurring charges extending ten months or more, such  as</p><p class="depth0">a. Payments on installment accounts;</p><p class="depth0">b. Child support or separate maintenance payments;</p><p class="depth0">c. Revolving accounts; and</p><p class="depth0">d. Alimony.</p><p class="depth0">b. Debts lasting less than ten months must be included if the amount  of the debt affects the consumer's ability to pay the mortgage during  the months immediately after loan closing, especially if the consumer  will have limited or no cash assets after loan closing.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Monthly payments on revolving or open-ended accounts,  regardless of the balance, are counted as a liability for qualifying  purposes even if the account appears likely to be paid off within 10  months or less.</p><p class="depth0">3. Revolving Account Monthly Payment Calculation. If the credit  report shows any revolving accounts with an outstanding balance but no  specific minimum monthly payment, the payment must be calculated as the  greater of:</p><p class="depth0">a. 5 percent of the balance; or</p><p class="depth0">b. $10.</p><p class="depth0">Note: If the actual monthly payment is documented from the creditor  or the creditor obtains a copy of the current statement reflecting the  monthly payment, that amount may be used for qualifying purposes.</p><p class="depth0">4. Reduction of Alimony Payment for Qualifying Ratio Calculation.  Since there are tax consequences of alimony payments, the creditor may  choose to treat the monthly alimony obligation as a reduction from the  consumer's gross income when calculating the ratio, rather than treating  it as a monthly obligation.</p><p class="depth0">IV. Consumer Liabilities: Contingent Liability</p><p class="depth0">1. Definition: Contingent Liability. A contingent liability exists  when an individual is held responsible for payment of a debt if another  party, jointly or severally obligated, defaults on the payment.</p><p class="depth0">2. Application of Contingent Liability Policies. The contingent  liability policies described in this topic apply unless the consumer can  provide conclusive evidence from the debt holder that there is no  possibility that the debt holder will pursue debt collection against  him/her should the other party default.</p><p class="depth0">3. Contingent Liability on Mortgage Assumptions. Contingent  liability must be considered when the consumer remains obligated on an  outstanding FHA-insured, VA-guaranteed, or conventional mortgage secured  by property that:</p><p class="depth0">a. Has been sold or traded within the last 12 months without a  release of liability, or</p><p class="depth0">b. Is to be sold on assumption without a release of liability being  obtained.</p><p class="depth0">4. Exemption From Contingent Liability Policy on Mortgage  Assumptions. When a mortgage is assumed, contingent liabilities need not  be considered if the:</p><p class="depth0">a. Originating creditor of the mortgage being underwritten obtains,  from the servicer of the assumed loan, a payment history showing that  the mortgage has been current during the previous 12 months, or</p><p class="depth0">b. Value of the property, as established by an appraisal or the  sales price on the HUD-   1 Settlement Statement from the sale of the property, results in a loan- to-value (LTV) ratio of 75 percent or less.</p><p class="depth0">5. Contingent Liability on Cosigned Obligations.</p><p class="depth0">a. Contingent liability applies, and the debt must be included in  the underwriting analysis, if an individual applying for a mortgage is a  cosigner/co-obligor on:</p><p class="depth0">i. A car loan;</p><p class="depth0">ii. A student loan;</p><p class="depth0">iii. A mortgage; or</p><p class="depth0">iv. Any other obligation.</p><p class="depth0">b. If the creditor obtains documented proof that the primary obligor  has been making regular payments during the previous 12 months, and does  not have a history of delinquent payments on the loan during that time,  the payment does not have to be included in the consumer's monthly  obligations.</p><p class="depth0">V. Consumer Liabilities: Projected Obligations and Obligations Not</p><p class="depth0">Considered Debt</p><p class="depth0">1. Projected Obligations</p><p class="depth0">a. Debt payments, such as a student loan or balloon-payment note  scheduled to begin or come due within 12 months of the mortgage loan  closing, must be included by the creditor as anticipated monthly  obligations during the underwriting analysis.</p><p class="depth0">b. Debt payments do not have to be classified as projected  obligations if the consumer provides written evidence that the debt will  be deferred to a period outside the 12-month timeframe.</p><p class="depth0">c. Balloon-payment notes that come due within one year of loan  closing must be considered in the underwriting analysis.</p><p class="depth0">2. Obligations Not Considered Debt</p><p class="depth0">Obligations not considered debt, and therefore not subtracted from  gross income, include:</p><p class="depth0">a. Federal, State, and local taxes;</p><p class="depth0">b. Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) or other retirement  contributions, such as 401(k) accounts (including repayment of debt  secured by these funds):</p><p class="depth0">c. Commuting costs;</p><p class="depth0">d. Union dues;</p><p class="depth0">e. Open accounts with zero balances;</p><p class="depth0">f. Automatic deductions to savings accounts;</p><p class="depth0">g. Child care; and</p><p class="depth0">h. Voluntary deductions.  [78 FR 44718, July 24, 2013]</p><p class="depth0">Sec.

For  example, some of the comments to Sec. 1026.18(b) are further divided by  subparagraph, such as comment 18(b)(1)-1 and comment 18(b)(2)-1. In  other cases, comments have more general application and are designated,  for example, as comment 18-1 or comment 18(b)-1. This introduction may  be cited as comments I-1 through I-4. Comments to the appendices may be  cited, for example, as comment app. A-1.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart A--General  Section 1026.1--Authority, Purpose, Coverage, Organization, Enforcement</p><p class="depth0">and Liability</p><p class="depth0">1(c) Coverage</p><p class="depth0">1. Foreign applicability. Regulation Z applies to all persons  (including branches of foreign banks and sellers located in the United  States) that extend consumer credit to residents (including resident  aliens) of any state as defined in Sec. 1026.2. If an account is  located in the United States and credit is extended to a U.S. resident,  the transaction is subject to the regulation. This will be the case  whether or not a particular advance or purchase on the account takes  place in the United States and whether or not the extender of credit is  chartered or based in the   United States or a foreign country. For example, if a U.S. resident has  a credit card account located in the consumer's state issued by a bank  (whether U.S. or foreign-based), the account is covered by the  regulation, including extensions of credit under the account that occur  outside the United States. In contrast, if a U.S. resident residing or  visiting abroad, or a foreign national abroad, opens a credit card  account issued by a foreign branch of a U.S. bank, the account is not  covered by the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 1(c)(5)--1. Temporary exemption. Section 1026.1(c)(5)  implements sections 128(a)(16) through (19), 128(b)(4), 129C(f)(1),  129C(g)(2) and (3), 129C(h), 129D(h), 129D(j)(1)(A), and 129D(j)(1)(B)  of the Truth in Lending Act and section 4(c) of the Real Estate  Settlement Procedures Act, by exempting persons from the disclosure  requirements of those sections. These exemptions are intended to be  temporary, lasting only until regulations implementing the integrated  disclosures required by sections 1032(f), 1098, and 1100A of the Dodd- Frank Act (12 U.S.C. 5532(f), 12 U.S.C. 2603(a), 15 U.S.C. 1604(b))  become mandatory. Section 1026.1(c)(5) does not exempt any person from  any other requirement of this part, Regulation X (12 CFR part 1024), the  Truth in Lending Act, or the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.2--Definitions and Rules of Construction</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(2) Advertisement</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. Only commercial messages that promote consumer credit  transactions requiring disclosures are advertisements. Messages  inviting, offering, or otherwise announcing generally to prospective  customers the availability of credit transactions, whether in visual,  oral, or print media, are covered by Regulation Z (12 CFR part 1026).</p><p class="depth0">i. Examples include:</p><p class="depth0">A. Messages in a newspaper, magazine, leaflet, promotional flyer, or  catalog.</p><p class="depth0">B. Announcements on radio, television, or public address system.</p><p class="depth0">C. Electronic advertisements, such as on the Internet.</p><p class="depth0">D. Direct mail literature or other printed material on any exterior  or interior sign.</p><p class="depth0">E. Point of sale displays.</p><p class="depth0">F. Telephone solicitations.</p><p class="depth0">G. Price tags that contain credit information.</p><p class="depth0">H. Letters sent to customers or potential customers as part of an  organized solicitation of business.</p><p class="depth0">I. Messages on checking account statements offering auto loans at a  stated annual percentage rate.</p><p class="depth0">J. Communications promoting a new open-end plan or closed-end  transaction.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The term does not include:</p><p class="depth0">A. Direct personal contacts, such as follow-up letters, cost  estimates for individual consumers, or oral or written communication  relating to the negotiation of a specific transaction.</p><p class="depth0">B. Informational material, for example, interest-rate and loan-term  memos, distributed only to business entities.</p><p class="depth0">C. Notices required by Federal or state law, if the law mandates  that specific information be displayed and only the information so  mandated is included in the notice.</p><p class="depth0">D. News articles the use of which is controlled by the news medium.</p><p class="depth0">E. Market-research or educational materials that do not solicit  business.</p><p class="depth0">F. Communications about an existing credit account (for example, a  promotion encouraging additional or different uses of an existing credit  card account).</p><p class="depth0">2. Persons covered. All persons must comply with the advertising  provisions in Sec. Sec. 1026.16 and 1026.24, not just those that meet  the definition of creditor in Sec. 1026.2(a)(17). Thus, home builders,  merchants, and others who are not themselves creditors must comply with  the advertising provisions of the regulation if they advertise consumer  credit transactions. However, under section 145 of the Act, the owner  and the personnel of the medium in which an advertisement appears, or  through which it is disseminated, are not subject to civil liability for  violations.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(4) Billing Cycle or Cycle</p><p class="depth0">1. Intervals. In open-end credit plans, the billing cycle determines  the intervals for which periodic disclosure statements are required;  these intervals are also used as measuring points for other duties of  the creditor. Typically, billing cycles are monthly, but they may be  more frequent or less frequent (but not less frequent than quarterly).</p><p class="depth0">2. Creditors that do not bill. The term cycle is interchangeable  with billing cycle for definitional purposes, since some creditors'  cycles do not involve the sending of bills in the traditional sense but  only statements of account activity. This is commonly the case with  financial institutions when periodic payments are made through payroll  deduction or through automatic debit of the consumer's asset account.</p><p class="depth0">3. Equal cycles. Although cycles must be equal, there is a  permissible variance to account for weekends, holidays, and differences  in the number of days in months. If the actual date of each statement  does not vary by more than four days from a fixed ``day'' (for example,  the third Thursday of each month) or ``date'' (for example, the 15th of  each month) that the creditor regularly uses, the intervals between  statements are considered equal. The requirement that cycles be equal  applies even if the creditor applies a daily periodic rate to determine  the finance charge. The requirement that intervals be   equal does not apply to the first billing cycle on an open-end account  (i.e., the time period between account opening and the generation of the  first periodic statement) or to a transitional billing cycle that can  occur if the creditor occasionally changes its billing cycles so as to  establish a new statement day or date. (See comments 9(c)(1)-3 and  9(c)(2)-3.)</p><p class="depth0">4. Payment reminder. The sending of a regular payment reminder  (rather than a late payment notice) establishes a cycle for which the  creditor must send periodic statements.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(6) Business Day</p><p class="depth0">1. Business function test. Activities that indicate that the  creditor is open for substantially all of its business functions include  the availability of personnel to make loan disbursements, to open new  accounts, and to handle credit transaction inquiries. Activities that  indicate that the creditor is not open for substantially all of its  business functions include a retailer's merely accepting credit cards  for purchases or a bank's having its customer-service windows open only  for limited purposes such as deposits and withdrawals, bill paying, and  related services.</p><p class="depth0">2. Rule for rescission, disclosures for certain mortgage  transactions, and private education loans. A more precise rule for what  is a business day (all calendar days except Sundays and the Federal  legal holidays specified in 5 U.S.C. 6103(a)) applies when the right of  rescission, the receipt of disclosures for certain dwelling-secured  mortgage transactions under Sec. Sec. 1026.19(a)(1)(ii), 1026.19(a)(2),  1026.31(c), or the receipt of disclosures for private education loans  under Sec. 1026.46(d)(4) is involved. Four Federal legal holidays are  identified in 5 U.S.C. 6103(a) by a specific date: New Year's Day,  January 1; Independence Day, July 4; Veterans Day, November 11; and  Christmas Day, December 25. When one of these holidays (July 4, for  example) falls on a Saturday, Federal offices and other entities might  observe the holiday on the preceding Friday (July 3). In cases where the  more precise rule applies, the observed holiday (in the example, July 3)  is a business day.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(7) Card Issuer</p><p class="depth0">1. Agent. An agent of a card issuer is considered a card issuer.  Because agency relationships are traditionally defined by contract and  by state or other applicable law, the regulation does not define agent.  Merely providing services relating to the production of credit cards or  data processing for others, however, does not make one the agent of the  card issuer. In contrast, a financial institution may become the agent  of the card issuer if an agreement between the institution and the card  issuer provides that the cardholder may use a line of credit with the  financial institution to pay obligations incurred by use of the credit  card.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(8) Cardholder</p><p class="depth0">1. General rule. A cardholder is a natural person at whose request a  card is issued for consumer credit purposes or who is a co-obligor or  guarantor for such a card issued to another. The second category does  not include an employee who is a co-obligor or guarantor on a card  issued to the employer for business purposes, nor does it include a  person who is merely the authorized user of a card issued to another.</p><p class="depth0">2. Limited application of regulation. For the limited purposes of  the rules on issuance of credit cards and liability for unauthorized  use, a cardholder includes any person, including an organization, to  whom a card is issued for any purpose--including a business,  agricultural, or commercial purpose.</p><p class="depth0">3. Issuance. See the commentary to Sec. 1026.12(a).</p><p class="depth0">4. Dual-purpose cards and dual-card systems. Some card issuers offer  dual-purpose cards that are for business as well as consumer purposes.  If a card is issued to an individual for consumer purposes, the fact  that an organization has guaranteed to pay the debt does not make it  business credit. On the other hand, if a card is issued for business  purposes, the fact that an individual sometimes uses it for consumer  purchases does not subject the card issuer to the provisions on periodic  statements, billing-error resolution, and other protections afforded to  consumer credit. Some card issuers offer dual-card systems--that is,  they issue two cards to the same individual, one intended for business  use, the other for consumer or personal use. With such a system, the  same person may be a cardholder for general purposes when using the card  issued for consumer use, and a cardholder only for the limited purposes  of the restrictions on issuance and liability when using the card issued  for business purposes.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(9) Cash Price</p><p class="depth0">1. Components. This amount is a starting point in computing the  amount financed and the total sale price under Sec. 1026.18 for credit  sales. Any charges imposed equally in cash and credit transactions may  be included in the cash price, or they may be treated as other amounts  financed under Sec. 1026.18(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">2. Service contracts. Service contracts include contracts for the  repair or the servicing of goods, such as mechanical breakdown coverage,  even if such a contract is characterized as insurance under state law.</p><p class="depth0">3. Rebates. The creditor has complete flexibility in the way it  treats rebates for purposes of disclosure and calculation. (See the  commentary to Sec. 1026.18(b).)</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(10) Closed-End Credit</p><p class="depth0">1. General. The coverage of this term is defined by exclusion. That  is, it includes any credit arrangement that does not fall within the  definition of open-end credit. Subpart C contains the disclosure rules  for closed-end credit when the obligation is subject to a finance charge  or is payable by written agreement in more than four installments.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(11) Consumer</p><p class="depth0">1. Scope. Guarantors, endorsers, and sureties are not generally  consumers for purposes of the regulation, but they may be entitled to  rescind under certain circumstances and they may have certain rights if  they are obligated on credit card plans.</p><p class="depth0">2. Rescission rules. For purposes of rescission under Sec. Sec.  1026.15 and 1026.23, a consumer includes any natural person whose  ownership interest in his or her principal dwelling is subject to the  risk of loss. Thus, if a security interest is taken in A's ownership  interest in a house and that house is A's principal dwelling, A is a  consumer for purposes of rescission, even if A is not liable, either  primarily or secondarily, on the underlying consumer credit transaction.  An ownership interest does not include, for example, leaseholds or  inchoate rights, such as dower.</p><p class="depth0">3. Land trusts. Credit extended to land trusts, as described in the  commentary to Sec. 1026.3(a), is considered to be extended to a natural  person for purposes of the definition of consumer.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(12) Consumer Credit</p><p class="depth0">1. Primary purpose. There is no precise test for what constitutes  credit offered or extended for personal, family, or household purposes,  nor for what constitutes the primary purpose. (See, however, the  discussion of business purposes in the commentary to Sec. 1026.3(a).)</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(13) Consummation</p><p class="depth0">1. State law governs. When a contractual obligation on the  consumer's part is created is a matter to be determined under applicable  law; Regulation Z does not make this determination. A contractual  commitment agreement, for example, that under applicable law binds the  consumer to the credit terms would be consummation. Consummation,  however, does not occur merely because the consumer has made some  financial investment in the transaction (for example, by paying a  nonrefundable fee) unless, of course, applicable law holds otherwise.</p><p class="depth0">2. Credit v. sale. Consummation does not occur when the consumer  becomes contractually committed to a sale transaction, unless the  consumer also becomes legally obligated to accept a particular credit  arrangement. For example, when a consumer pays a nonrefundable deposit  to purchase an automobile, a purchase contract may be created, but  consummation for purposes of the regulation does not occur unless the  consumer also contracts for financing at that time.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(14) Credit</p><p class="depth0">1. Exclusions. The following situations are not considered credit  for purposes of the regulation:</p><p class="depth0">i. Layaway plans, unless the consumer is contractually obligated to  continue making payments. Whether the consumer is so obligated is a  matter to be determined under applicable law. The fact that the consumer  is not entitled to a refund of any amounts paid towards the cash price  of the merchandise does not bring layaways within the definition of  credit.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Tax liens, tax assessments, court judgments, and court approvals  of reaffirmation of debts in bankruptcy. However, third-party financing  of such obligations (for example, a bank loan obtained to pay off a tax  lien) is credit for purposes of the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Insurance premium plans that involve payment in installments  with each installment representing the payment for insurance coverage  for a certain future period of time, unless the consumer is  contractually obligated to continue making payments.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Home improvement transactions that involve progress payments, if  the consumer pays, as the work progresses, only for work completed and  has no contractual obligation to continue making payments.</p><p class="depth0">v. Borrowing against the accrued cash value of an insurance policy  or a pension account, if there is no independent obligation to repay.</p><p class="depth0">vi. Letters of credit.</p><p class="depth0">vii. The execution of option contracts. However, there may be an  extension of credit when the option is exercised, if there is an  agreement at that time to defer payment of a debt.</p><p class="depth0">viii. Investment plans in which the party extending capital to the  consumer risks the loss of the capital advanced. This includes, for  example, an arrangement with a home purchaser in which the investor pays  a portion of the downpayment and of the periodic mortgage payments in  return for an ownership interest in the property, and shares in any gain  or loss of property value.</p><p class="depth0">ix. Mortgage assistance plans administered by a government agency in  which a portion of the consumer's monthly payment amount is paid by the  agency. No finance charge is imposed on the subsidy amount, and that  amount is due in a lump-sum payment on a set date or upon the occurrence  of certain events. (If payment is not made when due, a new note imposing  a finance charge may be written, which may then be subject to the  regulation.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Payday loans; deferred presentment. Credit includes a transaction  in which a cash advance is made to a consumer in exchange for the  consumer's personal check, or in exchange for the consumer's  authorization to debit the consumer's deposit account, and where the  parties agree either that the check will not be cashed or deposited, or  that the consumer's deposit account will not be debited, until a  designated future date. This type of transaction is often referred to as  a ``payday loan'' or ``payday advance'' or ``deferred-presentment  loan.'' A fee charged in connection with such a transaction may be a  finance charge for purposes of Sec. 1026.4, regardless of how the fee  is characterized under state law. Where the fee charged constitutes a  finance charge under Sec. 1026.4 and the person advancing funds  regularly extends consumer credit, that person is a creditor and is  required to provide disclosures consistent with the requirements of  Regulation Z. (See Sec. 1026.2(a)(17).)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 2(a)(15)</p><p class="depth0">1. Usable from time to time. A credit card must be usable from time  to time. Since this involves the possibility of repeated use of a single  device, checks and similar instruments that can be used only once to  obtain a single credit extension are not credit cards.</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples. i. Examples of credit cards include:</p><p class="depth0">A. A card that guarantees checks or similar instruments, if the  asset account is also tied to an overdraft line or if the instrument  directly accesses a line of credit.</p><p class="depth0">B. A card that accesses both a credit and an asset account (that is,  a debit-credit card).</p><p class="depth0">C. An identification card that permits the consumer to defer payment  on a purchase.</p><p class="depth0">D. An identification card indicating loan approval that is presented  to a merchant or to a lender, whether or not the consumer signs a  separate promissory note for each credit extension.</p><p class="depth0">E. A card or device that can be activated upon receipt to access  credit, even if the card has a substantive use other than credit, such  as a purchase-price discount card. Such a card or device is a credit  card notwithstanding the fact that the recipient must first contact the  card issuer to access or activate the credit feature.</p><p class="depth0">ii. In contrast, credit card does not include, for example:</p><p class="depth0">A. A check-guarantee or debit card with no credit feature or  agreement, even if the creditor occasionally honors an inadvertent  overdraft.</p><p class="depth0">B. Any card, key, plate, or other device that is used in order to  obtain petroleum products for business purposes from a wholesale  distribution facility or to gain access to that facility, and that is  required to be used without regard to payment terms.</p><p class="depth0">C. An account number that accesses a credit account, unless the  account number can access an open-end line of credit to purchase goods  or services. For example, if a creditor provides a consumer with an  open-end line of credit that can be accessed by an account number in  order to transfer funds into another account (such as an asset account  with the same creditor), the account number is not a credit card for  purposes of Sec. 1026.2(a)(15)(i). However, if the account number can  also access the line of credit to purchase goods or services (such as an  account number that can be used to purchase goods or services on the  Internet), the account number is a credit card for purposes of Sec.  1026.2(a)(15)(i), regardless of whether the creditor treats such  transactions as purchases, cash advances, or some other type of  transaction. Furthermore, if the line of credit can also be accessed by  a card (such as a debit card), that card is a credit card for purposes  of Sec. 1026.2(a)(15)(i).</p><p class="depth0">3. Charge card. Generally, charge cards are cards used in connection  with an account on which outstanding balances cannot be carried from one  billing cycle to another and are payable when a periodic statement is  received. Under the regulation, a reference to credit cards generally  includes charge cards. In particular, references to credit card accounts  under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan in Subparts B  and G generally include charge cards. The term charge card is, however,  distinguished from credit card or credit card account under an open-end  (not home-secured) consumer credit plan in Sec. Sec. 1026.60,  1026.6(b)(2)(xiv), 1026.7(b)(11), 1026.7(b)(12), 1026.9(e), 1026.9(f),  1026.28(d), 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(C), and Appendices G-10 through G-13.</p><p class="depth0">4. Credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer  credit plan. An open-end consumer credit account is a credit card  account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan for  purposes of Sec. 1026.2(a)(15)(ii) if:</p><p class="depth0">i. The account is accessed by a credit card, as defined in Sec.  1026.2(a)(15)(i); and</p><p class="depth0">ii. The account is not excluded under Sec. 1026.2(a)(15)(ii)(A) or  (a)(15)(ii)(B).</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(16) Credit Sale</p><p class="depth0">1. Special disclosure. If the seller is a creditor in the  transaction, the transaction is a credit sale and the special credit  sale disclosures (that is, the disclosures under Sec. 1026.18(j)) must  be given. This applies even if there is more than one creditor in the  transaction and the creditor making the disclosures is not the seller.  (See the commentary to Sec. 1026.17(d).)</p><p class="depth0">2. Sellers who arrange credit. If the seller of the property or  services involved arranged for financing but is not a creditor as to  that sale, the transaction is not a credit sale.   Thus, if a seller assists the consumer in obtaining a direct loan from a  financial institution and the consumer's note is payable to the  financial institution, the transaction is a loan and only the financial  institution is a creditor.</p><p class="depth0">3. Refinancings. Generally, when a credit sale is refinanced within  the meaning of Sec. 1026.20(a), loan disclosures should be made.  However, if a new sale of goods or services is also involved, the  transaction is a credit sale.</p><p class="depth0">4. Incidental sales. Some lenders sell a product or service--such as  credit, property, or health insurance--as part of a loan transaction.  Section 1026.4 contains the rules on whether the cost of credit life,  disability or property insurance is part of the finance charge. If the  insurance is financed, it may be disclosed as a separate credit-sale  transaction or disclosed as part of the primary transaction; if the  latter approach is taken, either loan or credit-sale disclosures may be  made. (See the commentary to Sec. 1026.17(c)(1) for further discussion  of this point.)</p><p class="depth0">5. Credit extensions for educational purposes. A credit extension  for educational purposes in which an educational institution is the  creditor may be treated as either a credit sale or a loan, regardless of  whether the funds are given directly to the student, credited to the  student's account, or disbursed to other persons on the student's  behalf. The disclosure of the total sale price need not be given if the  transaction is treated as a loan.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(17) Creditor</p><p class="depth0">1. General. The definition contains four independent tests. If any  one of the tests is met, the person is a creditor for purposes of that  particular test.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 2(a)(17)(i)</p><p class="depth0">1. Prerequisites. This test is composed of two requirements, both of  which must be met in order for a particular credit extension to be  subject to the regulation and for the credit extension to count towards  satisfaction of the numerical tests mentioned in Sec. 1026.2(a)(17)(v).</p><p class="depth0">i. First, there must be either or both of the following:</p><p class="depth0">A. A written (rather than oral) agreement to pay in more than four  installments. A letter that merely confirms an oral agreement does not  constitute a written agreement for purposes of the definition.</p><p class="depth0">B. A finance charge imposed for the credit. The obligation to pay  the finance charge need not be in writing.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Second, the obligation must be payable to the person in order  for that person to be considered a creditor. If an obligation is made  payable to bearer, the creditor is the one who initially accepts the  obligation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Assignees. If an obligation is initially payable to one person,  that person is the creditor even if the obligation by its terms is  simultaneously assigned to another person. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. An auto dealer and a bank have a business relationship in which  the bank supplies the dealer with credit sale contracts that are  initially made payable to the dealer and provide for the immediate  assignment of the obligation to the bank. The dealer and purchaser  execute the contract only after the bank approves the creditworthiness  of the purchaser. Because the obligation is initially payable on its  face to the dealer, the dealer is the only creditor in the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">3. Numerical tests. The examples below illustrate how the numerical  tests of Sec. 1026.2(a)(17)(v) are applied. The examples assume that  consumer credit with a finance charge or written agreement for more than  4 installments was extended in the years in question and that the person  did not extend such credit in 2006.</p><p class="depth0">4. Counting transactions. For purposes of closed-end credit, the  creditor counts each credit transaction. For open-end credit,  transactions means accounts, so that outstanding accounts are counted  instead of individual credit extensions. Normally the number of  transactions is measured by the preceding calendar year; if the  requisite number is met, then the person is a creditor for all  transactions in the current year. However, if the person did not meet  the test in the preceding year, the number of transactions is measured  by the current calendar year. For example, if the person extends  consumer credit 26 times in 2007, it is a creditor for purposes of the  regulation for the last extension of credit in 2007 and for all  extensions of consumer credit in 2008. On the other hand, if a business  begins in 2007 and extends consumer credit 20 times, it is not a  creditor for purposes of the regulation in 2007. If it extends consumer  credit 75 times in 2008, however, it becomes a creditor for purposes of  the regulation (and must begin making disclosures) after the 25th  extension of credit in that year and is a creditor for all extensions of  consumer credit in 2009.</p><p class="depth0">5. Relationship between consumer credit in general and credit  secured by a dwelling. Extensions of credit secured by a dwelling are  counted towards the 25-extensions test. For example, if in 2007 a person  extends unsecured consumer credit 23 times and consumer credit secured  by a dwelling twice, it becomes a creditor for the succeeding extensions  of credit, whether or not they are secured by a dwelling. On the other  hand, extensions of consumer credit not secured by a dwelling are not  counted towards the number of credit extensions secured by a dwelling.   For example, if in 2007 a person extends credit not secured by a  dwelling 8 times and credit secured by a dwelling 3 times, it is not a  creditor.</p><p class="depth0">6. Effect of satisfying one test. Once one of the numerical tests is  satisfied, the person is also a creditor for the other type of credit.  For example, in 2007 a person extends consumer credit secured by a  dwelling 5 times. That person is a creditor for all succeeding credit  extensions, whether they involve credit secured by a dwelling or not.</p><p class="depth0">7. Trusts. In the case of credit extended by trusts, each individual  trust is considered a separate entity for purposes of applying the  criteria. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. A bank is the trustee for three trusts. Trust A makes 15  extensions of consumer credit annually; Trust B makes 10 extensions of  consumer credit annually; and Trust C makes 30 extensions of consumer  credit annually. Only Trust C is a creditor for purposes of the  regulation.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 2(a)(17)(ii) [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 2(a)(17)(iii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Card issuers subject to Subpart B. Section 1026.2(a)(17)(iii)  makes certain card issuers creditors for purposes of the open-end credit  provisions of the regulation. This includes, for example, the issuers of  so-called travel and entertainment cards that expect repayment at the  first billing and do not impose a finance charge. Since all disclosures  are to be made only as applicable, such card issuers would omit finance  charge disclosures. Other provisions of the regulation regarding such  areas as scope, definitions, determination of which charges are finance  charges, Spanish language disclosures, record retention, and use of  model forms, also apply to such card issuers.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 2(a)(17)(iv)</p><p class="depth0">1. Card issuers subject to Subparts B and C. Section  1026.2(a)(17)(iv) includes as creditors card issuers extending closed- end credit in which there is a finance charge or an agreement to pay in  more than four installments. These card issuers are subject to the  appropriate provisions of Subparts B and C, as well as to the general  provisions.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(18) Downpayment</p><p class="depth0">1. Allocation. If a consumer makes a lump-sum payment, partially to  reduce the cash price and partially to pay prepaid finance charges, only  the portion attributable to reducing the cash price is part of the  downpayment. (See the commentary to Sec. 1026.2(a)(23).)</p><p class="depth0">2. Pick-up payments. i. Creditors may treat the deferred portion of  the downpayment, often referred to as pick-up payments, in a number of  ways. If the pick-up payment is treated as part of the downpayment:</p><p class="depth0">A. It is subtracted in arriving at the amount financed under Sec.  1026.18(b).</p><p class="depth0">B. It may, but need not, be reflected in the payment schedule under  Sec. 1026.18(g).</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the pick-up payment does not meet the definition (for  example, if it is payable after the second regularly scheduled payment)  or if the creditor chooses not to treat it as part of the downpayment:</p><p class="depth0">A. It must be included in the amount financed.B. It must be shown in  the payment schedule.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Whichever way the pick-up payment is treated, the total of  payments under Sec. 1026.18(h) must equal the sum of the payments  disclosed under Sec. 1026.18(g).</p><p class="depth0">3. Effect of existing liens. i. No cash payment. In a credit sale,  the ``downpayment'' may only be used to reduce the cash price. For  example, when a trade-in is used as the downpayment and the existing  lien on an automobile to be traded in exceeds the value of the  automobile, creditors must disclose a zero on the downpayment line  rather than a negative number. To illustrate, assume a consumer owes  $10,000 on an existing automobile loan and that the trade-in value of  the automobile is only $8,000, leaving a $2,000 deficit. The creditor  should disclose a downpayment of $0, not -$2,000.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Cash payment. If the consumer makes a cash payment, creditors  may, at their option, disclose the entire cash payment as the  downpayment, or apply the cash payment first to any excess lien amount  and disclose any remaining cash as the downpayment. In the above  example:</p><p class="depth0">A. If the downpayment disclosed is equal to the cash payment, the  $2,000 deficit must be reflected as an additional amount financed under  Sec. 1026.18(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">B. If the consumer provides $1,500 in cash (which does not  extinguish the $2,000 deficit), the creditor may disclose a downpayment  of $1,500 or of $0.</p><p class="depth0">C. If the consumer provides $3,000 in cash, the creditor may  disclose a downpayment of $3,000 or of $1,000.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(19) Dwelling</p><p class="depth0">1. Scope. A dwelling need not be the consumer's principal residence  to fit the definition, and thus a vacation or second home could be a  dwelling. However, for purposes of the definition of residential  mortgage transaction and the right to rescind, a dwelling must be the  principal residence of the consumer. (See the commentary to Sec. Sec.  1026.2(a)(24), 1026.15, and 1026.23.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Use as a residence. Mobile homes, boats, and trailers are  dwellings if they are in fact used as residences, just as are  condominium and cooperative units. Recreational vehicles, campers, and  the like not used as residences are not dwellings.</p><p class="depth0">3. Relation to exemptions. Any transaction involving a security  interest in a consumer's   principal dwelling (as well as in any real property) remains subject to  the regulation despite the general exemption in Sec. 1026.3(b).</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(20) Open-End Credit</p><p class="depth0">1. General. This definition describes the characteristics of open- end credit (for which the applicable disclosure and other rules are  contained in Subpart B), as distinct from closed-end credit. Open-end  credit is consumer credit that is extended under a plan and meets all 3  criteria set forth in the definition.</p><p class="depth0">2. Existence of a plan. The definition requires that there be a  plan, which connotes a contractual arrangement between the creditor and  the consumer. Some creditors offer programs containing a number of  different credit features. The consumer has a single account with the  institution that can be accessed repeatedly via a number of sub-accounts  established for the different program features and rate structures. Some  features of the program might be used repeatedly (for example, an  overdraft line) while others might be used infrequently (such as the  part of the credit line available for secured credit). If the program as  a whole is subject to prescribed terms and otherwise meets the  definition of open-end credit, such a program would be considered a  single, multifeatured plan.</p><p class="depth0">3. Repeated transactions. Under this criterion, the creditor must  reasonably contemplate repeated transactions. This means that the credit  plan must be usable from time to time and the creditor must legitimately  expect that there will be repeat business rather than a one-time credit  extension. The creditor must expect repeated dealings with consumers  under the credit plan as a whole and need not believe a consumer will  reuse a particular feature of the plan. The determination of whether a  creditor can reasonably contemplate repeated transactions requires an  objective analysis. Information that much of the creditor's customer  base with accounts under the plan make repeated transactions over some  period of time is relevant to the determination, particularly when the  plan is opened primarily for the financing of infrequently purchased  products or services. A standard based on reasonable belief by a  creditor necessarily includes some margin for judgmental error. The fact  that particular consumers do not return for further credit extensions  does not prevent a plan from having been properly characterized as open- end. For example, if much of the customer base of a clothing store makes  repeat purchases, the fact that some consumers use the plan only once  would not affect the characterization of the store's plan as open-end  credit. The criterion regarding repeated transactions is a question of  fact to be decided in the context of the creditor's type of business and  the creditor's relationship with its customers. For example, it would be  more reasonable for a bank or depository institution to contemplate  repeated transactions with a customer than for a seller of aluminum  siding to make the same assumption about its customers.</p><p class="depth0">4. Finance charge on an outstanding balance. The requirement that a  finance charge may be computed and imposed from time to time on the  outstanding balance means that there is no specific amount financed for  the plan for which the finance charge, total of payments, and payment  schedule can be calculated. A plan may meet the definition of open-end  credit even though a finance charge is not normally imposed, provided  the creditor has the right, under the plan, to impose a finance charge  from time to time on the outstanding balance. For example, in some  plans, a finance charge is not imposed if the consumer pays all or a  specified portion of the outstanding balance within a given time period.  Such a plan could meet the finance charge criterion, if the creditor has  the right to impose a finance charge, even though the consumer actually  pays no finance charges during the existence of the plan because the  consumer takes advantage of the option to pay the balance (either in  full or in installments) within the time necessary to avoid finance  charges.</p><p class="depth0">5. Reusable line. The total amount of credit that may be extended  during the existence of an open-end plan is unlimited because available  credit is generally replenished as earlier advances are repaid. A line  of credit is self-replenishing even though the plan itself has a fixed  expiration date, as long as during the plan's existence the consumer may  use the line, repay, and reuse the credit. The creditor may occasionally  or routinely verify credit information such as the consumer's continued  income and employment status or information for security purposes but,  to meet the definition of open-end credit, such verification of credit  information may not be done as a condition of granting a consumer's  request for a particular advance under the plan. In general, a credit  line is self-replenishing if the consumer can take further advances as  outstanding balances are repaid without being required to separately  apply for those additional advances. A credit card account where the  plan as a whole replenishes meets the self-replenishing criterion,  notwithstanding the fact that a credit card issuer may verify credit  information from time to time in connection with specific transactions.  This criterion of unlimited credit distinguishes open-end credit from a  series of advances made pursuant to a closed-end credit loan commitment.  For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Under a closed-end commitment, the creditor might agree to lend a  total of $10,000 in a series of advances as needed by the consumer. When  a consumer has borrowed the   full $10,000, no more is advanced under that particular agreement, even  if there has been repayment of a portion of the debt. (See Sec.  1026.2(a)(17)(iv) for disclosure requirements when a credit card is used  to obtain the advances.)</p><p class="depth0">ii. This criterion does not mean that the creditor must establish a  specific credit limit for the line of credit or that the line of credit  must always be replenished to its original amount. The creditor may  reduce a credit limit or refuse to extend new credit in a particular  case due to changes in the creditor's financial condition or the  consumer's creditworthiness. (The rules in Sec. 1026.40(f), however,  limit the ability of a creditor to suspend credit advances for home  equity plans.) While consumers should have a reasonable expectation of  obtaining credit as long as they remain current and within any preset  credit limits, further extensions of credit need not be an absolute  right in order for the plan to meet the self-replenishing criterion.6.  Verifications of collateral value. Creditors that otherwise meet the  requirements of Sec. 1026.2(a)(20) extend open-end credit  notwithstanding the fact that the creditor must verify collateral values  to comply with Federal, state, or other applicable law or verifies the  value of collateral in connection with a particular advance under the  plan.</p><p class="depth0">7. Open-end real estate mortgages. Some credit plans call for  negotiated advances under so-called open-end real estate mortgages. Each  such plan must be independently measured against the definition of open- end credit, regardless of the terminology used in the industry to  describe the plan. The fact that a particular plan is called an open-end  real estate mortgage, for example, does not, by itself, mean that it is  open-end credit under the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(21) Periodic Rate</p><p class="depth0">1. Basis. The periodic rate may be stated as a percentage (for  example, 1 and \1/2\% per month) or as a decimal equivalent (for  example, .015 monthly). It may be based on any portion of a year the  creditor chooses. Some creditors use \1/360\ of an annual rate as their  periodic rate. These creditors:</p><p class="depth0">i. May disclose a \1/360\ rate as a daily periodic rate, without  further explanation, if it is in fact only applied 360 days per year.  But if the creditor applies that rate for 365 days, the creditor must  note that fact and, of course, disclose the true annual percentage rate.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Would have to apply the rate to the balance to disclose the  annual percentage rate with the degree of accuracy required in the  regulation (that is, within \1/8\th of 1 percentage point of the rate  based on the actual 365 days in the year).</p><p class="depth0">2. Transaction charges. Periodic rate does not include initial one- time transaction charges, even if the charge is computed as a percentage  of the transaction amount.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(22) Person</p><p class="depth0">1. Joint ventures. A joint venture is an organization and is  therefore a person.</p><p class="depth0">2. Attorneys. An attorney and his or her client are considered to be  the same person for purposes of this part when the attorney is acting  within the scope of the attorney-client relationship with regard to a  particular transaction.</p><p class="depth0">3. Trusts. A trust and its trustee are considered to be the same  person for purposes of this part.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(23) Prepaid Finance Charge</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Prepaid finance charges must be taken into account under  Sec. 1026.18(b) in computing the disclosed amount financed, and must be  disclosed if the creditor provides an itemization of the amount financed  under Sec. 1026.18(c).</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples. i. Common examples of prepaid finance charges include:</p><p class="depth0">A. Buyer's points.</p><p class="depth0">B. Service fees.</p><p class="depth0">C. Loan fees.</p><p class="depth0">D. Finder's fees.</p><p class="depth0">E. Loan-guarantee insurance.</p><p class="depth0">F. Credit-investigation fees.</p><p class="depth0">ii. However, in order for these or any other finance charges to be  considered prepaid, they must be either paid separately in cash or check  or withheld from the proceeds. Prepaid finance charges include any  portion of the finance charge paid prior to or at closing or settlement.</p><p class="depth0">3. Exclusions. Add-on and discount finance charges are not prepaid  finance charges for purposes of this part. Finance charges are not  prepaid merely because they are precomputed, whether or not a portion of  the charge will be rebated to the consumer upon prepayment. (See the  commentary to Sec. 1026.18(b).)</p><p class="depth0">4. Allocation of lump-sum payments. In a credit sale transaction  involving a lump-sum payment by the consumer and a discount or other  item that is a finance charge under Sec. 1026.4, the discount or other  item is a prepaid finance charge to the extent the lump-sum payment is  not applied to the cash price. For example, a seller sells property to a  consumer for $10,000, requires the consumer to pay $3,000 at the time of  the purchase, and finances the remainder as a closed-end credit  transaction. The cash price of the property is $9,000. The seller is the  creditor in the transaction and therefore the $1,000 difference between  the credit and cash prices (the discount) is a finance charge. (See the  commentary to Sec. 1026.4(b)(9) and (c)(5).) If the creditor applies  the entire $3,000 to the cash price and adds the $1,000 finance charge  to the interest on the $6,000 to arrive at the   total finance charge, all of the $3,000 lump-sum payment is a  downpayment and the discount is not a prepaid finance charge. However,  if the creditor only applies $2,000 of the lump-sum payment to the cash  price, then $2,000 of the $3,000 is a downpayment and the $1,000  discount is a prepaid finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(24) Residential Mortgage Transaction</p><p class="depth0">1. Relation to other sections. This term is important in five  provisions in the regulation:</p><p class="depth0">i. Section 1026.4(c)(7)--exclusions from the finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Section 1026.15(f)--exemption from the right of rescission.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Section 1026.18(q)--whether or not the obligation is assumable.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Section 1026.20(b)--disclosure requirements for assumptions.</p><p class="depth0">v. Section 1026.23(f)--exemption from the right of rescission.</p><p class="depth0">2. Lien status. The definition is not limited to first lien  transactions. For example, a consumer might assume a paid-down first  mortgage (or borrow part of the purchase price) and borrow the balance  of the purchase price from a creditor who takes a second mortgage. The  second mortgage transaction is a residential mortgage transaction if the  dwelling purchased is the consumer's principal residence.</p><p class="depth0">3. Principal dwelling. A consumer can have only one principal  dwelling at a time. Thus, a vacation or other second home would not be a  principal dwelling. However, if a consumer buys or builds a new dwelling  that will become the consumer's principal dwelling within a year or upon  the completion of construction, the new dwelling is considered the  principal dwelling for purposes of applying this definition to a  particular transaction. (See the commentary to Sec. Sec. 1026.15(a) and  1026.23(a).)</p><p class="depth0">4. Construction financing. If a transaction meets the definition of  a residential mortgage transaction and the creditor chooses to disclose  it as several transactions under Sec. 1026.17(c)(6), each one is  considered to be a residential mortgage transaction, even if different  creditors are involved. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. The creditor makes a construction loan to finance the initial  construction of the consumer's principal dwelling, and the loan will be  disbursed in five advances. The creditor gives six sets of disclosures  (five for the construction phase and one for the permanent phase). Each  one is a residential mortgage transaction.</p><p class="depth0">ii. One creditor finances the initial construction of the consumer's  principal dwelling and another creditor makes a loan to satisfy the  construction loan and provide permanent financing. Both transactions are  residential mortgage transactions.</p><p class="depth0">5. Acquisition. i. A residential mortgage transaction finances the  acquisition of a consumer's principal dwelling. The term does not  include a transaction involving a consumer's principal dwelling if the  consumer had previously purchased and acquired some interest to the  dwelling, even though the consumer had not acquired full legal title.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Examples of new transactions involving a previously acquired  dwelling include the financing of a balloon payment due under a land  sale contract and an extension of credit made to a joint owner of  property to buy out the other joint owner's interest. In these  instances, disclosures are not required under Sec. 1026.18(q)  (assumability policies). However, the rescission rules of Sec. Sec.  1026.15 and 1026.23 do apply to these new transactions.</p><p class="depth0">iii. In other cases, the disclosure and rescission rules do not  apply. For example, where a buyer enters into a written agreement with  the creditor holding the seller's mortgage, allowing the buyer to assume  the mortgage, if the buyer had previously purchased the property and  agreed with the seller to make the mortgage payments, Sec. 1026.20(b)  does not apply (assumptions involving residential mortgages).</p><p class="depth0">6. Multiple purpose transactions. A transaction meets the definition  of this section if any part of the loan proceeds will be used to finance  the acquisition or initial construction of the consumer's principal  dwelling. For example, a transaction to finance the initial construction  of the consumer's principal dwelling is a residential mortgage  transaction even if a portion of the funds will be disbursed directly to  the consumer or used to satisfy a loan for the purchase of the land on  which the dwelling will be built.</p><p class="depth0">7. Construction on previously acquired vacant land. A residential  mortgage transaction includes a loan to finance the construction of a  consumer's principal dwelling on a vacant lot previously acquired by the  consumer.</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(25) Security Interest</p><p class="depth0">1. Threshold test. The threshold test is whether a particular  interest in property is recognized as a security interest under  applicable law. The regulation does not determine whether a particular  interest is a security interest under applicable law. If the creditor is  unsure whether a particular interest is a security interest under  applicable law (for example, if statutes and case law are either silent  or inconclusive on the issue), the creditor may at its option consider  such interests as security interests for Truth in Lending purposes.  However, the regulation and the commentary do exclude specific  interests, such as after-acquired property and accessories, from the  scope of the definition regardless of their categorization under  applicable law, and these named exclusions may not be disclosed as  security interests under the regulation. (But see the discussion of  exclusions elsewhere in the commentary to Sec. 1026.2(a)(25).)</p><p class="depth0">2. Exclusions. The general definition of security interest excludes  three groups of interests: incidental interests, interests in after- acquired property, and interests that arise solely by operation of law.  These interests may not be disclosed with the disclosures required under  Sec. 1026.18, but the creditor is not precluded from preserving these  rights elsewhere in the contract documents, or invoking and enforcing  such rights, if it is otherwise lawful to do so. If the creditor is  unsure whether a particular interest is one of the excluded interests,  the creditor may, at its option, consider such interests as security  interests for Truth in Lending purposes.</p><p class="depth0">3. Incidental interests. i. Incidental interests in property that  are not security interests include, among other things:</p><p class="depth0">A. Assignment of rents.</p><p class="depth0">B. Right to condemnation proceeds.</p><p class="depth0">C. Interests in accessories and replacements.</p><p class="depth0">D. Interests in escrow accounts, such as for taxes and insurance.</p><p class="depth0">E. Waiver of homestead or personal property rights.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The notion of an incidental interest does not encompass an  explicit security interest in an insurance policy if that policy is the  primary collateral for the transaction--for example, in an insurance  premium financing transaction.</p><p class="depth0">4. Operation of law. Interests that arise solely by operation of law  are excluded from the general definition. Also excluded are interests  arising by operation of law that are merely repeated or referred to in  the contract. However, if the creditor has an interest that arises by  operation of law, such as a vendor's lien, and takes an independent  security interest in the same property, such as a UCC security interest,  the latter interest is a disclosable security interest unless otherwise  provided.</p><p class="depth0">5. Rescission rules. Security interests that arise solely by  operation of law are security interests for purposes of rescission.  Examples of such interests are mechanics' and materialmen's liens.</p><p class="depth0">6. Specificity of disclosure. A creditor need not separately  disclose multiple security interests that it may hold in the same  collateral. The creditor need only disclose that the transaction is  secured by the collateral, even when security interests from prior  transactions remain of record and a new security interest is taken in  connection with the transaction. In disclosing the fact that the  transaction is secured by the collateral, the creditor also need not  disclose how the security interest arose. For example, in a closed-end  credit transaction, a rescission notice need not specifically state that  a new security interest is ``acquired'' or an existing security interest  is ``retained'' in the transaction. The acquisition or retention of a  security interest in the consumer's principal dwelling instead may be  disclosed in a rescission notice with a general statement such as the  following: ``Your home is the security for the new transaction.''</p><p class="depth0">2(b) Rules of Construction</p><p class="depth0">1. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">2. Amount. The numerical amount must be a dollar amount unless  otherwise indicated. For example, in a closed-end transaction (Subpart  C), the amount financed and the amount of any payment must be expressed  as a dollar amount. In some cases, an amount should be expressed as a  percentage. For example, in disclosures provided before the first  transaction under an open-end plan (Subpart B), creditors are permitted  to explain how the amount of any finance charge will be determined;  where a cash-advance fee (which is a finance charge) is a percentage of  each cash advance, the amount of the finance charge for that fee is  expressed as a percentage.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.3--Exempt Transactions</p><p class="depth0">1. Relationship to Sec. 1026.12. The provisions in Sec. 1026.12(a)  and (b) governing the issuance of credit cards and the limitations on  liability for their unauthorized use apply to all credit cards, even if  the credit cards are issued for use in connection with extensions of  credit that otherwise are exempt under this section.</p><p class="depth0">3(a) Business, Commercial, Agricultural, or Organizational Credit</p><p class="depth0">1. Primary purposes. A creditor must determine in each case if the  transaction is primarily for an exempt purpose. If some question exists  as to the primary purpose for a credit extension, the creditor is, of  course, free to make the disclosures, and the fact that disclosures are  made under such circumstances is not controlling on the question of  whether the transaction was exempt. (See comment 3(a)-2, however, with  respect to credit cards.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Business purpose purchases. i. Business-purpose credit cards-- extensions of credit for consumer purposes. If a business-purpose credit  card is issued to a person, the provisions of the regulation do not  apply, other than as provided in Sec. Sec. 1026.12(a) and 1026.12(b),  even if extensions of credit for consumer purposes are occasionally made  using that business-purpose credit card. For example, the billing error  provisions set forth in Sec. 1026.13 do not apply to consumer-purpose  extensions of credit using a business-purpose credit card.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Consumer-purpose credit cards--extensions of credit for business  purposes. If a consumer-purpose credit card is issued to a person, the  provisions of the regulation apply, even to occasional extensions of  credit for business purposes made using that consumer-purpose credit  card. For example, a consumer may   assert a billing error with respect to any extension of credit using a  consumer-purpose credit card, even if the specific extension of credit  on such credit card or open-end credit plan that is the subject of the  dispute was made for business purposes.</p><p class="depth0">3. Factors. In determining whether credit to finance an  acquisition--such as securities, antiques, or art--is primarily for  business or commercial purposes (as opposed to a consumer purpose), the  following factors should be considered:</p><p class="depth0">i. General. A. The relationship of the borrower's primary occupation  to the acquisition. The more closely related, the more likely it is to  be business purpose.</p><p class="depth0">B. The degree to which the borrower will personally manage the  acquisition. The more personal involvement there is, the more likely it  is to be business purpose.</p><p class="depth0">C. The ratio of income from the acquisition to the total income of  the borrower. The higher the ratio, the more likely it is to be business  purpose.</p><p class="depth0">D. The size of the transaction. The larger the transaction, the more  likely it is to be business purpose.</p><p class="depth0">E. The borrower's statement of purpose for the loan.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Business-purpose examples. Examples of business-purpose credit  include:</p><p class="depth0">A. A loan to expand a business, even if it is secured by the  borrower's residence or personal property.</p><p class="depth0">B. A loan to improve a principal residence by putting in a business  office.</p><p class="depth0">C. A business account used occasionally for consumer purposes.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Consumer-purpose examples. Examples of consumer-purpose credit  include:</p><p class="depth0">A. Credit extensions by a company to its employees or agents if the  loans are used for personal purposes.</p><p class="depth0">B. A loan secured by a mechanic's tools to pay a child's tuition.</p><p class="depth0">C. A personal account used occasionally for business purposes.</p><p class="depth0">4. Non-owner-occupied rental property. Credit extended to acquire,  improve, or maintain rental property (regardless of the number of  housing units) that is not owner-occupied is deemed to be for business  purposes. This includes, for example, the acquisition of a warehouse  that will be leased or a single-family house that will be rented to  another person to live in. If the owner expects to occupy the property  for more than 14 days during the coming year, the property cannot be  considered non-owner-occupied and this special rule will not apply. For  example, a beach house that the owner will occupy for a month in the  coming summer and rent out the rest of the year is owner occupied and is  not governed by this special rule. (See comment 3(a)-5, however, for  rules relating to owner-occupied rental property.)</p><p class="depth0">5. Owner-occupied rental property. If credit is extended to acquire,  improve, or maintain rental property that is or will be owner-occupied  within the coming year, different rules apply:</p><p class="depth0">i. Credit extended to acquire the rental property is deemed to be  for business purposes if it contains more than 2 housing units.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Credit extended to improve or maintain the rental property is  deemed to be for business purposes if it contains more than 4 housing  units. Since the amended statute defines dwelling to include 1 to 4  housing units, this rule preserves the right of rescission for credit  extended for purposes other than acquisition. Neither of these rules  means that an extension of credit for property containing fewer than the  requisite number of units is necessarily consumer credit. In such cases,  the determination of whether it is business or consumer credit should be  made by considering the factors listed in comment 3(a)-3.</p><p class="depth0">6. Business credit later refinanced. Business-purpose credit that is  exempt from the regulation may later be rewritten for consumer purposes.  Such a transaction is consumer credit requiring disclosures only if the  existing obligation is satisfied and replaced by a new obligation made  for consumer purposes undertaken by the same obligor.</p><p class="depth0">7. Credit card renewal. A consumer-purpose credit card that is  subject to the regulation may be converted into a business-purpose  credit card at the time of its renewal, and the resulting business- purpose credit card would be exempt from the regulation. Conversely, a  business-purpose credit card that is exempt from the regulation may be  converted into a consumer-purpose credit card at the time of its  renewal, and the resulting consumer-purpose credit card would be subject  to the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">8. Agricultural purpose. An agricultural purpose includes the  planting, propagating, nurturing, harvesting, catching, storing,  exhibiting, marketing, transporting, processing, or manufacturing of  food, beverages (including alcoholic beverages), flowers, trees,  livestock, poultry, bees, wildlife, fish, or shellfish by a natural  person engaged in farming, fishing, or growing crops, flowers, trees,  livestock, poultry, bees, or wildlife. The exemption also applies to a  transaction involving real property that includes a dwelling (for  example, the purchase of a farm with a homestead) if the transaction is  primarily for agricultural purposes.</p><p class="depth0">9. Organizational credit. The exemption for transactions in which  the borrower is not a natural person applies, for example, to loans to  corporations, partnerships, associations, churches, unions, and  fraternal organizations. The exemption applies regardless of the purpose  of the credit extension and regardless of the fact that a natural person   may guarantee or provide security for the credit.</p><p class="depth0">10. Land trusts. Credit extended for consumer purposes to a land  trust is considered to be credit extended to a natural person rather  than credit extended to an organization. In some jurisdictions, a  financial institution financing a residential real estate transaction  for an individual uses a land trust mechanism. Title to the property is  conveyed to the land trust for which the financial institution itself is  trustee. The underlying installment note is executed by the financial  institution in its capacity as trustee and payment is secured by a trust  deed, reflecting title in the financial institution as trustee. In some  instances, the consumer executes a personal guaranty of the  indebtedness. The note provides that it is payable only out of the  property specifically described in the trust deed and that the trustee  has no personal liability on the note. Assuming the transactions are for  personal, family, or household purposes, these transactions are subject  to the regulation since in substance (if not form) consumer credit is  being extended.</p><p class="depth0">3(b) Credit Over Applicable Threshold Amount</p><p class="depth0">1. Threshold amount. For purposes of Sec. 1026.3(b), the threshold  amount in effect during a particular period is the amount stated below  for that period. The threshold amount is adjusted effective January 1 of  each year by any annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index  for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) that was in effect  on the preceding June 1. This comment will be amended to provide the  threshold amount for the upcoming year after the annual percentage  change in the CPI-W that was in effect on June 1 becomes available. Any  increase in the threshold amount will be rounded to the nearest $100  increment. For example, if the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W  would result in a $950 increase in the threshold amount, the threshold  amount will be increased by $1,000. However, if the annual percentage  increase in the CPI-W would result in a $949 increase in the threshold  amount, the threshold amount will be increased by $900.</p><p class="depth0">i. Prior to July 21, 2011, the threshold amount is $25,000.</p><p class="depth0">ii. From July 21, 2011 through December 31, 2011, the threshold  amount is $50,000.</p><p class="depth0">iii. From January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012, the threshold  amount is $51,800.</p><p class="depth0">iv. From January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013, the threshold  amount is $53,000.</p><p class="depth0">v. From January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, the threshold  amount is $53,500.</p><p class="depth0">vi. From January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, the threshold  amount is $54,600.</p><p class="depth0">2. Open-end credit. i. Qualifying for exemption. An open-end account  is exempt under Sec. 1026.3(b) (unless secured by any real property, or  by personal property used or expected to be used as the consumer's  principal dwelling) if either of the following conditions is met:</p><p class="depth0">A. The creditor makes an initial extension of credit at or after  account opening that exceeds the threshold amount in effect at the time  the initial extension is made. If a creditor makes an initial extension  of credit after account opening that does not exceed the threshold  amount in effect at the time the extension is made, the creditor must  have satisfied all of the applicable requirements of this Part from the  date the account was opened (or earlier, if applicable), including but  not limited to the requirements of Sec. 1026.6 (account-opening  disclosures), Sec. 1026.7 (periodic statements), Sec. 1026.52  (limitations on fees), and Sec. 1026.55 (limitations on increasing  annual percentages rates, fees, and charges). For example:</p><p class="depth0">1. Assume that the threshold amount in effect on January 1 is  $50,000. On February 1, an account is opened but the creditor does not  make an initial extension of credit at that time. On July 1, the  creditor makes an initial extension of credit of $60,000. In this  circumstance, no requirements of this Part apply to the account.</p><p class="depth0">2. Assume that the threshold amount in effect on January 1 is  $50,000. On February 1, an account is opened but the creditor does not  make an initial extension of credit at that time. On July 1, the  creditor makes an initial extension of credit of $50,000 or less. In  this circumstance, the account is not exempt and the creditor must have  satisfied all of the applicable requirements of this Part from the date  the account was opened (or earlier, if applicable).</p><p class="depth0">B. The creditor makes a firm written commitment at account opening  to extend a total amount of credit in excess of the threshold amount in  effect at the time the account is opened with no requirement of  additional credit information for any advances on the account (except as  permitted from time to time with respect to open-end accounts pursuant  to Sec. 1026.2(a)(20)).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Subsequent changes generally. Subsequent changes to an open-end  account or the threshold amount may result in the account no longer  qualifying for the exemption in Sec. 1026.3(b). In these circumstances,  the creditor must begin to comply with all of the applicable  requirements of this Part within a reasonable period of time after the  account ceases to be exempt. Once an account ceases to be exempt, the  requirements of this Part apply to any balances on the account. The  creditor, however, is not required to comply with the requirements of  this Part with respect to the period of time during which the account  was exempt. For example, if an open-end credit account ceases to be  exempt, the creditor must within a reasonable period   of time provide the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.6 reflecting the  current terms of the account and begin to provide periodic statements  consistent with Sec. 1026.7. However, the creditor is not required to  disclose fees or charges imposed while the account was exempt.  Furthermore, if the creditor provided disclosures consistent with the  requirements of this Part while the account was exempt, it is not  required to provide disclosures required by Sec. 1026.6 reflecting the  current terms of the account. See also comment 3(b)-4.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Subsequent changes when exemption is based on initial extension  of credit. If a creditor makes an initial extension of credit that  exceeds the threshold amount in effect at that time, the open-end  account remains exempt under Sec. 1026.3(b) regardless of a subsequent  increase in the threshold amount, including an increase pursuant to  Sec. 1026.3(b)(1)(ii) as a result of an increase in the CPI-W.  Furthermore, in these circumstances, the account remains exempt even if  there are no further extensions of credit, subsequent extensions of  credit do not exceed the threshold amount, the account balance is  subsequently reduced below the threshold amount (such as through  repayment of the extension), or the credit limit for the account is  subsequently reduced below the threshold amount. However, if the initial  extension of credit on an account does not exceed the threshold amount  in effect at the time of the extension, the account is not exempt under  Sec. 1026.3(b) even if a subsequent extension exceeds the threshold  amount or if the account balance later exceeds the threshold amount (for  example, due to the subsequent accrual of interest).</p><p class="depth0">iv. Subsequent changes when exemption is based on firm commitment.  A. General. If a creditor makes a firm written commitment at account  opening to extend a total amount of credit that exceeds the threshold  amount in effect at that time, the open-end account remains exempt under  Sec. 1026.3(b) regardless of a subsequent increase in the threshold  amount pursuant to Sec. 1026.3(b)(1)(ii) as a result of an increase in  the CPI-W. However, see comment 3(b)-6 with respect to the increase in  the threshold amount from $25,000 to $50,000. If an open-end account is  exempt under Sec. 1026.3(b) based on a firm commitment to extend  credit, the account remains exempt even if the amount of credit actually  extended does not exceed the threshold amount. In contrast, if the firm  commitment does not exceed the threshold amount at account opening, the  account is not exempt under Sec. 1026.3(b) even if the account balance  later exceeds the threshold amount. In addition, if a creditor reduces a  firm commitment, the account ceases to be exempt unless the reduced firm  commitment exceeds the threshold amount in effect at the time of the  reduction. For example:</p><p class="depth0">1. Assume that, at account opening in year one, the threshold amount  in effect is $50,000 and the account is exempt under Sec. 1026.3(b)  based on the creditor's firm commitment to extend $55,000 in credit. If  during year one the creditor reduces its firm commitment to $53,000, the  account remains exempt under Sec. 1026.3(b). However, if during year  one the creditor reduces its firm commitment to $40,000, the account is  no longer exempt under Sec. 1026.3(b).</p><p class="depth0">2. Assume that, at account opening in year one, the threshold amount  in effect is $50,000 and the account is exempt under Sec. 1026.3(b)  based on the creditor's firm commitment to extend $55,000 in credit. If  the threshold amount is $56,000 on January 1 of year six as a result of  increases in the CPI-W, the account remains exempt. However, if the  creditor reduces its firm commitment to $54,000 on July 1 of year six,  the account ceases to be exempt under Sec. 1026.3(b).</p><p class="depth0">B. Initial extension of credit. If an open-end account qualifies for  a Sec. 1026.3(b) exemption at account opening based on a firm  commitment, that account may also subsequently qualify for a Sec.  1026.3(b) exemption based on an initial extension of credit. However,  that initial extension must be a single advance in excess of the  threshold amount in effect at the time the extension is made. In  addition, the account must continue to qualify for an exemption based on  the firm commitment until the initial extension of credit is made. For  example:</p><p class="depth0">1. Assume that, at account opening in year one, the threshold amount  in effect is $50,000 and the account is exempt under Sec. 1026.3(b)  based on the creditor's firm commitment to extend $55,000 in credit. The  account is not used for an extension of credit during year one. On  January 1 of year two, the threshold amount is increased to $51,000  pursuant to Sec. 1026.3(b)(1)(ii) as a result of an increase in the  CPI-W. On July 1 of year two, the consumer uses the account for an  initial extension of $52,000. As a result of this extension of credit,  the account remains exempt under Sec. 1026.3(b) even if, after July 1  of year two, the creditor reduces the firm commitment to $51,000 or  less.</p><p class="depth0">2. Same facts as in paragraph iv.B.1 above except that the consumer  uses the account for an initial extension of $30,000 on July 1 of year  two and for an extension of $22,000 on July 15 of year two. In these  circumstances, the account is not exempt under Sec. 1026.3(b) based on  the $30,000 initial extension of credit because that extension did not  exceed the applicable threshold amount ($51,000), although the account  remains exempt based on the firm commitment to extend $55,000 in credit.</p><p class="depth0">3. Same facts as in paragraph iv.B.1 above except that, on April 1  of year two, the creditor reduces the firm commitment to $50,000, which  is below the $51,000 threshold then in   effect. Because the account ceases to qualify for a Sec. 1026.3(b)  exemption on April 1 of year two, the account does not qualify for a  Sec. 1026.3(b) exemption based on a $52,000 initial extension of credit  on July 1 of year two.</p><p class="depth0">3. Closed-end credit. i. Qualifying for exemption. A closed-end loan  is exempt under Sec. 1026.3(b) (unless the extension of credit is  secured by any real property, or by personal property used or expected  to be used as the consumer's principal dwelling; or is a private  education loan as defined in Sec. 1026.46(b)(5)), if either of the  following conditions is met:</p><p class="depth0">A. The creditor makes an extension of credit at consummation that  exceeds the threshold amount in effect at the time of consummation. In  these circumstances, the loan remains exempt under Sec. 1026.3(b) even  if the amount owed is subsequently reduced below the threshold amount  (such as through repayment of the loan).</p><p class="depth0">B. The creditor makes a commitment at consummation to extend a total  amount of credit in excess of the threshold amount in effect at the time  of consummation. In these circumstances, the loan remains exempt under  Sec. 1026.3(b) even if the total amount of credit extended does not  exceed the threshold amount.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Subsequent changes. If a creditor makes a closed-end extension  of credit or commitment to extend closed-end credit that exceeds the  threshold amount in effect at the time of consummation, the closed-end  loan remains exempt under Sec. 1026.3(b) regardless of a subsequent  increase in the threshold amount. However, a closed-end loan is not  exempt under Sec. 1026.3(b) merely because it is used to satisfy and  replace an existing exempt loan, unless the new extension of credit is  itself exempt under the applicable threshold amount. For example, assume  a closed-end loan that qualified for a Sec. 1026.3(b) exemption at  consummation in year one is refinanced in year ten and that the new loan  amount is less than the threshold amount in effect in year ten. In these  circumstances, the creditor must comply with all of the applicable  requirements of this Part with respect to the year ten transaction if  the original loan is satisfied and replaced by the new loan, which is  not exempt under Sec. 1026.3(b). See also comment 3(b)-4.</p><p class="depth0">4. Addition of a security interest in real property or a dwelling  after account opening or consummation. i. Open-end credit. For open-end  accounts, if, after account opening, a security interest is taken in any  real property, or in personal property used or expected to be used as  the consumer's principal dwelling, a previously exempt account ceases to  be exempt under Sec. 1026.3(b) and the creditor must begin to comply  with all of the applicable requirements of this Part within a reasonable  period of time. See comment 3(b)-2.ii. If a security interest is taken  in the consumer's principal dwelling, the creditor must also give the  consumer the right to rescind the security interest consistent with  Sec. 1026.15.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Closed-end credit. For closed-end loans, if, after consummation,  a security interest is taken in any real property, or in personal  property used or expected to be used as the consumer's principal  dwelling, an exempt loan remains exempt under Sec. 1026.3(b). However,  the addition of a security interest in the consumer's principal dwelling  is a transaction for purposes of Sec. 1026.23 and the creditor must  give the consumer the right to rescind the security interest consistent  with that section. See Sec. 1026.23(a)(1) and the accompanying  commentary. In contrast, if a closed-end loan that is exempt under Sec.  1026.3(b) is satisfied and replaced by a loan that is secured by any  real property, or by personal property used or expected to be used as  the consumer's principal dwelling, the new loan is not exempt under  Sec. 1026.3(b) and the creditor must comply with all of the applicable  requirements of this Part. See comment 3(b)-3.</p><p class="depth0">5. Application to extensions secured by mobile homes. Because a  mobile home can be a dwelling under Sec. 1026.2(a)(19), the exemption  in Sec. 1026.3(b) does not apply to a credit extension secured by a  mobile home that is used or expected to be used as the principal  dwelling of the consumer. See comment 3(b)-4.</p><p class="depth0">6. Transition rule for open-end accounts exempt prior to July 21,  2011. Section 1026.3(b)(2) applies only to open-end accounts opened  prior to July 21, 2011. Section 1026.3(b)(2) does not apply if a  security interest is taken by the creditor in any real property, or in  personal property used or expected to be used as the consumer's  principal dwelling. If, on July 20, 2011, an open-end account is exempt  under Sec. 1026.3(b) based on a firm commitment to extend credit in  excess of $25,000, the account remains exempt under Sec. 1026.3(b)(2)  until December 31, 2011 (unless the firm commitment is reduced to  $25,000 or less). If the firm commitment is increased on or before  December 31, 2011 to an amount in excess of $50,000, the account remains  exempt under Sec. 1026.3(b)(1) regardless of subsequent increases in  the threshold amount as a result of increases in the CPI-W. If the firm  commitment is not increased on or before December 31, 2011 to an amount  in excess of $50,000, the account ceases to be exempt under Sec.  1026.3(b) based on a firm commitment to extend credit. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that, on July 20, 2011, the account is exempt under Sec.  1026.3(b) based on the creditor's firm commitment to extend $30,000 in  credit. On November 1, 2011, the creditor increases the firm commitment  on the account to $55,000. In these circumstances, the account remains  exempt under Sec. 1026.3(b)(1) regardless of subsequent increases in  the threshold amount as a result of increases in the CPI-W.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Same facts as paragraph i above except, on November 1, 2011, the  creditor increases the firm commitment on the account to $40,000. In  these circumstances, the account ceases to be exempt under Sec.  1026.3(b)(2) after December 31, 2011, and the creditor must begin to  comply with the applicable requirements of this Part.</p><p class="depth0">3(c) Public Utility Credit</p><p class="depth0">1. Examples. Examples of public utility services include:</p><p class="depth0">i. General. A. Gas, water, or electrical services.</p><p class="depth0">B. Cable television services.</p><p class="depth0">C. Installation of new sewer lines, water lines, conduits, telephone  poles, or metering equipment in an area not already serviced by the  utility.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Extensions of credit not covered. The exemption does not apply  to extensions of credit, for example:</p><p class="depth0">A. To purchase appliances such as gas or electric ranges, grills, or  telephones.</p><p class="depth0">B. To finance home improvements such as new heating or air  conditioning systems.</p><p class="depth0">3(d) Securities or Commodities Accounts</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. This exemption does not apply to a transaction with a  broker registered solely with the state, or to a separate credit  extension in which the proceeds are used to purchase securities.</p><p class="depth0">3(e) Home Fuel Budget Plans</p><p class="depth0">1. Definition. Under a typical home fuel budget plan, the fuel  dealer estimates the total cost of fuel for the season, bills the  customer for an average monthly payment, and makes an adjustment in the  final payment for any difference between the estimated and the actual  cost of the fuel. Fuel is delivered as needed, no finance charge is  assessed, and the customer may withdraw from the plan at any time. Under  these circumstances, the arrangement is exempt from the regulation, even  if a charge to cover the billing costs is imposed.</p><p class="depth0">3(f) Student Loan Programs</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. This exemption applies to loans made, insured, or  guaranteed under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C.  1070 et seq.). This exemption does not apply to private education loans  as defined by Sec. 1026.46(b)(5).</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.4--Finance Charge</p><p class="depth0">4(a) Definition</p><p class="depth0">1. Charges in comparable cash transactions. Charges imposed  uniformly in cash and credit transactions are not finance charges. In  determining whether an item is a finance charge, the creditor should  compare the credit transaction in question with a similar cash  transaction. A creditor financing the sale of property or services may  compare charges with those payable in a similar cash transaction by the  seller of the property or service.</p><p class="depth0">i. For example, the following items are not finance charges:</p><p class="depth0">A. Taxes, license fees, or registration fees paid by both cash and  credit customers.</p><p class="depth0">B. Discounts that are available to cash and credit customers, such  as quantity discounts.</p><p class="depth0">C. Discounts available to a particular group of consumers because  they meet certain criteria, such as being members of an organization or  having accounts at a particular financial institution. This is the case  even if an individual must pay cash to obtain the discount, provided  that credit customers who are members of the group and do not qualify  for the discount pay no more than the nonmember cash customers.</p><p class="depth0">D. Charges for a service policy, auto club membership, or policy of  insurance against latent defects offered to or required of both cash and  credit customers for the same price.</p><p class="depth0">ii. In contrast, the following items are finance charges:</p><p class="depth0">A. Inspection and handling fees for the staged disbursement of  construction-loan proceeds.</p><p class="depth0">B. Fees for preparing a Truth in Lending disclosure statement, if  permitted by law (for example, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act  prohibits such charges in certain transactions secured by real  property).</p><p class="depth0">C. Charges for a required maintenance or service contract imposed  only in a credit transaction.</p><p class="depth0">iii. If the charge in a credit transaction exceeds the charge  imposed in a comparable cash transaction, only the difference is a  finance charge. For example:</p><p class="depth0">A. If an escrow agent is used in both cash and credit sales of real  estate and the agent's charge is $100 in a cash transaction and $150 in  a credit transaction, only $50 is a finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">2. Costs of doing business. Charges absorbed by the creditor as a  cost of doing business are not finance charges, even though the creditor  may take such costs into consideration in determining the interest rate  to be charged or the cash price of the property or service sold.  However, if the creditor separately imposes a charge on the consumer to  cover certain costs, the charge is a finance charge if it otherwise  meets the definition. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. A discount imposed on a credit obligation when it is assigned by  a seller-creditor to another party is not a finance charge as long as  the discount is not separately imposed on the consumer. (See Sec.  1026.4(b)(6).)</p><p class="depth0">ii. A tax imposed by a state or other governmental body on a  creditor is not a finance   charge if the creditor absorbs the tax as a cost of doing business and  does not separately impose the tax on the consumer. (For additional  discussion of the treatment of taxes, see other commentary to Sec.  1026.4(a).)</p><p class="depth0">3. Forfeitures of interest. If the creditor reduces the interest  rate it pays or stops paying interest on the consumer's deposit account  or any portion of it for the term of a credit transaction (including,  for example, an overdraft on a checking account or a loan secured by a  certificate of deposit), the interest lost is a finance charge. (See the  commentary to Sec. 1026.4(c)(6).) For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. A consumer borrows $5,000 for 90 days and secures it with a  $10,000 certificate of deposit paying 15% interest. The creditor charges  the consumer an interest rate of 6% on the loan and stops paying  interest on $5,000 of the $10,000 certificate for the term of the loan.  The interest lost is a finance charge and must be reflected in the  annual percentage rate on the loan.</p><p class="depth0">ii. However, the consumer must be entitled to the interest that is  not paid in order for the lost interest to be a finance charge. For  example:</p><p class="depth0">A. A consumer wishes to buy from a financial institution a $10,000  certificate of deposit paying 15% interest but has only $4,000. The  financial institution offers to lend the consumer $6,000 at an interest  rate of 6% but will pay the 15% interest only on the amount of the  consumer's deposit, $4,000. The creditor's failure to pay interest on  the $6,000 does not result in an additional finance charge on the  extension of credit, provided the consumer is entitled by the deposit  agreement with the financial institution to interest only on the amount  of the consumer's deposit.</p><p class="depth0">B. A consumer enters into a combined time deposit/credit agreement  with a financial institution that establishes a time deposit account and  an open-end line of credit. The line of credit may be used to borrow  against the funds in the time deposit. The agreement provides for an  interest rate on any credit extension of, for example, 1%. In addition,  the agreement states that the creditor will pay 0% interest on the  amount of the time deposit that corresponds to the amount of the credit  extension(s). The interest that is not paid on the time deposit by the  financial institution is not a finance charge (and therefore does not  affect the annual percentage rate computation).</p><p class="depth0">4. Treatment of transaction fees on credit card plans. Any  transaction charge imposed on a cardholder by a card issuer is a finance  charge, regardless of whether the issuer imposes the same, greater, or  lesser charge on withdrawals of funds from an asset account such as a  checking or savings account. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Any charge imposed on a credit cardholder by a card issuer for  the use of an automated teller machine (ATM) to obtain a cash advance  (whether in a proprietary, shared, interchange, or other system) is a  finance charge regardless of whether the card issuer imposes a charge on  its debit cardholders for using the ATM to withdraw cash from a consumer  asset account, such as a checking or savings account.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Any charge imposed on a credit cardholder for making a purchase  or obtaining a cash advance outside the United States, with a foreign  merchant, or in a foreign currency is a finance charge, regardless of  whether a charge is imposed on debit cardholders for such transactions.  The following principles apply in determining what is a foreign  transaction fee and the amount of the fee:</p><p class="depth0">A. Included are (1) fees imposed when transactions are made in a  foreign currency and converted to U.S. dollars; (2) fees imposed when  transactions are made in U.S. dollars outside the U.S.; and (3) fees  imposed when transactions are made (whether in a foreign currency or in  U.S. dollars) with a foreign merchant, such as via a merchant's Web  site. For example, a consumer may use a credit card to make a purchase  in Bermuda, in U.S. dollars, and the card issuer may impose a fee  because the transaction took place outside the United States.</p><p class="depth0">B. Included are fees imposed by the card issuer and fees imposed by  a third party that performs the conversion, such as a credit card  network or the card issuer's corporate parent. (For example, in a  transaction processed through a credit card network, the network may  impose a 1 percent charge and the card-issuing bank may impose an  additional 2 percent charge, for a total of a 3 percentage point foreign  transaction fee being imposed on the consumer.)</p><p class="depth0">C. Fees imposed by a third party are included only if they are  directly passed on to the consumer. For example, if a credit card  network imposes a 1 percent fee on the card issuer, but the card issuer  absorbs the fee as a cost of doing business (and only passes it on to  consumers in the general sense that the interest and fees are imposed on  all its customers to recover its costs), then the fee is not a foreign  transaction fee and need not be disclosed. In another example, if the  credit card network imposes a 1 percent fee for a foreign transaction on  the card issuer, and the card issuer imposes this same fee on the  consumer who engaged in the foreign transaction, then the fee is a  foreign transaction fee and a finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">D. A card issuer is not required to disclose a fee imposed by a  merchant. For example, if the merchant itself performs the currency  conversion and adds a fee, this fee need not be disclosed by the card  issuer. Under Sec. 1026.9(d), a card issuer is not obligated to  disclose finance charges imposed by a party honoring a credit card, such  as a merchant,   although the merchant is required to disclose such a finance charge if  the merchant is subject to the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z.</p><p class="depth0">E. The foreign transaction fee is determined by first calculating  the dollar amount of the transaction by using a currency conversion rate  outside the card issuer's and third party's control. Any amount in  excess of that dollar amount is a foreign transaction fee. Conversion  rates outside the card issuer's and third party's control include, for  example, a rate selected from the range of rates available in the  wholesale currency exchange markets, an average of the highest and  lowest rates available in such markets, or a government-mandated or  government-managed exchange rate (or a rate selected from a range of  such rates).</p><p class="depth0">F. The rate used for a particular transaction need not be the same  rate that the card issuer (or third party) itself obtains in its  currency conversion operations. In addition, the rate used for a  particular transaction need not be the rate in effect on the date of the  transaction (purchase or cash advance).</p><p class="depth0">5. Taxes. i. Generally, a tax imposed by a state or other  governmental body solely on a creditor is a finance charge if the  creditor separately imposes the charge on the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">ii. In contrast, a tax is not a finance charge (even if it is  collected by the creditor) if applicable law imposes the tax:</p><p class="depth0">A. Solely on the consumer;</p><p class="depth0">B. On the creditor and the consumer jointly;</p><p class="depth0">C. On the credit transaction, without indicating which party is  liable for the tax; or</p><p class="depth0">D. On the creditor, if applicable law directs or authorizes the  creditor to pass the tax on to the consumer. (For purposes of this  section, if applicable law is silent as to passing on the tax, the law  is deemed not to authorize passing it on.)</p><p class="depth0">iii. For example, a stamp tax, property tax, intangible tax, or any  other state or local tax imposed on the consumer, or on the credit  transaction, is not a finance charge even if the tax is collected by the  creditor.</p><p class="depth0">iv. In addition, a tax is not a finance charge if it is excluded  from the finance charge by another provision of the regulation or  commentary (for example, if the tax is imposed uniformly in cash and  credit transactions).</p><p class="depth0">4(a)(1) Charges by Third Parties</p><p class="depth0">1. Choosing the provider of a required service. An example of a  third-party charge included in the finance charge is the cost of  required mortgage insurance, even if the consumer is allowed to choose  the insurer.</p><p class="depth0">2. Annuities associated with reverse mortgages. Some creditors offer  annuities in connection with a reverse-mortgage transaction. The amount  of the premium is a finance charge if the creditor requires the purchase  of the annuity incident to the credit. Examples include the following:</p><p class="depth0">i. The credit documents reflect the purchase of an annuity from a  specific provider or providers.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The creditor assesses an additional charge on consumers who do  not purchase an annuity from a specific provider.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The annuity is intended to replace in whole or in part the  creditor's payments to the consumer either immediately or at some future  date.</p><p class="depth0">4(a)(2) Special Rule; Closing Agent Charges</p><p class="depth0">1. General. This rule applies to charges by a third party serving as  the closing agent for the particular loan. An example of a closing agent  charge included in the finance charge is a courier fee where the  creditor requires the use of a courier.</p><p class="depth0">2. Required closing agent. If the creditor requires the use of a  closing agent, fees charged by the closing agent are included in the  finance charge only if the creditor requires the particular service,  requires the imposition of the charge, or retains a portion of the  charge. Fees charged by a third-party closing agent may be otherwise  excluded from the finance charge under Sec. 1026.4. For example, a fee  that would be paid in a comparable cash transaction may be excluded  under Sec. 1026.4(a). A charge for conducting or attending a closing is  a finance charge and may be excluded only if the charge is included in  and is incidental to a lump-sum fee excluded under Sec. 1026.4(c)(7).</p><p class="depth0">4(a)(3) Special Rule; Mortgage Broker Fees</p><p class="depth0">1. General. A fee charged by a mortgage broker is excluded from the  finance charge if it is the type of fee that is also excluded when  charged by the creditor. For example, to exclude an application fee from  the finance charge under Sec. 1026.4(c)(1), a mortgage broker must  charge the fee to all applicants for credit, whether or not credit is  extended.</p><p class="depth0">2. Coverage. This rule applies to charges paid by consumers to a  mortgage broker in connection with a consumer credit transaction secured  by real property or a dwelling.</p><p class="depth0">3. Compensation by lender. The rule requires all mortgage broker  fees to be included in the finance charge. Creditors sometimes  compensate mortgage brokers under a separate arrangement with those  parties. Creditors may draw on amounts paid by the consumer, such as  points or closing costs, to fund their payment to the broker.  Compensation paid by a creditor to a mortgage broker under an agreement  is not included as a separate component of a consumer's total finance  charge (although this compensation may be reflected in the finance  charge if it   comes from amounts paid by the consumer to the creditor that are finance  charges, such as points and interest).</p><p class="depth0">4(b) Examples of Finance Charges</p><p class="depth0">1. Relationship to other provisions. Charges or fees shown as  examples of finance charges in Sec. 1026.4(b) may be excludable under  Sec. 1026.4(c), (d), or (e). For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Premiums for credit life insurance, shown as an example of a  finance charge under Sec. 1026.4(b)(7), may be excluded if the  requirements of Sec. 1026.4(d)(1) are met.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Appraisal fees mentioned in Sec. 1026.4(b)(4) are excluded for  real property or residential mortgage transactions under Sec.  1026.4(c)(7).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(b)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Checking account charges. A checking or transaction account  charge imposed in connection with a credit feature is a finance charge  under Sec. 1026.4(b)(2) to the extent the charge exceeds the charge for  a similar account without a credit feature. If a charge for an account  with a credit feature does not exceed the charge for an account without  a credit feature, the charge is not a finance charge under Sec.  1026.4(b)(2). To illustrate:</p><p class="depth0">i. A $5 service charge is imposed on an account with an overdraft  line of credit (where the institution has agreed in writing to pay an  overdraft), while a $3 service charge is imposed on an account without a  credit feature; the $2 difference is a finance charge. (If the  difference is not related to account activity, however, it may be  excludable as a participation fee. See the commentary to Sec.  1026.4(c)(4).)</p><p class="depth0">ii. A $5 service charge is imposed for each item that results in an  overdraft on an account with an overdraft line of credit, while a $25  service charge is imposed for paying or returning each item on a similar  account without a credit feature; the $5 charge is not a finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(b)(3)</p><p class="depth0">1. Assumption fees. The assumption fees mentioned in Sec.  1026.4(b)(3) are finance charges only when the assumption occurs and the  fee is imposed on the new buyer. The assumption fee is a finance charge  in the new buyer's transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(b)(5)</p><p class="depth0">1. Credit loss insurance. Common examples of the insurance against  credit loss mentioned in Sec. 1026.4(b)(5) are mortgage guaranty  insurance, holder in due course insurance, and repossession insurance.  Such premiums must be included in the finance charge only for the period  that the creditor requires the insurance to be maintained.</p><p class="depth0">2. Residual value insurance. Where a creditor requires a consumer to  maintain residual value insurance or where the creditor is a beneficiary  of a residual value insurance policy written in connection with an  extension of credit (as is the case in some forms of automobile balloon- payment financing, for example), the premiums for the insurance must be  included in the finance charge for the period that the insurance is to  be maintained. If a creditor pays for residual-value insurance and  absorbs the payment as a cost of doing business, such costs are not  considered finance charges. (See comment 4(a)-2.)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraphs 4(b)(7) and (b)(8)</p><p class="depth0">1. Pre-existing insurance policy. The insurance discussed in Sec.  1026.4(b)(7) and (b)(8) does not include an insurance policy (such as a  life or an automobile collision insurance policy) that is already owned  by the consumer, even if the policy is assigned to or otherwise made  payable to the creditor to satisfy an insurance requirement. Such a  policy is not ``written in connection with'' the transaction, as long as  the insurance was not purchased for use in that credit extension, since  it was previously owned by the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">2. Insurance written in connection with a transaction. Credit  insurance sold before or after an open-end (not home-secured) plan is  opened is considered ``written in connection with a credit  transaction.'' Insurance sold after consummation in closed-end credit  transactions or after the opening of a home-equity plan subject to the  requirements of Sec. 1026.40 is not considered ``written in connection  with'' the credit transaction if the insurance is written because of the  consumer's default (for example, by failing to obtain or maintain  required property insurance) or because the consumer requests insurance  after consummation or the opening of a home-equity plan subject to the  requirements of Sec. 1026.40 (although credit-sale disclosures may be  required for the insurance sold after consummation if it is financed).</p><p class="depth0">3. Substitution of life insurance. The premium for a life insurance  policy purchased and assigned to satisfy a credit life insurance  requirement must be included in the finance charge, but only to the  extent of the cost of the credit life insurance if purchased from the  creditor or the actual cost of the policy (if that is less than the cost  of the insurance available from the creditor). If the creditor does not  offer the required insurance, the premium to be included in the finance  charge is the cost of a policy of insurance of the type, amount, and  term required by the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">4. Other insurance. Fees for required insurance not of the types  described in Sec. 1026.4(b)(7) and (b)(8) are finance charges and are  not excludable. For example, the premium for a hospitalization insurance  policy, if it is required to be purchased only in a credit transaction,  is a finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(b)(9)</p><p class="depth0">1. Discounts for payment by other than credit. The discounts to  induce payment by other than credit mentioned in Sec. 1026.4(b)(9)  include, for example, the following situation: The seller of land offers  individual tracts for $10,000 each. If the purchaser pays cash, the  price is $9,000, but if the purchaser finances the tract with the seller  the price is $10,000. The $1,000 difference is a finance charge for  those who buy the tracts on credit.</p><p class="depth0">2. Exception for cash discounts. i. Creditors may exclude from the  finance charge discounts offered to consumers for using cash or another  means of payment instead of using a credit card or an open-end plan. The  discount may be in whatever amount the seller desires, either as a  percentage of the regular price (as defined in section 103(z) of the  Act, as amended) or a dollar amount. Pursuant to section 167(b) of the  Act, this provision applies only to transactions involving an open-end  credit plan or a credit card (whether open-end or closed-end credit is  extended on the card). The merchant must offer the discount to  prospective buyers whether or not they are cardholders or members of the  open-end credit plan. The merchant may, however, make other  distinctions. For example:</p><p class="depth0">A. The merchant may limit the discount to payment by cash and not  offer it for payment by check or by use of a debit card.</p><p class="depth0">B. The merchant may establish a discount plan that allows a 15%  discount for payment by cash, a 10% discount for payment by check, and a  5% discount for payment by a particular credit card. None of these  discounts is a finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Pursuant to section 171(c) of the Act, discounts excluded from  the finance charge under this paragraph are also excluded from treatment  as a finance charge or other charge for credit under any state usury or  disclosure laws.</p><p class="depth0">3. Determination of the regular price. i. The regular price is  critical in determining whether the difference between the price charged  to cash customers and credit customers is a discount or a surcharge, as  these terms are defined in amended section 103 of the Act. The regular  price is defined in section 103 of the Act as--* * * the tag or posted  price charged for the property or service if a single price is tagged or  posted, or the price charged for the property or service when payment is  made by use of an open-end credit account or a credit card if either (1)  no price is tagged or posted, or (2) two prices are tagged or posted * *  *.</p><p class="depth0">ii. For example, in the sale of motor vehicle fuel, the tagged or  posted price is the price displayed at the pump. As a result, the higher  price (the open-end credit or credit card price) must be displayed at  the pump, either alone or along with the cash price. Service station  operators may designate separate pumps or separate islands as being for  either cash or credit purchases and display only the appropriate prices  at the various pumps. If a pump is capable of displaying on its meter  either a cash or a credit price depending upon the consumer's means of  payment, both the cash price and the credit price must be displayed at  the pump. A service station operator may display the cash price of fuel  by itself on a curb sign, as long as the sign clearly indicates that the  price is limited to cash purchases.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(b)(10)</p><p class="depth0">1. Definition. Debt cancellation coverage provides for payment or  satisfaction of all or part of a debt when a specified event occurs. The  term ``debt cancellation coverage'' includes guaranteed automobile  protection, or ``GAP,'' agreements, which pay or satisfy the remaining  debt after property insurance benefits are exhausted. Debt suspension  coverage provides for suspension of the obligation to make one or more  payments on the date(s) otherwise required by the credit agreement, when  a specified event occurs. The term ``debt suspension'' does not include  loan payment deferral arrangements in which the triggering event is the  bank's unilateral decision to allow a deferral of payment and the  borrower's unilateral election to do so, such as by skipping or reducing  one or more payments (``skip payments'').</p><p class="depth0">2. Coverage written in connection with a transaction. Coverage sold  after consummation in closed-end credit transactions or after the  opening of a home-equity plan subject to the requirements of Sec.  1026.40 is not ``written in connection with'' the credit transaction if  the coverage is written because the consumer requests coverage after  consummation or the opening of a home-equity plan subject to the  requirements of Sec. 1026.40 (although credit-sale disclosures may be  required for the coverage sold after consummation if it is financed).  Coverage sold before or after an open-end (not home-secured) plan is  opened is considered ``written in connection with a credit  transaction.''</p><p class="depth0">4(c) Charges Excluded From the Finance Charge</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(c)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Application fees. An application fee that is excluded from the  finance charge is a charge to recover the costs associated with  processing applications for credit. The fee may cover the costs of  services such as credit reports, credit investigations, and appraisals.  The creditor is free to impose the fee in only certain of its loan  programs, such as mortgage loans. However, if the fee is to be excluded  from the finance charge under   Sec. 1026.4(c)(1), it must be charged to all applicants, not just to  applicants who are approved or who actually receive credit.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(c)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Late payment charges. i. Late payment charges can be excluded  from the finance charge under Sec. 1026.4(c)(2) whether or not the  person imposing the charge continues to extend credit on the account or  continues to provide property or services to the consumer. In  determining whether a charge is for actual unanticipated late payment on  a 30-day account, for example, factors to be considered include:</p><p class="depth0">A. The terms of the account. For example, is the consumer required  by the account terms to pay the account balance in full each month? If  not, the charge may be a finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">B. The practices of the creditor in handling the accounts. For  example, regardless of the terms of the account, does the creditor allow  consumers to pay the accounts over a period of time without demanding  payment in full or taking other action to collect? If no effort is made  to collect the full amount due, the charge may be a finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">ii. section 1026.4(c)(2) applies to late payment charges imposed for  failure to make payments as agreed, as well as failure to pay an account  in full when due.</p><p class="depth0">2. Other excluded charges. Charges for ``delinquency, default, or a  similar occurrence'' include, for example, charges for reinstatement of  credit privileges or for submitting as payment a check that is later  returned unpaid.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(c)(3)</p><p class="depth0">1. Assessing interest on an overdraft balance. A charge on an  overdraft balance computed by applying a rate of interest to the amount  of the overdraft is not a finance charge, even though the consumer  agrees to the charge in the account agreement, unless the financial  institution agrees in writing that it will pay such items.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(c)(4)</p><p class="depth0">1. Participation fees--periodic basis. The participation fees  described in Sec. 1026.4(c)(4) do not necessarily have to be formal  membership fees, nor are they limited to credit card plans. The  provision applies to any credit plan in which payment of a fee is a  condition of access to the plan itself, but it does not apply to fees  imposed separately on individual closed-end transactions. The fee may be  charged on a monthly, annual, or other periodic basis; a one-time, non- recurring fee imposed at the time an account is opened is not a fee that  is charged on a periodic basis, and may not be treated as a  participation fee.</p><p class="depth0">2. Participation fees--exclusions. Minimum monthly charges, charges  for non-use of a credit card, and other charges based on either account  activity or the amount of credit available under the plan are not  excluded from the finance charge by Sec. 1026.4(c)(4). Thus, for  example, a fee that is charged and then refunded to the consumer based  on the extent to which the consumer uses the credit available would be a  finance charge. (See the commentary to Sec. 1026.4(b)(2). Also, see  comment 14(c)-2 for treatment of certain types of fees excluded in  determining the annual percentage rate for the periodic statement.)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(c)(5)</p><p class="depth0">1. Seller's points. The seller's points mentioned in Sec.  1026.4(c)(5) include any charges imposed by the creditor upon the  noncreditor seller of property for providing credit to the buyer or for  providing credit on certain terms. These charges are excluded from the  finance charge even if they are passed on to the buyer, for example, in  the form of a higher sales price. Seller's points are frequently  involved in real estate transactions guaranteed or insured by  governmental agencies. A commitment fee paid by a noncreditor seller  (such as a real estate developer) to the creditor should be treated as  seller's points. Buyer's points (that is, points charged to the buyer by  the creditor), however, are finance charges.</p><p class="depth0">2. Other seller-paid amounts. Mortgage insurance premiums and other  finance charges are sometimes paid at or before consummation or  settlement on the borrower's behalf by a noncreditor seller. The  creditor should treat the payment made by the seller as seller's points  and exclude it from the finance charge if, based on the seller's  payment, the consumer is not legally bound to the creditor for the  charge. A creditor who gives disclosures before the payment has been  made should base them on the best information reasonably available.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(c)(6)</p><p class="depth0">1. Lost interest. Certain Federal and state laws mandate a  percentage differential between the interest rate paid on a deposit and  the rate charged on a loan secured by that deposit. In some situations,  because of usury limits the creditor must reduce the interest rate paid  on the deposit and, as a result, the consumer loses some of the interest  that would otherwise have been earned. Under Sec. 1026.4(c)(6), such  ``lost interest'' need not be included in the finance charge. This rule  applies only to an interest reduction imposed because a rate  differential is required by law and a usury limit precludes compliance  by any other means. If the creditor imposes a differential that exceeds  that required, only the lost interest attributable to the excess   amount is a finance charge. (See the commentary to Sec. 1026.4(a).)</p><p class="depth0">4(c)(7) Real-Estate Related Fees</p><p class="depth0">1. Real estate or residential mortgage transaction charges. The list  of charges in Sec. 1026.4(c)(7) applies both to residential mortgage  transactions (which may include, for example, the purchase of a mobile  home) and to other transactions secured by real estate. The fees are  excluded from the finance charge even if the services for which the fees  are imposed are performed by the creditor's employees rather than by a  third party. In addition, the cost of verifying or confirming  information connected to the item is also excluded. For example, credit- report fees cover not only the cost of the report but also the cost of  verifying information in the report. In all cases, charges excluded  under Sec. 1026.4(c)(7) must be bona fide and reasonable.</p><p class="depth0">2. Lump-sum charges. If a lump sum charged for several services  includes a charge that is not excludable, a portion of the total should  be allocated to that service and included in the finance charge.  However, a lump sum charged for conducting or attending a closing (for  example, by a lawyer or a title company) is excluded from the finance  charge if the charge is primarily for services related to items listed  in Sec. 1026.4(c)(7) (for example, reviewing or completing documents),  even if other incidental services such as explaining various documents  or disbursing funds for the parties are performed. The entire charge is  excluded even if a fee for the incidental services would be a finance  charge if it were imposed separately.</p><p class="depth0">3. Charges assessed during the loan term. Real estate or residential  mortgage transaction charges excluded under Sec. 1026.4(c)(7) are those  charges imposed solely in connection with the initial decision to grant  credit. This would include, for example, a fee to search for tax liens  on the property or to determine if flood insurance is required. The  exclusion does not apply to fees for services to be performed  periodically during the loan term, regardless of when the fee is  collected. For example, a fee for one or more determinations during the  loan term of the current tax-lien status or flood-insurance requirements  is a finance charge, regardless of whether the fee is imposed at  closing, or when the service is performed. If a creditor is uncertain  about what portion of a fee to be paid at consummation or loan closing  is related to the initial decision to grant credit, the entire fee may  be treated as a finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">4(d) Insurance and Debt Cancellation and Debt Suspension Coverage</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Section 1026.4(d) permits insurance premiums and charges  and debt cancellation and debt suspension charges to be excluded from  the finance charge. The required disclosures must be made in writing,  except as provided in Sec. 1026.4(d)(4). The rules on location of  insurance and debt cancellation and debt suspension disclosures for  closed-end transactions are in Sec. 1026.17(a). For purposes of Sec.  1026.4(d), all references to insurance also include debt cancellation  and debt suspension coverage unless the context indicates otherwise.</p><p class="depth0">2. Timing of disclosures. If disclosures are given early, for  example under Sec. 1026.17(f) or Sec. 1026.19(a), the creditor need  not redisclose if the actual premium is different at the time of  consummation. If insurance disclosures are not given at the time of  early disclosure and insurance is in fact written in connection with the  transaction, the disclosures under Sec. 1026.4(d) must be made in order  to exclude the premiums from the finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">3. Premium rate increases. The creditor should disclose the premium  amount based on the rates currently in effect and need not designate it  as an estimate even if the premium rates may increase. An increase in  insurance rates after consummation of a closed-end credit transaction or  during the life of an open-end credit plan does not require redisclosure  in order to exclude the additional premium from treatment as a finance  charge.</p><p class="depth0">4. Unit-cost disclosures. i. Open-end credit. The premium or fee for  insurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension for the initial term  of coverage may be disclosed on a unit-cost basis in open-end credit  transactions. The cost per unit should be based on the initial term of  coverage, unless one of the options under comment 4(d)-12 is available.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Closed-end credit. One of the transactions for which unit-cost  disclosures (such as 50 cents per year for each $100 of the amount  financed) may be used in place of the total insurance premium involves a  particular kind of insurance plan. For example, a consumer with a  current indebtedness of $8,000 is covered by a plan of credit life  insurance coverage with a maximum of $10,000. The consumer requests an  additional $4,000 loan to be covered by the same insurance plan. Since  the $4,000 loan exceeds, in part, the maximum amount of indebtedness  that can be covered by the plan, the creditor may properly give the  insurance-cost disclosures on the $4,000 loan on a unit-cost basis.</p><p class="depth0">5. Required credit life insurance; debt cancellation or suspension  coverage. Credit life, accident, health, or loss-of-income insurance,  and debt cancellation and suspension coverage described in Sec.  1026.4(b)(10), must be voluntary in order for the premium or charges to  be excluded from the finance charge. Whether the insurance or coverage  is in fact required or optional is a factual question. If the insurance  or coverage is required,   the premiums must be included in the finance charge, whether the  insurance or coverage is purchased from the creditor or from a third  party. If the consumer is required to elect one of several options--such  as to purchase credit life insurance, or to assign an existing life  insurance policy, or to pledge security such as a certificate of  deposit--and the consumer purchases the credit life insurance policy,  the premium must be included in the finance charge. (If the consumer  assigns a preexisting policy or pledges security instead, no premium is  included in the finance charge. The security interest would be disclosed  under Sec. 1026.6(a)(4), Sec. 1026.6(b)(5)(ii), or Sec. 1026.18(m).  See the commentary to Sec. 1026.4(b)(7) and (b)(8).)</p><p class="depth0">6. Other types of voluntary insurance. Insurance is not credit life,  accident, health, or loss-of-income insurance if the creditor or the  credit account of the consumer is not the beneficiary of the insurance  coverage. If the premium for such insurance is not imposed by the  creditor as an incident to or a condition of credit, it is not covered  by Sec. 1026.4.</p><p class="depth0">7. Signatures. If the creditor offers a number of insurance options  under Sec. 1026.4(d), the creditor may provide a means for the consumer  to sign or initial for each option, or it may provide for a single  authorizing signature or initial with the options selected designated by  some other means, such as a check mark. The insurance authorization may  be signed or initialed by any consumer, as defined in Sec.  1026.2(a)(11), or by an authorized user on a credit card account.</p><p class="depth0">8. Property insurance. To exclude property insurance premiums or  charges from the finance charge, the creditor must allow the consumer to  choose the insurer and disclose that fact. This disclosure must be made  whether or not the property insurance is available from or through the  creditor. The requirement that an option be given does not require that  the insurance be readily available from other sources. The premium or  charge must be disclosed only if the consumer elects to purchase the  insurance from the creditor; in such a case, the creditor must also  disclose the term of the property insurance coverage if it is less than  the term of the obligation.</p><p class="depth0">9. Single-interest insurance. Blanket and specific single-interest  coverage are treated the same for purposes of the regulation. A charge  for either type of single-interest insurance may be excluded from the  finance charge if:</p><p class="depth0">i. The insurer waives any right of subrogation.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The other requirements of Sec. 1026.4(d)(2) are met. This  includes, of course, giving the consumer the option of obtaining the  insurance from a person of the consumer's choice. The creditor need not  ascertain whether the consumer is able to purchase the insurance from  someone else.</p><p class="depth0">10. Single-interest insurance defined. The term single-interest  insurance as used in the regulation refers only to the types of coverage  traditionally included in the term vendor's single-interest insurance  (or VSI), that is, protection of tangible property against normal  property damage, concealment, confiscation, conversion, embezzlement,  and skip. Some comprehensive insurance policies may include a variety of  additional coverages, such as repossession insurance and holder-in-due- course insurance. These types of coverage do not constitute single- interest insurance for purposes of the regulation, and premiums for them  do not qualify for exclusion from the finance charge under Sec.  1026.4(d). If a policy that is primarily VSI also provides coverages  that are not VSI or other property insurance, a portion of the premiums  must be allocated to the nonexcludable coverages and included in the  finance charge. However, such allocation is not required if the total  premium in fact attributable to all of the non-VSI coverages included in  the policy is $1.00 or less (or $5.00 or less in the case of a multiyear  policy).</p><p class="depth0">11. Initial term. i. The initial term of insurance or debt  cancellation or debt suspension coverage determines the period for which  a premium amount must be disclosed, unless one of the options discussed  under comment 4(d)-12 is available. For purposes of Sec. 1026.4(d), the  initial term is the period for which the insurer or creditor is  obligated to provide coverage, even though the consumer may be allowed  to cancel the coverage or coverage may end due to nonpayment before that  term expires.</p><p class="depth0">ii. For example: A. The initial term of a property insurance policy  on an automobile that is written for one year is one year even though  premiums are paid monthly and the term of the credit transaction is four  years.</p><p class="depth0">B. The initial term of an insurance policy is the full term of the  credit transaction if the consumer pays or finances a single premium in  advance.</p><p class="depth0">12. Initial term; alternative. i. General. A creditor has the option  of providing cost disclosures on the basis of one year of insurance or  debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage instead of a longer  initial term (provided the premium or fee is clearly labeled as being  for one year) if:</p><p class="depth0">A. The initial term is indefinite or not clear, or</p><p class="depth0">B. The consumer has agreed to pay a premium or fee that is assessed  periodically but the consumer is under no obligation to continue the  coverage, whether or not the consumer has made an initial payment.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Open-end plans. For open-end plans, a creditor also has the  option of providing unit-cost disclosure on the basis of a period that  is less than one year if the consumer has agreed to pay a premium or fee  that is assessed periodically, for example monthly,   but the consumer is under no obligation to continue the coverage.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Examples. To illustrate:</p><p class="depth0">A. A credit life insurance policy providing coverage for a 30-year  mortgage loan has an initial term of 30 years, even though premiums are  paid monthly and the consumer is not required to continue the coverage.  Disclosures may be based on the initial term, but the creditor also has  the option of making disclosures on the basis of coverage for an assumed  initial term of one year.</p><p class="depth0">13. Loss-of-income insurance. The loss-of-income insurance mentioned  in Sec. 1026.4(d) includes involuntary unemployment insurance, which  provides that some or all of the consumer's payments will be made if the  consumer becomes unemployed involuntarily.</p><p class="depth0">4(d)(3) Voluntary Debt Cancellation or Debt Suspension Fees</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Fees charged for the specialized form of debt  cancellation agreement known as guaranteed automobile protection  (``GAP'') agreements must be disclosed according to Sec. 1026.4(d)(3)  rather than according to Sec. 1026.4(d)(2) for property insurance.</p><p class="depth0">2. Disclosures. Creditors can comply with Sec. 1026.4(d)(3) by  providing a disclosure that refers to debt cancellation or debt  suspension coverage whether or not the coverage is considered insurance.  Creditors may use the model credit insurance disclosures only if the  debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage constitutes insurance  under state law. (See Model Clauses and Samples at G-16 and H-17 in  appendix G and appendix H to part 1026 for guidance on how to provide  the disclosure required by Sec. 1026.4(d)(3)(iii) for debt suspension  products.)</p><p class="depth0">3. Multiple events. If debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage  for two or more events is provided at a single charge, the entire charge  may be excluded from the finance charge if at least one of the events is  accident or loss of life, health, or income and the conditions specified  in Sec. 1026.4(d)(3) or, as applicable, Sec. 1026.4(d)(4), are  satisfied.</p><p class="depth0">4. Disclosures in programs combining debt cancellation and debt  suspension features. If the consumer's debt can be cancelled under  certain circumstances, the disclosure may be modified to reflect that  fact. The disclosure could, for example, state (in addition to the  language required by Sec. 1026.4(d)(3)(iii)) that ``In some  circumstances, my debt may be cancelled.'' However, the disclosure would  not be permitted to list the specific events that would result in debt  cancellation.</p><p class="depth0">4(d)(4) Telephone Purchases</p><p class="depth0">1. Affirmative request. A creditor would not satisfy the requirement  to obtain a consumer's affirmative request if the ``request'' was a  response to a script that uses leading questions or negative consent. A  question asking whether the consumer wishes to enroll in the credit  insurance or debt cancellation or suspension plan and seeking a yes-or- no response (such as ``Do you want to enroll in this optional debt  cancellation plan?'') would not be considered leading.</p><p class="depth0">4(e) Certain Security Interest Charges</p><p class="depth0">1. Examples. i. Excludable charges. Sums must be actually paid to  public officials to be excluded from the finance charge under Sec.  1026.4(e)(1) and (e)(3). Examples are charges or other fees required for  filing or recording security agreements, mortgages, continuation  statements, termination statements, and similar documents, as well as  intangible property or other taxes even when the charges or fees are  imposed by the state solely on the creditor and charged to the consumer  (if the tax must be paid to record a security agreement). (See comment  4(a)-5 regarding the treatment of taxes, generally.)</p><p class="depth0">ii. Charges not excludable. If the obligation is between the  creditor and a third party (an assignee, for example), charges or other  fees for filing or recording security agreements, mortgages,  continuation statements, termination statements, and similar documents  relating to that obligation are not excludable from the finance charge  under this section.</p><p class="depth0">2. Itemization. The various charges described in Sec. 1026.4(e)(1)  and (e)(3) may be totaled and disclosed as an aggregate sum, or they may  be itemized by the specific fees and taxes imposed. If an aggregate sum  is disclosed, a general term such as security interest fees or filing  fees may be used.</p><p class="depth0">3. Notary fees. In order for a notary fee to be excluded under Sec.  1026.4(e)(1), all of the following conditions must be met:</p><p class="depth0">i. The document to be notarized is one used to perfect, release, or  continue a security interest.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The document is required by law to be notarized.</p><p class="depth0">iii. A notary is considered a public official under applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">iv. The amount of the fee is set or authorized by law.</p><p class="depth0">4. Nonfiling insurance. The exclusion in Sec. 1026.4(e)(2) is  available only if nonfiling insurance is purchased. If the creditor  collects and simply retains a fee as a sort of ``self-insurance''  against nonfiling, it may not be excluded from the finance charge. If  the nonfiling insurance premium exceeds the amount of the fees  excludable from the finance charge under Sec. 1026.4(e)(1), only the  excess is a finance charge. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. The fee for perfecting a security interest is $5.00 and the fee  for releasing the security interest is $3.00. The creditor charges  $10.00 for nonfiling insurance. Only $8.00 of the $10.00 is excludable  from the finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">4(f) Prohibited Offsets</p><p class="depth0">1. Earnings on deposits or investments. The rule that the creditor  shall not deduct any earnings by the consumer on deposits or investments  applies whether or not the creditor has a security interest in the  property.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart B--Open-End Credit</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.5--General Disclosure Requirements</p><p class="depth0">5(a) Form of Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">5(a)(1) General</p><p class="depth0">1. Clear and conspicuous standard. The ``clear and conspicuous''  standard generally requires that disclosures be in a reasonably  understandable form. Disclosures for credit card applications and  solicitations under Sec. 1026.60, highlighted account-opening  disclosures under Sec. 1026.6(b)(1), highlighted disclosure on checks  that access a credit card under Sec. 1026.9(b)(3), highlighted change- in-terms disclosures under Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(iv)(D), and highlighted  disclosures when a rate is increased due to delinquency, default or for  a penalty under Sec. 1026.9(g)(3)(ii) must also be readily noticeable  to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">2. Clear and conspicuous--reasonably understandable form. Except  where otherwise provided, the reasonably understandable form standard  does not require that disclosures be segregated from other material or  located in any particular place on the disclosure statement, or that  numerical amounts or percentages be in any particular type size. For  disclosures that are given orally, the standard requires that they be  given at a speed and volume sufficient for a consumer to hear and  comprehend them. (See comment 5(b)(1)(ii)-1.) Except where otherwise  provided, the standard does not prohibit:</p><p class="depth0">i. Pluralizing required terminology (``finance charge'' and ``annual  percentage rate'').</p><p class="depth0">ii. Adding to the required disclosures such items as contractual  provisions, explanations of contract terms, state disclosures, and  translations.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Sending promotional material with the required disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Using commonly accepted or readily understandable abbreviations  (such as ``mo.'' for ``month'' or ``TX'' for ``Texas'') in making any  required disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">v. Using codes or symbols such as ``APR'' (for annual percentage  rate), ``FC'' (for finance charge), or ``Cr'' (for credit balance), so  long as a legend or description of the code or symbol is provided on the  disclosure statement.</p><p class="depth0">3. Clear and conspicuous--readily noticeable standard. To meet the  readily noticeable standard, disclosures for credit card applications  and solicitations under Sec. 1026.60, highlighted account-opening  disclosures under Sec. 1026.6(b)(1), highlighted disclosures on checks  that access a credit card account under Sec. 1026.9(b)(3), highlighted  change-in-terms disclosures under Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(iv)(D), and  highlighted disclosures when a rate is increased due to delinquency,  default or penalty pricing under Sec. 1026.9(g)(3)(ii) must be given in  a minimum of 10-point font. (See special rule for font size requirements  for the annual percentage rate for purchases under Sec. Sec.  1026.60(b)(1) and 1026.6(b)(2)(i).)</p><p class="depth0">4. Integrated document. The creditor may make both the account- opening disclosures (Sec. 1026.6) and the periodic-statement  disclosures (Sec. 1026.7) on more than one page, and use both the front  and the reverse sides, except where otherwise indicated, so long as the  pages constitute an integrated document. An integrated document would  not include disclosure pages provided to the consumer at different times  or disclosures interspersed on the same page with promotional material.  An integrated document would include, for example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Multiple pages provided in the same envelope that cover related  material and are folded together, numbered consecutively, or clearly  labeled to show that they relate to one another; or</p><p class="depth0">ii. A brochure that contains disclosures and explanatory material  about a range of services the creditor offers, such as credit, checking  account, and electronic fund transfer features.</p><p class="depth0">5. Disclosures covered. Disclosures that must meet the ``clear and  conspicuous'' standard include all required communications under this  subpart. Therefore, disclosures made by a person other than the card  issuer, such as disclosures of finance charges imposed at the time of  honoring a consumer's credit card under Sec. 1026.9(d), and notices,  such as the correction notice required to be sent to the consumer under  Sec. 1026.13(e), must also be clear and conspicuous.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5(a)(1)(ii)(A)</p><p class="depth0">1. Electronic disclosures. Disclosures that need not be provided in  writing under Sec. 1026.5(a)(1)(ii)(A) may be provided in writing,  orally, or in electronic form. If the consumer requests the service in  electronic form, such as on the creditor's Web site, the specified  disclosures may be provided in electronic form without regard to the  consumer consent or other provisions of the Electronic Signatures in  Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq.).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5(a)(1)(iii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosures not subject to E-Sign Act. See the commentary to  Sec. 1026.5(a)(1)(ii)(A) regarding disclosures (in addition to those  specified under Sec. 1026.5(a)(1)(iii)) that may be provided in  electronic form without regard   to the consumer consent or other provisions of the E-Sign Act.</p><p class="depth0">5(a)(2) Terminology</p><p class="depth0">1. When disclosures must be more conspicuous. For home-equity plans  subject to Sec. 1026.40, the terms finance charge and annual percentage  rate, when required to be used with a number, must be disclosed more  conspicuously than other required disclosures, except in the cases  provided in Sec. 1026.5(a)(2)(ii). At the creditor's option, finance  charge and annual percentage rate may also be disclosed more  conspicuously than the other required disclosures even when the  regulation does not so require. The following examples illustrate these  rules:</p><p class="depth0">i. In disclosing the annual percentage rate as required by Sec.  1026.6(a)(1)(ii), the term annual percentage rate is subject to the more  conspicuous rule.</p><p class="depth0">ii. In disclosing the amount of the finance charge, required by  Sec. 1026.7(a)(6)(i), the term finance charge is subject to the more  conspicuous rule.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Although neither finance charge nor annual percentage rate need  be emphasized when used as part of general informational material or in  textual descriptions of other terms, emphasis is permissible in such  cases. For example, when the terms appear as part of the explanations  required under Sec. 1026.6(a)(1)(iii) and (a)(1)(iv), they may be  equally conspicuous as the disclosures required under Sec. Sec.  1026.6(a)(1)(ii) and 1026.7(a)(7).</p><p class="depth0">2. Making disclosures more conspicuous. In disclosing the terms  finance charge and annual percentage rate more conspicuously for home- equity plans subject to Sec. 1026.40, only the words finance charge and  annual percentage rate should be accentuated. For example, if the term  total finance charge is used, only finance charge should be emphasized.  The disclosures may be made more conspicuous by, for example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Capitalizing the words when other disclosures are printed in  lower case.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Putting them in bold print or a contrasting color.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Underlining them.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Setting them off with asterisks.</p><p class="depth0">v. Printing them in larger type.</p><p class="depth0">3. Disclosure of figures--exception to more conspicuous rule. For  home-equity plans subject to Sec. 1026.40, the terms annual percentage  rate and finance charge need not be more conspicuous than figures  (including, for example, numbers, percentages, and dollar signs).</p><p class="depth0">4. Consistent terminology. Language used in disclosures required in  this subpart must be close enough in meaning to enable the consumer to  relate the different disclosures; however, the language need not be  identical.</p><p class="depth0">5(b) Time of Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">5(b)(1) Account-Opening Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">5(b)(1)(i) General Rule</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure before the first transaction. When disclosures must be  furnished ``before the first transaction,'' account-opening disclosures  must be delivered before the consumer becomes obligated on the plan.  Examples include:</p><p class="depth0">i. Purchases. The consumer makes the first purchase, such as when a  consumer opens a credit plan and makes purchases contemporaneously at a  retail store, except when the consumer places a telephone call to make  the purchase and opens the plan contemporaneously. (See commentary to  Sec. 1026.5(b)(1)(iii) below.)</p><p class="depth0">ii. Advances. The consumer receives the first advance. If the  consumer receives a cash advance check at the same time the account- opening disclosures are provided, disclosures are still timely if the  consumer can, after receiving the disclosures, return the cash advance  check to the creditor without obligation (for example, without paying  finance charges).</p><p class="depth0">2. Reactivation of suspended account. If an account is temporarily  suspended (for example, because the consumer has exceeded a credit  limit, or because a credit card is reported lost or stolen) and then is  reactivated, no new account-opening disclosures are required.</p><p class="depth0">3. Reopening closed account. If an account has been closed (for  example, due to inactivity, cancellation, or expiration) and then is  reopened, new account-opening disclosures are required. No new account- opening disclosures are required, however, when the account is closed  merely to assign it a new number (for example, when a credit card is  reported lost or stolen) and the ``new'' account then continues on the  same terms.</p><p class="depth0">4. Converting closed-end to open-end credit. If a closed-end credit  transaction is converted to an open-end credit account under a written  agreement with the consumer, account-opening disclosures under Sec.  1026.6 must be given before the consumer becomes obligated on the open- end credit plan. (See the commentary to Sec. 1026.17 on converting  open-end credit to closed-end credit.)</p><p class="depth0">5. Balance transfers. A creditor that solicits the transfer by a  consumer of outstanding balances from an existing account to a new open- end plan must furnish the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.6 so that  the consumer has an opportunity, after receiving the disclosures, to  contact the creditor before the balance is transferred and decline the  transfer. For example, assume a consumer responds to a card issuer's  solicitation for a credit card account subject to Sec. 1026.60 that  offers a range of balance transfer annual percentage   rates, based on the consumer's creditworthiness. If the creditor opens  an account for the consumer, the creditor would comply with the timing  rules of this section by providing the consumer with the annual  percentage rate (along with the fees and other required disclosures)  that would apply to the balance transfer in time for the consumer to  contact the creditor and withdraw the request. A creditor that permits  consumers to withdraw the request by telephone has met this timing  standard if the creditor does not effect the balance transfer until 10  days after the creditor has sent account-opening disclosures to the  consumer, assuming the consumer has not contacted the creditor to  withdraw the request. Card issuers that are subject to the requirements  of Sec. 1026.60 may establish procedures that comply with both  Sec. Sec. 1026.60 and 1026.6 in a single disclosure statement.</p><p class="depth0">6. Substitution or replacement of credit card accounts. i.  Generally. When a card issuer substitutes or replaces an existing credit  card account with another credit card account, the card issuer must  either provide notice of the terms of the new account consistent with  Sec. 1026.6(b) or provide notice of the changes in the terms of the  existing account consistent with Sec. 1026.9(c)(2). Whether a  substitution or replacement results in the opening of a new account or a  change in the terms of an existing account for purposes of the  disclosure requirements in Sec. Sec. 1026.6(b) and 1026.9(c)(2) is  determined in light of all the relevant facts and circumstances. For  additional requirements and limitations related to the substitution or  replacement of credit card accounts, see Sec. Sec. 1026.12(a) and  1026.55(d) and comments 12(a)(1)-1 through -8, 12(a)(2)-1 through -9,  55(b)(3)-3, and 55(d)-1 through -3.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Relevant facts and circumstances. Listed below are facts and  circumstances that are relevant to whether a substitution or replacement  results in the opening of a new account or a change in the terms of an  existing account for purposes of the disclosure requirements in  Sec. Sec. 1026.6(b) and 1026.9(c)(2). When most of the facts and  circumstances listed below are present, the substitution or replacement  likely constitutes the opening of a new account for which Sec.  1026.6(b) disclosures are appropriate. When few of the facts and  circumstances listed below are present, the substitution or replacement  likely constitutes a change in the terms of an existing account for  which Sec. 1026.9(c)(2) disclosures are appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">A. Whether the card issuer provides the consumer with a new credit  card;</p><p class="depth0">B. Whether the card issuer provides the consumer with a new account  number;</p><p class="depth0">C. Whether the account provides new features or benefits after the  substitution or replacement (such as rewards on purchases);</p><p class="depth0">D. Whether the account can be used to conduct transactions at a  greater or lesser number of merchants after the substitution or  replacement (such as when a retail card is replaced with a cobranded  general purpose credit card that can be used at a wider number of  merchants);</p><p class="depth0">E. Whether the card issuer implemented the substitution or  replacement on an individualized basis (such as in response to a  consumer's request); and</p><p class="depth0">F. Whether the account becomes a different type of open-end plan  after the substitution or replacement (such as when a charge card is  replaced by a credit card).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Replacement as a result of theft or unauthorized use.  Notwithstanding paragraphs i and ii above, a card issuer that replaces a  credit card or provides a new account number because the consumer has  reported the card stolen or because the account appears to have been  used for unauthorized transactions is not required to provide a notice  under Sec. Sec. 1026.6(b) or 1026.9(c)(2) unless the card issuer has  changed a term of the account that is subject to Sec. Sec. 1026.6(b) or  1026.9(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0">5(b)(1)(ii) Charges Imposed as Part of an Open-End (Not Home-Secured)</p><p class="depth0">Plan</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosing charges before the fee is imposed. Creditors may  disclose charges imposed as part of an open-end (not home-secured) plan  orally or in writing at any time before a consumer agrees to pay the fee  or becomes obligated for the charge, unless the charge is specified  under Sec. 1026.6(b)(2). (Charges imposed as part of an open-end (not  home-secured plan) that are not specified under Sec. 1026.6(b)(2) may  alternatively be disclosed in electronic form; see the commentary to  Sec. 1026.5(a)(1)(ii)(A).) Creditors must provide such disclosures at a  time and in a manner that a consumer would be likely to notice them. For  example, if a consumer telephones a card issuer to discuss a particular  service, a creditor would meet the standard if the creditor clearly and  conspicuously discloses the fee associated with the service that is the  topic of the telephone call orally to the consumer. Similarly, a  creditor providing marketing materials in writing to a consumer about a  particular service would meet the standard if the creditor provided a  clear and conspicuous written disclosure of the fee for that service in  those same materials. A creditor that provides written materials to a  consumer about a particular service but provides a fee disclosure for  another service not promoted in such materials would not meet the  standard. For example, if a creditor provided marketing materials  promoting payment by Internet, but included the fee for a replacement  card on such materials with no explanation, the creditor would not be  disclosing the fee at a time and in a manner that the consumer would be  likely to notice the fee.</p><p class="depth0">5(b)(1)(iii) Telephone Purchases</p><p class="depth0">1. Return policies. In order for creditors to provide disclosures in  accordance with the timing requirements of this paragraph, consumers  must be permitted to return merchandise purchased at the time the plan  was established without paying mailing or return-shipment costs.  Creditors may impose costs to return subsequent purchases of merchandise  under the plan, or to return merchandise purchased by other means such  as a credit card issued by another creditor. A reasonable return policy  would be of sufficient duration that the consumer is likely to have  received the disclosures and had sufficient time to make a decision  about the financing plan before his or her right to return the goods  expires. Return policies need not provide a right to return goods if the  consumer consumes or damages the goods, or for installed appliances or  fixtures, provided there is a reasonable repair or replacement policy to  cover defective goods or installations. If the consumer chooses to  reject the financing plan, creditors comply with the requirements of  this paragraph by permitting the consumer to pay for the goods with  another reasonable form of payment acceptable to the merchant and keep  the goods although the creditor cannot require the consumer to do so.</p><p class="depth0">5(b)(1)(iv) Membership Fees</p><p class="depth0">1. Membership fees. See Sec. 1026.60(b)(2) and related commentary  for guidance on fees for issuance or availability of a credit or charge  card.</p><p class="depth0">2. Rejecting the plan. If a consumer has paid or promised to pay a  membership fee including an application fee excludable from the finance  charge under Sec. 1026.4(c)(1) before receiving account-opening  disclosures, the consumer may, after receiving the disclosures, reject  the plan and not be obligated for the membership fee, application fee,  or any other fee or charge. A consumer who has received the disclosures  and uses the account, or makes a payment on the account after receiving  a billing statement, is deemed not to have rejected the plan.</p><p class="depth0">3. Using the account. A consumer uses an account by obtaining an  extension of credit after receiving the account-opening disclosures,  such as by making a purchase or obtaining an advance. A consumer does  not ``use'' the account by activating the account. A consumer also does  not ``use'' the account when the creditor assesses fees on the account  (such as start-up fees or fees associated with credit insurance or debt  cancellation or suspension programs agreed to as a part of the  application and before the consumer receives account-opening  disclosures). For example, the consumer does not ``use'' the account  when a creditor sends a billing statement with start-up fees, there is  no other activity on the account, the consumer does not pay the fees,  and the creditor subsequently assesses a late fee or interest on the  unpaid fee balances. A consumer also does not ``use'' the account by  paying an application fee excludable from the finance charge under Sec.  1026.4(c)(1) prior to receiving the account-opening disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">4. Home-equity plans. Creditors offering home-equity plans subject  to the requirements of Sec. 1026.40 are subject to the requirements of  Sec. 1026.40(h) regarding the collection of fees.</p><p class="depth0">5(b)(2) Periodic Statements</p><p class="depth0">5(b)(2)(i) Statement Required</p><p class="depth0">1. Periodic statements not required. Periodic statements need not be  sent in the following cases:</p><p class="depth0">i. If the creditor adjusts an account balance so that at the end of  the cycle the balance is less than $1--so long as no finance charge has  been imposed on the account for that cycle.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If a statement was returned as undeliverable. If a new address  is provided, however, within a reasonable time before the creditor must  send a statement, the creditor must resume sending statements. Receiving  the address at least 20 days before the end of a cycle would be a  reasonable amount of time to prepare the statement for that cycle. For  example, if an address is received 22 days before the end of the June  cycle, the creditor must send the periodic statement for the June cycle.  (See Sec. 1026.13(a)(7).)</p><p class="depth0">2. Termination of draw privileges. When a consumer's ability to draw  on an open-end account is terminated without being converted to closed- end credit under a written agreement, the creditor must continue to  provide periodic statements to those consumers entitled to receive them  under Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(i), for example, when the draw period of an  open-end credit plan ends and consumers are paying off outstanding  balances according to the account agreement or under the terms of a  workout agreement that is not converted to a closed-end transaction. In  addition, creditors must continue to follow all of the other open-end  credit requirements and procedures in subpart B.</p><p class="depth0">3. Uncollectible accounts. An account is deemed uncollectible for  purposes of Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(i) when a creditor has ceased collection  efforts, either directly or through a third party.</p><p class="depth0">4. Instituting collection proceedings. Creditors institute a  delinquency collection proceeding by filing a court action or initiating  an adjudicatory process with a third party. Assigning a debt to a debt  collector or other third party would not constitute instituting a  collection proceeding.</p><p class="depth0">5(b)(2)(ii) Timing Requirements</p><p class="depth0">1. Mailing or delivery of periodic statements. A creditor is not  required to determine the specific date on which a periodic statement is  mailed or delivered to an individual consumer for purposes of Sec.  1026.5(b)(2)(ii). A creditor complies with Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(ii) if it  has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that periodic  statements are mailed or delivered to consumers no later than a certain  number of days after the closing date of the billing cycle and adds that  number of days to the 21-day or 14-day period required by Sec.  1026.5(b)(2)(ii) when determining, as applicable, the payment due date  for purposes of Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A), the date on which any grace  period expires for purposes of Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(1), or the date  after which the payment will be treated as late for purposes of Sec.  1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(2). For example:</p><p class="depth0">A. If a creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to  ensure that periodic statements for a credit card account under an open- end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan or an account under an open- end consumer credit plan that provides a grace period are mailed or  delivered to consumers no later than three days after the closing date  of the billing cycle, the payment due date for purposes of Sec.  1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A) and the date on which any grace period expires for  purposes of Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(1) must be no less than 24 days  after the closing date of the billing cycle. Similarly, in these  circumstances, the limitations in Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A) and  (b)(2)(ii)(B)(1) on treating a payment as late and imposing finance  charges apply for 24 days after the closing date of the billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">B. If a creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to  ensure that periodic statements for an account under an open-end  consumer credit plan that does not provide a grace period are mailed or  delivered to consumers no later than five days after the closing date of  the billing cycle, the date on which a payment must be received in order  to avoid being treated as late for purposes of Sec.  1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(2) must be no less than 19 days after the closing  date of the billing cycle. Similarly, in these circumstances, the  limitation in Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(2) on treating a payment as late  for any purpose applies for 19 days after the closing date of the  billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">2. Treating a payment as late for any purpose. Treating a payment as  late for any purpose includes increasing the annual percentage rate as a  penalty, reporting the consumer as delinquent to a credit reporting  agency, assessing a late fee or any other fee, initiating collection  activities, or terminating benefits (such as rewards on purchases) based  on the consumer's failure to make a payment within a specified amount of  time or by a specified date. The prohibitions in Sec.  1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A)(2) and (b)(2)(B)(2)(ii) on treating a payment as  late for any purpose apply only during the 21-day or 14-day period (as  applicable) following mailing or delivery of the periodic statement  stating the due date for that payment and only if the required minimum  periodic payment is received within that period. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that, for a credit card account under an open-end (not  home-secured) consumer credit plan, a periodic statement mailed on April  4 states that a required minimum periodic payment of $50 is due on April  25. If the card issuer does not receive any payment on or before April  25, Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A)(2) does not prohibit the card issuer from  treating the required minimum periodic payment as late.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Same facts as in paragraph i above. On April 20, the card issuer  receives a payment of $30 and no additional payment is received on or  before April 25. Section 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A)(2) does not prohibit the  card issuer from treating the required minimum periodic payment as late.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Same facts as in paragraph i above. On May 4, the card issuer  has not received the $50 required minimum periodic payment that was due  on April 25. The periodic statement mailed on May 4 states that a  required minimum periodic payment of $150 is due on May 25. Section  1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A)(2) does not permit the card issuer to treat the $150  required minimum periodic payment as late until April 26. However, the  card issuer may continue to treat the $50 required minimum periodic  payment as late during this period.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Assume that, for an account under an open-end consumer credit  plan that does not provide a grace period, a periodic statement mailed  on September 10 states that a required minimum periodic payment of $100  is due on September 24. If the creditor does not receive any payment on  or before September 24, Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(2)(ii) does not  prohibit the creditor from treating the required minimum periodic  payment as late.</p><p class="depth0">3. Grace periods. i. Definition of grace period. For purposes of  Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(B), ``grace period'' means a period within which  any credit extended may be repaid without incurring a finance charge due  to a periodic interest rate. A deferred interest or similar promotional  program under which the consumer is not obligated to pay interest that  accrues on a balance if that balance is paid in full prior to the  expiration of a specified period of time is not a grace period for  purposes of Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(B). Similarly, a period following the  payment due date during which a late payment fee will not be imposed is  not a grace period for purposes of Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(B). See  comments 7(b)(11)-1, 7(b)(11)-2, and 54(a)(1)-2.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Applicability of Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(1). Section  1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(1) applies if an account   is eligible for a grace period when the periodic statement is mailed or  delivered. Section 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(1) does not require the creditor  to provide a grace period or prohibit the creditor from placing  limitations and conditions on a grace period to the extent consistent  with Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(B) and Sec. 1026.54. See comment 54(a)(1)- 1. Furthermore, the prohibition in Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(1)(ii)  applies only during the 21-day period following mailing or delivery of  the periodic statement and applies only when the creditor receives a  payment within that 21-day period that satisfies the terms of the grace  period.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Example. Assume that the billing cycles for an account begin on  the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month and that  the payment due date for the account is the twenty-fifth of the month.  Assume also that, under the terms of the account, the balance at the end  of a billing cycle must be paid in full by the following payment due  date in order for the account to remain eligible for the grace period.  At the end of the April billing cycle, the balance on the account is  $500. The grace period applies to the $500 balance because the balance  for the March billing cycle was paid in full on April 25. Accordingly,  Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(1)(i) requires the creditor to have reasonable  procedures designed to ensure that the periodic statement reflecting the  $500 balance is mailed or delivered on or before May 4. Furthermore,  Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(1)(ii) requires the creditor to have  reasonable procedures designed to ensure that the creditor does not  impose finance charges as a result of the loss of the grace period if a  $500 payment is received on or before May 25. However, if the creditor  receives a payment of $300 on April 25, Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(1)(ii)  would not prohibit the creditor from imposing finance charges as a  result of the loss of the grace period (to the extent permitted by Sec.  1026.54).</p><p class="depth0">4. Application of Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(ii) to charge card and charged- off accounts. i. Charge card accounts. For purposes of Sec.  1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A)(1), the payment due date for a credit card account  under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan is the date  the card issuer is required to disclose on the periodic statement  pursuant to Sec. 1026.7(b)(11)(i)(A). Because Sec. 1026.7(b)(11)(ii)  provides that Sec. 1026.7(b)(11)(i) does not apply to periodic  statements provided solely for charge card accounts, Sec.  1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A)(1) also does not apply to the mailing or delivery of  periodic statements provided solely for such accounts. However, in these  circumstances, Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A)(2) requires the card issuer to  have reasonable procedures designed to ensure that a payment is not  treated as late for any purpose during the 21-day period following  mailing or delivery of the statement. A card issuer that complies with  Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A) as discussed above with respect to a charge  card account has also complied with Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(2).  Section 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(1) does not apply to charge card accounts  because, for purposes of Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(B), a grace period is a  period within which any credit extended may be repaid without incurring  a finance charge due to a periodic interest rate and, consistent with  Sec. 1026.2(a)(15)(iii), charge card accounts do not impose a finance  charge based on a periodic rate.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Charged-off accounts. For purposes of Sec.  1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A)(1), the payment due date for a credit card account  under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan is the date  the card issuer is required to disclose on the periodic statement  pursuant to Sec. 1026.7(b)(11)(i)(A). Because Sec. 1026.7(b)(11)(ii)  provides that Sec. 1026.7(b)(11)(i) does not apply to periodic  statements provided for charged-off accounts where full payment of the  entire account balance is due immediately, Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A)(1)  also does not apply to the mailing or delivery of periodic statements  provided solely for such accounts. Furthermore, although Sec.  1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A)(2) requires the card issuer to have reasonable  procedures designed to ensure that a payment is not treated as late for  any purpose during the 21-day period following mailing or delivery of  the statement, Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A)(2) does not prohibit a card  issuer from continuing to treat prior payments as late during that  period. See comment 5(b)(2)(ii)-2. Similarly, although Sec.  1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(2) applies to open-end consumer credit accounts in  these circumstances, Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(2)(ii) does not prohibit  a creditor from continuing treating prior payments as late during the  14-day period following mailing or delivery of a periodic statement.  Section 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(1) does not apply to charged-off accounts  where full payment of the entire account balance is due immediately  because such accounts do not provide a grace period.</p><p class="depth0">5. Consumer request to pick up periodic statements. When a consumer  initiates a request, the creditor may permit, but may not require, the  consumer to pick up periodic statements. If the consumer wishes to pick  up a statement, the statement must be made available in accordance with  Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">6. Deferred interest and similar promotional programs. See comment  7(b)-1.iv.</p><p class="depth0">5(c) Basis of Disclosures and Use of Estimates</p><p class="depth0">1. Legal obligation. The disclosures should reflect the credit terms  to which the parties are legally bound at the time of giving the  disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">i. The legal obligation is determined by applicable state or other  law.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The fact that a term or contract may later be deemed  unenforceable by a court on the basis of equity or other grounds does  not,   by itself, mean that disclosures based on that term or contract did not  reflect the legal obligation.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The legal obligation normally is presumed to be contained in  the contract that evidences the agreement. But this may be rebutted if  another agreement between the parties legally modifies that contract.</p><p class="depth0">2. Estimates--obtaining information. Disclosures may be estimated  when the exact information is unknown at the time disclosures are made.  Information is unknown if it is not reasonably available to the creditor  at the time disclosures are made. The reasonably available standard  requires that the creditor, acting in good faith, exercise due diligence  in obtaining information. In using estimates, the creditor is not  required to disclose the basis for the estimated figures, but may  include such explanations as additional information. The creditor  normally may rely on the representations of other parties in obtaining  information. For example, the creditor might look to insurance companies  for the cost of insurance.</p><p class="depth0">3. Estimates--redisclosure. If the creditor makes estimated  disclosures, redisclosure is not required for that consumer, even though  more accurate information becomes available before the first  transaction. For example, in an open-end plan to be secured by real  estate, the creditor may estimate the appraisal fees to be charged; such  an estimate might reasonably be based on the prevailing market rates for  similar appraisals. If the exact appraisal fee is determinable after the  estimate is furnished but before the consumer receives the first advance  under the plan, no new disclosure is necessary.</p><p class="depth0">5(d) Multiple Creditors; Multiple Consumers</p><p class="depth0">1. Multiple creditors. Under Sec. 1026.5(d):</p><p class="depth0">i. Creditors must choose which of them will make the disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A single, complete set of disclosures must be provided, rather  than partial disclosures from several creditors.</p><p class="depth0">iii. All disclosures for the open-end credit plan must be given,  even if the disclosing creditor would not otherwise have been obligated  to make a particular disclosure.</p><p class="depth0">2. Multiple consumers. Disclosures may be made to either obligor on  a joint account. Disclosure responsibilities are not satisfied by giving  disclosures to only a surety or guarantor for a principal obligor or to  an authorized user. In rescindable transactions, however, separate  disclosures must be given to each consumer who has the right to rescind  under Sec. 1026.15.</p><p class="depth0">3. Card issuer and person extending credit not the same person.  Section 127(c)(4)(D) of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C.  1637(c)(4)(D)) contains rules pertaining to charge card issuers with  plans that allow access to an open-end credit plan that is maintained by  a person other than the charge card issuer. These rules are not  implemented in Regulation Z (although they were formerly implemented in  Sec. 1026.60(f)). However, the statutory provisions remain in effect  and may be used by charge card issuers with plans meeting the specified  criteria.</p><p class="depth0">5(e) Effect of Subsequent Events</p><p class="depth0">1. Events causing inaccuracies. Inaccuracies in disclosures are not  violations if attributable to events occurring after disclosures are  made. For example, when the consumer fails to fulfill a prior commitment  to keep the collateral insured and the creditor then provides the  coverage and charges the consumer for it, such a change does not make  the original disclosures inaccurate. The creditor may, however, be  required to provide a new disclosure(s) under Sec. 1026.9(c).</p><p class="depth0">2. Use of inserts. When changes in a creditor's plan affect required  disclosures, the creditor may use inserts with outdated disclosure  forms. Any insert:</p><p class="depth0">i. Should clearly refer to the disclosure provision it replaces.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Need not be physically attached or affixed to the basic  disclosure statement.</p><p class="depth0">iii. May be used only until the supply of outdated forms is  exhausted.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.6--Account-Opening Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">6(a) Rules Affecting Home-Equity Plans</p><p class="depth0">6(a)(1) Finance Charge</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 6(a)(1)(i)</p><p class="depth0">1. When finance charges accrue. Creditors are not required to  disclose a specific date when finance charges will begin to accrue.  Creditors may provide a general explanation such as that the consumer  has 30 days from the closing date to pay the new balance before finance  charges will accrue on the account.</p><p class="depth0">2. Grace periods. In disclosing whether or not a grace period  exists, the creditor need not use ``free period,'' ``free-ride period,''  ``grace period'' or any other particular descriptive phrase or term. For  example, a statement that ``the finance charge begins on the date the  transaction is posted to your account'' adequately discloses that no  grace period exists. In the same fashion, a statement that ``finance  charges will be imposed on any new purchases only if they are not paid  in full within 25 days after the close of the billing cycle'' indicates  that a grace period exists in the interim.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 6(a)(1)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Range of balances. The range of balances disclosure is  inapplicable:</p><p class="depth0">i. If only one periodic rate may be applied to the entire account  balance.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If only one periodic rate may be applied to the entire balance  for a feature (for example, cash advances), even though the balance for  another feature (purchases) may be subject to two rates (a 1.5% monthly  periodic rate on purchase balances of $0-$500, and a 1% monthly periodic  rate for balances above $500). In this example, the creditor must give a  range of balances disclosure for the purchase feature.</p><p class="depth0">2. Variable-rate disclosures--coverage. i. Examples. This section  covers open-end credit plans under which rate changes are specifically  set forth in the account agreement and are tied to an index or formula.  A creditor would use variable-rate disclosures for plans involving rate  changes such as the following:</p><p class="depth0">A. Rate changes that are tied to the rate the creditor pays on its  six-month certificates of deposit.</p><p class="depth0">B. Rate changes that are tied to Treasury bill rates.</p><p class="depth0">C. Rate changes that are tied to changes in the creditor's  commercial lending rate.</p><p class="depth0">ii. An open-end credit plan in which the employee receives a lower  rate contingent upon employment (that is, with the rate to be increased  upon termination of employment) is not a variable-rate plan.</p><p class="depth0">3. Variable-rate plan--rate(s) in effect. In disclosing the rate(s)  in effect at the time of the account-opening disclosures (as is required  by Sec. 1026.6(a)(1)(ii)), the creditor may use an insert showing the  current rate; may give the rate as of a specified date and then update  the disclosure from time to time, for example, each calendar month; or  may disclose an estimated rate under Sec. 1026.5(c).</p><p class="depth0">4. Variable-rate plan--additional disclosures required. In addition  to disclosing the rates in effect at the time of the account-opening  disclosures, the disclosures under Sec. 1026.6(a)(1)(ii) also must be  made.</p><p class="depth0">5. Variable-rate plan--index. The index to be used must be clearly  identified; the creditor need not give, however, an explanation of how  the index is determined or provide instructions for obtaining it.</p><p class="depth0">6. Variable-rate plan--circumstances for increase. i. Circumstances  under which the rate(s) may increase include, for example:</p><p class="depth0">A. An increase in the Treasury bill rate.</p><p class="depth0">B. An increase in the Federal Reserve discount rate.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The creditor must disclose when the increase will take effect;  for example:</p><p class="depth0">A. ``An increase will take effect on the day that the Treasury bill  rate increases,'' or</p><p class="depth0">B. ``An increase in the Federal Reserve discount rate will take  effect on the first day of the creditor's billing cycle.''</p><p class="depth0">7. Variable-rate plan--limitations on increase. In disclosing any  limitations on rate increases, limitations such as the maximum increase  per year or the maximum increase over the duration of the plan must be  disclosed. When there are no limitations, the creditor may, but need  not, disclose that fact. (A maximum interest rate must be included in  dwelling-secured open-end credit plans under which the interest rate may  be changed. See Sec. 1026.30 and the commentary to that section.) Legal  limits such as usury or rate ceilings under state or Federal statutes or  regulations need not be disclosed. Examples of limitations that must be  disclosed include:</p><p class="depth0">i. ``The rate on the plan will not exceed 25% annual percentage  rate.''</p><p class="depth0">ii. ``Not more than \1/2\ percent increase in the annual percentage  rate per year will occur.''</p><p class="depth0">8. Variable-rate plan--effects of increase. Examples of effects of  rate increases that must be disclosed include:</p><p class="depth0">i. Any requirement for additional collateral if the annual  percentage rate increases beyond a specified rate.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Any increase in the scheduled minimum periodic payment amount.</p><p class="depth0">9. Variable-rate plan--change-in-terms notice not required. No  notice of a change in terms is required for a rate increase under a  variable-rate plan as defined in comment 6(a)(1)(ii)-2.</p><p class="depth0">10. Discounted variable-rate plans. In some variable-rate plans,  creditors may set an initial interest rate that is not determined by the  index or formula used to make later interest rate adjustments.  Typically, this initial rate is lower than the rate would be if it were  calculated using the index or formula.</p><p class="depth0">i. For example, a creditor may calculate interest rates according to  a formula using the six-month Treasury bill rate plus a 2 percent  margin. If the current Treasury bill rate is 10 percent, the creditor  may forgo the 2 percent spread and charge only 10 percent for a limited  time, instead of setting an initial rate of 12 percent, or the creditor  may disregard the index or formula and set the initial rate at 9  percent.</p><p class="depth0">ii. When creditors use an initial rate that is not calculated using  the index or formula for later rate adjustments, the account-opening  disclosure statement should reflect:</p><p class="depth0">A. The initial rate (expressed as a periodic rate and a  corresponding annual percentage rate), together with a statement of how  long the initial rate will remain in effect;</p><p class="depth0">B. The current rate that would have been applied using the index or  formula (also expressed as a periodic rate and a corresponding annual  percentage rate); and</p><p class="depth0">C. The other variable-rate information required in Sec.  1026.6(a)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">iii. In disclosing the current periodic and annual percentage rates  that would be applied using the index or formula, the creditor may use  any of the disclosure options described in comment 6(a)(1)(ii)-3.</p><p class="depth0">11. Increased penalty rates. If the initial rate may increase upon  the occurrence of one or more specific events, such as a late payment   or an extension of credit that exceeds the credit limit, the creditor  must disclose the initial rate and the increased penalty rate that may  apply. If the penalty rate is based on an index and an increased margin,  the issuer must disclose the index and the margin. The creditor must  also disclose the specific event or events that may result in the  increased rate, such as ``22% APR, if 60 days late.'' If the penalty  rate cannot be determined at the time disclosures are given, the  creditor must provide an explanation of the specific event or events  that may result in the increased rate. At the creditor's option, the  creditor may disclose the period for which the increased rate will  remain in effect, such as ``until you make three timely payments.'' The  creditor need not disclose an increased rate that is imposed when credit  privileges are permanently terminated.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 6(a)(1)(iii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Explanation of balance computation method. A shorthand phrase  such as ``previous balance method'' does not suffice in explaining the  balance computation method. (See Model Clauses G-1 and G-1(A) to part  1026.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Allocation of payments. Creditors may, but need not, explain how  payments and other credits are allocated to outstanding balances. For  example, the creditor need not disclose that payments are applied to  late charges, overdue balances, and finance charges before being applied  to the principal balance; or in a multifeatured plan, that payments are  applied first to finance charges, then to purchases, and then to cash  advances. (See comment 7-1 for definition of multifeatured plan.)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 6(a)(1)(iv)</p><p class="depth0">1. Finance charges. In addition to disclosing the periodic rate(s)  under Sec. 1026.6(a)(1)(ii), creditors must disclose any other type of  finance charge that may be imposed, such as minimum, fixed, transaction,  and activity charges; required insurance; or appraisal or credit report  fees (unless excluded from the finance charge under Sec. 1026.4(c)(7)).  Creditors are not required to disclose the fact that no finance charge  is imposed when the outstanding balance is less than a certain amount or  the balance below which no finance charge will be imposed.</p><p class="depth0">6(a)(2) Other Charges</p><p class="depth0">1. General; examples of other charges. Under Sec. 1026.6(a)(2),  significant charges related to the plan (that are not finance charges)  must also be disclosed. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Late-payment and over-the-credit-limit charges.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Fees for providing documentary evidence of transactions  requested under Sec. 1026.13 (billing error resolution).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Charges imposed in connection with residential mortgage  transactions or real estate transactions such as title, appraisal, and  credit-report fees (see Sec. 1026.4(c)(7)).</p><p class="depth0">iv. A tax imposed on the credit transaction by a state or other  governmental body, such as a documentary stamp tax on cash advances.  (See the commentary to Sec. 1026.4(a)).</p><p class="depth0">v. A membership or participation fee for a package of services that  includes an open-end credit feature, unless the fee is required whether  or not the open-end credit feature is included. For example, a  membership fee to join a credit union is not an ``other charge,'' even  if membership is required to apply for credit. For example, if the  primary benefit of membership in an organization is the opportunity to  apply for a credit card, and the other benefits offered (such as a  newsletter or a member information hotline) are merely incidental to the  credit feature, the membership fee would be disclosed as an ``other  charge.''</p><p class="depth0">vi. Charges imposed for the termination of an open-end credit plan.</p><p class="depth0">2. Exclusions. The following are examples of charges that are not  ``other charges'':</p><p class="depth0">i. Fees charged for documentary evidence of transactions for income  tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Amounts payable by a consumer for collection activity after  default; attorney's fees, whether or not automatically imposed;  foreclosure costs; post-judgment interest rates imposed by law; and  reinstatement or reissuance fees.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Premiums for voluntary credit life or disability insurance, or  for property insurance, that are not part of the finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Application fees under Sec. 1026.4(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0">v. A monthly service charge for a checking account with overdraft  protection that is applied to all checking accounts, whether or not a  credit feature is attached.</p><p class="depth0">vi. Charges for submitting as payment a check that is later returned  unpaid (See commentary to Sec. 1026.4(c)(2)).</p><p class="depth0">vii. Charges imposed on a cardholder by an institution other than  the card issuer for the use of the other institution's ATM in a shared  or interchange system. (See also comment 7(a)(2)-2.)</p><p class="depth0">viii. Taxes and filing or notary fees excluded from the finance  charge under Sec. 1026.4(e).</p><p class="depth0">ix. A fee to expedite delivery of a credit card, either at account  opening or during the life of the account, provided delivery of the card  is also available by standard mail service (or other means at least as  fast) without paying a fee for delivery.</p><p class="depth0">x. A fee charged for arranging a single payment on the credit  account, upon the consumer's request (regardless of how frequently the  consumer requests the service), if the credit plan provides that the  consumer may make payments on the account by another reasonable means,  such as by standard   mail service, without paying a fee to the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">6(a)(3) Home-Equity Plan Information</p><p class="depth0">1. Additional disclosures required. For home-equity plans, creditors  must provide several of the disclosures set forth in Sec. 1026.40(d)  along with the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.6. Creditors also  must disclose a list of the conditions that permit the creditor to  terminate the plan, freeze or reduce the credit limit, and implement  specified modifications to the original terms. (See comment  40(d)(4)(iii)-1.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Form of disclosures. The home-equity disclosures provided under  this section must be in a form the consumer can keep, and are governed  by Sec. 1026.5(a)(1). The segregation standard set forth in Sec.  1026.40(a) does not apply to home-equity disclosures provided under  Sec. 1026.6.</p><p class="depth0">3. Disclosure of payment and variable-rate examples. i. The payment- example disclosure in Sec. 1026.40(d)(5)(iii) and the variable-rate  information in Sec. 1026.40(d)(12)(viii), (d)(12)(x), (d)(12)(xi), and  (d)(12)(xii) need not be provided with the disclosures under Sec.  1026.6 if the disclosures under Sec. 1026.40(d) were provided in a form  the consumer could keep; and the disclosures of the payment example  under Sec. 1026.40(d)(5)(iii), the maximum-payment example under Sec.  1026.40(d)(12)(x) and the historical table under Sec.  1026.40(d)(12)(xi) included a representative payment example for the  category of payment options the consumer has chosen.</p><p class="depth0">ii. For example, if a creditor offers three payment options (one for  each of the categories described in the commentary to Sec.  1026.40(d)(5)), describes all three options in its early disclosures,  and provides all of the disclosures in a retainable form, that creditor  need not provide the Sec. 1026.40(d)(5)(iii) or (d)(12) disclosures  again when the account is opened. If the creditor showed only one of the  three options in the early disclosures (which would be the case with a  separate disclosure form rather than a combined form, as discussed under  Sec. 1026.40(a)), the disclosures under Sec. 1026.40(d)(5)(iii),  (d)(12)(viii), (d)(12)(x), (d)(12)(xi) and (d)(12)(xii) must be given to  any consumer who chooses one of the other two options. If the Sec.  1026.40(d)(5)(iii) and (d)(12) disclosures are provided with the second  set of disclosures, they need not be transaction-specific, but may be  based on a representative example of the category of payment option  chosen.</p><p class="depth0">4. Disclosures for the repayment period. The creditor must provide  disclosures about both the draw and repayment phases when giving the  disclosures under Sec. 1026.6. Specifically, the creditor must make the  disclosures in Sec. 1026.6(a)(3), state the corresponding annual  percentage rate, and provide the variable-rate information required in  Sec. 1026.6(a)(1)(ii) for the repayment phase. To the extent the  corresponding annual percentage rate, the information in Sec.  1026.6(a)(1)(ii), and any other required disclosures are the same for  the draw and repayment phase, the creditor need not repeat such  information, as long as it is clear that the information applies to both  phases.</p><p class="depth0">6(a)(4) Security Interests</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Creditors are not required to use specific terms to  describe a security interest, or to explain the type of security or the  creditor's rights with respect to the collateral.</p><p class="depth0">2. Identification of property. Creditors sufficiently identify  collateral by type by stating, for example, motor vehicle or household  appliances. (Creditors should be aware, however, that the Federal credit  practices rules, as well as some state laws, prohibit certain security  interests in household goods.) The creditor may, at its option, provide  a more specific identification (for example, a model and serial number).</p><p class="depth0">3. Spreader clause. If collateral for preexisting credit with the  creditor will secure the plan being opened, the creditor must disclose  that fact. (Such security interests may be known as ``spreader'' or  ``dragnet'' clauses, or as ``cross-collateralization'' clauses.) The  creditor need not specifically identify the collateral; a reminder such  as ``collateral securing other loans with us may also secure this loan''  is sufficient. At the creditor's option, a more specific description of  the property involved may be given.</p><p class="depth0">4. Additional collateral. If collateral is required when advances  reach a certain amount, the creditor should disclose the information  available at the time of the account-opening disclosures. For example,  if the creditor knows that a security interest will be taken in  household goods if the consumer's balance exceeds $1,000, the creditor  should disclose accordingly. If the creditor knows that security will be  required if the consumer's balance exceeds $1,000, but the creditor does  not know what security will be required, the creditor must disclose on  the initial disclosure statement that security will be required if the  balance exceeds $1,000, and the creditor must provide a change-in-terms  notice under Sec. 1026.9(c) at the time the security is taken. (See  comment 6(a)(4)-2.)</p><p class="depth0">5. Collateral from third party. Security interests taken in  connection with the plan must be disclosed, whether the collateral is  owned by the consumer or a third party.</p><p class="depth0">6(a)(5) Statement of Billing Rights</p><p class="depth0">1.

Creditors must use the accuracy standard for annual percentage  rates in Sec. 1026.6(b)(4)(ii)(G).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Generally, creditors must disclose the specific rate for each  feature that applies to the account. If the rates on an open-end (not  home-secured) plan vary by state and the creditor is providing the  account-opening table in person at the time the plan is established in  connection with financing the purchase of goods or services the creditor  may, at its option, disclose in the account-opening table (A) the rate  applicable to the consumer's account, or (B) the range of rates, if the  disclosure includes a statement that the rate varies by state and refers  the consumer to the account agreement or other disclosure provided with  the account-opening table where the rate applicable to the consumer's  account is disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Creditors must explain whether or not a grace period exists for  all features on the account. The row heading ``Paying Interest'' must be  used if any one feature on the account does not have a grace period.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Creditors must name the balance computation method used for each  feature of the account and state that an explanation of the balance  computation method(s) is provided in the account-opening disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">v. Creditors must state that consumers' billing rights are provided  in the account-opening disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">vi. If fees on an open-end (not home-secured) plan vary by state and  the creditor is providing the account-opening table in person at the  time the plan is established in connection with financing the purchase  of goods or services the creditor may, at its option, disclose in the  account-opening table (A) the specific fee applicable to the consumer's  account, or (B) the range of fees, if the disclosure includes a  statement that the amount of the fee varies by state and refers the  consumer to the account agreement or other disclosure provided with the  account-opening table where the fee applicable to the consumer's account  is disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">vii. Creditors that must disclose the amount of available credit  must state the initial credit limit provided on the account.</p><p class="depth0">viii. Creditors must disclose directly beneath the table the  circumstances under which an introductory rate may be revoked and the  rate that will apply after the introductory rate is revoked. Issuers of  credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer  credit plan are subject to limitations on the circumstances under which  an introductory rate may be revoked. (See comment 60(b)(1)-5 for  guidance on how a card issuer may disclose the circumstances under which  an introductory rate may be revoked.)</p><p class="depth0">ix. The applicable forms providing safe harbors for account-opening  tables are under appendix G-17 to part 1026.</p><p class="depth0">2. Clear and conspicuous standard. See comment 5(a)(1)-1 for the  clear and conspicuous standard applicable to Sec. 1026.6 disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">3. Terminology. Section 1026.6(b)(1) generally requires that the  headings, content, and format of the tabular disclosures be  substantially similar, but need not be identical, to the tables in  appendix G to part 1026; but see Sec. 1026.5(a)(2) for terminology  requirements applicable to Sec. 1026.6(b).  6(b)(2) Required Disclosures for Account-Opening Table for Open-End (Not</p><p class="depth0">Home-Secured) Plans</p><p class="depth0">6(b)(2)(iii) Fixed Finance Charge; Minimum Interest Charge</p><p class="depth0">1. Example of brief statement. See Samples G-17(B), G-17(C), and G- 17(D) for guidance on how to provide a brief description of a minimum  interest charge.</p><p class="depth0">6(b)(2)(v) Grace Period</p><p class="depth0">1. Grace period. Creditors must state any conditions on the  applicability of the grace period. A creditor, however, may not disclose  under Sec. 1026.6(b)(2)(v) the limitations on the imposition of finance  charges as a result of a loss of a grace period in Sec. 1026.54, or the  impact of payment allocation on whether interest is charged on  transactions as a result of a loss of a grace period. Some creditors may  offer a grace period on all types of transactions under which interest  will not be charged on transactions if the consumer pays the outstanding  balance shown on a periodic statement in full by the due date shown on  that statement for one or more billing cycles. In these circumstances,  Sec. 1026.6(b)(2)(v) requires that the creditor disclose the grace  period and the conditions for its applicability using the following  language, or substantially similar language, as applicable: ``Your due  date is [at least] ------ days after the close of each billing cycle. We  will not charge you any interest on your account if you pay your entire  balance by the due date each month.'' However, other creditors may offer  a grace period on all types of transactions under which interest may be  charged on transactions even if the consumer pays the outstanding  balance shown on a periodic statement in full by the due date shown on  that statement each billing cycle. In these circumstances, Sec.  1026.6(b)(2)(v) requires the creditor to amend the above disclosure  language to describe accurately the   conditions on the applicability of the grace period.</p><p class="depth0">2. No grace period. Creditors may use the following language to  describe that no grace period is offered, as applicable: ``We will begin  charging interest on [applicable transactions] on the transaction  date.''</p><p class="depth0">3. Grace period on some features. Some creditors do not offer a  grace period on cash advances and balance transfers, but offer a grace  period for all purchases under which interest will not be charged on  purchases if the consumer pays the outstanding balance shown on a  periodic statement in full by the due date shown on that statement for  one or more billing cycles. In these circumstances, Sec.  1026.6(b)(2)(v) requires that the creditor disclose the grace period for  purchases and the conditions for its applicability, and the lack of a  grace period for cash advances and balance transfers using the following  language, or substantially similar language, as applicable: ``Your due  date is [at least] ------ days after the close of each billing cycle. We  will not charge you any interest on purchases if you pay your entire  balance by the due date each month. We will begin charging interest on  cash advances and balance transfers on the transaction date.'' However,  other creditors may offer a grace period on all purchases under which  interest may be charged on purchases even if the consumer pays the  outstanding balance shown on a periodic statement in full by the due  date shown on that statement each billing cycle. In these circumstances,  Sec. 1026.6(a)(2)(v) requires the creditor to amend the above  disclosure language to describe accurately the conditions on the  applicability of the grace period. Also, some creditors may not offer a  grace period on cash advances and balance transfers, and will begin  charging interest on these transactions from a date other than the  transaction date, such as the posting date. In these circumstances,  Sec. 1026.6(a)(2)(v) requires the creditor to amend the above  disclosure language to be accurate.</p><p class="depth0">6(b)(2)(vi) Balance Computation Method</p><p class="depth0">1. Use of same balance computation method for all features. In cases  where the balance for each feature is computed using the same balance  computation method, a single identification of the name of the balance  computation method is sufficient. In this case, a creditor may use an  appropriate name listed in Sec. 1026.60(g) (e.g., ``average daily  balance (including new purchases)'') to satisfy the requirement to  disclose the name of the method for all features on the account, even  though the name only refers to purchases. For example, if a creditor  uses the average daily balance method including new transactions for all  features, a creditor may use the name ``average daily balance (including  new purchases)'' listed in Sec. 1026.60(g)(i) to satisfy the  requirement to disclose the name of the balance computation method for  all features. As an alternative, in this situation, a creditor may  revise the balance computation names listed in Sec. 1026.60(g) to refer  more broadly to all new credit transactions, such as using the language  ``new transactions'' or ``current transactions'' (e.g., ``average daily  balance (including new transactions)''), rather than simply referring to  new purchases when the same method is used to calculate the balances for  all features of the account. See Samples G-17(B) and G-17(C) for  guidance on how to disclose the balance computation method where the  same method is used for all features on the account.</p><p class="depth0">2. Use of balance computation names in Sec. 1026.60(g) for balances  other than purchases. The names of the balance computation methods  listed in Sec. 1026.60(g) describe balance computation methods for  purchases. When a creditor is disclosing the name of the balance  computation methods separately for each feature, in using the names  listed in Sec. 1026.60(g) to satisfy the requirements of Sec.  1026.6(b)(2)(vi) for features other than purchases, a creditor must  revise the names listed in Sec. 1026.60(g) to refer to the other  features. For example, when disclosing the name of the balance  computation method applicable to cash advances, a creditor must revise  the name listed in Sec. 1026.60(g)(i) to disclose it as ``average daily  balance (including new cash advances)'' when the balance for cash  advances is figured by adding the outstanding balance (including new  cash advances and deducting payments and credits) for each day in the  billing cycle, and then dividing by the number of days in the billing  cycle. Similarly, a creditor must revise the name listed in Sec.  1026.60(g)(ii) to disclose it as ``average daily balance (excluding new  cash advances)'' when the balance for cash advances is figured by adding  the outstanding balance (excluding new cash advances and deducting  payments and credits) for each day in the billing cycle, and then  dividing by the number of days in the billing cycle. See comment  6(b)(2)(vi)-1 for guidance on the use of one balance computation name  when the same balance computation method is used for all features on the  account.</p><p class="depth0">6(b)(2)(xiii) Available Credit</p><p class="depth0">1. Right to reject the plan. Creditors may use the following  language to describe consumers' right to reject a plan after receiving  account-opening disclosures: ``You may still reject this plan, provided  that you have not yet used the account or paid a fee after receiving a  billing statement. If you do reject the plan, you are not responsible  for any fees or charges.''</p><p class="depth0">6(b)(3) Disclosure of Charges Imposed as Part of Open-End (Not Home-</p><p class="depth0">Secured) Plans</p><p class="depth0">1. When finance charges accrue. Creditors are not required to  disclose a specific date when a cost that is a finance charge under  Sec. 1026.4 will begin to accrue.</p><p class="depth0">2. Grace periods. In disclosing in the account agreement or  disclosure statement whether or not a grace period exists, the creditor  need not use any particular descriptive phrase or term. However, the  descriptive phrase or term must be sufficiently similar to the  disclosures provided pursuant to Sec. Sec. 1026.60(b)(5) and  1026.6(b)(2)(v) to satisfy a creditor's duty to provide consistent  terminology under Sec. 1026.5(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0">3. No finance charge imposed below certain balance. Creditors are  not required to disclose the fact that no finance charge is imposed when  the outstanding balance is less than a certain amount or the balance  below which no finance charge will be imposed.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 6(b)(3)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Failure to use the plan as agreed. Late payment fees, over-the- limit fees, and fees for payments returned unpaid are examples of  charges resulting from consumers' failure to use the plan as agreed.</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples of fees that affect the plan. Examples of charges the  payment, or nonpayment, of which affects the consumer's account are:</p><p class="depth0">i. Access to the plan. Fees for using the card at the creditor's ATM  to obtain a cash advance, fees to obtain additional cards including  replacements for lost or stolen cards, fees to expedite delivery of  cards or other credit devices, application and membership fees, and  annual or other participation fees identified in Sec. 1026.4(c)(4).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Amount of credit extended. Fees for increasing the credit limit  on the account, whether at the consumer's request or unilaterally by the  creditor.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Timing or method of billing or payment. Fees to pay by  telephone or via the Internet.</p><p class="depth0">3. Threshold test. If the creditor is unsure whether a particular  charge is a cost imposed as part of the plan, the creditor may at its  option consider such charges as a cost imposed as part of the plan for  purposes of the Truth in Lending Act.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 6(b)(3)(iii)(B)</p><p class="depth0">1. Fees for package of services. A fee to join a credit union is an  example of a fee for a package of services that is not imposed as part  of the plan, even if the consumer must join the credit union to apply  for credit. In contrast, a membership fee is an example of a fee for a  package of services that is considered to be imposed as part of a plan  where the primary benefit of membership in the organization is the  opportunity to apply for a credit card, and the other benefits offered  (such as a newsletter or a member information hotline) are merely  incidental to the credit feature.</p><p class="depth0">6(b)(4) Disclosure of Rates for Open-End (Not Home-Secured) Plans</p><p class="depth0">6(b)(4)(i)(B) Range of Balances</p><p class="depth0">1. Range of balances. Creditors are not required to disclose the  range of balances:</p><p class="depth0">i. If only one periodic interest rate may be applied to the entire  account balance.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If only one periodic interest rate may be applied to the entire  balance for a feature (for example, cash advances), even though the  balance for another feature (purchases) may be subject to two rates (a  1.5% monthly periodic interest rate on purchase balances of $0-$500, and  a 1% periodic interest rate for balances above $500). In this example,  the creditor must give a range of balances disclosure for the purchase  feature.</p><p class="depth0">6(b)(4)(i)(D) Balance Computation Method</p><p class="depth0">1. Explanation of balance computation method. Creditors do not  provide a sufficient explanation of a balance computation method by  using a shorthand phrase such as ``previous balance method'' or the name  of a balance computation method listed in Sec. 1026.60(g). (See Model  Clauses G-1(A) in appendix G to part 1026. See Sec. 1026.6(b)(2)(vi)  regarding balance computation descriptions in the account-opening  summary.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Allocation of payments. Creditors may, but need not, explain how  payments and other credits are allocated to outstanding balances.</p><p class="depth0">6(b)(4)(ii) Variable-Rate Accounts</p><p class="depth0">1. Variable-rate disclosures--coverage. i. Examples. Examples of  open-end plans that permit the rate to change and are considered  variable-rate plans include:</p><p class="depth0">A. Rate changes that are tied to the rate the creditor pays on its  six-month certificates of deposit.</p><p class="depth0">B. Rate changes that are tied to Treasury bill rates.</p><p class="depth0">C. Rate changes that are tied to changes in the creditor's  commercial lending rate.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Examples of open-end plans that permit the rate to change and  are not considered variable-rate include:</p><p class="depth0">A. Rate changes that are invoked under a creditor's contract  reservation to increase the rate without reference to such an index or  formula (for example, a plan that simply provides that the creditor  reserves the right to raise its rates).</p><p class="depth0">B. Rate changes that are triggered by a specific event such as an  open-end credit plan in which the employee receives a lower rate  contingent upon employment, and the rate increases upon termination of  employment.</p><p class="depth0">2. Variable-rate plan--circumstances for increase. i. The following  are examples that comply with the requirement to disclose circumstances  under which the rate(s) may increase:</p><p class="depth0">A. ``The Treasury bill rate increases.''</p><p class="depth0">B. ``The Federal Reserve discount rate increases.''</p><p class="depth0">ii. Disclosing the frequency with which the rate may increase  includes disclosing when the increase will take effect; for example:</p><p class="depth0">A. ``An increase will take effect on the day that the Treasury bill  rate increases.''</p><p class="depth0">B. ``An increase in the Federal Reserve discount rate will take  effect on the first day of the creditor's billing cycle.''</p><p class="depth0">3. Variable-rate plan--limitations on increase. In disclosing any  limitations on rate increases, limitations such as the maximum increase  per year or the maximum increase over the duration of the plan must be  disclosed. When there are no limitations, the creditor may, but need  not, disclose that fact. Legal limits such as usury or rate ceilings  under state or Federal statutes or regulations need not be disclosed.  Examples of limitations that must be disclosed include:</p><p class="depth0">i. ``The rate on the plan will not exceed 25% annual percentage  rate.''</p><p class="depth0">ii. ``Not more than \1/2\; of 1% increase in the annual percentage  rate per year will occur.''</p><p class="depth0">4. Variable-rate plan--effects of increase. Examples of effects of  rate increases that must be disclosed include:</p><p class="depth0">i. Any requirement for additional collateral if the annual  percentage rate increases beyond a specified rate.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Any increase in the scheduled minimum periodic payment amount.</p><p class="depth0">5. Discounted variable-rate plans. In some variable-rate plans,  creditors may set an initial interest rate that is not determined by the  index or formula used to make later interest rate adjustments.  Typically, this initial rate is lower than the rate would be if it were  calculated using the index or formula.</p><p class="depth0">i. For example, a creditor may calculate interest rates according to  a formula using the six-month Treasury bill rate plus a 2 percent  margin. If the current Treasury bill rate is 10 percent, the creditor  may forgo the 2 percent spread and charge only 10 percent for a limited  time, instead of setting an initial rate of 12 percent, or the creditor  may disregard the index or formula and set the initial rate at 9  percent.</p><p class="depth0">ii. When creditors disclose in the account-opening disclosures an  initial rate that is not calculated using the index or formula for later  rate adjustments, the disclosure should reflect:</p><p class="depth0">A. The initial rate (expressed as a periodic rate and a  corresponding annual percentage rate), together with a statement of how  long the initial rate will remain in effect;</p><p class="depth0">B. The current rate that would have been applied using the index or  formula (also expressed as a periodic rate and a corresponding annual  percentage rate); and</p><p class="depth0">C. The other variable-rate information required by Sec.  1026.6(b)(4)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">6(b)(4)(iii) Rate Changes Not Due to Index or Formula</p><p class="depth0">1. Events that cause the initial rate to change. i. Changes based on  expiration of time period. If the initial rate will change at the  expiration of a time period, creditors that disclose the initial rate in  the account-opening disclosure must identify the expiration date and the  fact that the initial rate will end at that time.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Changes based on specified contract terms. If the account  agreement provides that the creditor may change the initial rate upon  the occurrence of a specified event or events, the creditor must  identify the events or events. Examples include the consumer not making  the required minimum payment when due, or the termination of an employee  preferred rate when the employment relationship is terminated.</p><p class="depth0">2. Rate that will apply after initial rate changes. i. Increased  margins. If the initial rate is based on an index and the rate may  increase due to a change in the margin applied to the index, the  creditor must disclose the increased margin. If more than one margin  could apply, the creditor may disclose the highest margin.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Risk-based pricing. In some plans, the amount of the rate change  depends on how the creditor weighs the occurrence of events specified in  the account agreement that authorize the creditor to change rates, as  well as other factors. Creditors must state the increased rate that may  apply. At the creditor's option, the creditor may state the possible  rates as a range, or by stating only the highest rate that could be  assessed. The creditor must disclose the period for which the increased  rate will remain in effect, such as ``until you make three timely  payments,'' or if there is no limitation, the fact that the increased  rate may remain indefinitely.</p><p class="depth0">3. Effect of rate change on balances. Creditors must disclose  information to consumers about the balance to which the new rate will  apply and the balance to which the current rate at the time of the  change will apply. Card issuers subject to Sec. 1026.55 may be subject  to certain restrictions on the application of increased rates to certain  balances.</p><p class="depth0">6(b)(5) Additional Disclosures for Open-End (Not Home-Secured) Plans</p><p class="depth0">6(b)(5)(i) Voluntary Credit Insurance, Debt Cancellation or Debt</p><p class="depth0">Suspension</p><p class="depth0">1. Timing. Under Sec. 1026.4(d), disclosures required to exclude  the cost of voluntary credit insurance or debt cancellation or debt  suspension coverage from the finance charge must be provided before the  consumer agrees   to the purchase of the insurance or coverage. Creditors comply with  Sec. 1026.6(b)(5)(i) if they provide those disclosures in accordance  with Sec. 1026.4(d). For example, if the disclosures required by Sec.  1026.4(d) are provided at application, creditors need not repeat those  disclosures at account opening.</p><p class="depth0">6(b)(5)(ii) Security Interests</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Creditors are not required to use specific terms to  describe a security interest, or to explain the type of security or the  creditor's rights with respect to the collateral.</p><p class="depth0">2. Identification of property. Creditors sufficiently identify  collateral by type by stating, for example, motor vehicle or household  appliances. (Creditors should be aware, however, that the Federal credit  practices rules, as well as some state laws, prohibit certain security  interests in household goods.) The creditor may, at its option, provide  a more specific identification (for example, a model and serial number.)</p><p class="depth0">3. Spreader clause. If collateral for preexisting credit with the  creditor will secure the plan being opened, the creditor must disclose  that fact. (Such security interests may be known as ``spreader'' or  ``dragnet'' clauses, or as ``cross-collateralization'' clauses.) The  creditor need not specifically identify the collateral; a reminder such  as ``collateral securing other loans with us may also secure this loan''  is sufficient. At the creditor's option, a more specific description of  the property involved may be given.</p><p class="depth0">4. Additional collateral. If collateral is required when advances  reach a certain amount, the creditor should disclose the information  available at the time of the account-opening disclosures. For example,  if the creditor knows that a security interest will be taken in  household goods if the consumer's balance exceeds $1,000, the creditor  should disclose accordingly. If the creditor knows that security will be  required if the consumer's balance exceeds $1,000, but the creditor does  not know what security will be required, the creditor must disclose on  the initial disclosure statement that security will be required if the  balance exceeds $1,000, and the creditor must provide a change-in-terms  notice under Sec. 1026.9(c) at the time the security is taken. (See  comment 6(b)(5)(ii)-2.)</p><p class="depth0">5. Collateral from third party. Security interests taken in  connection with the plan must be disclosed, whether the collateral is  owned by the consumer or a third party.</p><p class="depth0">6(b)(5)(iii) Statement of Billing Rights</p><p class="depth0">1. See the commentary to Model Forms G-3(A) and G-4(A).</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.7--Periodic Statement</p><p class="depth0">1. Multifeatured plans. Some plans involve a number of different  features, such as purchases, cash advances, or overdraft checking.  Groups of transactions subject to different finance charge terms because  of the dates on which the transactions took place are treated like  different features for purposes of disclosures on the periodic  statements. The commentary includes additional guidance for  multifeatured plans.</p><p class="depth0">7(a) Rules Affecting Home-Equity Plans</p><p class="depth0">7(a)(1) Previous Balance</p><p class="depth0">1. Credit balances. If the previous balance is a credit balance, it  must be disclosed in such a way so as to inform the consumer that it is  a credit balance, rather than a debit balance.</p><p class="depth0">2. Multifeatured plans. In a multifeatured plan, the previous  balance may be disclosed either as an aggregate balance for the account  or as separate balances for each feature (for example, a previous  balance for purchases and a previous balance for cash advances). If  separate balances are disclosed, a total previous balance is optional.</p><p class="depth0">3. Accrued finance charges allocated from payments. Some open-end  credit plans provide that the amount of the finance charge that has  accrued since the consumer's last payment is directly deducted from each  new payment, rather than being separately added to each statement and  reflected as an increase in the obligation. In such a plan, the previous  balance need not reflect finance charges accrued since the last payment.</p><p class="depth0">7(a)(2) Identification of Transactions</p><p class="depth0">1. Multifeatured plans. In identifying transactions under Sec.  1026.7(a)(2) for multifeatured plans, creditors may, for example, choose  to arrange transactions by feature (such as disclosing sale transactions  separately from cash advance transactions) or in some other clear  manner, such as by arranging the transactions in general chronological  order.</p><p class="depth0">2. Automated teller machine (ATM) charges imposed by other  institutions in shared or interchange systems. A charge imposed on the  cardholder by an institution other than the card issuer for the use of  the other institution's ATM in a shared or interchange system and  included by the terminal-operating institution in the amount of the  transaction need not be separately disclosed on the periodic statement.</p><p class="depth0">7(a)(3) Credits</p><p class="depth0">1. Identification--sufficiency. The creditor need not describe each  credit by type (returned merchandise, rebate of finance charge, etc.)-- ``credit'' would suffice--except if the creditor is using the periodic  statement to satisfy the billing-error correction notice requirement.  (See the commentary to Sec. 1026.13(e) and (f).)</p><p class="depth0">2. Format. A creditor may list credits relating to credit extensions  (payments, rebates, etc.) together with other types of credits (such as  deposits to a checking account), as long as the entries are identified  so as to inform the consumer which type of credit each entry represents.</p><p class="depth0">3. Date. If only one date is disclosed (that is, the crediting date  as required by the regulation), no further identification of that date  is necessary. More than one date may be disclosed for a single entry, as  long as it is clear which date represents the date on which credit was  given.</p><p class="depth0">4. Totals. A total of amounts credited during the billing cycle is  not required.</p><p class="depth0">7(a)(4) Periodic Rates</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure of periodic rates--whether or not actually applied.  Except as provided in Sec. 1026.7(a)(4)(ii), any periodic rate that may  be used to compute finance charges (and its corresponding annual  percentage rate) must be disclosed whether or not it is applied during  the billing cycle. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. If the consumer's account has both a purchase feature and a cash  advance feature, the creditor must disclose the rate for each, even if  the consumer only makes purchases on the account during the billing  cycle.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the rate varies (such as when it is tied to a particular  index), the creditor must disclose each rate in effect during the cycle  for which the statement was issued.</p><p class="depth0">2. Disclosure of periodic rates required only if imposition  possible. With regard to the periodic rate disclosure (and its  corresponding annual percentage rate), only rates that could have been  imposed during the billing cycle reflected on the periodic statement  need to be disclosed. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. If the creditor is changing rates effective during the next  billing cycle (because of a variable-rate plan), the rates required to  be disclosed under Sec. 1026.7(a)(4) are only those in effect during  the billing cycle reflected on the periodic statement. For example, if  the monthly rate applied during May was 1.5%, but the creditor will  increase the rate to 1.8% effective June 1, 1.5% (and its corresponding  annual percentage rate) is the only required disclosure under Sec.  1026.7(a)(4) for the periodic statement reflecting the May account  activity.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If rates applicable to a particular type of transaction changed  after a certain date and the old rate is only being applied to  transactions that took place prior to that date, the creditor need not  continue to disclose the old rate for those consumers that have no  outstanding balances to which that rate could be applied.</p><p class="depth0">3. Multiple rates--same transaction. If two or more periodic rates  are applied to the same balance for the same type of transaction (for  example, if the finance charge consists of a monthly periodic rate of  1.5% applied to the outstanding balance and a required credit life  insurance component calculated at 0.1% per month on the same outstanding  balance), the creditor may do either of the following:</p><p class="depth0">i. Disclose each periodic rate, the range of balances to which it is  applicable, and the corresponding annual percentage rate for each. (For  example, 1.5% monthly, 18% annual percentage rate; 0.1% monthly, 1.2%  annual percentage rate.)</p><p class="depth0">ii. Disclose one composite periodic rate (that is, 1.6% per month)  along with the applicable range of balances and the corresponding annual  percentage rate.</p><p class="depth0">4. Corresponding annual percentage rate. In disclosing the annual  percentage rate that corresponds to each periodic rate, the creditor may  use ``corresponding annual percentage rate,'' ``nominal annual  percentage rate,'' ``corresponding nominal annual percentage rate,'' or  similar phrases.</p><p class="depth0">5. Rate same as actual annual percentage rate. When the  corresponding rate is the same as the annual percentage rate disclosed  under Sec. 1026.7(a)(7), the creditor need disclose only one annual  percentage rate, but must use the phrase ``annual percentage rate.''</p><p class="depth0">6. Range of balances. See comment 6(a)(1)(ii)-1. A creditor is not  required to adjust the range of balances disclosure to reflect the  balance below which only a minimum charge applies.</p><p class="depth0">7(a)(5) Balance on Which Finance Charge Computed</p><p class="depth0">1. Limitation to periodic rates. Section 1026.7(a)(5) only requires  disclosure of the balance(s) to which a periodic rate was applied and  does not apply to balances on which other kinds of finance charges (such  as transaction charges) were imposed. For example, if a consumer obtains  a $1,500 cash advance subject to both a 1% transaction fee and a 1%  monthly periodic rate, the creditor need only disclose the balance  subject to the monthly rate (which might include portions of earlier  cash advances not paid off in previous cycles).</p><p class="depth0">2. Split rates applied to balance ranges. If split rates were  applied to a balance because different portions of the balance fall  within two or more balance ranges, the creditor need not separately  disclose the portions of the balance subject to such different rates  since the range of balances to which the rates apply has been separately  disclosed. For example, a creditor could disclose a balance of $700 for  purchases even though a monthly periodic rate of 1.5% applied to the  first $500, and a monthly periodic rate of 1% to the remainder. This  option to disclose a combined balance does not apply when the finance  charge is computed by applying the split rates to each day's balance (in  contrast,   for example, to applying the rates to the average daily balance). In  that case, the balances must be disclosed using any of the options that  are available if two or more daily rates are imposed. (See comment  7(a)(5)-5.)</p><p class="depth0">3. Monthly rate on average daily balance. Creditors may apply a  monthly periodic rate to an average daily balance.</p><p class="depth0">4. Multifeatured plans. In a multifeatured plan, the creditor must  disclose a separate balance (or balances, as applicable) to which a  periodic rate was applied for each feature or group of features subject  to different periodic rates or different balance computation methods.  Separate balances are not required, however, merely because a grace  period is available for some features but not others. A total balance  for the entire plan is optional. This does not affect how many balances  the creditor must disclose--or may disclose--within each feature. (See,  for example, comment 7(a)(5)-5.)</p><p class="depth0">5. Daily rate on daily balances. If the finance charge is computed  on the balance each day by application of one or more daily periodic  rates, the balance on which the finance charge was computed may be  disclosed in any of the following ways for each feature:</p><p class="depth0">i. If a single daily periodic rate is imposed, the balance to which  it is applicable may be stated as:</p><p class="depth0">A. A balance for each day in the billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">B. A balance for each day in the billing cycle on which the balance  in the account changes.</p><p class="depth0">C. The sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">D. The average daily balance during the billing cycle, in which case  the creditor shall explain that the average daily balance is or can be  multiplied by the number of days in the billing cycle and the periodic  rate applied to the product to determine the amount of the finance  charge.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If two or more daily periodic rates may be imposed, the balances  to which the rates are applicable may be stated as:</p><p class="depth0">A. A balance for each day in the billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">B. A balance for each day in the billing cycle on which the balance  in the account changes.</p><p class="depth0">C. Two or more average daily balances, each applicable to the daily  periodic rates imposed for the time that those rates were in effect, as  long as the creditor explains that the finance charge is or may be  determined by (1) multiplying each of the average balances by the number  of days in the billing cycle (or if the daily rate varied during the  cycle, by multiplying by the number of days the applicable rate was in  effect), (2) multiplying each of the results by the applicable daily  periodic rate, and (3) adding these products together.</p><p class="depth0">6. Explanation of balance computation method. See the commentary to  6(a)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">7. Information to compute balance. In connection with disclosing the  finance charge balance, the creditor need not give the consumer all of  the information necessary to compute the balance if that information is  not otherwise required to be disclosed. For example, if current  purchases are included from the date they are posted to the account, the  posting date need not be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">8. Non-deduction of credits. The creditor need not specifically  identify the total dollar amount of credits not deducted in computing  the finance charge balance. Disclosure of the amount of credits not  deducted is accomplished by listing the credits (Sec. 1026.7(a)(3)) and  indicating which credits will not be deducted in determining the balance  (for example, ``credits after the 15th of the month are not deducted in  computing the finance charge.'').</p><p class="depth0">9. Use of one balance computation method explanation when multiple  balances disclosed. Sometimes the creditor will disclose more than one  balance to which a periodic rate was applied, even though each balance  was computed using the same balance computation method. For example, if  a plan involves purchases and cash advances that are subject to  different rates, more than one balance must be disclosed, even though  the same computation method is used for determining the balance for each  feature. In these cases, one explanation of the balance computation  method is sufficient. Sometimes the creditor separately discloses the  portions of the balance that are subject to different rates because  different portions of the balance fall within two or more balance  ranges, even when a combined balance disclosure would be permitted under  comment 7(a)(5)-2. In these cases, one explanation of the balance  computation method is also sufficient (assuming, of course, that all  portions of the balance were computed using the same method).</p><p class="depth0">7(a)(6) Amount of Finance Charge and Other Charges</p><p class="depth0">7(a)(6)(i) Finance Charges</p><p class="depth0">1. Total. A total finance charge amount for the plan is not  required.</p><p class="depth0">2. Itemization--types of finance charges. Each type of finance  charge (such as periodic rates, transaction charges, and minimum  charges) imposed during the cycle must be separately itemized; for  example, disclosure of only a combined finance charge attributable to  both a minimum charge and transaction charges would not be permissible.  Finance charges of the same type may be disclosed, however, individually  or as a total. For example, five transaction charges of $1 may be listed  separately or as $5.</p><p class="depth0">3. Itemization--different periodic rates. Whether different periodic  rates are applicable to different types of transactions or to different  balance ranges, the creditor may give the finance charge attributable to  each rate or may give a total finance charge amount. For example, if a  creditor charges 1.5% per month on the first $500 of a balance and 1%  per month on amounts over $500, the creditor may itemize the two  components ($7.50 and $1.00) of the $8.50 charge, or may disclose $8.50.</p><p class="depth0">4. Multifeatured plans. In a multifeatured plan, in disclosing the  amount of the finance charge attributable to the application of periodic  rates no total periodic rate disclosure for the entire plan need be  given.</p><p class="depth0">5. Finance charges not added to account. A finance charge that is  not included in the new balance because it is payable to a third party  (such as required life insurance) must still be shown on the periodic  statement as a finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">6. Finance charges other than periodic rates. See comment  6(a)(1)(iv)-1 for examples.</p><p class="depth0">7. Accrued finance charges allocated from payments. Some plans  provide that the amount of the finance charge that has accrued since the  consumer's last payment is directly deducted from each new payment,  rather than being separately added to each statement and therefore  reflected as an increase in the obligation. In such a plan, no  disclosure is required of finance charges that have accrued since the  last payment.</p><p class="depth0">8. Start-up fees. Points, loan fees, and similar finance charges  relating to the opening of the account that are paid prior to the  issuance of the first periodic statement need not be disclosed on the  periodic statement. If, however, these charges are financed as part of  the plan, including charges that are paid out of the first advance, the  charges must be disclosed as part of the finance charge on the first  periodic statement. However, they need not be factored into the annual  percentage rate. (See Sec. 1026.14(c)(3).)</p><p class="depth0">7(a)(6)(ii) Other Charges</p><p class="depth0">1. Identification. In identifying any other charges actually imposed  during the billing cycle, the type is adequately described as late  charge or membership fee, for example. Similarly, closing costs or  settlement costs, for example, may be used to describe charges imposed  in connection with real estate transactions that are excluded from the  finance charge under Sec. 1026.4(c)(7), if the same term (such as  closing costs) was used in the initial disclosures and if the creditor  chose to itemize and individually disclose the costs included in that  term. Even though the taxes and filing or notary fees excluded from the  finance charge under Sec. 1026.4(e) are not required to be disclosed as  other charges under Sec. 1026.6(a)(2), these charges may be included in  the amount shown as closing costs or settlement costs on the periodic  statement, if the charges were itemized and disclosed as part of the  closing costs or settlement costs on the initial disclosure statement.  (See comment 6(a)(2)-1 for examples of other charges.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Date. The date of imposing or debiting other charges need not be  disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">3. Total. Disclosure of the total amount of other charges is  optional.</p><p class="depth0">4. Itemization--types of other charges. Each type of other charge  (such as late-payment charges, over-the-credit-limit charges, and  membership fees) imposed during the cycle must be separately itemized;  for example, disclosure of only a total of other charges attributable to  both an over-the-credit-limit charge and a late-payment charge would not  be permissible. Other charges of the same type may be disclosed,  however, individually or as a total. For example, three fees of $3 for  providing copies related to the resolution of a billing error could be  listed separately or as $9.</p><p class="depth0">7(a)(7) Annual Percentage Rate</p><p class="depth0">1. Plans subject to the requirements of Sec. 1026.40. For home- equity plans subject to the requirements of Sec. 1026.40, creditors are  not required to disclose an effective annual percentage rate. Creditors  that state an annualized rate in addition to the corresponding annual  percentage rate required by Sec. 1026.7(a)(4) must calculate that rate  in accordance with Sec. 1026.14(c).</p><p class="depth0">2. Labels. Creditors that choose to disclose an annual percentage  rate calculated under Sec. 1026.14(c) and label the figure as ``annual  percentage rate'' must label the periodic rate expressed as an  annualized rate as the ``corresponding APR,'' ``nominal APR,'' or a  similar phrase as provided in comment 7(a)(4)-4. Creditors also comply  with the label requirement if the rate calculated under Sec. 1026.14(c)  is described as the ``effective APR'' or something similar. For those  creditors, the periodic rate expressed as an annualized rate could be  labeled ``annual percentage rate,'' consistent with the requirement  under Sec. 1026.7(b)(4). If the two rates represent different values,  creditors must label the rates differently to meet the clear and  conspicuous standard under Sec. 1026.5(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">7(a)(8) Grace Period</p><p class="depth0">1. Terminology. Although the creditor is required to indicate any  time period the consumer may have to pay the balance outstanding without  incurring additional finance charges, no specific wording is required,  so long as the language used is consistent with that used on the  account-opening disclosure statement. For example, ``To avoid additional  finance charges, pay the new balance before ----'' would suffice.</p><p class="depth0">7(a)(9) Address for Notice of Billing Errors</p><p class="depth0">1. Terminology. The periodic statement should indicate the general  purpose for the address for billing-error inquiries, although a detailed  explanation or particular wording is not required.</p><p class="depth0">2. Telephone number. A telephone number, email address, or Web site  location may be included, but the mailing address for billing-error  inquiries, which is the required disclosure, must be clear and  conspicuous. The address is deemed to be clear and conspicuous if a  precautionary instruction is included that telephoning or notifying the  creditor by email or Web site will not preserve the consumer's billing  rights, unless the creditor has agreed to treat billing error notices  provided by electronic means as written notices, in which case the  precautionary instruction is required only for telephoning.</p><p class="depth0">7(a)(10) Closing Date of Billing Cycle; New Balance</p><p class="depth0">1. Credit balances. See comment 7(a)(1)-1.</p><p class="depth0">2. Multifeatured plans. In a multifeatured plan, the new balance may  be disclosed for each feature or for the plan as a whole. If separate  new balances are disclosed, a total new balance is optional.</p><p class="depth0">3. Accrued finance charges allocated from payments. Some plans  provide that the amount of the finance charge that has accrued since the  consumer's last payment is directly deducted from each new payment,  rather than being separately added to each statement and therefore  reflected as an increase in the obligation. In such a plan, the new  balance need not reflect finance charges accrued since the last payment.</p><p class="depth0">7(b) Rules Affecting Open-End (Not Home-Secured) Plans</p><p class="depth0">1. Deferred interest or similar transactions. Creditors offer a  variety of payment plans for purchases that permit consumers to avoid  interest charges if the purchase balance is paid in full by a certain  date. ``Deferred interest'' has the same meaning as in Sec.  1026.16(h)(2) and associated commentary. The following provides guidance  for a deferred interest or similar plan where, for example, no interest  charge is imposed on a $500 purchase made in January if the $500 balance  is paid by July 31.</p><p class="depth0">i. Annual percentage rates. Under Sec. 1026.7(b)(4), creditors must  disclose each annual percentage rate that may be used to compute the  interest charge. Under some plans with a deferred interest or similar  feature, if the deferred interest balance is not paid by a certain date,  July 31 in this example, interest charges applicable to the billing  cycles between the date of purchase in January and July 31 may be  imposed. Annual percentage rates that may apply to the deferred interest  balance ($500 in this example) if the balance is not paid in full by  July 31 must appear on periodic statements for the billing cycles  between the date of purchase and July 31. However, if the consumer does  not pay the deferred interest balance by July 31, the creditor is not  required to identify, on the periodic statement disclosing the interest  charge for the deferred interest balance, annual percentage rates that  have been disclosed in previous billing cycles between the date of  purchase and July 31.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Balances subject to periodic rates. Under Sec. 1026.7(b)(5),  creditors must disclose the balances subject to interest during a  billing cycle. The deferred interest balance ($500 in this example) is  not subject to interest for billing cycles between the date of purchase  and July 31 in this example. Periodic statements sent for those billing  cycles should not include the deferred interest balance in the balance  disclosed under Sec. 1026.7(b)(5). This amount must be separately  disclosed on periodic statements and identified by a term other than the  term used to identify the balance disclosed under Sec. 1026.7(b)(5)  (such as ``deferred interest balance''). During any billing cycle in  which an interest charge on the deferred interest balance is debited to  the account, the balance disclosed under Sec. 1026.7(b)(5) should  include the deferred interest balance for that billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Amount of interest charge. Under Sec. 1026.7(b)(6)(ii),  creditors must disclose interest charges imposed during a billing cycle.  For some deferred interest purchases, the creditor may impose interest  from the date of purchase if the deferred interest balance ($500 in this  example) is not paid in full by July 31 in this example, but otherwise  will not impose interest for billing cycles between the date of purchase  and July 31. Periodic statements for billing cycles preceding July 31 in  this example should not include in the interest charge disclosed under  Sec. 1026.7(b)(6)(ii) the amounts a consumer may owe if the deferred  interest balance is not paid in full by July 31. In this example, the  February periodic statement should not identify as interest charges  interest attributable to the $500 January purchase. This amount must be  separately disclosed on periodic statements and identified by a term  other than ``interest charge'' (such as ``contingent interest charge''  or ``deferred interest charge''). The interest charge on a deferred  interest balance should be reflected on the periodic statement under  Sec. 1026.7(b)(6)(ii) for the billing cycle in which the interest  charge is debited to the account.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Due date to avoid obligation for finance charges under a  deferred interest or similar program. Section 1026.7(b)(14) requires  disclosure on periodic statements of the date by which any outstanding  balance subject to a deferred interest or similar program must be paid  in full in order to avoid the obligation   for finance charges on such balance. This disclosure must appear on the  front of any page of each periodic statement issued during the deferred  interest period beginning with the first periodic statement issued  during the deferred interest period that reflects the deferred interest  or similar transaction.</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(1) Previous Balance</p><p class="depth0">1. Credit balances. If the previous balance is a credit balance, it  must be disclosed in such a way so as to inform the consumer that it is  a credit balance, rather than a debit balance.</p><p class="depth0">2. Multifeatured plans. In a multifeatured plan, the previous  balance may be disclosed either as an aggregate balance for the account  or as separate balances for each feature (for example, a previous  balance for purchases and a previous balance for cash advances). If  separate balances are disclosed, a total previous balance is optional.</p><p class="depth0">3. Accrued finance charges allocated from payments. Some open-end  credit plans provide that the amount of the finance charge that has  accrued since the consumer's last payment is directly deducted from each  new payment, rather than being separately added to each statement and  reflected as an increase in the obligation. In such a plan, the previous  balance need not reflect finance charges accrued since the last payment.</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(2) Identification of Transactions</p><p class="depth0">1. Multifeatured plans. Creditors may, but are not required to,  arrange transactions by feature (such as disclosing purchase  transactions separately from cash advance transactions). Pursuant to  Sec. 1026.7(b)(6), however, creditors must group all fees and all  interest separately from transactions and may not disclose any fees or  interest charges with transactions.</p><p class="depth0">2. Automated teller machine (ATM) charges imposed by other  institutions in shared or interchange systems. A charge imposed on the  cardholder by an institution other than the card issuer for the use of  the other institution's ATM in a shared or interchange system and  included by the terminal-operating institution in the amount of the  transaction need not be separately disclosed on the periodic statement.</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(3) Credits</p><p class="depth0">1. Identification--sufficiency. The creditor need not describe each  credit by type (returned merchandise, rebate of finance charge, etc.)-- ``credit'' would suffice--except if the creditor is using the periodic  statement to satisfy the billing-error correction notice requirement.  (See the commentary to Sec. 1026.13(e) and (f).) Credits may be  distinguished from transactions in any way that is clear and  conspicuous, for example, by use of debit and credit columns or by use  of plus signs and/or minus signs.</p><p class="depth0">2. Date. If only one date is disclosed (that is, the crediting date  as required by the regulation), no further identification of that date  is necessary. More than one date may be disclosed for a single entry, as  long as it is clear which date represents the date on which credit was  given.</p><p class="depth0">3. Totals. A total of amounts credited during the billing cycle is  not required.</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(4) Periodic Rates</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure of periodic interest rates--whether or not actually  applied. Except as provided in Sec. 1026.7(b)(4)(ii), any periodic  interest rate that may be used to compute finance charges, expressed as  and labeled ``Annual Percentage Rate,'' must be disclosed whether or not  it is applied during the billing cycle. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. If the consumer's account has both a purchase feature and a cash  advance feature, the creditor must disclose the annual percentage rate  for each, even if the consumer only makes purchases on the account  during the billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the annual percentage rate varies (such as when it is tied to  a particular index), the creditor must disclose each annual percentage  rate in effect during the cycle for which the statement was issued.</p><p class="depth0">2. Disclosure of periodic interest rates required only if imposition  possible. With regard to the periodic interest rate disclosure (and its  corresponding annual percentage rate), only rates that could have been  imposed during the billing cycle reflected on the periodic statement  need to be disclosed. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. If the creditor is changing annual percentage rates effective  during the next billing cycle (either because it is changing terms or  because of a variable-rate plan), the annual percentage rates required  to be disclosed under Sec. 1026.7(b)(4) are only those in effect during  the billing cycle reflected on the periodic statement. For example, if  the annual percentage rate applied during May was 18%, but the creditor  will increase the rate to 21% effective June 1, 18% is the only required  disclosure under Sec. 1026.7(b)(4) for the periodic statement  reflecting the May account activity.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the consumer has an overdraft line that might later be  expanded upon the consumer's request to include secured advances, the  rates for the secured advance feature need not be given until such time  as the consumer has requested and received access to the additional  feature.</p><p class="depth0">iii. If annual percentage rates applicable to a particular type of  transaction changed after a certain date and the old rate is only being  applied to transactions that took place   prior to that date, the creditor need not continue to disclose the old  rate for those consumers that have no outstanding balances to which that  rate could be applied.</p><p class="depth0">3. Multiple rates--same transaction. If two or more periodic rates  are applied to the same balance for the same type of transaction (for  example, if the interest charge consists of a monthly periodic interest  rate of 1.5% applied to the outstanding balance and a required credit  life insurance component calculated at 0.1% per month on the same  outstanding balance), creditors must disclose the periodic interest  rate, expressed as an 18% annual percentage rate and the range of  balances to which it is applicable. Costs attributable to the credit  life insurance component must be disclosed as a fee under Sec.  1026.7(b)(6)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">4. Fees. Creditors that identify fees in accordance with Sec.  1026.7(b)(6)(iii) need not identify the periodic rate at which a fee  would accrue if the fee remains unpaid. For example, assume a fee is  imposed for a late payment in the previous cycle and that the fee,  unpaid, would be included in the purchases balance and accrue interest  at the rate for purchases. The creditor need not separately disclose  that the purchase rate applies to the portion of the purchases balance  attributable to the unpaid fee.</p><p class="depth0">5. Ranges of balances. See comment 6(b)(4)(i)(B)-1. A creditor is  not required to adjust the range of balances disclosure to reflect the  balance below which only a minimum charge applies.</p><p class="depth0">6. Deferred interest transactions. See comment 7(b)-1.i.</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(5) Balance on Which Finance Charge Computed</p><p class="depth0">1. Split rates applied to balance ranges. If split rates were  applied to a balance because different portions of the balance fall  within two or more balance ranges, the creditor need not separately  disclose the portions of the balance subject to such different rates  since the range of balances to which the rates apply has been separately  disclosed. For example, a creditor could disclose a balance of $700 for  purchases even though a monthly periodic rate of 1.5% applied to the  first $500, and a monthly periodic rate of 1% to the remainder. This  option to disclose a combined balance does not apply when the interest  charge is computed by applying the split rates to each day's balance (in  contrast, for example, to applying the rates to the average daily  balance). In that case, the balances must be disclosed using any of the  options that are available if two or more daily rates are imposed. (See  comment 7(b)(5)-4.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Monthly rate on average daily balance. Creditors may apply a  monthly periodic rate to an average daily balance.</p><p class="depth0">3. Multifeatured plans. In a multifeatured plan, the creditor must  disclose a separate balance (or balances, as applicable) to which a  periodic rate was applied for each feature. Separate balances are not  required, however, merely because a grace period is available for some  features but not others. A total balance for the entire plan is  optional. This does not affect how many balances the creditor must  disclose--or may disclose--within each feature. (See, for example,  comments 7(b)(5)-4 and 7(b)(4)-5.)</p><p class="depth0">4. Daily rate on daily balance. If a finance charge is computed on  the balance each day by application of one or more daily periodic  interest rates, the balance on which the interest charge was computed  may be disclosed in any of the following ways for each feature:</p><p class="depth0">i. If a single daily periodic interest rate is imposed, the balance  to which it is applicable may be stated as:</p><p class="depth0">A. A balance for each day in the billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">B. A balance for each day in the billing cycle on which the balance  in the account changes.</p><p class="depth0">C. The sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">D. The average daily balance during the billing cycle, in which case  the creditor may, at its option, explain that the average daily balance  is or can be multiplied by the number of days in the billing cycle and  the periodic rate applied to the product to determine the amount of  interest.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If two or more daily periodic interest rates may be imposed, the  balances to which the rates are applicable may be stated as:</p><p class="depth0">A. A balance for each day in the billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">B. A balance for each day in the billing cycle on which the balance  in the account changes.</p><p class="depth0">C. Two or more average daily balances, each applicable to the daily  periodic interest rates imposed for the time that those rates were in  effect. The creditor may, at its option, explain that interest is or may  be determined by (1) multiplying each of the average balances by the  number of days in the billing cycle (or if the daily rate varied during  the cycle, by multiplying by the number of days the applicable rate was  in effect), (2) multiplying each of the results by the applicable daily  periodic rate, and (3) adding these products together.</p><p class="depth0">5. Information to compute balance. In connection with disclosing the  interest charge balance, the creditor need not give the consumer all of  the information necessary to compute the balance if that information is  not otherwise required to be disclosed. For example, if current  purchases are included from the date they are posted to the account, the  posting date need not be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">6. Non-deduction of credits. The creditor need not specifically  identify the total dollar amount of credits not deducted in computing   the finance charge balance. Disclosure of the amount of credits not  deducted is accomplished by listing the credits (Sec. 1026.7(b)(3)) and  indicating which credits will not be deducted in determining the balance  (for example, ``credits after the 15th of the month are not deducted in  computing the interest charge.'').</p><p class="depth0">7. Use of one balance computation method explanation when multiple  balances disclosed. Sometimes the creditor will disclose more than one  balance to which a periodic rate was applied, even though each balance  was computed using the same balance computation method. For example, if  a plan involves purchases and cash advances that are subject to  different rates, more than one balance must be disclosed, even though  the same computation method is used for determining the balance for each  feature. In these cases, one explanation or a single identification of  the name of the balance computation method is sufficient. Sometimes the  creditor separately discloses the portions of the balance that are  subject to different rates because different portions of the balance  fall within two or more balance ranges, even when a combined balance  disclosure would be permitted under comment 7(b)(5)-1. In these cases,  one explanation or a single identification of the name of the balance  computation method is also sufficient (assuming, of course, that all  portions of the balance were computed using the same method). In these  cases, a creditor may use an appropriate name listed in Sec. 1026.60(g)  (e.g., ``average daily balance (including new purchases)'') as the  single identification of the name of the balance computation method  applicable to all features, even though the name only refers to  purchases. For example, if a creditor uses the average daily balance  method including new transactions for all features, a creditor may use  the name ``average daily balance (including new purchases)'' listed in  Sec. 1026.60(g)(i) to satisfy the requirement to disclose the name of  the balance computation method for all features. As an alternative, in  this situation, a creditor may revise the balance computation names  listed in Sec. 1026.60(g) to refer more broadly to all new credit  transactions, such as using the language ``new transactions'' or  ``current transactions'' (e.g., ``average daily balance (including new  transactions)''), rather than simply referring to new purchases, when  the same method is used to calculate the balances for all features of  the account.</p><p class="depth0">8. Use of balance computation names in Sec. 1026.60(g) for balances  other than purchases. The names of the balance computation methods  listed in Sec. 1026.60(g) describe balance computation methods for  purchases. When a creditor is disclosing the name of the balance  computation methods separately for each feature, in using the names  listed in Sec. 1026.60(g) to satisfy the requirements of Sec.  1026.7(b)(5) for features other than purchases, a creditor must revise  the names listed in Sec. 1026.60(g) to refer to the other features. For  example, when disclosing the name of the balance computation method  applicable to cash advances, a creditor must revise the name listed in  Sec. 1026.60(g)(i) to disclose it as ``average daily balance (including  new cash advances)'' when the balance for cash advances is figured by  adding the outstanding balance (including new cash advances and  deducting payments and credits) for each day in the billing cycle, and  then dividing by the number of days in the billing cycle. Similarly, a  creditor must revise the name listed in Sec. 1026.60(g)(ii) to disclose  it as ``average daily balance (excluding new cash advances)'' when the  balance for cash advances is figured by adding the outstanding balance  (excluding new cash advances and deducting payments and credits) for  each day in the billing cycle, and then dividing by the number of days  in the billing cycle. See comment 7(b)(5)-7 for guidance on the use of  one balance computation method explanation or name when multiple  balances are disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(6) Charges Imposed</p><p class="depth0">1. Examples of charges. See commentary to Sec. 1026.6(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0">2. Fees. Costs attributable to periodic rates other than interest  charges shall be disclosed as a fee. For example, if a consumer obtains  credit life insurance that is calculated at 0.1% per month on an  outstanding balance and a monthly interest rate of 1.5% applies to the  same balance, the creditor must disclose the dollar cost attributable to  interest as an ``interest charge'' and the credit insurance cost as a  ``fee.''</p><p class="depth0">3. Total fees and interest charged for calendar year to date. i.  Monthly statements. Some creditors send monthly statements but the  statement periods do not coincide with the calendar month. For creditors  sending monthly statements, the following comply with the requirement to  provide calendar year-to-date totals.</p><p class="depth0">A. A creditor may disclose calendar-year-to-date totals at the end  of the calendar year by separately aggregating finance charges  attributable to periodic interest rates and fees for 12 monthly cycles,  starting with the period that begins during January and finishing with  the period that begins during December. For example, if statement  periods begin on the 10th day of each month, the statement covering  December 10, 2011 through January 9, 2012, may disclose the separate  year-to-date totals for interest charged and fees imposed from January  10, 2011, through January 9, 2012. Alternatively, the creditor could  provide a statement for the cycle ending January 9, 2012, showing the  separate year-to-date totals for interest charged and fees imposed  January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2011.</p><p class="depth0">B. A creditor may disclose calendar-year-to-date totals at the end  of the calendar year by separately aggregating finance charges  attributable to periodic interest rates and fees for 12 monthly cycles,  starting with the period that begins during December and finishing with  the period that begins during November. For example, if statement  periods begin on the 10th day of each month, the statement covering  November 10, 2011 through December 9, 2011, may disclose the separate  year-to-date totals for interest charged and fees imposed from December  10, 2010, through December 9, 2011.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Quarterly statements. Creditors issuing quarterly statements may  apply the guidance set forth for monthly statements to comply with the  requirement to provide calendar year-to-date totals on quarterly  statements.</p><p class="depth0">4. Minimum charge in lieu of interest. A minimum charge imposed if a  charge would otherwise have been determined by applying a periodic rate  to a balance except for the fact that such charge is smaller than the  minimum must be disclosed as a fee. For example, assume a creditor  imposes a minimum charge of $1.50 in lieu of interest if the calculated  interest for a billing period is less than that minimum charge. If the  interest calculated on a consumer's account for a particular billing  period is 50 cents, the minimum charge of $1.50 would apply. In this  case, the entire $1.50 would be disclosed as a fee; the periodic  statement would reflect the $1.50 as a fee, and $0 in interest.</p><p class="depth0">5. Adjustments to year-to-date totals. In some cases, a creditor may  provide a statement for the current period reflecting that fees or  interest charges imposed during a previous period were waived or  reversed and credited to the account. Creditors may, but are not  required to, reflect the adjustment in the year-to-date totals, nor, if  an adjustment is made, to provide an explanation about the reason for  the adjustment. Such adjustments should not affect the total fees or  interest charges imposed for the current statement period.</p><p class="depth0">6. Acquired accounts. An institution that acquires an account or  plan must include, as applicable, fees and charges imposed on the  account or plan prior to the acquisition in the aggregate disclosures  provided under Sec. 1026.7(b)(6) for the acquired account or plan.  Alternatively, the institution may provide separate totals reflecting  activity prior and subsequent to the account or plan acquisition. For  example, a creditor that acquires an account or plan on August 12 of a  given calendar year may provide one total for the period from January 1  to August 11 and a separate total for the period beginning on August 12.</p><p class="depth0">7. Account upgrades. A creditor that upgrades, or otherwise changes,  a consumer's plan to a different open-end credit plan must include, as  applicable, fees and charges imposed for that portion of the calendar  year prior to the upgrade or change in the consumer's plan in the  aggregate disclosures provided pursuant to Sec. 1026.7(b)(6) for the  new plan. For example, assume a consumer has incurred $125 in fees for  the calendar year to date for a retail credit card account, which is  then replaced by a cobranded credit card account also issued by the  creditor. In this case, the creditor must reflect the $125 in fees  incurred prior to the replacement of the retail credit card account in  the calendar year-to-date totals provided for the cobranded credit card  account. Alternatively, the institution may provide two separate totals  reflecting activity prior and subsequent to the plan upgrade or change.  7(b)(7) Change-in-Terms and Increased Penalty Rate Summary for Open-End</p><p class="depth0">(Not Home-Secured) Plan</p><p class="depth0">1. Location of summary tables. If a change-in-terms notice required  by Sec. 1026.9(c)(2) is provided on or with a periodic statement, a  tabular summary of key changes must appear on the front of the  statement. Similarly, if a notice of a rate increase due to delinquency  or default or as a penalty required by Sec. 1026.9(g)(1) is provided on  or with a periodic statement, information required to be provided about  the increase, presented in a table, must appear on the front of the  statement.</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(8) Grace Period</p><p class="depth0">1. Terminology. In describing the grace period, the language used  must be consistent with that used on the account-opening disclosure  statement. (See Sec. 1026.5(a)(2)(i).)</p><p class="depth0">2. Deferred interest transactions. See comment 7(b)-1.iv.</p><p class="depth0">3. Limitation on the imposition of finance charges in Sec. 1026.54.  Section 1026.7(b)(8) does not require a card issuer to disclose the  limitations on the imposition of finance charges as a result of a loss  of a grace period in Sec. 1026.54, or the impact of payment allocation  on whether interest is charged on transactions as a result of a loss of  a grace period.</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(9) Address for Notice of Billing Errors</p><p class="depth0">1. Terminology. The periodic statement should indicate the general  purpose for the address for billing-error inquiries, although a detailed  explanation or particular wording is not required.</p><p class="depth0">2. Telephone number. A telephone number, email address, or Web site  location may be included, but the mailing address for billing-error  inquiries, which is the required disclosure, must be clear and  conspicuous. The address is deemed to be clear and conspicuous if a  precautionary instruction is included that telephoning or notifying the  creditor by email or Web site will not preserve the consumer's billing  rights, unless the creditor   has agreed to treat billing error notices provided by electronic means  as written notices, in which case the precautionary instruction is  required only for telephoning.</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(10) Closing Date of Billing Cycle; New Balance</p><p class="depth0">1. Credit balances. See comment 7(b)(1)-1.</p><p class="depth0">2. Multifeatured plans. In a multifeatured plan, the new balance may  be disclosed for each feature or for the plan as a whole. If separate  new balances are disclosed, a total new balance is optional.</p><p class="depth0">3. Accrued finance charges allocated from payments. Some plans  provide that the amount of the finance charge that has accrued since the  consumer's last payment is directly deducted from each new payment,  rather than being separately added to each statement and therefore  reflected as an increase in the obligation. In such a plan, the new  balance need not reflect finance charges accrued since the last payment.</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(11) Due Date; Late Payment Costs</p><p class="depth0">1. Informal periods affecting late payments. Although the terms of  the account agreement may provide that a card issuer may assess a late  payment fee if a payment is not received by a certain date, the card  issuer may have an informal policy or practice that delays the  assessment of the late payment fee for payments received a brief period  of time after the date upon which a card issuer has the contractual  right to impose the fee. A card issuer must disclose the due date  according to the legal obligation between the parties, and need not  consider the end of an informal ``courtesy period'' as the due date  under Sec. 1026.7(b)(11).</p><p class="depth0">2. Assessment of late payment fees. Some state or other laws require  that a certain number of days must elapse following a due date before a  late payment fee may be imposed. In addition, a card issuer may be  restricted by the terms of the account agreement from imposing a late  payment fee until a payment is late for a certain number of days  following a due date. For example, assume a payment is due on March 10  and the account agreement or state law provides that a late payment fee  cannot be assessed before March 21. A card issuer must disclose the due  date under the terms of the legal obligation (March 10 in this example),  and not a date different than the due date, such as when the card issuer  is restricted by the account agreement or state or other law from  imposing a late payment fee unless a payment is late for a certain  number of days following the due date (March 21 in this example).  Consumers' rights under state law to avoid the imposition of late  payment fees during a specified period following a due date are  unaffected by the disclosure requirement. In this example, the card  issuer would disclose March 10 as the due date for purposes of Sec.  1026.7(b)(11), but could not, under state law, assess a late payment fee  before March 21.</p><p class="depth0">3. Fee or rate triggered by multiple events. If a late payment fee  or penalty rate is triggered after multiple events, such as two late  payments in six months, the card issuer may, but is not required to,  disclose the late payment and penalty rate disclosure each month. The  disclosures must be included on any periodic statement for which a late  payment could trigger the late payment fee or penalty rate, such as  after the consumer made one late payment in this example. For example,  if a cardholder has already made one late payment, the disclosure must  be on each statement for the following five billing cycles.</p><p class="depth0">4. Range of late fees or penalty rates. A card issuer that imposes a  range of late payment fees or rates on a credit card account under an  open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan may state the highest  fee or rate along with an indication lower fees or rates could be  imposed. For example, a phrase indicating the late payment fee could be  ``up to $29'' complies with this requirement.</p><p class="depth0">5. Penalty rate in effect. If the highest penalty rate has  previously been triggered on an account, the card issuer may, but is not  required to, delete the amount of the penalty rate and the warning that  the rate may be imposed for an untimely payment, as not applicable.  Alternatively, the card issuer may, but is not required to, modify the  language to indicate that the penalty rate has been increased due to  previous late payments (if applicable).</p><p class="depth0">6. Same day each month. The requirement that the due date be the  same day each month means that the due date must generally be the same  numerical date. For example, a consumer's due date could be the 25th of  every month. In contrast, a due date that is the same relative date but  not numerical date each month, such as the third Tuesday of the month,  generally would not comply with this requirement. However, a consumer's  due date may be the last day of each month, even though that date will  not be the same numerical date. For example, if a consumer's due date is  the last day of each month, it will fall on February 28th (or February  29th in a leap year) and on August 31st.</p><p class="depth0">7. Change in due date. A creditor may adjust a consumer's due date  from time to time provided that the new due date will be the same  numerical date each month on an ongoing basis. For example, a creditor  may choose to honor a consumer's request to change from a due date that  is the 20th of each month to the 5th of each month, or may choose to  change a consumer's due date from time to time for operational reasons.  See comment 2(a)(4)-3 for guidance on transitional billing cycles.</p><p class="depth0">8. Billing cycles longer than one month. The requirement that the  due date be the same day each month does not prohibit billing cycles  that are two or three months, provided that the due date for each  billing cycle is on the same numerical date of the month. For example, a  creditor that establishes two-month billing cycles could send a consumer  periodic statements disclosing due dates of January 25, March 25, and  May 25.</p><p class="depth0">9. Payment due date when the creditor does not accept or receive  payments by mail. If the due date in a given month falls on a day on  which the creditor does not receive or accept payments by mail and the  creditor is required to treat a payment received the next business day  as timely pursuant to Sec. 1026.10(d), the creditor must disclose the  due date according to the legal obligation between the parties, not the  date as of which the creditor is permitted to treat the payment as late.  For example, assume that the consumer's due date is the 4th of every  month and the creditor does not accept or receive payments by mail on  Thursday, July 4. Pursuant to Sec. 1026.10(d), the creditor may not  treat a mailed payment received on the following business day, Friday,  July 5, as late for any purpose. The creditor must nonetheless disclose  July 4 as the due date on the periodic statement and may not disclose a  July 5 due date.</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(12) Repayment Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Rounding. In disclosing on the periodic statement the minimum  payment total cost estimate, the estimated monthly payment for repayment  in 36 months, the total cost estimate for repayment in 36 months, and  the savings estimate for repayment in 36 months under Sec.  1026.7(b)(12)(i) or (b)(12)(ii) as applicable, a card issuer, at its  option, must either round these disclosures to the nearest whole dollar  or to the nearest cent. Nonetheless, an issuer's rounding for all of  these disclosures must be consistent. An issuer may round all of these  disclosures to the nearest whole dollar when disclosing them on the  periodic statement, or may round all of these disclosures to the nearest  cent. An issuer may not, however, round some of the disclosures to the  nearest whole dollar, while rounding other disclosures to the nearest  cent.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 7(b)(12)(i)(F)</p><p class="depth0">1. Minimum payment repayment estimate disclosed on the periodic  statement is three years or less. Section 1026.7(b)(12)(i)(F)(2)(i)  provides that a credit card issuer is not required to provide the  disclosures related to repayment in 36 months if the minimum payment  repayment estimate disclosed under Sec. 1026.7(b)(12)(i)(B) after  rounding is 3 years or less. For example, if the minimum payment  repayment estimate is 2 years 6 months to 3 years 5 months, issuers  would be required under Sec. 1026.7(b)(12)(i)(B) to disclose that it  would take 3 years to pay off the balance in full if making only the  minimum payment. In these cases, an issuer would not be required to  disclose the 36-month disclosures on the periodic statement because the  minimum payment repayment estimate disclosed to the consumer on the  periodic statement (after rounding) is 3 years or less.</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(12)(iv) Provision of Information About Credit Counseling Services</p><p class="depth0">1. Approved organizations. Section 1026.7(b)(12)(iv)(A) requires  card issuers to provide information regarding at least three  organizations that have been approved by the United States Trustee or a  bankruptcy administrator pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 111(a)(1) to provide  credit counseling services in, at the card issuer's option, either the  state in which the billing address for the account is located or the  state specified by the consumer. A card issuer does not satisfy the  requirements in Sec. 1026.7(b)(12)(iv)(A) by providing information  regarding providers that have been approved pursuant to 11 U.S.C.  111(a)(2) to offer personal financial management courses.</p><p class="depth0">2. Information regarding approved organizations. i. Provision of  information obtained from United States Trustee or bankruptcy  administrator. A card issuer complies with the requirements of Sec.  1026.7(b)(12)(iv)(A) if, through the toll-free number disclosed pursuant  to Sec. 1026.7(b)(12)(i) or (b)(12)(ii), it provides the consumer with  information obtained from the United States Trustee or a bankruptcy  administrator, such as information obtained from the Web site operated  by the United States Trustee. Section 1026.7(b)(12)(iv)(A) does not  require a card issuer to provide information that is not available from  the United States Trustee or a bankruptcy administrator. If, for  example, the Web site address for an organization approved by the United  States Trustee is not available from the Web site operated by the United  States Trustee, a card issuer is not required to provide a Web site  address for that organization. However, Sec. 1026.7(b)(12)(iv)(B)  requires the card issuer to, at least annually, update the information  it provides for consistency with the information provided by the United  States Trustee or a bankruptcy administrator.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Provision of information consistent with request of approved  organization. If requested by an approved organization, a card issuer  may at its option provide, in addition to the name of the organization  obtained from the United States Trustee or a bankruptcy administrator,  another name used by that organization through the toll-free number  disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.7(b)(12)(i) or (b)(12)(ii). In   addition, if requested by an approved organization, a card issuer may at  its option provide through the toll-free number disclosed pursuant to  Sec. 1026.7(b)(12)(i) or (b)(12)(ii) a street address, telephone  number, or Web site address for the organization that is different than  the street address, telephone number, or Web site address obtained from  the United States Trustee or a bankruptcy administrator. However, if  requested by an approved organization, a card issuer must not provide  information regarding that organization through the toll-free number  disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.7(b)(12)(i) or (b)(12)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Information regarding approved organizations that provide  credit counseling services in a language other than English. A card  issuer may at its option provide through the toll-free number disclosed  pursuant to Sec. 1026.7(b)(12)(i) or (b)(12)(ii) information regarding  approved organizations that provide credit counseling services in  languages other than English. In the alternative, a card issuer may at  its option state that such information is available from the Web site  operated by the United States Trustee. Disclosing this Web site address  does not by itself constitute a statement that organizations have been  approved by the United States Trustee for purposes of comment  7(b)(12)(iv)-2.iv.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Statements regarding approval by the United States Trustee or a  bankruptcy administrator. Section 1026.7(b)(12)(iv) does not require a  card issuer to disclose through the toll-free number disclosed pursuant  to Sec. 1026.7(b)(12)(i) or (b)(12)(ii) that organizations have been  approved by the United States Trustee or a bankruptcy administrator.  However, if a card issuer chooses to make such a disclosure, Sec.  1026.7(b)(12)(iv) requires that the card issuer also disclose that:</p><p class="depth0">A. The United States Trustee or a bankruptcy administrator has  determined that the organizations meet the minimum requirements for  nonprofit pre-bankruptcy budget and credit counseling;</p><p class="depth0">B. The organizations may provide other credit counseling services  that have not been reviewed by the United States Trustee or a bankruptcy  administrator; and</p><p class="depth0">C. The United States Trustee or the bankruptcy administrator does  not endorse or recommend any particular organization.</p><p class="depth0">3. Automated response systems or devices. At their option, card  issuers may use toll-free telephone numbers that connect consumers to  automated systems, such as an interactive voice response system, through  which consumers may obtain the information required by Sec.  1026.7(b)(12)(iv) by inputting information using a touch-tone telephone  or similar device.</p><p class="depth0">4. Toll-free telephone number. A card issuer may provide a toll-free  telephone number that is designed to handle customer service calls  generally, so long as the option to receive the information required by  Sec. 1026.7(b)(12)(iv) is prominently disclosed to the consumer. For  automated systems, the option to receive the information required by  Sec. 1026.7(b)(12)(iv) is prominently disclosed to the consumer if it  is listed as one of the options in the first menu of options given to  the consumer, such as ``Press or say `3' if you would like information  about credit counseling services.'' If the automated system permits  callers to select the language in which the call is conducted and in  which information is provided, the menu to select the language may  precede the menu with the option to receive information about accessing  credit counseling services.</p><p class="depth0">5. Third parties. At their option, card issuers may use a third  party to establish and maintain a toll-free telephone number for use by  the issuer to provide the information required by Sec.  1026.7(b)(12)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">6. Web site address. When making the repayment disclosures on the  periodic statement pursuant to Sec. 1026.7(b)(12), a card issuer at its  option may also include a reference to a Web site address (in addition  to the toll-free telephone number) where its customers may obtain the  information required by Sec. 1026.7(b)(12)(iv), so long as the  information provided on the Web site complies with Sec.  1026.7(b)(12)(iv). The Web site address disclosed must take consumers  directly to the Web page where information about accessing credit  counseling may be obtained. In the alternative, the card issuer may  disclose the Web site address for the Web page operated by the United  States Trustee where consumers may obtain information about approved  credit counseling organizations. Disclosing this Web site address does  not by itself constitute a statement that organizations have been  approved by the United States Trustee for purposes of comment  7(b)(12)(iv)-2.iv.</p><p class="depth0">7. Advertising or marketing information. If a consumer requests  information about credit counseling services, the card issuer may not  provide advertisements or marketing materials to the consumer (except  for providing the name of the issuer) prior to providing the information  required by Sec. 1026.7(b)(12)(iv). Educational materials that do not  solicit business are not considered advertisements or marketing  materials for this purpose. Examples:</p><p class="depth0">i. Toll-free telephone number. As described in comment 7(b)(12)(iv)- 4, an issuer may provide a toll-free telephone number that is designed  to handle customer service calls generally, so long as the option to  receive the information required by Sec. 1026.7(b)(12)(iv) through that  toll-free telephone number is prominently disclosed to the consumer.  Once the consumer selects the option to receive the information required  by Sec. 1026.7(b)(12)(iv), the issuer may not provide advertisements   or marketing materials to the consumer (except for providing the name of  the issuer) prior to providing the required information.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Web page. If the issuer discloses a link to a Web site address  as part of the disclosures pursuant to comment 7(b)(12)(iv)-6, the  issuer may not provide advertisements or marketing materials (except for  providing the name of the issuer) on the Web page accessed by the  address prior to providing the information required by Sec.  1026.7(b)(12)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(12)(v) Exemptions</p><p class="depth0">1. Billing cycle where paying the minimum payment due for that  billing cycle will pay the outstanding balance on the account for that  billing cycle. Under Sec. 1026.7(b)(12)(v)(C), a card issuer is exempt  from the repayment disclosure requirements set forth in Sec.  1026.7(b)(12) for a particular billing cycle where paying the minimum  payment due for that billing cycle will pay the outstanding balance on  the account for that billing cycle. For example, if the entire  outstanding balance on an account for a particular billing cycle is $20  and the minimum payment is $20, an issuer would not need to comply with  the repayment disclosure requirements for that particular billing cycle.  In addition, this exemption would apply to a charged-off account where  payment of the entire account balance is due immediately.</p><p class="depth0">7(b)(13) Format Requirements</p><p class="depth0">1. Combined deposit account and credit account statements. Some  financial institutions provide information about deposit account and  open-end credit account activity on one periodic statement. For purposes  of providing disclosures on the front of the first page of the periodic  statement pursuant to Sec. 1026.7(b)(13), the first page of such a  combined statement shall be the page on which credit transactions first  appear.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.8--Identifying Transactions on Periodic Statements</p><p class="depth0">8(a) Sale Credit</p><p class="depth0">1. Sale credit. The term ``sale credit'' refers to a purchase in  which the consumer uses a credit card or otherwise directly accesses an  open-end line of credit (see comment 8(b)-1 if access is by means of a  check) to obtain goods or services from a merchant, whether or not the  merchant is the card issuer or creditor. ``Sale credit'' includes:</p><p class="depth0">i. The purchase of funds-transfer services (such as a wire transfer)  from an intermediary.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The purchase of services from the card issuer or creditor. For  the purchase of services that are costs imposed as part of the plan  under Sec. 1026.6(b)(3), card issuers and creditors comply with the  requirements for identifying transactions under this section by  disclosing the fees in accordance with the requirements of Sec.  1026.7(b)(6). For the purchases of services that are not costs imposed  as part of the plan, card issuers and creditors may, at their option,  identify transactions under this section or in accordance with the  requirements of Sec. 1026.7(b)(6).</p><p class="depth0">2. Amount--transactions not billed in full. If sale transactions are  not billed in full on any single statement, but are billed periodically  in precomputed installments, the first periodic statement reflecting the  transaction must show either the full amount of the transaction together  with the date the transaction actually took place; or the amount of the  first installment that was debited to the account together with the date  of the transaction or the date on which the first installment was  debited to the account. In any event, subsequent periodic statements  should reflect each installment due, together with either any other  identifying information required by Sec. 1026.8(a) (such as the  seller's name and address in a three-party situation) or other  appropriate identifying information relating the transaction to the  first billing. The debiting date for the particular installment, or the  date the transaction took place, may be used as the date of the  transaction on these subsequent statements.</p><p class="depth0">3. Date--when a transaction takes place. i. If the consumer conducts  the transaction in person, the date of the transaction is the calendar  date on which the consumer made the purchase or order, or secured the  advance.</p><p class="depth0">ii. For transactions billed to the account on an ongoing basis  (other than installments to pay a precomputed amount), the date of the  transaction is the date on which the amount is debited to the account.  This might include, for example, monthly insurance premiums.</p><p class="depth0">iii. For mail, Internet, or telephone orders, a creditor may  disclose as the transaction date either the invoice date, the debiting  date, or the date the order was placed by telephone or via the Internet.</p><p class="depth0">iv. In a foreign transaction, the debiting date may be considered  the transaction date.</p><p class="depth0">4. Date--sufficiency of description. i. If the creditor discloses  only the date of the transaction, the creditor need not identify it as  the ``transaction date.'' If the creditor discloses more than one date  (for example, the transaction date and the posting date), the creditor  must identify each.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The month and day sufficiently identify the transaction date,  unless the posting of the transaction is delayed so long that the year  is needed for a clear disclosure to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">5. Same or related persons. i. For purposes of identifying  transactions, the term same or related persons refers to, for example:</p><p class="depth0">A. Franchised or licensed sellers of a creditor's product or  service.</p><p class="depth0">B. Sellers who assign or sell open-end sales accounts to a creditor  or arrange for such credit under a plan that allows the consumer to use  the credit only in transactions with that seller.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A seller is not related to the creditor merely because the  seller and the creditor have an agreement authorizing the seller to  honor the creditor's credit card.</p><p class="depth0">6. Brief identification--sufficiency of description. The ``brief  identification'' provision in Sec. 1026.8(a)(1)(i) requires a  designation that will enable the consumer to reconcile the periodic  statement with the consumer's own records. In determining the  sufficiency of the description, the following rules apply:</p><p class="depth0">i. While item-by-item descriptions are not necessary, reasonable  precision is required. For example, ``merchandise,'' ``miscellaneous,''  ``second-hand goods,'' or ``promotional items'' would not suffice.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A reference to a department in a sales establishment that  accurately conveys the identification of the types of property or  services available in the department is sufficient--for example,  ``jewelry,'' or ``sporting goods.''</p><p class="depth0">iii. A number or symbol that is related to an identification list  printed elsewhere on the statement that reasonably identifies the  transaction with the creditor is sufficient.</p><p class="depth0">7. Seller's name--sufficiency of description. The requirement  contemplates that the seller's name will appear on the periodic  statement in essentially the same form as it appears on transaction  documents provided to the consumer at the time of the sale. The seller's  name may also be disclosed as, for example:</p><p class="depth0">i. A more complete spelling of the name that was alphabetically  abbreviated on the receipt or other credit document.</p><p class="depth0">ii. An alphabetical abbreviation of the name on the periodic  statement even if the name appears in a more complete spelling on the  receipt or other credit document. Terms that merely indicate the form of  a business entity, such as ``Inc.,'' ``Co.,'' or ``Ltd.,'' may always be  omitted.</p><p class="depth0">8. Location of transaction. i. If the seller has multiple stores or  branches within a city, the creditor need not identify the specific  branch at which the sale occurred.</p><p class="depth0">ii. When no meaningful address is available because the consumer did  not make the purchase at any fixed location of the seller, the creditor  may omit the address, or may provide some other identifying designation,  such as ``aboard plane,'' ``ABC Airways Flight,'' ``customer's home,''  ``telephone order,'' ``internet order'' or ``mail order.''</p><p class="depth0">8(b) Nonsale credit.</p><p class="depth0">1. Nonsale credit. The term ``nonsale credit'' refers to any form of  loan credit including, for example:</p><p class="depth0">i. A cash advance.</p><p class="depth0">ii. An advance on a credit plan that is accessed by overdrafts on a  checking account.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The use of a ``supplemental credit device'' in the form of a  check or draft or the use of the overdraft credit plan accessed by a  debit card, even if such use is in connection with a purchase of goods  or services.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Miscellaneous debits to remedy mispostings, returned checks, and  similar entries.</p><p class="depth0">2. Amount--overdraft credit plans. If credit is extended under an  overdraft credit plan tied to a checking account or by means of a debit  card tied to an overdraft credit plan:</p><p class="depth0">i. The amount to be disclosed is that of the credit extension, not  the face amount of the check or the total amount of the debit/credit  transaction.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The creditor may disclose the amount of the credit extensions on  a cumulative daily basis, rather than the amount attributable to each  check or each use of the debit card that accesses the credit plan.</p><p class="depth0">3. Date of transaction. See comment 8(a)-4.</p><p class="depth0">4. Nonsale transaction--sufficiency of identification. The creditor  sufficiently identifies a nonsale transaction by describing the type of  advance it represents, such as cash advance, loan, overdraft loan, or  any readily understandable trade name for the credit program.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.9--Subsequent Disclosure Requirements</p><p class="depth0">9(a) Furnishing Statement of Billing Rights</p><p class="depth0">9(a)(1) Annual Statement</p><p class="depth0">1. General. The creditor may provide the annual billing rights  statement:</p><p class="depth0">i. By sending it in one billing period per year to each consumer  that gets a periodic statement for that period; or</p><p class="depth0">ii. By sending a copy to all of its accountholders sometime during  the calendar year but not necessarily all in one billing period (for  example, sending the annual notice in connection with renewal cards or  when imposing annual membership fees).</p><p class="depth0">2. Substantially similar. See the commentary to Model Forms G-3 and  G-3(A) in appendix G to part 1026.</p><p class="depth0">9(a)(2) Alternative Summary Statement</p><p class="depth0">1. Changing from long-form to short form statement and vice versa.  If the creditor has been sending the long-form annual statement, and  subsequently decides to use the alternative summary statement, the first  summary statement must be sent no later than 12 months after the last  long-form statement was sent. Conversely, if the creditor wants to  switch to the long-form, the first long-form statement must be sent no  later than 12 months after the last summary statement.</p><p class="depth0">2. Substantially similar. See the commentary to Model Forms G-4 and  G-4(A) in appendix G to part 1026.</p><p class="depth0">9(b) Disclosures for Supplemental Credit Access Devices and Additional</p><p class="depth0">Features</p><p class="depth0">1. Credit access device--examples. Credit access device includes,  for example, a blank check, payee-designated check, blank draft or  order, or authorization form for issuance of a check; it does not  include a check issued payable to a consumer representing loan proceeds  or the disbursement of a cash advance.</p><p class="depth0">2. Credit account feature--examples. A new credit account feature  would include, for example:</p><p class="depth0">i. The addition of overdraft checking to an existing account  (although the regular checks that could trigger the overdraft feature  are not themselves ``devices'').</p><p class="depth0">ii. The option to use an existing credit card to secure cash  advances, when previously the card could only be used for purchases.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 9(b)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Different finance charge terms. Except as provided in Sec.  1026.9(b)(3) for checks that access a credit card account, if the  finance charge terms are different from those previously disclosed, the  creditor may satisfy the requirement to give the finance charge terms  either by giving a complete set of new account-opening disclosures  reflecting the terms of the added device or feature or by giving only  the finance charge disclosures for the added device or feature.</p><p class="depth0">9(b)(3) Checks That Access a Credit Card Account</p><p class="depth0">9(b)(3)(i) Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Front of the page containing the checks. The following would  comply with the requirement that the tabular disclosures provided  pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(b)(3) appear on the front of the page  containing the checks:</p><p class="depth0">i. Providing the tabular disclosure on the front of the first page  on which checks appear, for an offer where checks are provided on  multiple pages;</p><p class="depth0">ii. Providing the tabular disclosure on the front of a mini-book or  accordion booklet containing the checks; or</p><p class="depth0">iii. Providing the tabular disclosure on the front of the  solicitation letter, when the checks are printed on the front of the  same page as the solicitation letter even if the checks can be separated  by the consumer from the solicitation letter using perforations.</p><p class="depth0">2. Combined disclosures for checks and other transactions subject to  the same terms. A card issuer may include in the tabular disclosure  provided pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(b)(3) disclosures regarding the terms  offered on non-check transactions, provided that such transactions are  subject to the same terms that are required to be disclosed pursuant to  Sec. 1026.9(b)(3)(i) for the checks that access a credit card account.  However, a card issuer may not include in the table information  regarding additional terms that are not required disclosures for checks  that access a credit card account pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 9(b)(3)(i)(D)</p><p class="depth0">1. Grace period. A creditor may not disclose under Sec.  1026.9(b)(3)(i)(D) the limitations on the imposition of finance charges  as a result of a loss of a grace period in Sec. 1026.54, or the impact  of payment allocation on whether interest is charged on transactions as  a result of a loss of a grace period. Some creditors may offer a grace  period on credit extended by the use of an access check under which  interest will not be charged on the check transactions if the consumer  pays the outstanding balance shown on a periodic statement in full by  the due date shown on that statement for one or more billing cycles. In  these circumstances, Sec. 1026.9(b)(3)(i)(D) requires that the creditor  disclose the grace period using the following language, or substantially  similar language, as applicable: ``Your due date is [at least] ---- days  after the close of each billing cycle. We will not charge you any  interest on check transactions if you pay your entire balance by the due  date each month.'' However, other creditors may offer a grace period on  check transactions under which interest may be charged on check  transactions even if the consumer pays the outstanding balance shown on  a periodic statement in full by the due date shown on that statement  each billing cycle. In these circumstances, Sec. 1026.9(b)(3)(i)(D)  requires the creditor to amend the above disclosure language to describe  accurately the conditions on the applicability of the grace period.  Creditors may use the following language to describe that no grace  period on check transactions is offered, as applicable: ``We will begin  charging interest on these checks on the transaction date.''</p><p class="depth0">9(c) Change in Terms</p><p class="depth0">9(c)(1) Rules Affecting Home-Equity Plans</p><p class="depth0">1. Changes initially disclosed. No notice of a change in terms need  be given if the specific change is set forth initially, such as: rate  increases under a properly disclosed variable-rate plan, a rate increase  that occurs when an employee has been under a preferential rate  agreement and terminates employment, or an increase that occurs when the  consumer has been under an agreement to maintain a certain balance in a  savings account in order to keep a particular rate and the account  balance falls below the specified minimum. The rules in Sec. 1026.40(f)  relating to   home-equity plans limit the ability of a creditor to change the terms of  such plans.</p><p class="depth0">2. State law issues. Examples of issues not addressed by Sec.  1026.9(c) because they are controlled by state or other applicable law  include:</p><p class="depth0">i. The types of changes a creditor may make. (But see Sec.  1026.40(f))</p><p class="depth0">ii. How changed terms affect existing balances, such as when a  periodic rate is changed and the consumer does not pay off the entire  existing balance before the new rate takes effect.</p><p class="depth0">3. Change in billing cycle. Whenever the creditor changes the  consumer's billing cycle, it must give a change-in-terms notice if the  change either affects any of the terms required to be disclosed under  Sec. 1026.6(a) or increases the minimum payment, unless an exception  under Sec. 1026.9(c)(1)(ii) applies; for example, the creditor must  give advance notice if the creditor initially disclosed a 25-day grace  period on purchases and the consumer will have fewer days during the  billing cycle change.</p><p class="depth0">9(c)(1)(i) Written Notice Required</p><p class="depth0">1. Affected consumers. Change-in-terms notices need only go to those  consumers who may be affected by the change. For example, a change in  the periodic rate for check overdraft credit need not be disclosed to  consumers who do not have that feature on their accounts.</p><p class="depth0">2. Timing--effective date of change. The rule that the notice of the  change in terms be provided at least 15 days before the change takes  effect permits mid-cycle changes when there is clearly no retroactive  effect, such as the imposition of a transaction fee. Any change in the  balance computation method, in contrast, would need to be disclosed at  least 15 days prior to the billing cycle in which the change is to be  implemented.</p><p class="depth0">3. Timing--advance notice not required. Advance notice of 15 days is  not necessary--that is, a notice of change in terms is required, but it  may be mailed or delivered as late as the effective date of the change-- in two circumstances:</p><p class="depth0">i. If there is an increased periodic rate or any other finance  charge attributable to the consumer's delinquency or default.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the consumer agrees to the particular change. This provision  is intended for use in the unusual instance when a consumer substitutes  collateral or when the creditor can advance additional credit only if a  change relatively unique to that consumer is made, such as the  consumer's providing additional security or paying an increased minimum  payment amount. Therefore, the following are not ``agreements'' between  the consumer and the creditor for purposes of Sec. 1026.9(c)(1)(i): The  consumer's general acceptance of the creditor's contract reservation of  the right to change terms; the consumer's use of the account (which  might imply acceptance of its terms under state law); and the consumer's  acceptance of a unilateral term change that is not particular to that  consumer, but rather is of general applicability to consumers with that  type of account.</p><p class="depth0">4. Form of change-in-terms notice. A complete new set of the initial  disclosures containing the changed term complies with Sec.  1026.9(c)(1)(i) if the change is highlighted in some way on the  disclosure statement, or if the disclosure statement is accompanied by a  letter or some other insert that indicates or draws attention to the  term change.</p><p class="depth0">5. Security interest change--form of notice. A copy of the security  agreement that describes the collateral securing the consumer's account  may be used as the notice, when the term change is the addition of a  security interest or the addition or substitution of collateral.</p><p class="depth0">6. Changes to home-equity plans entered into on or after November 7,  1989. Section 1026.9(c)(1) applies when, by written agreement under  Sec. 1026.40(f)(3)(iii), a creditor changes the terms of a home-equity  plan--entered into on or after November 7, 1989--at or before its  scheduled expiration, for example, by renewing a plan on terms different  from those of the original plan. In disclosing the change:</p><p class="depth0">i. If the index is changed, the maximum annual percentage rate is  increased (to the limited extent permitted by Sec. 1026.30), or a  variable-rate feature is added to a fixed-rate plan, the creditor must  include the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.40(d)(12)(x) and  (d)(12)(xi), unless these disclosures are unchanged from those given  earlier.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the minimum payment requirement is changed, the creditor must  include the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.40(d)(5)(iii) (and, in  variable-rate plans, the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.40(d)(12)(x)  and (d)(12)(xi)) unless the disclosures given earlier contained  representative examples covering the new minimum payment requirement.  (See the commentary to Sec. 1026.40(d)(5)(iii), (d)(12)(x) and  (d)(12)(xi) for a discussion of representative examples.)</p><p class="depth0">iii. When the terms are changed pursuant to a written agreement as  described in Sec. 1026.40(f)(3)(iii), the advance-notice requirement  does not apply.</p><p class="depth0">9(c)(1)(ii) Notice not Required</p><p class="depth0">1. Changes not requiring notice. The following are examples of  changes that do not require a change-in-terms notice:</p><p class="depth0">i. A change in the consumer's credit limit.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A change in the name of the credit card or credit card plan.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The substitution of one insurer for another.</p><p class="depth0">iv. A termination or suspension of credit privileges. (But see Sec.  1026.40(f).)</p><p class="depth0">v. Changes arising merely by operation of law; for example, if the  creditor's security interest in a consumer's car automatically extends  to the proceeds when the consumer sells the car.</p><p class="depth0">2. Skip features. If a credit program allows consumers to skip or  reduce one or more payments during the year, or involves temporary  reductions in finance charges, no notice of the change in terms is  required either prior to the reduction or upon resumption of the higher  rates or payments if these features are explained on the initial  disclosure statement (including an explanation of the terms upon  resumption). For example, a merchant may allow consumers to skip the  December payment to encourage holiday shopping, or a teachers' credit  union may not require payments during summer vacation. Otherwise, the  creditor must give notice prior to resuming the original schedule or  rate, even though no notice is required prior to the reduction. The  change-in-terms notice may be combined with the notice offering the  reduction. For example, the periodic statement reflecting the reduction  or skip feature may also be used to notify the consumer of the  resumption of the original schedule or rate, either by stating  explicitly when the higher payment or charges resume, or by indicating  the duration of the skip option. Language such as ``You may skip your  October payment,'' or ``We will waive your finance charges for  January,'' may serve as the change-in-terms notice.</p><p class="depth0">9(c)(1)(iii) Notice to Restrict Credit</p><p class="depth0">1. Written request for reinstatement. If a creditor requires the  request for reinstatement of credit privileges to be in writing, the  notice under Sec. 1026.9(c)(1)(iii) must state that fact.</p><p class="depth0">2. Notice not required. A creditor need not provide a notice under  this paragraph if, pursuant to the commentary to Sec. 1026.40(f)(2), a  creditor freezes a line or reduces a credit line rather than terminating  a plan and accelerating the balance.</p><p class="depth0">9(c)(2) Rules Affecting Open-End (Not Home-Secured) Plans</p><p class="depth0">1. Changes initially disclosed. Except as provided in Sec.  1026.9(g)(1), no notice of a change in terms need be given if the  specific change is set forth initially consistent with any applicable  requirements, such as rate or fee increases upon expiration of a  specific period of time that were disclosed in accordance with Sec.  1026.9(c)(2)(v)(B) or rate increases under a properly disclosed  variable-rate plan in accordance with Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(C). In  contrast, notice must be given if the contract allows the creditor to  increase a rate or fee at its discretion.</p><p class="depth0">2. State law issues. Some issues are not addressed by Sec.  1026.9(c)(2) because they are controlled by state or other applicable  laws. These issues include the types of changes a creditor may make, to  the extent otherwise permitted by this part.</p><p class="depth0">3. Change in billing cycle. Whenever the creditor changes the  consumer's billing cycle, it must give a change-in-terms notice if the  change affects any of the terms described in Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(i),  unless an exception under Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(v) applies; for example,  the creditor must give advance notice if the creditor initially  disclosed a 28-day grace period on purchases and the consumer will have  fewer days during the billing cycle change. See also Sec.  1026.7(b)(11)(i)(A) regarding the general requirement that the payment  due date for a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured)  consumer credit plan must be the same day each month.</p><p class="depth0">4. Relationship to Sec. 1026.9(b). If a creditor adds a feature to  the account on the type of terms otherwise required to be disclosed  under Sec. 1026.6, the creditor must satisfy: The requirement to  provide the finance charge disclosures for the added feature under Sec.  1026.9(b); and any applicable requirement to provide a change-in-terms  notice under Sec. 1026.9(c), including any advance notice that must be  provided. For example, if a creditor adds a balance transfer feature to  an account more than 30 days after account-opening disclosures are  provided, it must give the finance charge disclosures for the balance  transfer feature under Sec. 1026.9(b) as well as comply with the  change-in-terms notice requirements under Sec. 1026.9(c), including  providing notice of the change at least 45 days prior to the effective  date of the change. Similarly, if a creditor makes a balance transfer  offer on finance charge terms that are higher than those previously  disclosed for balance transfers, it would also generally be required to  provide a change-in-terms notice at least 45 days in advance of the  effective date of the change. A creditor may provide a single notice  under Sec. 1026.9(c) to satisfy the notice requirements of both  paragraphs (b) and (c) of Sec. 1026.9. For checks that access a credit  card account subject to the disclosure requirements in Sec.  1026.9(b)(3), a creditor is not subject to the notice requirements under  Sec. 1026.9(c) even if the applicable rate or fee is higher than those  previously disclosed for such checks. Thus, for example, the creditor  need not wait 45 days before applying the new rate or fee for  transactions made using such checks, but the creditor must make the  required disclosures on or with the checks in accordance with Sec.  1026.9(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0">9(c)(2)(i) Changes Where Written Advance Notice is Required</p><p class="depth0">1. Affected consumers. Change-in-terms notices need only go to those  consumers who may be affected by the change. For example,   a change in the periodic rate for check overdraft credit need not be  disclosed to consumers who do not have that feature on their accounts.  If a single credit account involves multiple consumers that may be  affected by the change, the creditor should refer to Sec. 1026.5(d) to  determine the number of notices that must be given.</p><p class="depth0">2. Timing--effective date of change. The rule that the notice of the  change in terms be provided at least 45 days before the change takes  effect permits mid-cycle changes when there is clearly no retroactive  effect, such as the imposition of a transaction fee. Any change in the  balance computation method, in contrast, would need to be disclosed at  least 45 days prior to the billing cycle in which the change is to be  implemented.</p><p class="depth0">3. Changes agreed to by the consumer. See also comment 5(b)(1)(i)-6.</p><p class="depth0">4. Form of change-in-terms notice. Except if Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(iv)  applies, a complete new set of the initial disclosures containing the  changed term complies with Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(i) if the change is  highlighted on the disclosure statement, or if the disclosure statement  is accompanied by a letter or some other insert that indicates or draws  attention to the term being changed.</p><p class="depth0">5. Security interest change--form of notice. A creditor must provide  a description of any security interest it is acquiring under Sec.  1026.9(c)(2)(iv). A copy of the security agreement that describes the  collateral securing the consumer's account may also be used as the  notice, when the term change is the addition of a security interest or  the addition or substitution of collateral.</p><p class="depth0">6. Examples. See comment 55(a)-1 and 55(b)-3 for examples of how a  card issuer that is subject to Sec. 1026.55 may comply with the timing  requirements for notices required by Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0">9(c)(2)(iii) Charges not Covered by Sec. 1026.6(b)(1) and (b)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicability. Generally, if a creditor increases any component  of a charge, or introduces a new charge, that is imposed as part of the  plan under Sec. 1026.6(b)(3) but is not required to be disclosed as  part of the account-opening summary table under Sec. 1026.6(b)(1) and  (b)(2), the creditor must either, at its option (i) provide at least 45  days' written advance notice before the change becomes effective to  comply with the requirements of Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(i), or (ii) provide  notice orally or in writing, or electronically if the consumer requests  the service electronically, of the amount of the charge to an affected  consumer before the consumer agrees to or becomes obligated to pay the  charge, at a time and in a manner that a consumer would be likely to  notice the disclosure. (See the commentary under Sec. 1026.5(a)(1)(iii)  regarding disclosure of such changes in electronic form.) For example, a  fee for expedited delivery of a credit card is a charge imposed as part  of the plan under Sec. 1026.6(b)(3) but is not required to be disclosed  in the account-opening summary table under Sec. 1026.6(b)(1) and  (b)(2). If a creditor changes the amount of that expedited delivery fee,  the creditor may provide written advance notice of the change to  affected consumers at least 45 days before the change becomes effective.  Alternatively, the creditor may provide oral or written notice, or  electronic notice if the consumer requests the service electronically,  of the amount of the charge to an affected consumer before the consumer  agrees to or becomes obligated to pay the charge, at a time and in a  manner that the consumer would be likely to notice the disclosure. (See  comment 5(b)(1)(ii)-1 for examples of disclosures given at a time and in  a manner that the consumer would be likely to notice them.)</p><p class="depth0">9(c)(2)(iv) Disclosure Requirements</p><p class="depth0">1. Changing margin for calculating a variable rate. If a creditor is  changing a margin used to calculate a variable rate, the creditor must  disclose the amount of the new rate (as calculated using the new margin)  in the table described in Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(iv), and include a reminder  that the rate is a variable rate. For example, if a creditor is changing  the margin for a variable rate that uses the prime rate as an index, the  creditor must disclose in the table the new rate (as calculated using  the new margin) and indicate that the rate varies with the market based  on the prime rate.</p><p class="depth0">2. Changing index for calculating a variable rate. If a creditor is  changing the index used to calculate a variable rate, the creditor must  disclose the amount of the new rate (as calculated using the new index)  and indicate that the rate varies and how the rate is determined, as  explained in Sec. 1026.6(b)(2)(i)(A). For example, if a creditor is  changing from using a prime rate to using the LIBOR in calculating a  variable rate, the creditor would disclose in the table the new rate  (using the new index) and indicate that the rate varies with the market  based on the LIBOR.</p><p class="depth0">3. Changing from a variable rate to a non-variable rate. If a  creditor is changing a rate applicable to a consumer's account from a  variable rate to a non-variable rate, the creditor generally must  provide a notice as otherwise required under Sec. 1026.9(c) even if the  variable rate at the time of the change is higher than the non-variable  rate. However, a creditor is not required to provide a notice under  Sec. 1026.9(c) if the creditor provides the disclosures required by  Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(B) or (c)(2)(v)(D) in connection with changing a  variable rate to a lower non-variable rate. Similarly, a creditor is not  required to provide a notice under Sec. 1026.9(c) when changing a  variable rate to a lower non-variable rate   in order to comply with 50 U.S.C. app. 527 or a similar Federal or state  statute or regulation. Finally, a creditor is not required to provide a  notice under Sec. 1026.9(c) when changing a variable rate to a lower  non-variable rate in order to comply with Sec. 1026.55(b)(4).</p><p class="depth0">4. Changing from a non-variable rate to a variable rate. If a  creditor is changing a rate applicable to a consumer's account from a  non-variable rate to a variable rate, the creditor generally must  provide a notice as otherwise required under Sec. 1026.9(c) even if the  non-variable rate is higher than the variable rate at the time of the  change. However, a creditor is not required to provide a notice under  Sec. 1026.9(c) if the creditor provides the disclosures required by  Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(B) or (c)(2)(v)(D) in connection with changing a  non-variable rate to a lower variable rate. Similarly, a creditor is not  required to provide a notice under Sec. 1026.9(c) when changing a non- variable rate to a lower variable rate in order to comply with 50 U.S.C.  app. 527 or a similar Federal or state statute or regulation. Finally, a  creditor is not required to provide a notice under Sec. 1026.9(c) when  changing a non-variable rate to a lower variable rate in order to comply  with Sec. 1026.55(b)(4). See comment 55(b)(2)-4 regarding the  limitations in Sec. 1026.55(b)(2) on changing the rate that applies to  a protected balance from a non-variable rate to a variable rate.</p><p class="depth0">5. Changes in the penalty rate, the triggers for the penalty rate,  or how long the penalty rate applies. If a creditor is changing the  amount of the penalty rate, the creditor must also redisclose the  triggers for the penalty rate and the information about how long the  penalty rate applies even if those terms are not changing. Likewise, if  a creditor is changing the triggers for the penalty rate, the creditor  must redisclose the amount of the penalty rate and information about how  long the penalty rate applies. If a creditor is changing how long the  penalty rate applies, the creditor must redisclose the amount of the  penalty rate and the triggers for the penalty rate, even if they are not  changing.</p><p class="depth0">6. Changes in fees. If a creditor is changing part of how a fee that  is disclosed in a tabular format under Sec. 1026.6(b)(1) and (b)(2) is  determined, the creditor must redisclose all relevant information  related to that fee regardless of whether this other information is  changing. For example, if a creditor currently charges a cash advance  fee of ``Either $5 or 3% of the transaction amount, whichever is  greater(Max: $100),'' and the creditor is only changing the minimum  dollar amount from $5 to $10, the issuer must redisclose the other  information related to how the fee is determined. For example, the  creditor in this example would disclose the following: ``Either $10 or  3% of the transaction amount, whichever is greater (Max: $100).''</p><p class="depth0">7. Combining a notice described in Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(iv) with a  notice described in Sec. 1026.9(g)(3). If a creditor is required to  provide a notice described in Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(iv) and a notice  described in Sec. 1026.9(g)(3) to a consumer, the creditor may combine  the two notices. This would occur if penalty pricing has been triggered,  and other terms are changing on the consumer's account at the same time.</p><p class="depth0">8. Content. Sample G-20 contains an example of how to comply with  the requirements in Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(iv) when a variable rate is being  changed to a non-variable rate on a credit card account. The sample  explains when the new rate will apply to new transactions and to which  balances the current rate will continue to apply. Sample G-21 contains  an example of how to comply with the requirements in Sec.  1026.9(c)(2)(iv) when the late payment fee on a credit card account is  being increased, and the returned payment fee is also being increased.  The sample discloses the consumer's right to reject the changes in  accordance with Sec. 1026.9(h).</p><p class="depth0">9. Clear and conspicuous standard. See comment 5(a)(1)-1 for the  clear and conspicuous standard applicable to disclosures required under  Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(iv)(A)(1).</p><p class="depth0">10. Terminology. See Sec. 1026.5(a)(2) for terminology requirements  applicable to disclosures required under Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(iv)(A)(1).</p><p class="depth0">11. Reasons for increase. i. In general. Section  1026.9(c)(2)(iv)(A)(8) requires card issuers to disclose the principal  reason(s) for increasing an annual percentage rate applicable to a  credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit  plan. The regulation does not mandate a minimum number of reasons that  must be disclosed. However, the specific reasons disclosed under Sec.  1026.9(c)(2)(iv)(A)(8) are required to relate to and accurately describe  the principal factors actually considered by the card issuer in  increasing the rate. A card issuer may describe the reasons for the  increase in general terms. For example, the notice of a rate increase  triggered by a decrease of 100 points in a consumer's credit score may  state that the increase is due to ``a decline in your creditworthiness''  or ``a decline in your credit score.'' Similarly, a notice of a rate  increase triggered by a 10% increase in the card issuer's cost of funds  may be disclosed as ``a change in market conditions.'' In some  circumstances, it may be appropriate for a card issuer to combine the  disclosure of several reasons in one statement. However, Sec.  1026.9(c)(2)(iv)(A)(8) requires that the notice specifically disclose  any violation of the terms of the account on which the rate is being  increased, such as a late payment or a returned payment, if such  violation of the account terms is one of the four principal reasons for  the rate increase.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Example. Assume that a consumer made a late payment on the  credit card account on which the rate increase is being imposed,   made a late payment on a credit card account with another card issuer,  and the consumer's credit score decreased, in part due to such late  payments. The card issuer may disclose the reasons for the rate increase  as a decline in the consumer's credit score and the consumer's late  payment on the account subject to the increase. Because the late payment  on the credit card account with the other issuer also likely contributed  to the decline in the consumer's credit score, it is not required to be  separately disclosed. However, the late payment on the credit card  account on which the rate increase is being imposed must be specifically  disclosed even if that late payment also contributed to the decline in  the consumer's credit score.</p><p class="depth0">9(c)(2)(v) Notice not Required</p><p class="depth0">1. Changes not requiring notice. The following are examples of  changes that do not require a change-in-terms notice:</p><p class="depth0">i. A change in the consumer's credit limit except as otherwise  required by Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(vi).</p><p class="depth0">ii. A change in the name of the credit card or credit card plan.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The substitution of one insurer for another.</p><p class="depth0">iv. A termination or suspension of credit privileges.</p><p class="depth0">v. Changes arising merely by operation of law; for example, if the  creditor's security interest in a consumer's car automatically extends  to the proceeds when the consumer sells the car.</p><p class="depth0">2. Skip features. i. Skipped or reduced payments. If a credit  program allows consumers to skip or reduce one or more payments during  the year, no notice of the change in terms is required either prior to  the reduction in payments or upon resumption of the higher payments if  these features are explained on the account-opening disclosure statement  (including an explanation of the terms upon resumption). For example, a  merchant may allow consumers to skip the December payment to encourage  holiday shopping, or a teacher's credit union may not require payments  during summer vacation. Otherwise, the creditor must give notice prior  to resuming the original payment schedule, even though no notice is  required prior to the reduction. The change-in-terms notice may be  combined with the notice offering the reduction. For example, the  periodic statement reflecting the skip feature may also be used to  notify the consumer of the resumption of the original payment schedule,  either by stating explicitly when the higher resumes or by indicating  the duration of the skip option. Language such as ``You may skip your  October payment'' may serve as the change-in-terms notice.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Temporary reductions in interest rates or fees. If a credit  program involves temporary reductions in an interest rate or fee, no  notice of the change in terms is required either prior to the reduction  or upon resumption of the original rate or fee if these features are  disclosed in advance in accordance with the requirements of Sec.  1026.9(c)(2)(v)(B). Otherwise, the creditor must give notice prior to  resuming the original rate or fee, even though no notice is required  prior to the reduction. The notice provided prior to resuming the  original rate or fee must comply with the timing requirements of Sec.  1026.9(c)(2)(i) and the content and format requirements of Sec.  1026.9(c)(2)(iv)(A), (B) (if applicable), (C) (if applicable), and (D).  See comment 55(b)-3 for guidance regarding the application of Sec.  1026.55 in these circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">3. Changing from a variable rate to a non-variable rate. See comment  9(c)(2)(iv)-3.</p><p class="depth0">4. Changing from a non-variable rate to a variable rate. See comment  9(c)(2)(iv)-4.</p><p class="depth0">5. Temporary rate or fee reductions offered by telephone. The timing  requirements of Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(B) are deemed to have been met,  and written disclosures required by Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(B) may be  provided as soon as reasonably practicable after the first transaction  subject to a rate that will be in effect for a specified period of time  (a temporary rate) or the imposition of a fee that will be in effect for  a specified period of time (a temporary fee) if:</p><p class="depth0">i. The consumer accepts the offer of the temporary rate or temporary  fee by telephone;</p><p class="depth0">ii. The creditor permits the consumer to reject the temporary rate  or temporary fee offer and have the rate or rates or fee that previously  applied to the consumer's balances reinstated for 45 days after the  creditor mails or delivers the written disclosures required by Sec.  1026.9(c)(2)(v)(B), except that the creditor need not permit the  consumer to reject a temporary rate or temporary fee offer if the rate  or rates or fee that will apply following expiration of the temporary  rate do not exceed the rate or rates or fee that applied immediately  prior to commencement of the temporary rate or temporary fee; and</p><p class="depth0">iii. The disclosures required by Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(B) and the  consumer's right to reject the temporary rate or temporary fee offer and  have the rate or rates or fee that previously applied to the consumer's  account reinstated, if applicable, are disclosed to the consumer as part  of the temporary rate or temporary fee offer.</p><p class="depth0">6. First listing. The disclosures required by Sec.  1026.9(c)(2)(v)(B)(1) are only required to be provided in close  proximity and in equal prominence to the first listing of the temporary  rate or fee in the disclosure provided to the consumer. For purposes of  Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(B), the first statement of the temporary rate or  fee is the most prominent listing on the front side of the first page of  the disclosure. If the temporary rate or fee   does not appear on the front side of the first page of the disclosure,  then the first listing of the temporary rate or fee is the most  prominent listing of the temporary rate on the subsequent pages of the  disclosure. For advertising requirements for promotional rates, see  Sec. 1026.16(g).</p><p class="depth0">7. Close proximity--point of sale. Creditors providing the  disclosures required by Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(B) of this section in  person in connection with financing the purchase of goods or services  may, at the creditor's option, disclose the annual percentage rate or  fee that would apply after expiration of the period on a separate page  or document from the temporary rate or fee and the length of the period,  provided that the disclosure of the annual percentage rate or fee that  would apply after the expiration of the period is equally prominent to,  and is provided at the same time as, the disclosure of the temporary  rate or fee and length of the period.</p><p class="depth0">8. Disclosure of annual percentage rates. If a rate disclosed  pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(B) or (c)(2)(v)(D) is a variable rate,  the creditor must disclose the fact that the rate may vary and how the  rate is determined. For example, a creditor could state ``After October  1, 2009, your APR will be 14.99%. This APR will vary with the market  based on the Prime Rate.''</p><p class="depth0">9. Deferred interest or similar programs. If the applicable  conditions are met, the exception in Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(B) applies to  deferred interest or similar promotional programs under which the  consumer is not obligated to pay interest that accrues on a balance if  that balance is paid in full prior to the expiration of a specified  period of time. For purposes of this comment and Sec.  1026.9(c)(2)(v)(B), ``deferred interest'' has the same meaning as in  Sec. 1026.16(h)(2) and associated commentary. For such programs, a  creditor must disclose pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(B)(1) the  length of the deferred interest period and the rate that will apply to  the balance subject to the deferred interest program if that balance is  not paid in full prior to expiration of the deferred interest period.  Examples of language that a creditor may use to make the required  disclosures under Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(B)(1) include:</p><p class="depth0">i. ``No interest if paid in full in 6 months. If the balance is not  paid in full in 6 months, interest will be imposed from the date of  purchase at a rate of 15.99%.''</p><p class="depth0">ii. ``No interest if paid in full by December 31, 2010. If the  balance is not paid in full by that date, interest will be imposed from  the transaction date at a rate of 15%.''</p><p class="depth0">10. Relationship between Sec. Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(B) and  1026.6(b). A disclosure of the information described in Sec.  1026.9(c)(2)(v)(B)(1) provided in the account-opening table in  accordance with Sec. 1026.6(b) complies with the requirements of Sec.  1026.9(c)(2)(v)(B)(2), if the listing of the introductory rate in such  tabular disclosure also is the first listing as described in comment  9(c)(2)(v)-6.</p><p class="depth0">11. Disclosure of the terms of a workout or temporary hardship  arrangement. In order for the exception in Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(D) to  apply, the disclosure provided to the consumer pursuant to Sec.  1026.9(c)(2)(v)(D)(2) must set forth:</p><p class="depth0">i. The annual percentage rate that will apply to balances subject to  the workout or temporary hardship arrangement;</p><p class="depth0">ii. The annual percentage rate that will apply to such balances if  the consumer completes or fails to comply with the terms of, the workout  or temporary hardship arrangement;</p><p class="depth0">iii. Any reduced fee or charge of a type required to be disclosed  under Sec. 1026.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), (b)(2)(viii), (b)(2)(ix),  (b)(2)(xi), or (b)(2)(xii) that will apply to balances subject to the  workout or temporary hardship arrangement, as well as the fee or charge  that will apply if the consumer completes or fails to comply with the  terms of the workout or temporary hardship arrangement;</p><p class="depth0">iv. Any reduced minimum periodic payment that will apply to balances  subject to the workout or temporary hardship arrangement, as well as the  minimum periodic payment that will apply if the consumer completes or  fails to comply with the terms of the workout or temporary hardship  arrangement; and</p><p class="depth0">v. If applicable, that the consumer must make timely minimum  payments in order to remain eligible for the workout or temporary  hardship arrangement.</p><p class="depth0">12. Index not under creditor's control. See comment 55(b)(2)-2 for  guidance on when an index is deemed to be under a creditor's control.</p><p class="depth0">13. Temporary rates--relationship to Sec. 1026.59. i. General.  Section 1026.59 requires a card issuer to review rate increases imposed  due to the revocation of a temporary rate. In some circumstances, Sec.  1026.59 may require an issuer to reinstate a reduced temporary rate  based on that review. If, based on a review required by Sec. 1026.59, a  creditor reinstates a temporary rate that had been revoked, the card  issuer is not required to provide an additional notice to the consumer  when the reinstated temporary rate expires, if the card issuer provided  the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(B) prior to the  original commencement of the temporary rate. See Sec. 1026.55 and the  associated commentary for guidance on the permissibility and  applicability of rate increases.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Example. A consumer opens a new credit card account under an  open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan on January 1, 2011. The  annual percentage rate applicable to purchases is 18%. The card issuer  offers the consumer a 15% rate on purchases made between January 1, 2012  and January 1, 2014. Prior to January 1, 2012, the card issuer  discloses, in accordance with Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(B),   that the rate on purchases made during that period will increase to the  standard 18% rate on January 1, 2014. In March 2012, the consumer makes  a payment that is ten days late. The card issuer, upon providing 45  days' advance notice of the change under Sec. 1026.9(g), increases the  rate on new purchases to 18% effective as of June 1, 2012. On December  1, 2012, the issuer performs a review of the consumer's account in  accordance with Sec. 1026.59. Based on that review, the card issuer is  required to reduce the rate to the original 15% temporary rate as of  January 15, 2013. On January 1, 2014, the card issuer may increase the  rate on purchases to 18%, as previously disclosed prior to January 1,  2012, without providing an additional notice to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">9(d) Finance Charge Imposed at Time of Transaction</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure prior to imposition. A person imposing a finance  charge at the time of honoring a consumer's credit card must disclose  the amount of the charge, or an explanation of how the charge will be  determined, prior to its imposition. This must be disclosed before the  consumer becomes obligated for property or services that may be paid for  by use of a credit card. For example, disclosure must be given before  the consumer has dinner at a restaurant, stays overnight at a hotel, or  makes a deposit guaranteeing the purchase of property or services.</p><p class="depth0">9(e) Disclosures Upon Renewal of Credit or Charge Card</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. This paragraph applies to credit and charge card  accounts of the type subject to Sec. 1026.60. (See Sec. 1026.60(a)(5)  and the accompanying commentary for discussion of the types of accounts  subject to Sec. 1026.60.) The disclosure requirements are triggered  when a card issuer imposes any annual or other periodic fee on such an  account or if the card issuer has changed or amended any term of a  cardholder's account required to be disclosed under Sec. 1026.6(b)(1)  and (b)(2) that has not previously been disclosed to the consumer,  whether or not the card issuer originally was required to provide the  application and solicitation disclosures described in Sec. 1026.60.</p><p class="depth0">2. Form. The disclosures under this paragraph must be clear and  conspicuous, but need not appear in a tabular format or in a prominent  location. The disclosures need not be in a form the cardholder can  retain.</p><p class="depth0">3. Terms at renewal. Renewal notices must reflect the terms actually  in effect at the time of renewal. For example, a card issuer that offers  a preferential annual percentage rate to employees during their  employment must send a renewal notice to employees disclosing the lower  rate actually charged to employees (although the card issuer also may  show the rate charged to the general public).</p><p class="depth0">4. Variable rate. If the card issuer cannot determine the rate that  will be in effect if the cardholder chooses to renew a variable-rate  account, the card issuer may disclose the rate in effect at the time of  mailing or delivery of the renewal notice. Alternatively, the card  issuer may use the rate as of a specified date within the last 30 days  before the disclosure is provided.</p><p class="depth0">5. Renewals more frequent than annual. If a renewal fee is billed  more often than annually, the renewal notice should be provided each  time the fee is billed. In this instance, the fee need not be disclosed  as an annualized amount. Alternatively, the card issuer may provide the  notice no less than once every 12 months if the notice explains the  amount and frequency of the fee that will be billed during the time  period covered by the disclosure, and also discloses the fee as an  annualized amount. The notice under this alternative also must state the  consequences of a cardholder's decision to terminate the account after  the renewal-notice period has expired. For example, if a $2 fee is  billed monthly but the notice is given annually, the notice must inform  the cardholder that the monthly charge is $2, the annualized fee is $24,  and $2 will be billed to the account each month for the coming year  unless the cardholder notifies the card issuer. If the cardholder is  obligated to pay an amount equal to the remaining unpaid monthly charges  if the cardholder terminates the account during the coming year but  after the first month, the notice must disclose the fact.</p><p class="depth0">6. Terminating credit availability. Card issuers have some  flexibility in determining the procedures for how and when an account  may be terminated. However, the card issuer must clearly disclose the  time by which the cardholder must act to terminate the account to avoid  paying a renewal fee, if applicable. State and other applicable law  govern whether the card issuer may impose requirements such as  specifying that the cardholder's response be in writing or that the  outstanding balance be repaid in full upon termination.</p><p class="depth0">7. Timing of termination by cardholder. When a card issuer provides  notice under Sec. 1026.9(e)(1), a cardholder must be given at least 30  days or one billing cycle, whichever is less, from the date the notice  is mailed or delivered to make a decision whether to terminate an  account.</p><p class="depth0">8. Timing of notices. A renewal notice is deemed to be provided when  mailed or delivered. Similarly, notice of termination is deemed to be  given when mailed or delivered.</p><p class="depth0">9. Prompt reversal of renewal fee upon termination. In a situation  where a cardholder has provided timely notice of termination and a  renewal fee has been billed to a cardholder's   account, the card issuer must reverse or otherwise withdraw the fee  promptly. Once a cardholder has terminated an account, no additional  action by the cardholder may be required.</p><p class="depth0">10. Disclosure of changes in terms required to be disclosed pursuant  to Sec. 1026.6(b)(1) and (b)(2). Clear and conspicuous disclosure of a  changed term on a periodic statement provided to a consumer prior to  renewal of the consumer's account constitutes prior disclosure of that  term for purposes of Sec. 1026.9(e)(1). Card issuers should refer to  Sec. 1026.9(c)(2) for additional timing, content, and formatting  requirements that apply to certain changes in terms under that  paragraph.</p><p class="depth0">9(e)(2) Notification on Periodic Statements</p><p class="depth0">1. Combined disclosures. If a single disclosure is used to comply  with both Sec. Sec. 1026.9(e) and 1026.7, the periodic statement must  comply with the rules in Sec. Sec. 1026.60 and 1026.7. For example, a  description substantially similar to the heading describing the grace  period required by Sec. 1026.60(b)(5) must be used and the name of the  balance-calculation method must be identified (if listed in Sec.  1026.60(g)) to comply with the requirements of Sec. 1026.60. A card  issuer may include some of the renewal disclosures on a periodic  statement and others on a separate document so long as there is some  reference indicating that the disclosures relate to one another. All  renewal disclosures must be provided to a cardholder at the same time.</p><p class="depth0">2. Preprinted notices on periodic statements. A card issuer may  preprint the required information on its periodic statements. A card  issuer that does so, however, must make clear on the periodic statement  when the preprinted renewal disclosures are applicable. For example, the  card issuer could include a special notice (not preprinted) at the  appropriate time that the renewal fee will be billed in the following  billing cycle, or could show the renewal date as a regular (preprinted)  entry on all periodic statements.</p><p class="depth0">9(f) Change in Credit Card Account Insurance Provider</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. This paragraph applies to credit card accounts of the  type subject to Sec. 1026.60 if credit insurance (typically life,  disability, and unemployment insurance) is offered on the outstanding  balance of such an account. (Credit card accounts subject to Sec.  1026.9(f) are the same as those subject to Sec. 1026.9(e); see comment  9(e)-1.) Charge card accounts are not covered by this paragraph. In  addition, the disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply only where  the card issuer initiates the change in insurance provider. For example,  if the card issuer's current insurance provider is merged into or  acquired by another company, these disclosures would not be required.  Disclosures also need not be given in cases where card issuers pay for  credit insurance themselves and do not separately charge the cardholder.</p><p class="depth0">2. No increase in rate or decrease in coverage. The requirement to  provide the disclosure arises when the card issuer changes the provider  of insurance, even if there will be no increase in the premium rate  charged to the consumer and no decrease in coverage under the insurance  policy.</p><p class="depth0">3. Form of notice. If a substantial decrease in coverage will result  from the change in provider, the card issuer either must explain the  decrease or refer to an accompanying copy of the policy or group  certificate for details of the new terms of coverage. (See the  commentary to AppendixG-13 to part 1026.)</p><p class="depth0">4. Discontinuation of insurance. In addition to stating that the  cardholder may cancel the insurance, the card issuer may explain the  effect the cancellation would have on the consumer's credit card plan.</p><p class="depth0">5. Mailing by third party. Although the card issuer is responsible  for the disclosures, the insurance provider or another third party may  furnish the disclosures on the card issuer's behalf.</p><p class="depth0">9(f)(3) Substantial Decrease in Coverage</p><p class="depth0">1. Determination. Whether a substantial decrease in coverage will  result from the change in provider is determined by the two-part test in  Sec. 1026.9(f)(3): First, whether the decrease is in a significant term  of coverage; and second, whether the decrease might reasonably be  expected to affect a cardholder's decision to continue the insurance. If  both conditions are met, the decrease must be disclosed in the notice.</p><p class="depth0">9(g) Increase in Rates Due to Delinquency or Default or as a Penalty</p><p class="depth0">1. Relationship between Sec. 1026.9(c) and (g) and Sec. 1026.55-- examples. Card issuers subject to Sec. 1026.55 are prohibited from  increasing the annual percentage rate for a category of transactions on  any consumer credit card account unless specifically permitted by one of  the exceptions in Sec. 1026.55(b). See comments 55(a)-1 and 55(b)-3 and  the commentary to Sec. 1026.55(b)(4) for examples that illustrate the  relationship between the notice requirements of Sec. 1026.9(c) and (g)  and Sec. 1026.55.</p><p class="depth0">2. Affected consumers. If a single credit account involves multiple  consumers that may be affected by the change, the creditor should refer  to Sec. 1026.5(d) to determine the number of notices that must be  given.</p><p class="depth0">3. Combining a notice described in Sec. 1026.9(g)(3) with a notice  described in Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(iv). If a creditor is required to  provide notices pursuant to both Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(iv) and (g)(3) to a  consumer, the creditor may combine the two notices. This would occur  when penalty pricing has been   triggered, and other terms are changing on the consumer's account at the  same time.</p><p class="depth0">4. Content. Sample G-22 contains an example of how to comply with  the requirements in Sec. 1026.9(g)(3)(i) when the rate on a consumer's  credit card account is being increased to a penalty rate as described in  Sec. 1026.9(g)(1)(ii), based on a late payment that is not more than 60  days late. Sample G-23 contains an example of how to comply with the  requirements in Sec. 1026.9(g)(3)(i) when the rate increase is  triggered by a delinquency of more than 60 days.</p><p class="depth0">5.

See Sec. 1026.5(a)(2) for terminology requirements  applicable to disclosures required under Sec. 1026.9(g).</p><p class="depth0">7. Reasons for increase. See comment 9(c)(2)(iv)-11 for guidance on  disclosure of the reasons for a rate increase for a credit card account  under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan.</p><p class="depth0">9(g)(4) Exception for Decrease in Credit Limit</p><p class="depth0">1. The following illustrates the requirements of Sec. 1026.9(g)(4).  Assume that a creditor decreased the credit limit applicable to a  consumer's account and sent a notice pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(g)(4) on  January 1, stating among other things that the penalty rate would apply  if the consumer's balance exceeded the new credit limit as of February  16. If the consumer's balance exceeded the credit limit on February 16,  the creditor could impose the penalty rate on that date. However, a  creditor could not apply the penalty rate if the consumer's balance did  not exceed the new credit limit on February 16, even if the consumer's  balance had exceeded the new credit limit on several dates between  January 1 and February 15. If the consumer's balance did not exceed the  new credit limit on February 16 but the consumer conducted a transaction  on February 17 that caused the balance to exceed the new credit limit,  the general rule in Sec. 1026.9(g)(1)(ii) would apply and the creditor  would be required to give an additional 45 days' notice prior to  imposition of the penalty rate (but under these circumstances the  consumer would have no ability to cure the over-the-limit balance in  order to avoid penalty pricing).</p><p class="depth0">9(h) Consumer Rejection of Certain Significant Changes in Terms</p><p class="depth0">1. Circumstances in which Sec. 1026.9(h) does not apply. Section  1026.9(h) applies when Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(iv)(B) requires disclosure of  the consumer's right to reject a significant change to an account term.  Thus, for example, Sec. 1026.9(h) does not apply to changes to the  terms of home equity plans subject to the requirements of Sec. 1026.40  that are accessible by a credit or charge card because Sec.  1026.9(c)(2) does not apply to such plans. Similarly, Sec. 1026.9(h)  does not apply in the following circumstances because Sec.  1026.9(c)(2)(iv)(B) does not require disclosure of the right to reject  in those circumstances: (i) An increase in the required minimum periodic  payment; (ii) a change in an annual percentage rate applicable to a  consumer's account (such as changing the margin or index for calculating  a variable rate, changing from a variable rate to a non-variable rate,  or changing from a non-variable rate to a variable rate); (iii) a change  in the balance computation method necessary to comply with Sec.  1026.54; and (iv) when the change results from the creditor not  receiving the consumer's required minimum periodic payment within 60  days after the due date for that payment.</p><p class="depth0">9(h)(1) Right To Reject</p><p class="depth0">1. Reasonable requirements for submission of rejections. A creditor  may establish reasonable requirements for the submission of rejections  pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(h)(1). For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. It would be reasonable for a creditor to require that rejections  be made by the primary account holder and that the consumer identify the  account number.</p><p class="depth0">ii. It would be reasonable for a creditor to require that rejections  be made only using the toll-free telephone number disclosed pursuant to  Sec. 1026.9(c). It would also be reasonable for a creditor to designate  additional channels for the submission of rejections (such as an address  for rejections submitted by mail) so long as the creditor does not  require that rejections be submitted through such additional channels.</p><p class="depth0">iii. It would be reasonable for a creditor to require that  rejections be received before the effective date disclosed pursuant to  Sec. 1026.9(c) and to treat the account as not subject to Sec.  1026.9(h) if a rejection is received on or after that date. It would  not, however, be reasonable to require that rejections be submitted  earlier than the day before the effective date. If a creditor is unable  to process all rejections received before the effective date, the  creditor may delay implementation of the change in terms until all  rejections have been processed. In the alternative, the creditor could  implement the change on the effective date and then, on any account for  which a timely rejection was received, reverse the change and remove or  credit any interest charges or fees imposed as a result of the change.  For example, if the effective date for a change in terms is June 15 and  the creditor cannot process all rejections received by telephone on June  14 until June 16, the creditor may delay imposition of the change until  June 17. Alternatively, the   creditor could implement the change for all affected accounts on June 15  and then, once all rejections have been processed, return any account  for which a timely rejection was received to the prior terms and ensure  that the account is not assessed any additional interest or fees as a  result of the change or that the account is credited for such interest  or fees.</p><p class="depth0">2. Use of account following provision of notice. A consumer does not  waive or forfeit the right to reject a significant change in terms by  using the account for transactions prior to the effective date of the  change. Similarly, a consumer does not revoke a rejection by using the  account for transactions after the rejection is received.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 9(h)(2)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Termination or suspension of credit availability. Section  1026.9(h)(2)(ii) does not prohibit a creditor from terminating or  suspending credit availability as a result of the consumer's rejection  of a significant change in terms.</p><p class="depth0">2. Solely as a result of rejection. A creditor is prohibited from  imposing a fee or charge or treating an account as in default solely as  a result of the consumer's rejection of a significant change in terms.  For example, if credit availability is terminated or suspended as a  result of the consumer's rejection of a significant change in terms, a  creditor is prohibited from imposing a periodic fee that was not charged  before the consumer rejected the change (such as a closed account fee).  See also comment 55(d)-1. However, regardless of whether credit  availability is terminated or suspended as a result of the consumer's  rejection, a creditor is not prohibited from continuing to charge a  periodic fee that was charged before the rejection. Similarly, a  creditor that charged a fee for late payment before a change was  rejected is not prohibited from charging that fee after rejection of the  change.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 9(h)(2)(iii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Relevant date for repayment methods. Once a consumer has rejected  a significant change in terms, Sec. 1026.9(h)(2)(iii) prohibits the  creditor from requiring repayment of the balance on the account using a  method that is less beneficial to the consumer than one of the methods  listed in Sec. 1026.55(c)(2). When applying the methods listed in Sec.  1026.55(c)(2) pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(h)(2)(iii), a creditor may  utilize the date on which the creditor was notified of the rejection or  a later date (such as the date on which the change would have gone into  effect but for the rejection). For example, assume that on April 16 a  creditor provides a notice pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(c) informing the  consumer that the monthly maintenance fee for the account will increase  effective June 1. The notice also states that the consumer may reject  the increase by calling a specified toll-free telephone number before  June 1 but that, if the consumer does so, credit availability for the  account will be terminated. On May 5, the consumer calls the toll-free  number and exercises the right to reject. If the creditor chooses to  establish a five-year amortization period for the balance on the account  consistent with Sec. 1026.55(c)(2)(ii), that period may begin no  earlier than the date on which the creditor was notified of the  rejection (May 5). However, the creditor may also begin the amortization  period on the date on which the change would have gone into effect but  for the rejection (June 1).</p><p class="depth0">2. Balance on the account. i. In general. When applying the methods  listed in Sec. 1026.55(c)(2) pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(h)(2)(iii), the  provisions in Sec. 1026.55(c)(2) and the guidance in the commentary to  Sec. 1026.55(c)(2) regarding protected balances also apply to a balance  on the account subject to Sec. 1026.9(h)(2)(iii). If a creditor  terminates or suspends credit availability based on a consumer's  rejection of a significant change in terms, the balance on the account  that is subject to Sec. 1026.9(h)(2)(iii) is the balance at the end of  the day on which credit availability is terminated or suspended.  However, if a creditor does not terminate or suspend credit availability  based on the consumer's rejection, the balance on the account subject to  Sec. 1026.9(h)(2)(iii) is the balance at the end of the day on which  the creditor was notified of the rejection or, at the creditor's option,  a later date.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Example. Assume that on June 16 a creditor provides a notice  pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(c) informing the consumer that the annual fee  for the account will increase effective August 1. The notice also states  that the consumer may reject the increase by calling a specified toll- free telephone number before August 1 but that, if the consumer does so,  credit availability for the account will be terminated. On July 20, the  account has a purchase balance of $1,000 and the consumer calls the  toll-free number and exercises the right to reject. On July 22, a $200  purchase is charged to the account. If the creditor terminates credit  availability on July 25 as a result of the rejection, the balance  subject to the repayment limitations in Sec. 1026.9(h)(2)(iii) is the  $1,200 purchase balance at the end of the day on July 25. However, if  the creditor does not terminate credit availability as a result of the  rejection, the balance subject to the repayment limitations in Sec.  1026.9(h)(2)(iii) is the $1,000 purchase balance at the end of the day  on the date the creditor was notified of the rejection (July 20),  although the creditor may, at its option, treat the $200 purchase as  part of the balance subject to Sec. 1026.9(h)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">9(h)(3) Exception</p><p class="depth0">1. Examples. Section 1026.9(h)(3) provides that Sec. 1026.9(h) does  not apply when the creditor has not received the consumer's required  minimum periodic payment within 60 days after the due date for that  payment. The following examples illustrate the application of this  exception:</p><p class="depth0">i. Account becomes more than 60 days delinquent before notice  provided. Assume that a credit card account is opened on January 1 of  year one and that the payment due date for the account is the fifteenth  day of the month. On June 20 of year two, the creditor has not received  the required minimum periodic payments due on April 15, May 15, and June  15. On June 20, the creditor provides a notice pursuant to Sec.  1026.9(c) informing the consumer that a monthly maintenance fee of $10  will be charged beginning on August 4. However, Sec.  1026.9(c)(2)(iv)(B) does not require the creditor to notify the consumer  of the right to reject because the creditor has not received the April  15 minimum payment within 60 days after the due date. Furthermore, the  exception in Sec. 1026.9(h)(3) applies and the consumer may not reject  the fee.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Account becomes more than 60 days delinquent after rejection.  Assume that a credit card account is opened on January 1 of year one and  that the payment due date for the account is the fifteenth day of the  month. On April 20 of year two, the creditor has not received the  required minimum periodic payment due on April 15. On April 20, the  creditor provides a notice pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(c) informing the  consumer that an annual fee of $100 will be charged beginning on June 4.  The notice further states that the consumer may reject the fee by  calling a specified toll-free telephone number before June 4 but that,  if the consumer does so, credit availability for the account will be  terminated. On May 5, the consumer calls the toll-free telephone number  and rejects the fee. Section 1026.9(h)(2)(i) prohibits the creditor from  charging the $100 fee to the account. If, however, the creditor does not  receive the minimum payments due on April 15 and May 15 by June 15,  Sec. 1026.9(h)(3) permits the creditor to charge the $100 fee. The  creditor must provide a second notice of the fee pursuant to Sec.  1026.9(c), but Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(iv)(B) does not require the creditor  to disclose the right to reject and Sec. 1026.9(h)(3) does not allow  the consumer to reject the fee. Similarly, the restrictions in Sec.  1026.9(h)(2)(ii) and (iii) no longer apply.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.10--Payments</p><p class="depth0">10(a) General Rule.</p><p class="depth0">1. Crediting date. Section 1026.10(a) does not require the creditor  to post the payment to the consumer's account on a particular date; the  creditor is only required to credit the payment as of the date of  receipt.</p><p class="depth0">2. Date of receipt. The ``date of receipt'' is the date that the  payment instrument or other means of completing the payment reaches the  creditor. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Payment by check is received when the creditor gets it, not when  the funds are collected.</p><p class="depth0">ii. In a payroll deduction plan in which funds are deposited to an  asset account held by the creditor, and from which payments are made  periodically to an open-end credit account, payment is received on the  date when it is debited to the asset account (rather than on the date of  the deposit), provided the payroll deduction method is voluntary and the  consumer retains use of the funds until the contractual payment date.</p><p class="depth0">iii. If the consumer elects to have payment made by a third party  payor such as a financial institution, through a preauthorized payment  or telephone bill-payment arrangement, payment is received when the  creditor gets the third party payor's check or other transfer medium,  such as an electronic fund transfer, as long as the payment meets the  creditor's requirements as specified under Sec. 1026.10(b).</p><p class="depth0">iv. Payment made via the creditor's Web site is received on the date  on which the consumer authorizes the creditor to effect the payment,  even if the consumer gives the instruction authorizing that payment in  advance of the date on which the creditor is authorized to effect the  payment. If the consumer authorizes the creditor to effect the payment  immediately, but the consumer's instruction is received after 5 p.m. or  any later cut-off time specified by the creditor, the date on which the  consumer authorizes the creditor to effect the payment is deemed to be  the next business day.</p><p class="depth0">10(b) Specific Requirements for Payments</p><p class="depth0">1. Payment by electronic fund transfer. A creditor may be prohibited  from specifying payment by preauthorized electronic fund transfer. (See  Section 913 of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Payment methods promoted by creditor. If a creditor promotes a  specific payment method, any payments made via that method (prior to any  cut-off time specified by the creditor, to the extent permitted by Sec.  1026.10(b)(2)) are generally conforming payments for purposes of Sec.  1026.10(b). For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. If a creditor promotes electronic payment via its Web site (such  as by disclosing on the Web site itself that payments may be made via  the Web site), any payments made via the creditor's Web site prior to  the creditor's specified cut-off time, if any, would generally be  conforming payments for purposes of Sec. 1026.10(b).</p><p class="depth0">ii. If a creditor promotes payment by telephone (for example, by  including the option to pay by telephone in a menu of options provided  to consumers at a toll-free number disclosed on its periodic statement),  payments made by telephone would generally be conforming payments for  purposes of Sec. 1026.10(b).</p><p class="depth0">iii. If a creditor promotes in-person payments, for example by  stating in an advertisement that payments may be made in person at its  branch locations, such in-person payments made at a branch or office of  the creditor generally would be conforming payments for purposes of  Sec. 1026.10(b).</p><p class="depth0">iv. If a creditor promotes that payments may be made through an  unaffiliated third party, such as by disclosing the Web site address of  that third party on the periodic statement, payments made via that third  party's Web site generally would be conforming payments for purposes of  Sec. 1026.10(b). In contrast, if a customer service representative of  the creditor confirms to a consumer that payments may be made via an  unaffiliated third party, but the creditor does not otherwise promote  that method of payment, Sec. 1026.10(b) permits the creditor to treat  payments made via such third party as nonconforming payments in  accordance with Sec. 1026.10(b)(4).</p><p class="depth0">3. Acceptance of nonconforming payments. If the creditor accepts a  nonconforming payment (for example, payment mailed to a branch office,  when the creditor had specified that payment be sent to a different  location), finance charges may accrue for the period between receipt and  crediting of payments.</p><p class="depth0">4. Implied guidelines for payments. In the absence of specified  requirements for making payments (see Sec. 1026.10(b)):</p><p class="depth0">i. Payments may be made at any location where the creditor conducts  business.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Payments may be made any time during the creditor's normal  business hours.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Payment may be by cash, money order, draft, or other similar  instrument in properly negotiable form, or by electronic fund transfer  if the creditor and consumer have so agreed.</p><p class="depth0">5. Payments made at point of sale. If a card issuer that is a  financial institution issues a credit card under an open-end (not home- secured) consumer credit plan that can be used only for transactions  with a particular merchant or merchants or a credit card that is  cobranded with the name of a particular merchant or merchants, and a  consumer is able to make a payment on that credit card account at a  retail location maintained by such a merchant, that retail location is  not considered to be a branch or office of the card issuer for purposes  of Sec. 1026.10(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0">6. In-person payments on credit card accounts. For purposes of Sec.  1026.10(b)(3), payments made in person at a branch or office of a  financial institution include payments made with the direct assistance  of, or to, a branch or office employee, for example a teller at a bank  branch. A payment made at the bank branch without the direct assistance  of a branch or office employee, for example a payment placed in a branch  or office mail slot, is not a payment made in person for purposes of  Sec. 1026.10(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0">7. In-person payments at affiliate of card issuer. If an affiliate  of a card issuer that is a financial institution shares a name with the  card issuer, such as ``ABC,'' and accepts in-person payments on the card  issuer's credit card accounts, those payments are subject to the  requirements of Sec. 1026.10(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0">10(d) Crediting of Payments When Creditor Does Not Receive or Accept</p><p class="depth0">Payments on Due Date</p><p class="depth0">1. Example. A day on which the creditor does not receive or accept  payments by mail may occur, for example, if the U.S. Postal Service does  not deliver mail on that date.</p><p class="depth0">2. Treating a payment as late for any purpose. See comment  5(b)(2)(ii)-2 for guidance on treating a payment as late for any  purpose. When an account is not eligible for a grace period, imposing a  finance charge due to a periodic interest rate does not constitute  treating a payment as late.</p><p class="depth0">10(e) Limitations on Fees Related to Method of Payment</p><p class="depth0">1. Separate fee to allow consumers to make a payment. For purposes  of Sec. 1026.10(e), the term ``separate fee'' means a fee imposed on a  consumer for making a payment to the consumer's account. A fee or other  charge imposed if payment is made after the due date, such as a late fee  or finance charge, is not a separate fee to allow consumers to make a  payment for purposes of Sec. 1026.10(e).</p><p class="depth0">2. Expedited. For purposes of Sec. 1026.10(e), the term  ``expedited'' means crediting a payment the same day or, if the payment  is received after any cut-off time established by the creditor, the next  business day.</p><p class="depth0">3. Service by a customer service representative. Service by a  customer service representative of a creditor means any payment made to  the consumer's account with the assistance of a live representative or  agent of the creditor, including those made in person, on the telephone,  or by electronic means. A customer service representative does not  include automated means of making payment that do not involve a live  representative or agent of the creditor, such as a voice response unit  or interactive voice response system. Service by a customer service  representative includes any payment transaction which involves the  assistance of a live representative or agent of the creditor, even if an  automated system is required for a portion of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">4. Creditor. For purposes of Sec. 1026.10(e), the term ``creditor''  includes a third party that collects, receives, or processes payments on  behalf of a creditor. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that a creditor uses a service provider to receive,  collect, or process on the creditor's behalf payments made through the  creditor's Web site or made through an automated telephone payment  service. In these circumstances, the service provider would be  considered a creditor for purposes of paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume that a consumer pays a fee to a money transfer or payment  service in order to transmit a payment to the creditor on the consumer's  behalf. In these circumstances, the money transfer or payment service  would not be considered a creditor for purposes of paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Assume that a consumer has a checking account at a depository  institution. The consumer makes a payment to the creditor from the  checking account using a bill payment service provided by the depository  institution. In these circumstances, the depository institution would  not be considered a creditor for purposes of paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0">10(f) Changes by Card Issuer</p><p class="depth0">1. Address for receiving payment. For purposes of Sec. 1026.10(f),  ``address for receiving payment'' means a mailing address for receiving  payment, such as a post office box, or the address of a branch or office  at which payments on credit card accounts are accepted.</p><p class="depth0">2. Materiality. For purposes of Sec. 1026.10(f), a ``material  change'' means any change in the address for receiving payment or  procedures for handling cardholder payments which causes a material  delay in the crediting of a payment. ``Material delay'' means any delay  in crediting payment to a consumer's account which would result in a  late payment and the imposition of a late fee or finance charge. A delay  in crediting a payment which does not result in a late fee or finance  charge would be immaterial.</p><p class="depth0">3. Safe harbor. i. General. A card issuer may elect not to impose a  late fee or finance charge on a consumer's account for the 60-day period  following a change in address for receiving payment or procedures for  handling cardholder payments which could reasonably be expected to cause  a material delay in crediting of a payment to the consumer's account.  For purposes of Sec. 1026.10(f), a late fee or finance charge is not  imposed if the fee or charge is waived or removed, or an amount equal to  the fee or charge is credited to the account.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Retail location. For a material change in the address of a  retail location or procedures for handling cardholder payments at a  retail location, a card issuer may impose a late fee or finance charge  on a consumer's account for a late payment during the 60-day period  following the date on which the change took effect. However, if a card  issuer is notified by a consumer no later than 60 days after the card  issuer transmitted the first periodic statement that reflects the late  fee or finance charge for a late payment that the late payment was  caused by such change, the card issuer must waive or remove any late fee  or finance charge, or credit an amount equal to any late fee or finance  charge, imposed on the account during the 60-day period following the  date on which the change took effect.</p><p class="depth0">4. Examples. i. A card issuer changes the mailing address for  receiving payments by mail from a five-digit postal zip code to a nine- digit postal zip code. A consumer mails a payment using the five-digit  postal zip code. The change in mailing address is immaterial and it does  not cause a delay. Therefore, a card issuer may impose a late fee or  finance charge for a late payment on the account.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A card issuer changes the mailing address for receiving payments  by mail from one post office box number to another post office box  number. For a 60-day period following the change, the card issuer  continues to use both post office box numbers for the collection of  payments received by mail. The change in mailing address would not cause  a material delay in crediting a payment because payments would be  received and credited at both addresses. Therefore, a card issuer may  impose a late fee or finance charge for a late payment on the account  during the 60-day period following the date on which the change took  effect.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Same facts as paragraph ii above, except the prior post office  box number is no longer valid and mail sent to that address during the  60-day period following the change would be returned to sender. The  change in mailing address is material and the change could cause a  material delay in the crediting of a payment because a payment sent to  the old address could be delayed past the due date. If, as a result, a  consumer makes a late payment on the account during the 60-day period  following the date on which the change took effect, a card issuer may  not impose any late fee or finance charge for the late payment.</p><p class="depth0">iv. A card issuer permanently closes a local branch office at which  payments are accepted on credit card accounts. The permanent closing of  the local branch office is a material change in address for receiving  payment. Relying on the safe harbor, the card issuer elects not to  impose a late fee or finance charge for the 60-day period following the  local branch closing for late payments on consumer accounts which the  issuer reasonably determines are associated with the local branch and  which could reasonably be expected to have been caused by the branch  closing.</p><p class="depth0">v. A consumer has elected to make payments automatically to a credit  card account, such as through a payroll deduction plan or a third party  payor's preauthorized payment arrangement. A card issuer changes the  procedures for handling such payments and as a result, a payment is  delayed and not credited to the consumer's account before the due date.  In these circumstances, a card issuer may not impose any late fee or  finance charge during the 60-day period following the date on which the  change took effect for a late payment on the account.</p><p class="depth0">vi. A card issuer no longer accepts payments in person at a retail  location as a conforming method of payment, which is a material change  in the procedures for handling cardholder payment. In the 60-day period  following the date on which the change took effect, a consumer attempts  to make a payment in person at a retail location of a card issuer. As a  result, the consumer makes a late payment and the issuer charges a late  fee on the consumer's account. The consumer notifies the card issuer of  the late fee for the late payment which was caused by the material  change. In order to comply with Sec. 1026.10(f), the card issuer must  waive or remove the late fee or finance charge, or credit the consumer's  account in an amount equal to the late fee or finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">5. Finance charge due to periodic interest rate. When an account is  not eligible for a grace period, imposing a finance charge due to a  periodic interest rate does not constitute imposition of a finance  charge for a late payment for purposes of Sec. 1026.10(f).</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.11--Treatment of Credit Balances; Account Termination</p><p class="depth0">11(a) Credit Balances</p><p class="depth0">1. Timing of refund. The creditor may also fulfill its obligations  under Sec. 1026.11 by:</p><p class="depth0">i. Refunding any credit balance to the consumer immediately.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Refunding any credit balance prior to receiving a written  request (under Sec. 1026.11(a)(2)) from the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Refunding any credit balance upon the consumer's oral or  electronic request.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Making a good faith effort to refund any credit balance before 6  months have passed.

The phrases any part of the remaining credit  balance in Sec. 1026.11(a)(2) and any part of the credit balance  remaining in the account in Sec. 1026.11(a)(3) mean the amount of the  credit balance at the time the creditor is required to make the refund.

This includes, if necessary, attempts to trace the  consumer through the consumer's last known address or telephone number,  or both.</p><p class="depth0">2. Good faith effort unsuccessful. Section 1026.11 imposes no  further duties on the creditor if a good faith effort to return the  balance is unsuccessful. The ultimate disposition of the credit balance  (or any credit balance of $1 or less) is to be determined under other  applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">11(b) Account Termination</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 11(b)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Expiration date. The credit agreement determines whether or not  an open-end plan has a stated expiration (maturity) date. Creditors that  offer accounts with no stated expiration date are prohibited from  terminating those accounts solely because a consumer does not incur a  finance charge, even if credit cards or other access devices associated  with the account expire after a stated period. Creditors may still  terminate such accounts for inactivity consistent with Sec.  1026.11(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">11(c) Timely Settlement of Estate Debts</p><p class="depth0">1. Administrator of an estate. For purposes of Sec. 1026.11(c), the  term ``administrator'' means an administrator, executor, or any personal  representative of an estate who is authorized to act on behalf of the  estate.</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples. The following are examples of reasonable procedures  that satisfy this rule:</p><p class="depth0">i. A card issuer may decline future transactions and terminate the  account upon receiving reasonable notice of the consumer's death.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A card issuer may credit the account for fees and charges  imposed after the date of receiving reasonable notice of the consumer's  death.</p><p class="depth0">iii. A card issuer may waive the estate's liability for all charges  made to the account after receiving reasonable notice of the consumer's  death.</p><p class="depth0">iv. A card issuer may authorize an agent to handle matters in  accordance with the requirements of this rule.</p><p class="depth0">v. A card issuer may require administrators of an estate to provide  documentation indicating authority to act on behalf of the estate.</p><p class="depth0">vi. A card issuer may establish or designate a department, business  unit, or communication channel for administrators, such as a specific  mailing address or toll-free number, to handle matters in accordance  with the requirements of this rule.</p><p class="depth0">vii. A card issuer may direct administrators, who call a general  customer service toll-free number or who send correspondence by mail to  an address for general correspondence, to an appropriate customer  service representative, department, business unit, or communication  channel to handle matters in accordance with the requirements of this  rule.</p><p class="depth0">2. Request by an administrator of an estate. A card issuer may  receive a request for the amount of the balance on a deceased consumer's  account in writing or by telephone call from the administrator of an  estate. If a request is made in writing, such as by mail, the request is  received on the date the card issuer receives the correspondence.</p><p class="depth0">3. Timely statement of balance. A card issuer must disclose the  balance on a deceased consumer's account, upon request by the  administrator of the decedent's estate. A card issuer may provide the  amount, if any, by a written statement or by telephone. This does not  preclude a card issuer from providing the balance amount to appropriate  persons, other than the administrator, such as the spouse or a relative  of the decedent, who indicate that they may pay any balance. This  provision does not relieve card issuers of the requirements to provide a  periodic statement, under Sec. 1026.5(b)(2). A periodic statement,  under Sec. 1026.5(b)(2), may satisfy the requirements of Sec.  1026.11(c)(2), if provided within 30 days of receiving a request by an  administrator of the estate.</p><p class="depth0">4. Imposition of fees and interest charges. Section 1026.11(c)(3)  does not prohibit a card issuer from imposing fees and finance charges  due to a periodic interest rate based on balances for days that precede  the date on which the card issuer receives a request pursuant to Sec.  1026.11(c)(2). For example, if the last day of the billing cycle is June  30 and the card issuer receives a request pursuant to Sec.  1026.11(c)(2) on June 25, the card issuer may charge interest that  accrued prior to June 25.</p><p class="depth0">5. Example. A card issuer receives a request from an administrator  for the amount of the balance on a deceased consumer's account on March  1. The card issuer discloses to the administrator on March 25 that the  balance is $1,000. If the card issuer receives payment in full of the  $1,000 on April 24, the card issuer must waive or rebate any additional  interest that accrued on the $1,000 balance between March 25 and April  24. If the card issuer receives a payment of $1,000 on April 25, the  card issuer is not required to waive or rebate interest charges on the  $1,000 balance in respect of the period between March 25 and April 25.  If the card issuer receives a partial payment of $500 on April 24, the  card issuer is not required to waive or rebate interest charges on the  $1,000 balance in respect of the period between March 25 and April 25.</p><p class="depth0">6. Application to joint accounts. A card issuer may impose fees and  charges on an account of a deceased consumer if a joint accountholder  remains on the account. If only an authorized user remains on the  account of a deceased consumer, however, then a card issuer may not  impose fees and charges.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.12--Special Credit Card Provisions</p><p class="depth0">1. Scope. Sections 1026.12(a) and (b) deal with the issuance and  liability rules for credit cards, whether the card is intended for  consumer, business, or any other purposes. Sections 1026.12(a) and (b)  are exceptions to the general rule that the regulation applies only to  consumer credit. (See Sec. Sec. 1026.1 and 1026.3.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Definition of ``accepted credit card''. For purposes of this  section, ``accepted credit card'' means any credit card that a  cardholder has requested or applied for and received, or has signed,  used, or authorized another person to use to obtain credit. Any credit  card issued as a renewal or substitute in accordance with Sec.  1026.12(a) becomes an accepted credit card when received by the  cardholder.</p><p class="depth0">12(a) Issuance of Credit Cards</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 12(a)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Explicit request. A request or application for a card must be  explicit. For example, a request for an overdraft plan tied to a  checking account does not constitute an application for a credit card  with overdraft checking features.</p><p class="depth0">2. Addition of credit features. If the consumer has a non-credit  card, the addition of credit features to the card (for example, the  granting of overdraft privileges on a checking account when the consumer  already has a check guarantee card) constitutes issuance of a credit  card.</p><p class="depth0">3. Variance of card from request. The request or application need  not correspond exactly to the card that is issued. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. The name of the card requested may be different when issued.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The card may have features in addition to those reflected in the  request or application.</p><p class="depth0">4. Permissible form of request. The request or application may be  oral (in response to a telephone solicitation by a card issuer, for  example) or written.</p><p class="depth0">5. Time of issuance. A credit card may be issued in response to a  request made before any cards are ready for issuance (for example, if a  new program is established), even if there is some delay in issuance.</p><p class="depth0">6. Persons to whom cards may be issued. A card issuer may issue a  credit card to the person who requests it, and to anyone else for whom  that person requests a card and who will be an authorized user on the  requester's account. In other words, cards may be sent to consumer A on  A's request, and also (on A's request) to consumers B and C, who will be  authorized users on A's account. In these circumstances, the following  rules apply:</p><p class="depth0">i. The additional cards may be imprinted in either A's name or in  the names of B and C.</p><p class="depth0">ii. No liability for unauthorized use (by persons other than B and  C), not even the $50, may be imposed on B or C since they are merely  users and not cardholders as that term is defined in Sec. 1026.2 and  used in Sec. 1026.12(b); of course, liability of up to $50 for  unauthorized use of B's and C's cards may be imposed on A.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Whether B and C may be held liable for their own use, or on the  account generally, is a matter of state or other applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">7. Issuance of non-credit cards. i. General. Under Sec.  1026.12(a)(1), a credit card cannot be issued except in response to a  request or an application. (See comment 2(a)(15)-2 for examples of cards  or devices that are and are not credit cards.) A non-credit card may be  sent on an unsolicited basis by an issuer that does not propose to  connect the card to any credit plan; a credit feature may be added to a  previously issued non-credit card only upon the consumer's specific  request.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Examples. A purchase-price discount card may be sent on an  unsolicited basis by an issuer that does not propose to connect the card  to any credit plan. An issuer demonstrates that it proposes to connect  the card to a credit plan by, for example, including promotional  materials about credit features or account agreements and disclosures  required by Sec. 1026.6. The issuer will violate the rule against  unsolicited issuance if, for example, at the time the card is sent a  credit plan can be accessed by the card or the recipient of the  unsolicited card has been preapproved for credit that the recipient can  access by contacting the issuer and activating the card.</p><p class="depth0">8. Unsolicited issuance of PINs. A card issuer may issue personal  identification numbers (PINs) to existing credit cardholders without a  specific request from the cardholders, provided the PINs cannot be used  alone to obtain credit. For example, the PINs may be necessary if  consumers wish to use their existing credit cards at automated teller  machines or at merchant locations with point of sale terminals that  require PINs.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 12(a)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Renewal. Renewal generally contemplates the regular replacement  of existing cards because of, for example, security reasons or new  technology or systems. It also includes the re-issuance of cards that  have been suspended temporarily, but does not include the opening of a  new account after a previous account was closed.</p><p class="depth0">2. Substitution--examples. Substitution encompasses the replacement  of one card with another because the underlying account relationship has  changed in some way--such as when the card issuer has:</p><p class="depth0">i. Changed its name.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Changed the name of the card.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Changed the credit or other features available on the account.  For example, the original card could be used to make purchases and  obtain cash advances at teller windows. The substitute card might be  usable, in addition, for obtaining cash advances through automated  teller machines. (If the substitute card constitutes an access device,  as defined in Regulation E, then the Regulation E issuance rules would  have to be followed.) The substitution of one card with another on an  unsolicited basis is not permissible, however, where in conjunction with  the substitution an additional credit card account is opened and the  consumer is able to make new purchases or advances under both the  original and the new account with the new card. For example, if a retail  card issuer replaces its credit card with a combined retailer/bank card,  each of the creditors maintains a separate account, and both accounts  can be accessed for new transactions by use of the new credit card, the  card cannot be provided to a consumer without solicitation.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Substituted a card user's name on the substitute card for the  cardholder's name appearing on the original card.</p><p class="depth0">v. Changed the merchant base, provided that the new card is honored  by at least one of the persons that honored the original card. However,  unless the change in the merchant base is the addition of an affiliate  of the existing merchant base, the substitution of a new card for  another on an unsolicited basis is not permissible where the account is  inactive. A credit card cannot be issued in these circumstances without  a request or application. For purposes of Sec. 1026.12(a), an account  is inactive if no credit has been extended and if the account has no  outstanding balance for the prior 24 months. (See Sec. 1026.11(b)(2).)</p><p class="depth0">3. Substitution--successor card issuer. Substitution also occurs  when a successor card issuer replaces the original card issuer (for  example, when a new card issuer purchases the accounts of the original  issuer and issues its own card to replace the original one). A  permissible substitution exists even if the   original issuer retains the existing receivables and the new card issuer  acquires the right only to future receivables, provided use of the  original card is cut off when use of the new card becomes possible.</p><p class="depth0">4. Substitution--non-credit-card plan. A credit card that replaces a  retailer's open-end credit plan not involving a credit card is not  considered a substitute for the retailer's plan--even if the consumer  used the retailer's plan. A credit card cannot be issued in these  circumstances without a request or application.</p><p class="depth0">5. One-for-one rule. An accepted card may be replaced by no more  than one renewal or substitute card. For example, the card issuer may  not replace a credit card permitting purchases and cash advances with  two cards, one for the purchases and another for the cash advances.</p><p class="depth0">6. One-for-one rule--exceptions. The regulation does not prohibit  the card issuer from:</p><p class="depth0">i. Replacing a debit/credit card with a credit card and another card  with only debit functions (or debit functions plus an associated  overdraft capability), since the latter card could be issued on an  unsolicited basis under Regulation E.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Replacing an accepted card with more than one renewal or  substitute card, provided that:</p><p class="depth0">A. No replacement card accesses any account not accessed by the  accepted card;</p><p class="depth0">B. For terms and conditions required to be disclosed under Sec.  1026.6, all replacement cards are issued subject to the same terms and  conditions, except that a creditor may vary terms for which no change in  terms notice is required under Sec. 1026.9(c); and</p><p class="depth0">C. Under the account's terms the consumer's total liability for  unauthorized use with respect to the account does not increase.</p><p class="depth0">7. Methods of terminating replaced card. The card issuer need not  physically retrieve the original card, provided the old card is voided  in some way, for example:</p><p class="depth0">i. The issuer includes with the new card a notification that the  existing card is no longer valid and should be destroyed immediately.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The original card contained an expiration date.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The card issuer, in order to preclude use of the card,  reprograms computers or issues instructions to authorization centers.</p><p class="depth0">8. Incomplete replacement. If a consumer has duplicate credit cards  on the same account (Card A--one type of bank credit card, for example),  the card issuer may not replace the duplicate cards with one Card A and  one Card B (Card B--another type of bank credit card) unless the  consumer requests Card B.</p><p class="depth0">9. Multiple entities. Where multiple entities share responsibilities  with respect to a credit card issued by one of them, the entity that  issued the card may replace it on an unsolicited basis, if that entity  terminates the original card by voiding it in some way, as described in  comment 12(a)(2)-7. The other entity or entities may not issue a card on  an unsolicited basis in these circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">12(b) Liability of Cardholder for Unauthorized Use</p><p class="depth0">1. Meaning of cardholder. For purposes of this provision, cardholder  includes any person (including organizations) to whom a credit card is  issued for any purpose, including business. When a corporation is the  cardholder, required disclosures should be provided to the corporation  (as opposed to an employee user).</p><p class="depth0">2. Imposing liability. A card issuer is not required to impose  liability on a cardholder for the unauthorized use of a credit card; if  the card issuer does not seek to impose liability, the issuer need not  conduct any investigation of the cardholder's claim.</p><p class="depth0">3. Reasonable investigation. If a card issuer seeks to impose  liability when a claim of unauthorized use is made by a cardholder, the  card issuer must conduct a reasonable investigation of the claim. In  conducting its investigation, the card issuer may reasonably request the  cardholder's cooperation. The card issuer may not automatically deny a  claim based solely on the cardholder's failure or refusal to comply with  a particular request, including providing an affidavit or filing a  police report; however, if the card issuer otherwise has no knowledge of  facts confirming the unauthorized use, the lack of information resulting  from the cardholder's failure or refusal to comply with a particular  request may lead the card issuer reasonably to terminate the  investigation. The procedures involved in investigating claims may  differ, but actions such as the following represent steps that a card  issuer may take, as appropriate, in conducting a reasonable  investigation:</p><p class="depth0">i. Reviewing the types or amounts of purchases made in relation to  the cardholder's previous purchasing pattern.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Reviewing where the purchases were delivered in relation to the  cardholder's residence or place of business.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Reviewing where the purchases were made in relation to where  the cardholder resides or has normally shopped.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Comparing any signature on credit slips for the purchases to the  signature of the cardholder or an authorized user in the card issuer's  records, including other credit slips.</p><p class="depth0">v. Requesting documentation to assist in the verification of the  claim.</p><p class="depth0">vi. Requiring a written, signed statement from the cardholder or  authorized user. For example, the creditor may include a signature line  on a billing rights form that the cardholder may send in to provide  notice of the claim. However, a creditor may not require the cardholder  to provide an affidavit   or signed statement under penalty of perjury as part of a reasonable  investigation.</p><p class="depth0">vii. Requesting a copy of a police report, if one was filed.</p><p class="depth0">viii. Requesting information regarding the cardholder's knowledge of  the person who allegedly used the card or of that person's authority to  do so.</p><p class="depth0">4. Checks that access a credit card account. The liability  provisions for unauthorized use under Sec. 1026.12(b)(1) only apply to  transactions involving the use of a credit card, and not if an  unauthorized transaction is made using a check accessing the credit card  account. However, the billing error provisions in Sec. 1026.13 apply to  both of these types of transactions.</p><p class="depth0">12(b)(1)(ii) Limitation on Amount</p><p class="depth0">1. Meaning of authority. Section 1026.12(b)(1)(i) defines  unauthorized use in terms of whether the user has actual, implied, or  apparent authority. Whether such authority exists must be determined  under state or other applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">2. Liability limits--dollar amounts. As a general rule, the  cardholder's liability for a series of unauthorized uses cannot exceed  either $50 or the value obtained through the unauthorized use before the  card issuer is notified, whichever is less.</p><p class="depth0">3. Implied or apparent authority. If a cardholder furnishes a credit  card and grants authority to make credit transactions to a person (such  as a family member or coworker) who exceeds the authority given, the  cardholder is liable for the transaction(s) unless the cardholder has  notified the creditor that use of the credit card by that person is no  longer authorized.</p><p class="depth0">4. Credit card obtained through robbery or fraud. An unauthorized  use includes, but is not limited to, a transaction initiated by a person  who has obtained the credit card from the consumer, or otherwise  initiated the transaction, through fraud or robbery.</p><p class="depth0">12(b)(2) Conditions of Liability</p><p class="depth0">1. Issuer's option not to comply. A card issuer that chooses not to  impose any liability on cardholders for unauthorized use need not comply  with the disclosure and identification requirements discussed in Sec.  1026.12(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 12(b)(2)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure of liability and means of notifying issuer. The  disclosures referred to in Sec. 1026.12(b)(2)(ii) may be given, for  example, with the initial disclosures under Sec. 1026.6, on the credit  card itself, or on periodic statements. They may be given at any time  preceding the unauthorized use of the card.</p><p class="depth0">2. Meaning of ``adequate notice.'' For purposes of this provision,  ``adequate notice'' means a printed notice to a cardholder that sets  forth clearly the pertinent facts so that the cardholder may reasonably  be expected to have noticed it and understood its meaning. The notice  may be given by any means reasonably assuring receipt by the cardholder.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 12(b)(2)(iii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Means of identifying cardholder or user. To fulfill the condition  set forth in Sec. 1026.12(b)(2)(iii), the issuer must provide some  method whereby the cardholder or the authorized user can be identified.  This could include, for example, a signature, photograph, or fingerprint  on the card or other biometric means, or electronic or mechanical  confirmation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Identification by magnetic strip. Unless a magnetic strip (or  similar device not readable without physical aids) must be used in  conjunction with a secret code or the like, it would not constitute  sufficient means of identification. Sufficient identification also does  not exist if a ``pool'' or group card, issued to a corporation and  signed by a corporate agent who will not be a user of the card, is  intended to be used by another employee for whom no means of  identification is provided.</p><p class="depth0">3. Transactions not involving card. The cardholder may not be held  liable under Sec. 1026.12(b) when the card itself (or some other  sufficient means of identification of the cardholder) is not presented.  Since the issuer has not provided a means to identify the user under  these circumstances, the issuer has not fulfilled one of the conditions  for imposing liability. For example, when merchandise is ordered by  telephone or the Internet by a person without authority to do so, using  a credit card account number by itself or with other information that  appears on the card (for example, the card expiration date and a 3- or  4-digit cardholder identification number), no liability may be imposed  on the cardholder.</p><p class="depth0">12(b)(3) Notification to Card Issuer</p><p class="depth0">1. How notice must be provided. Notice given in a normal business  manner--for example, by mail, telephone, or personal visit--is effective  even though it is not given to, or does not reach, some particular  person within the issuer's organization. Notice also may be effective  even though it is not given at the address or phone number disclosed by  the card issuer under Sec. 1026.12(b)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">2. Who must provide notice. Notice of loss, theft, or possible  unauthorized use need not be initiated by the cardholder. Notice is  sufficient so long as it gives the ``pertinent information'' which would  include the name or card number of the cardholder and an indication that  unauthorized use has or may have occurred.</p><p class="depth0">3. Relationship to Sec. 1026.13. The liability protections afforded  to cardholders in Sec. 1026.12   do not depend upon the cardholder's following the error resolution  procedures in Sec. 1026.13. For example, the written notification and  time limit requirements of Sec. 1026.13 do not affect the Sec. 1026.12  protections. (See also comment 12(b)-4.)</p><p class="depth0">12(b)(5) Business Use of Credit Cards</p><p class="depth0">1. Agreement for higher liability for business use cards. The card  issuer may not rely on Sec. 1026.12(b)(5) if the business is clearly  not in a position to provide 10 or more cards to employees (for example,  if the business has only 3 employees). On the other hand, the issuer  need not monitor the personnel practices of the business to make sure  that it has at least 10 employees at all times.</p><p class="depth0">2. Unauthorized use by employee. The protection afforded to an  employee against liability for unauthorized use in excess of the limits  set in Sec. 1026.12(b) applies only to unauthorized use by someone  other than the employee. If the employee uses the card in an  unauthorized manner, the regulation sets no restriction on the  employee's potential liability for such use.</p><p class="depth0">12(c) Right of Cardholder To Assert Claims or Defenses Against Card</p><p class="depth0">Issuer</p><p class="depth0">1. Relationship to Sec. 1026.13. The Sec. 1026.12(c) credit card  ``holder in due course'' provision deals with the consumer's right to  assert against the card issuer a claim or defense concerning property or  services purchased with a credit card, if the merchant has been  unwilling to resolve the dispute. Even though certain merchandise  disputes, such as non-delivery of goods, may also constitute ``billing  errors'' under Sec. 1026.13, that section operates independently of  Sec. 1026.12(c). The cardholder whose asserted billing error involves  undelivered goods may institute the error resolution procedures of Sec.  1026.13; but whether or not the cardholder has done so, the cardholder  may assert claims or defenses under Sec. 1026.12(c). Conversely, the  consumer may pay a disputed balance and thus have no further right to  assert claims and defenses, but still may assert a billing error if  notice of that billing error is given in the proper time and manner. An  assertion that a particular transaction resulted from unauthorized use  of the card could also be both a ``defense'' and a billing error.</p><p class="depth0">2. Claims and defenses assertible. Section 1026.12(c) merely  preserves the consumer's right to assert against the card issuer any  claims or defenses that can be asserted against the merchant. It does  not determine what claims or defenses are valid as to the merchant; this  determination must be made under state or other applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">3. Transactions excluded. Section 1026.12(c) does not apply to the  use of a check guarantee card or a debit card in connection with an  overdraft credit plan, or to a check guarantee card used in connection  with cash-advance checks.</p><p class="depth0">4. Method of calculating the amount of credit outstanding. The  amount of the claim or defense that the cardholder may assert shall not  exceed the amount of credit outstanding for the disputed transaction at  the time the cardholder first notifies the card issuer or the person  honoring the credit card of the existence of the claim or defense.  However, when a consumer has asserted a claim or defense against a  creditor pursuant to Sec. 1026.12(c), the creditor must apply any  payment or other credit in a manner that avoids or minimizes any  reduction in the amount subject to that claim or defense. Accordingly,  to determine the amount of credit outstanding for purposes of this  section, payments and other credits must be applied first to amounts  other than the disputed transaction.</p><p class="depth0">i. For examples of how to comply with Sec. Sec. 1026.12 and 1026.53  for credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer  credit plan, see comment 53-3.</p><p class="depth0">ii. For other types of credit card accounts, creditors may, at their  option, apply payments consistent with Sec. 1026.53 and comment 53-3.  In the alternative, payments and other credits may be applied to: Late  charges in the order of entry to the account; then to finance charges in  the order of entry to the account; and then to any debits other than the  transaction subject to the claim or defense in the order of entry to the  account. In these circumstances, if more than one item is included in a  single extension of credit, credits are to be distributed pro rata  according to prices and applicable taxes.</p><p class="depth0">12(c)(1) General Rule</p><p class="depth0">1. Situations excluded and included. The consumer may assert claims  or defenses only when the goods or services are ``purchased with the  credit card.'' This could include mail, the Internet or telephone  orders, if the purchase is charged to the credit card account. But it  would exclude:</p><p class="depth0">i. Use of a credit card to obtain a cash advance, even if the  consumer then uses the money to purchase goods or services. Such a  transaction would not involve ``property or services purchased with the  credit card.''</p><p class="depth0">ii. The purchase of goods or services by use of a check accessing an  overdraft account and a credit card used solely for identification of  the consumer. (On the other hand, if the credit card is used to make  partial payment for the purchase and not merely for identification, the  right to assert claims or defenses would apply to credit extended via  the credit card, although not to the credit extended on the overdraft  line.)</p><p class="depth0">iii. Purchases made by use of a check guarantee card in conjunction  with a cash advance check (or by cash advance checks alone). (See  comment 12(c)-3.) A cash advance   check is a check that, when written, does not draw on an asset account;  instead, it is charged entirely to an open-end credit account.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Purchases effected by use of either a check guarantee card or a  debit card when used to draw on overdraft credit plans. (See comment  12(c)-3.) The debit card exemption applies whether the card accesses an  asset account via point of sale terminals, automated teller machines, or  in any other way, and whether the card qualifies as an ``access device''  under Regulation E or is only a paper based debit card. If a card serves  both as an ordinary credit card and also as check guarantee or debit  card, a transaction will be subject to this rule on asserting claims and  defenses when used as an ordinary credit card, but not when used as a  check guarantee or debit card.</p><p class="depth0">12(c)(2) Adverse Credit Reports Prohibited</p><p class="depth0">1. Scope of prohibition. Although an amount in dispute may not be  reported as delinquent until the matter is resolved:</p><p class="depth0">i. That amount may be reported as disputed.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Nothing in this provision prohibits the card issuer from  undertaking its normal collection activities for the delinquent and  undisputed portion of the account.</p><p class="depth0">2. Settlement of dispute. A card issuer may not consider a dispute  settled and report an amount disputed as delinquent or begin collection  of the disputed amount until it has completed a reasonable investigation  of the cardholder's claim. A reasonable investigation requires an  independent assessment of the cardholder's claim based on information  obtained from both the cardholder and the merchant, if possible. In  conducting an investigation, the card issuer may request the  cardholder's reasonable cooperation. The card issuer may not  automatically consider a dispute settled if the cardholder fails or  refuses to comply with a particular request. However, if the card issuer  otherwise has no means of obtaining information necessary to resolve the  dispute, the lack of information resulting from the cardholder's failure  or refusal to comply with a particular request may lead the card issuer  reasonably to terminate the investigation.</p><p class="depth0">12(c)(3) Limitations</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 12(c)(3)(i)(A)</p><p class="depth0">1. Resolution with merchant. The consumer must have tried to resolve  the dispute with the merchant. This does not require any special  procedures or correspondence between them, and is a matter for factual  determination in each case. The consumer is not required to seek  satisfaction from the manufacturer of the goods involved. When the  merchant is in bankruptcy proceedings, the consumer is not required to  file a claim in those proceedings, and may instead file a claim for the  property or service purchased with the credit card with the card issuer  directly.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 12(c)(3)(i)(B)</p><p class="depth0">1. Geographic limitation. The question of where a transaction occurs  (as in the case of mail, Internet, or telephone orders, for example) is  to be determined under state or other applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">12(c)(3)(ii) Exclusion</p><p class="depth0">1. Merchant honoring card. The exceptions (stated in Sec.  1026.12(c)(3)(ii)) to the amount and geographic limitations in Sec.  1026.12(c)(3)(i)(B) do not apply if the merchant merely honors, or  indicates through signs or advertising that it honors, a particular  credit card.</p><p class="depth0">12(d) Offsets by Card Issuer Prohibited</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 12(d)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Holds on accounts. ``Freezing'' or placing a hold on funds in the  cardholder's deposit account is the functional equivalent of an offset  and would contravene the prohibition in Sec. 1026.12(d)(1), unless done  in the context of one of the exceptions specified in Sec.  1026.12(d)(2). For example, if the terms of a security agreement  permitted the card issuer to place a hold on the funds, the hold would  not violate the offset prohibition. Similarly, if an order of a  bankruptcy court required the card issuer to turn over deposit account  funds to the trustee in bankruptcy, the issuer would not violate the  regulation by placing a hold on the funds in order to comply with the  court order.</p><p class="depth0">2. Funds intended as deposits. If the consumer tenders funds as a  deposit (to a checking account, for example), the card issuer may not  apply the funds to repay indebtedness on the consumer's credit card  account.</p><p class="depth0">3. Types of indebtedness; overdraft accounts. The offset prohibition  applies to any indebtedness arising from transactions under a credit  card plan, including accrued finance charges and other charges on the  account. The prohibition also applies to balances arising from  transactions not using the credit card itself but taking place under  plans that involve credit cards. For example, if the consumer writes a  check that accesses an overdraft line of credit, the resulting  indebtedness is subject to the offset prohibition since it is incurred  through a credit card plan, even though the consumer did not use an  associated check guarantee or debit card.</p><p class="depth0">4. When prohibition applies in case of termination of account. The  offset prohibition applies even after the card issuer terminates the  cardholder's credit card privileges, if the indebtedness was incurred  prior to termination. If the indebtedness was incurred   after termination, the prohibition does not apply.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 12(d)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Security interest--limitations. In order to qualify for the  exception stated in Sec. 1026.12(d)(2), a security interest must be  affirmatively agreed to by the consumer and must be disclosed in the  issuer's account-opening disclosures under Sec. 1026.6. The security  interest must not be the functional equivalent of a right of offset; as  a result, routinely including in agreements contract language indicating  that consumers are giving a security interest in any deposit accounts  maintained with the issuer does not result in a security interest that  falls within the exception in Sec. 1026.12(d)(2). For a security  interest to qualify for the exception under Sec. 1026.12(d)(2) the  following conditions must be met:</p><p class="depth0">i. The consumer must be aware that granting a security interest is a  condition for the credit card account (or for more favorable account  terms) and must specifically intend to grant a security interest in a  deposit account. Indicia of the consumer's awareness and intent include  at least one of the following (or a substantially similar procedure that  evidences the consumer's awareness and intent):</p><p class="depth0">A. Separate signature or initials on the agreement indicating that a  security interest is being given.</p><p class="depth0">B. Placement of the security agreement on a separate page, or  otherwise separating the security interest provisions from other  contract and disclosure provisions.</p><p class="depth0">C. Reference to a specific amount of deposited funds or to a  specific deposit account number.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The security interest must be obtainable and enforceable by  creditors generally. If other creditors could not obtain a security  interest in the consumer's deposit accounts to the same extent as the  card issuer, the security interest is prohibited by Sec. 1026.12(d)(2).</p><p class="depth0">2. Security interest--after-acquired property. As used in Sec.  1026.12(d)(2), the term ``security interest'' does not exclude (as it  does for other Regulation Z purposes) interests in after-acquired  property. Thus, a consensual security interest in deposit-account funds,  including funds deposited after the granting of the security interest  would constitute a permissible exception to the prohibition on offsets.</p><p class="depth0">3. Court order. If the card issuer obtains a judgment against the  cardholder, and if state and other applicable law and the terms of the  judgment do not so prohibit, the card issuer may offset the indebtedness  against the cardholder's deposit account.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 12(d)(3)</p><p class="depth0">1. Automatic payment plans--scope of exception. With regard to  automatic debit plans under Sec. 1026.12(d)(3), the following rules  apply:</p><p class="depth0">i. The cardholder's authorization must be in writing and signed or  initialed by the cardholder.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The authorizing language need not appear directly above or next  to the cardholder's signature or initials, provided it appears on the  same document and that it clearly spells out the terms of the automatic  debit plan.</p><p class="depth0">iii. If the cardholder has the option to accept or reject the  automatic debit feature (such option may be required under section 913  of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act), the fact that the option exists  should be clearly indicated.</p><p class="depth0">2. Automatic payment plans--additional exceptions. The following  practices are not prohibited by Sec. 1026.12(d)(1):</p><p class="depth0">i. Automatically deducting charges for participation in a program of  banking services (one aspect of which may be a credit card plan).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Debiting the cardholder's deposit account on the cardholder's  specific request rather than on an automatic periodic basis (for  example, a cardholder might check a box on the credit card bill stub,  requesting the issuer to debit the cardholder's account to pay that  bill).</p><p class="depth0">12(e) Prompt Notification of Returns and Crediting of Refunds</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 12(e)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Normal channels. The term normal channels refers to any network  or interchange system used for the processing of the original charge  slips (or equivalent information concerning the transaction).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 12(e)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Crediting account. The card issuer need not actually post the  refund to the consumer's account within three business days after  receiving the credit statement, provided that it credits the account as  of a date within that time period.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.13--Billing Error Resolution</p><p class="depth0">1. Creditor's failure to comply with billing error provisions.  Failure to comply with the error resolution procedures may result in the  forfeiture of disputed amounts as prescribed in section 161(e) of the  Act. (Any failure to comply may also be a violation subject to the  liability provisions of section 130 of the Act.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Charges for error resolution. If a billing error occurred,  whether as alleged or in a different amount or manner, the creditor may  not impose a charge related to any aspect of   the error resolution process (including charges for documentation or  investigation) and must credit the consumer's account if such a charge  was assessed pending resolution. Since the Act grants the consumer error  resolution rights, the creditor should avoid any chilling effect on the  good faith assertion of errors that might result if charges are assessed  when no billing error has occurred.</p><p class="depth0">13(a) Definition of Billing Error</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 13(a)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Actual, implied, or apparent authority. Whether use of a credit  card or open-end credit plan is authorized is determined by state or  other applicable law. (See comment 12(b)(1)(ii)-1.)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 13(a)(3)</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. i. Section 1026.13(a)(3) covers disputes about goods or  services that are ``not accepted'' or ``not delivered * * * as agreed'';  for example:</p><p class="depth0">A. The appearance on a periodic statement of a purchase, when the  consumer refused to take delivery of goods because they did not comply  with the contract.</p><p class="depth0">B. Delivery of property or services different from that agreed upon.</p><p class="depth0">C. Delivery of the wrong quantity.</p><p class="depth0">D. Late delivery.</p><p class="depth0">E. Delivery to the wrong location.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Section 1026.13(a)(3) does not apply to a dispute relating to  the quality of property or services that the consumer accepts. Whether  acceptance occurred is determined by state or other applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">2. Application to purchases made using a third-party payment  intermediary. Section 1026.13(a)(3) generally applies to disputes about  goods and services that are purchased using a third-party payment  intermediary, such as a person-to-person Internet payment service,  funded through use of a consumer's open-end credit plan when the goods  or services are not accepted by the consumer or not delivered to the  consumer as agreed. However, the extension of credit must be made at the  time the consumer purchases the good or service and match the amount of  the transaction to purchase the good or service (including ancillary  taxes and fees). Under these circumstances, the property or service for  which the extension of credit is made is not the payment service, but  rather the good or service that the consumer has purchased using the  payment service. Thus, for example, Sec. 1026.13(a)(3) would not apply  to purchases using a third party payment intermediary that is funded  through use of an open-end credit plan if:</p><p class="depth0">i. The extension of credit is made to fund the third-party payment  intermediary ``account,'' but the consumer does not contemporaneously  use those funds to purchase a good or service at that time.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The extension of credit is made to fund only a portion of the  purchase amount, and the consumer uses other sources to fund the  remaining amount.</p><p class="depth0">3. Notice to merchant not required. A consumer is not required to  first notify the merchant or other payee from whom he or she has  purchased goods or services and attempt to resolve a dispute regarding  the good or service before providing a billing-error notice to the  creditor under Sec. 1026.13(a)(3) asserting that the goods or services  were not accepted or delivered as agreed.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 13(a)(5)</p><p class="depth0">1. Computational errors. In periodic statements that are combined  with other information, the error resolution procedures are triggered  only if the consumer asserts a computational billing error in the  credit-related portion of the periodic statement. For example, if a bank  combines a periodic statement reflecting the consumer's credit card  transactions with the consumer's monthly checking statement, a  computational error in the checking account portion of the combined  statement is not a billing error.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 13(a)(6)</p><p class="depth0">1. Documentation requests. A request for documentation such as  receipts or sales slips, unaccompanied by an allegation of an error  under Sec. 1026.13(a) or a request for additional clarification under  Sec. 1026.13(a)(6), does not trigger the error resolution procedures.  For example, a request for documentation merely for purposes such as tax  preparation or recordkeeping does not trigger the error resolution  procedures.</p><p class="depth0">13(b) Billing Error Notice</p><p class="depth0">1. Withdrawal of billing error notice by consumer. The creditor need  not comply with the requirements of Sec. 1026.13(c) through (g) of this  section if the consumer concludes that no billing error occurred and  voluntarily withdraws the billing error notice. The consumer's  withdrawal of a billing error notice may be oral, electronic or written.</p><p class="depth0">2. Form of written notice. The creditor may require that the written  notice not be made on the payment medium or other material accompanying  the periodic statement if the creditor so stipulates in the billing  rights statement required by Sec. Sec. 1026.6(a)(5) or (b)(5)(iii), and  1026.9(a). In addition, if the creditor stipulates in the billing rights  statement that it accepts billing error notices submitted  electronically, and states the means by which a consumer may  electronically submit a billing error notice, a notice sent in such  manner will be deemed to satisfy the written notice requirement for  purposes of Sec. 1026.13(b).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 13(b)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Failure to send periodic statement--timing. If the creditor has  failed to send a periodic statement, the 60-day period runs from the  time the statement should have been sent. Once the statement is  provided, the consumer has another 60 days to assert any billing errors  reflected on it.</p><p class="depth0">2. Failure to reflect credit--timing. If the periodic statement  fails to reflect a credit to the account, the 60-day period runs from  transmittal of the statement on which the credit should have appeared.</p><p class="depth0">3. Transmittal. If a consumer has arranged for periodic statements  to be held at the financial institution until called for, the statement  is ``transmitted'' when it is first made available to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 13(b)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Identity of the consumer. The billing error notice need not  specify both the name and the account number if the information supplied  enables the creditor to identify the consumer's name and account.</p><p class="depth0">13(c) Time for Resolution; General Procedures</p><p class="depth0">1. Temporary or provisional corrections. A creditor may temporarily  correct the consumer's account in response to a billing error notice,  but is not excused from complying with the remaining error resolution  procedures within the time limits for resolution.</p><p class="depth0">2. Correction without investigation. A creditor may correct a  billing error in the manner and amount asserted by the consumer without  the investigation or the determination normally required. The creditor  must comply, however, with all other applicable provisions. If a  creditor follows this procedure, no presumption is created that a  billing error occurred.</p><p class="depth0">3. Relationship with Sec. 1026.12. The consumer's rights under the  billing error provisions in Sec. 1026.13 are independent of the  provisions set forth in Sec. 1026.12(b) and (c). (See comments 12(b)-4,  12(b)(3)-3, and 12(c)-1.)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 13(c)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Time for resolution. The phrase two complete billing cycles means  two actual billing cycles occurring after receipt of the billing error  notice, not a measure of time equal to two billing cycles. For example,  if a creditor on a monthly billing cycle receives a billing error notice  mid-cycle, it has the remainder of that cycle plus the next two full  billing cycles to resolve the error.</p><p class="depth0">2. Finality of error resolution procedure. A creditor must comply  with the error resolution procedures and complete its investigation to  determine whether an error occurred within two complete billing cycles  as set forth in Sec. 1026.13(c)(2). Thus, for example, Sec.  1026.13(c)(2) prohibits a creditor from reversing amounts previously  credited for an alleged billing error even if the creditor obtains  evidence after the error resolution time period has passed indicating  that the billing error did not occur as asserted by the consumer.  Similarly, if a creditor fails to mail or deliver a written explanation  setting forth the reason why the billing error did not occur as  asserted, or otherwise fails to comply with the error resolution  procedures set forth in Sec. 1026.13(f), the creditor generally must  credit the disputed amount and related finance or other charges, as  applicable, to the consumer's account. However, if a consumer receives  more than one credit to correct the same billing error, Sec. 1026.13  does not prevent a creditor from reversing amounts it has previously  credited to correct that error, provided that the total amount of the  remaining credits is equal to or more than the amount of the error and  that the consumer does not incur any fees or other charges as a result  of the timing of the creditor's reversal. For example, assume that a  consumer asserts a billing error with respect to a $100 transaction and  that the creditor posts a $100 credit to the consumer's account to  correct that error during the time period set forth in Sec.  1026.13(c)(2). However, following that time period, a merchant or other  person honoring the credit card issues a $100 credit to the consumer to  correct the same error. In these circumstances, Sec. 1026.13(c)(2) does  not prohibit the creditor from reversing its $100 credit once the $100  credit from the merchant or other person has posted to the consumer's  account.</p><p class="depth0">13(d) Rules Pending Resolution</p><p class="depth0">1. Disputed amount. Disputed amount is the dollar amount alleged by  the consumer to be in error. When the allegation concerns the  description or identification of the transaction (such as the date or  the seller's name) rather than a dollar amount, the disputed amount is  the amount of the transaction or charge that corresponds to the disputed  transaction identification. If the consumer alleges a failure to send a  periodic statement under Sec. 1026.13(a)(7), the disputed amount is the  entire balance owing.  13(d)(1) Consumer's Right To Withhold Disputed Amount; Collection Action</p><p class="depth0">Prohibited</p><p class="depth0">1. Prohibited collection actions. During the error resolution  period, the creditor is prohibited from trying to collect the disputed  amount from the consumer. Prohibited collection actions include, for  example, instituting court action, taking a lien, or instituting  attachment proceedings.</p><p class="depth0">2. Right to withhold payment. If the creditor reflects any disputed  amount or related finance or other charges on the periodic statement,  and is therefore required to make the disclosure under Sec.  1026.13(d)(4), the creditor may comply with that disclosure requirement  by indicating that payment of any disputed amount is not required  pending resolution. Making a disclosure that only refers to the disputed  amount would, of course, in no way affect the consumer's right under  Sec. 1026.13(d)(1) to withhold related finance and other charges. The  disclosure under Sec. 1026.13(d)(4) need not appear in any specific  place on the periodic statement, need not state the specific amount that  the consumer may withhold, and may be preprinted on the periodic  statement.</p><p class="depth0">3. Imposition of additional charges on undisputed amounts. The  consumer's withholding of a disputed amount from the total bill cannot  subject undisputed balances (including new purchases or cash advances  made during the present or subsequent cycles) to the imposition of  finance or other charges. For example, if on an account with a grace  period (that is, an account in which paying the new balance in full  allows the consumer to avoid the imposition of additional finance  charges), a consumer disputes a $2 item out of a total bill of $300 and  pays $298 within the grace period, the consumer would not lose the grace  period as to any undisputed amounts, even if the creditor determines  later that no billing error occurred. Furthermore, finance or other  charges may not be imposed on any new purchases or advances that, absent  the unpaid disputed balance, would not have finance or other charges  imposed on them. Finance or other charges that would have been incurred  even if the consumer had paid the disputed amount would not be affected.</p><p class="depth0">4. Automatic payment plans--coverage. The coverage of this provision  is limited to the card issuer's automatic payment plans, whether or not  the consumer's asset account is held by the card issuer or by another  financial institution. It does not apply to automatic or bill-payment  plans offered by financial institutions other than the credit card  issuer.</p><p class="depth0">5. Automatic payment plans--time of notice. While the card issuer  does not have to restore or prevent the debiting of a disputed amount if  the billing error notice arrives after the three-business-day cut-off,  the card issuer must, however, prevent the automatic debit of any part  of the disputed amount that is still outstanding and unresolved at the  time of the next scheduled debit date.</p><p class="depth0">13(d)(2) Adverse Credit Reports Prohibited</p><p class="depth0">1. Report of dispute. Although the creditor must not issue an  adverse credit report because the consumer fails to pay the disputed  amount or any related charges, the creditor may report that the amount  or the account is in dispute. Also, the creditor may report the account  as delinquent if undisputed amounts remain unpaid.</p><p class="depth0">2. Person. During the error resolution period, the creditor is  prohibited from making an adverse credit report about the disputed  amount to any person--including employers, insurance companies, other  creditors, and credit bureaus.</p><p class="depth0">3. Creditor's agent. Whether an agency relationship exists between a  creditor and an issuer of an adverse credit report is determined by  state or other applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">13(e) Procedures If Billing Error Occurred as Asserted</p><p class="depth0">1. Correction of error. The phrase as applicable means that the  necessary corrections vary with the type of billing error that occurred.  For example, a misidentified transaction (or a transaction that is  identified by one of the alternative methods in Sec. 1026.8) is cured  by properly identifying the transaction and crediting related finance  and any other charges imposed. The creditor is not required to cancel  the amount of the underlying obligation incurred by the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">2. Form of correction notice. The written correction notice may take  a variety of forms. It may be sent separately, or it may be included on  or with a periodic statement that is mailed within the time for  resolution. If the periodic statement is used, the amount of the billing  error must be specifically identified. If a separate billing error  correction notice is provided, the accompanying or subsequent periodic  statement reflecting the corrected amount may simply identify it as  credit.</p><p class="depth0">3. Discovery of information after investigation period. See comment  13(c)(2)-2.  13(f) Procedures If Different Billing Error or No Billing Error Occurred</p><p class="depth0">1. Different billing error. Examples of a different billing error  include:</p><p class="depth0">i. Differences in the amount of an error (for example, the customer  asserts a $55.00 error but the error was only $53.00).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Differences in other particulars asserted by the consumer (such  as when a consumer asserts that a particular transaction never occurred,  but the creditor determines that only the seller's name was disclosed  incorrectly).</p><p class="depth0">2. Form of creditor's explanation. The written explanation (which  also may notify the consumer of corrections to the account) may take a  variety of forms. It may be sent separately, or it may be included on or  with a periodic statement that is mailed within the time for resolution.  If the creditor uses the periodic statement for the explanation and  correction(s), the corrections must be specifically identified. If a  separate explanation,   including the correction notice, is provided, the enclosed or subsequent  periodic statement reflecting the corrected amount may simply identify  it as a credit. The explanation may be combined with the creditor's  notice to the consumer of amounts still owing, which is required under  Sec. 1026.13(g)(1), provided it is sent within the time limit for  resolution. (See commentary to Sec. 1026.13(e).)</p><p class="depth0">3. Reasonable investigation. A creditor must conduct a reasonable  investigation before it determines that no billing error occurred or  that a different billing error occurred from that asserted. In  conducting its investigation of an allegation of a billing error, the  creditor may reasonably request the consumer's cooperation. The creditor  may not automatically deny a claim based solely on the consumer's  failure or refusal to comply with a particular request, including  providing an affidavit or filing a police report. However, if the  creditor otherwise has no knowledge of facts confirming the billing  error, the lack of information resulting from the consumer's failure or  refusal to comply with a particular request may lead the creditor  reasonably to terminate the investigation. The procedures involved in  investigating alleged billing errors may differ depending on the billing  error type.</p><p class="depth0">i. Unauthorized transaction. In conducting an investigation of a  notice of billing error alleging an unauthorized transaction under Sec.  1026.13(a)(1), actions such as the following represent steps that a  creditor may take, as appropriate, in conducting a reasonable  investigation:</p><p class="depth0">A. Reviewing the types or amounts of purchases made in relation to  the consumer's previous purchasing pattern.</p><p class="depth0">B. Reviewing where the purchases were delivered in relation to the  consumer's residence or place of business.</p><p class="depth0">C. Reviewing where the purchases were made in relation to where the  consumer resides or has normally shopped.</p><p class="depth0">D. Comparing any signature on credit slips for the purchases to the  signature of the consumer (or an authorized user in the case of a credit  card account) in the creditor's records, including other credit slips.</p><p class="depth0">E. Requesting documentation to assist in the verification of the  claim.</p><p class="depth0">F. Requiring a written, signed statement from the consumer (or  authorized user, in the case of a credit card account). For example, the  creditor may include a signature line on a billing rights form that the  consumer may send in to provide notice of the claim. However, a creditor  may not require the consumer to provide an affidavit or signed statement  under penalty of perjury as a part of a reasonable investigation.</p><p class="depth0">G. Requesting a copy of a police report, if one was filed.</p><p class="depth0">H. Requesting information regarding the consumer's knowledge of the  person who allegedly obtained an extension of credit on the account or  of that person's authority to do so.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Nondelivery of property or services. In conducting an  investigation of a billing error notice alleging the nondelivery of  property or services under Sec. 1026.13(a)(3), the creditor shall not  deny the assertion unless it conducts a reasonable investigation and  determines that the property or services were actually delivered,  mailed, or sent as agreed.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Incorrect information. In conducting an investigation of a  billing error notice alleging that information appearing on a periodic  statement is incorrect because a person honoring the consumer's credit  card or otherwise accepting an access device for an open-end plan has  made an incorrect report to the creditor, the creditor shall not deny  the assertion unless it conducts a reasonable investigation and  determines that the information was correct.</p><p class="depth0">13(g) Creditor's Rights and Duties After Resolution</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 13(g)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Amounts owed by consumer. Amounts the consumer still owes may  include both minimum periodic payments and related finance and other  charges that accrued during the resolution period. As explained in the  commentary to Sec. 1026.13(d)(1), even if the creditor later determines  that no billing error occurred, the creditor may not include finance or  other charges that are imposed on undisputed balances solely as a result  of a consumer's withholding payment of a disputed amount.</p><p class="depth0">2. Time of notice. The creditor need not send the notice of amount  owed within the time period for resolution, although it is under a duty  to send the notice promptly after resolution of the alleged error. If  the creditor combines the notice of the amount owed with the explanation  required under Sec. 1026.13(f)(1), the combined notice must be provided  within the time limit for resolution.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 13(g)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Grace period if no error occurred. If the creditor determines,  after a reasonable investigation, that a billing error did not occur as  asserted, and the consumer was entitled to a grace period at the time  the consumer provided the billing error notice, the consumer must be  given a period of time equal to the grace period disclosed under Sec.  1026.6(a)(1) or (b)(2) and Sec. 1026.7(a)(8) or (b)(8) to pay any  disputed amounts due without incurring additional finance or other  charges. However, the creditor need not allow a grace period disclosed  under the above-mentioned sections to pay the amount due under Sec.  1026.13(g)(1) if no error occurred and the consumer was not entitled to  a grace period   at the time the consumer asserted the error. For example, assume that a  creditor provides a consumer a grace period of 20 days to pay a new  balance to avoid finance charges, and that the consumer did not carry an  outstanding balance from the prior month. If the consumer subsequently  asserts a billing error for the current statement period within the 20- day grace period, and the creditor determines that no billing error in  fact occurred, the consumer must be given at least 20 days (i.e., the  full disclosed grace period) to pay the amount due without incurring  additional finance charges. Conversely, if the consumer was not entitled  to a grace period at the time the consumer asserted the billing error,  for example, if the consumer did not pay the previous monthly balance of  undisputed charges in full, the creditor may assess finance charges on  the disputed balance for the entire period the item was in dispute.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 13(g)(3)</p><p class="depth0">1. Time for payment. The consumer has a minimum of 10 days to pay  (measured from the time the consumer could reasonably be expected to  have received notice of the amount owed) before the creditor may issue  an adverse credit report; if an initially disclosed grace period allows  the consumer a longer time in which to pay, the consumer has the benefit  of that longer period.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 13(g)(4)</p><p class="depth0">1. Credit reporting. Under Sec. 1026.13(g)(4)(i) and (iii) the  creditor's additional credit reporting responsibilities must be  accomplished promptly. The creditor need not establish costly procedures  to fulfill this requirement. For example, a creditor that reports to a  credit bureau on scheduled updates need not transmit corrective  information by an unscheduled computer or magnetic tape; it may provide  the credit bureau with the correct information by letter or other  commercially reasonable means when using the scheduled update would not  be ``prompt.'' The creditor is not responsible for ensuring that the  credit bureau corrects its information immediately.</p><p class="depth0">2. Adverse report to credit bureau. If a creditor made an adverse  report to a credit bureau that disseminated the information to other  creditors, the creditor fulfills its Sec. 1026.13(g)(4)(ii) obligations  by providing the consumer with the name and address of the credit  bureau.</p><p class="depth0">13(i) Relation to Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. Credit extended directly from a non-overdraft credit  line is governed solely by Regulation Z, even though a combined credit  card/access device is used to obtain the extension.</p><p class="depth0">2. Incidental credit under agreement. Credit extended incident to an  electronic fund transfer under an agreement between the consumer and the  financial institution is governed by Sec. 1026.13(i), which provides  that certain error resolution procedures in both this part and  Regulation E apply. Incidental credit that is not extended under an  agreement between the consumer and the financial institution is governed  solely by the error resolution procedures in Regulation E. For example,  credit inadvertently extended incident to an electronic fund-transfer,  such as under an overdraft service not subject to Regulation Z, is  governed solely by the Regulation E error resolution procedures, if the  bank and the consumer do not have an agreement to extend credit when the  consumer's account is overdrawn.</p><p class="depth0">3. Application to debit/credit transactions-examples. If a consumer  withdraws money at an automated teller machine and activates an  overdraft credit feature on the checking account:</p><p class="depth0">i. An error asserted with respect to the transaction is subject, for  error resolution purposes, to the applicable Regulation E (12 CFR Part  1005) provisions (such as timing and notice) for the entire transaction.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The creditor need not provisionally credit the consumer's  account, under 12 CFR 1005.11(c)(2)(i), for any portion of the unpaid  extension of credit.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The creditor must credit the consumer's account under Sec.  1005.11(c) with any finance or other charges incurred as a result of the  alleged error.</p><p class="depth0">iv. The provisions of Sec. Sec. 1026.13(d) and (g) apply only to  the credit portion of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.14--Determination of Annual Percentage Rate</p><p class="depth0">14(a) General Rule</p><p class="depth0">1. Tolerance. The tolerance of 1/8th of 1 percentage point above or  below the annual percentage rate applies to any required disclosure of  the annual percentage rate. The disclosure of the annual percentage rate  is required in Sec. Sec. 1026.60, 1026.40, 1026.6, 1026.7, 1026.9,  1026.15, 1026.16, 1026.26, 1026.55, and 1026.56.</p><p class="depth0">2. Rounding. The regulation does not require that the annual  percentage rate be calculated to any particular number of decimal  places; rounding is permissible within the 1/8th of 1 percent tolerance.  For example, an exact annual percentage rate of 14.33333% may be stated  as 14.33% or as 14.3%, or even as 14\1/4\%; but it could not be stated  as 14.2% or 14%, since each varies by more than the permitted tolerance.</p><p class="depth0">3. Periodic rates. No explicit tolerance exists for any periodic  rate as such; a disclosed periodic rate may vary from precise accuracy  (for example, due to rounding) only to   the extent that its annualized equivalent is within the tolerance  permitted by Sec. 1026.14(a). Further, a periodic rate need not be  calculated to any particular number of decimal places.</p><p class="depth0">4. Finance charges. The regulation does not prohibit creditors from  assessing finance charges on balances that include prior, unpaid finance  charges; state or other applicable law may do so, however.</p><p class="depth0">5. Good faith reliance on faulty calculation tools. The regulation  relieves a creditor of liability for an error in the annual percentage  rate or finance charge that resulted from a corresponding error in a  calculation tool used in good faith by the creditor. Whether or not the  creditor's use of the tool was in good faith must be determined on a  case-by-case basis, but the creditor must in any case have taken  reasonable steps to verify the accuracy of the tool, including any  instructions, before using it. Generally, the safe harbor from liability  is available only for errors directly attributable to the calculation  tool itself, including software programs; it is not intended to absolve  a creditor of liability for its own errors, or for errors arising from  improper use of the tool, from incorrect data entry, or from  misapplication of the law.</p><p class="depth0">6. Effect of leap year. Any variance in the annual percentage rate  that occurs solely by reason of the addition of February 29 in a leap  year may be disregarded, and such a rate may be disclosed without regard  to such variance.</p><p class="depth0">14(b) Annual Percentage Rate--In General</p><p class="depth0">1. Corresponding annual percentage rate computation. For purposes of  Sec. Sec. 1026.60, 1026.40, 1026.6, 1026.7(a)(4) or (b)(4), 1026.9,  1026.15, 1026.16, 1026.26, 1026.55, and 1026.56, the annual percentage  rate is determined by multiplying the periodic rate by the number of  periods in the year. This computation reflects the fact that, in such  disclosures, the rate (known as the corresponding annual percentage  rate) is prospective and does not involve any particular finance charge  or periodic balance.  14(c) Optional Effective Annual Percentage Rate for Periodic Statements</p><p class="depth0">for Creditors Offering Open-End Credit Plans Secured by a Consumer's</p><p class="depth0">Dwelling</p><p class="depth0">1. General rule. The periodic statement may reflect (under Sec.  1026.7(a)(7)) the annualized equivalent of the rate actually applied  during a particular cycle; this rate may differ from the corresponding  annual percentage rate because of the inclusion of, for example, fixed,  minimum, or transaction charges. Sections 1026.14(c)(1) through (c)(4)  state the computation rules for the effective rate.</p><p class="depth0">2. Charges related to opening, renewing, or continuing an account.  Sections 1026.14(c)(2) and (c)(3) exclude from the calculation of the  effective annual percentage rate finance charges that are imposed during  the billing cycle such as a loan fee, points, or similar charge that  relates to opening, renewing, or continuing an account. The charges  involved here do not relate to a specific transaction or to specific  activity on the account, but relate solely to the opening, renewing, or  continuing of the account. For example, an annual fee to renew an open- end credit account that is a percentage of the credit limit on the  account, or that is charged only to consumers that have not used their  credit card for a certain dollar amount in transactions during the  preceding year, would not be included in the calculation of the annual  percentage rate, even though the fee may not be excluded from the  finance charge under Sec. 1026.4(c)(4). (See comment 4(c)(4)-2.) This  rule applies even if the loan fee, points, or similar charges are billed  on a subsequent periodic statement or withheld from the proceeds of the  first advance on the account.</p><p class="depth0">3. Classification of charges. If the finance charge includes a  charge not due to the application of a periodic rate, the creditor must  use the annual percentage rate computation method that corresponds to  the type of charge imposed. If the charge is tied to a specific  transaction (for example, 3 percent of the amount of each transaction),  then the method in Sec. 1026.14(c)(3) must be used. If a fixed or  minimum charge is applied, that is, one not tied to any specific  transaction, then the formula in Sec. 1026.14(c)(2) is appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">4. Small finance charges. Section 1026.14(c)(4) gives the creditor  an alternative to Sec. 1026.14(c)(2) and (c)(3) if small finance  charges (50 cents or less) are involved; that is, if the finance charge  includes minimum or fixed fees not due to the application of a periodic  rate and the total finance charge for the cycle does not exceed 50  cents. For example, while a monthly activity fee of 50 cents on a  balance of $20 would produce an annual percentage rate of 30 percent  under the rule in Sec. 1026.14(c)(2), the creditor may disclose an  annual percentage rate of 18 percent if the periodic rate generally  applicable to all balances is 1 and \1/2\ percent per month.</p><p class="depth0">5. Prior-cycle adjustments. i. The annual percentage rate reflects  the finance charges imposed during the billing cycle. However, finance  charges imposed during the billing cycle may relate to activity in a  prior cycle. Examples of circumstances when this may occur are:</p><p class="depth0">A. A cash advance occurs on the last day of a billing cycle on an  account that uses the transaction date to figure finance charges, and it  is impracticable to post the transaction until the following cycle.</p><p class="depth0">B. An adjustment to the finance charge is made following the  resolution of a billing error dispute.</p><p class="depth0">C. A consumer fails to pay the purchase balance under a deferred  payment feature by the payment due date, and finance charges are imposed  from the date of purchase.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Finance charges relating to activity in prior cycles should be  reflected on the periodic statement as follows:</p><p class="depth0">A. If a finance charge imposed in the current billing cycle is  attributable to periodic rates applicable to prior billing cycles (such  as when a deferred payment balance was not paid in full by the payment  due date and finance charges from the date of purchase are now being  debited to the account, or when a cash advance occurs on the last day of  a billing cycle on an account that uses the transaction date to figure  finance charges and it is impracticable to post the transaction until  the following cycle), and the creditor uses the quotient method to  calculate the annual percentage rate, the numerator would include the  amount of any transaction charges plus any other finance charges posted  during the billing cycle. At the creditor's option, balances relating to  the finance charge adjustment may be included in the denominator if  permitted by the legal obligation, if it was impracticable to post the  transaction in the previous cycle because of timing, or if the  adjustment is covered by comment 14(c)-5.ii.B.</p><p class="depth0">B. If a finance charge that is posted to the account relates to  activity for which a finance charge was debited or credited to the  account in a previous billing cycle (for example, if the finance charge  relates to an adjustment such as the resolution of a billing error  dispute, or an unintentional posting error, or a payment by check that  was later returned unpaid for insufficient funds or other reasons), the  creditor shall at its option:</p><p class="depth0">1. Calculate the annual percentage rate in accordance with ii.A of  this paragraph, or</p><p class="depth0">2. Disclose the finance charge adjustment on the periodic statement  and calculate the annual percentage rate for the current billing cycle  without including the finance charge adjustment in the numerator and  balances associated with the finance charge adjustment in the  denominator.</p><p class="depth0">14(c)(1) Solely Periodic Rates Imposed</p><p class="depth0">1. Periodic rates. Section 1026.14(c)(1) applies if the only finance  charge imposed is due to the application of a periodic rate to a  balance. The creditor may compute the annual percentage rate either:</p><p class="depth0">i. By multiplying each periodic rate by the number of periods in the  year; or</p><p class="depth0">ii. By the ``quotient'' method. This method refers to a composite  annual percentage rate when different periodic rates apply to different  balances. For example, a particular plan may involve a periodic rate of  \1/2\ percent on balances up to $500, and 1 percent on balances over  $500. If, in a given cycle, the consumer has a balance of $800, the  finance charge would consist of $7.50 (500 x .015) plus $3.00 (300 x  .01), for a total finance charge of $10.50. The annual percentage rate  for this period may be disclosed either as 18% on $500 and 12 percent on  $300, or as 15.75 percent on a balance of $800 (the quotient of $10.50  divided by $800, multiplied by 12).</p><p class="depth0">14(c)(2) Minimum or Fixed Charge, But Not Transaction Charge, Imposed</p><p class="depth0">1. Certain charges not based on periodic rates. Section  1026.14(c)(2) specifies use of the quotient method to determine the  annual percentage rate if the finance charge imposed includes a certain  charge not due to the application of a periodic rate (other than a  charge relating to a specific transaction). For example, if the creditor  imposes a minimum $1 finance charge on all balances below $50, and the  consumer's balance was $40 in a particular cycle, the creditor would  disclose an annual percentage rate of 30 percent (1/40 x 12).</p><p class="depth0">2. No balance. If there is no balance to which the finance charge is  applicable, an annual percentage rate cannot be determined under Sec.  1026.14(c)(2). This could occur not only when minimum charges are  imposed on an account with no balance, but also when a periodic rate is  applied to advances from the date of the transaction. For example, if on  May 19 the consumer pays the new balance in full from a statement dated  May 1, and has no further transactions reflected on the June 1  statement, that statement would reflect a finance charge with no account  balance.</p><p class="depth0">14(c)(3) Transaction Charge Imposed</p><p class="depth0">1. Transaction charges. i. Section 1026.14(c)(3) transaction charges  include, for example:</p><p class="depth0">A. A loan fee of $10 imposed on a particular advance.</p><p class="depth0">B. A charge of 3 percent of the amount of each transaction.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The reference to avoiding duplication in the computation  requires that the amounts of transactions on which transaction charges  were imposed not be included both in the amount of total balances and in  the ``other amounts on which a finance charge was imposed'' figure. In a  multifeatured plan, creditors may consider each bona fide feature  separately in the calculation of the denominator. A creditor has  considerable flexibility in defining features for open-end plans, as  long as the creditor has a reasonable basis for the distinctions. For  further explanation and examples of how to determine the components of  this formula, see appendix F to part 1026.</p><p class="depth0">2. Daily rate with specific transaction charge. Section  1026.14(c)(3) sets forth an acceptable   method for calculating the annual percentage rate if the finance charge  results from a charge relating to a specific transaction and the  application of a daily periodic rate. This section includes the  requirement that the creditor follow the rules in appendix F to part  1026 in calculating the annual percentage rate, especially the provision  in the introductory section of appendix F which addresses the daily  rate/transaction charge situation by providing that the ``average of  daily balances'' shall be used instead of the ``sum of the balances.''</p><p class="depth0">14(d) Calculations Where Daily Periodic Rate Applied</p><p class="depth0">1. Quotient method. Section 1026.14(d) addresses use of a daily  periodic rate(s) to determine some or all of the finance charge and use  of the quotient method to determine the annual percentage rate. Since  the quotient formula in Sec. 1026.14(c)(1)(ii) and (c)(2) cannot be  used when a daily rate is being applied to a series of daily balances,  Sec. 1026.14(d) provides two alternative ways to calculate the annual  percentage rate--either of which satisfies the provisions of Sec.  1026.7(a)(7).</p><p class="depth0">2. Daily rate with specific transaction charge. If the finance  charge results from a charge relating to a specific transaction and the  application of a daily periodic rate, see comment 14(c)(3)-2 for  guidance on an appropriate calculation method.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.15--Right of Rescission</p><p class="depth0">1. Transactions not covered. Credit extensions that are not subject  to the regulation are not covered by Sec. 1026.15 even if the  customer's principal dwelling is the collateral securing the credit. For  this purpose, credit extensions also would include the occurrences  listed in comment 15(a)(1)-1. For example, the right of rescission does  not apply to the opening of a business-purpose credit line, even though  the loan is secured by the customer's principal dwelling.</p><p class="depth0">15(a) Consumer's Right To Rescind</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 15(a)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Occurrences subject to right. Under an open-end credit plan  secured by the consumer's principal dwelling, the right of rescission  generally arises with each of the following occurrences:</p><p class="depth0">i. Opening the account.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Each credit extension.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Increasing the credit limit.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Adding to an existing account a security interest in the  consumer's principal dwelling.</p><p class="depth0">v. Increasing the dollar amount of the security interest taken in  the dwelling to secure the plan. For example, a consumer may open an  account with a $10,000 credit limit, $5,000 of which is initially  secured by the consumer's principal dwelling. The consumer has the right  to rescind at that time and (except as noted in Sec. 1026.15(a)(1)(ii))  with each extension on the account. Later, if the creditor decides that  it wants the credit line fully secured, and increases the amount of its  interest in the consumer's dwelling, the consumer has the right to  rescind the increase.</p><p class="depth0">2. Exceptions. Although the consumer generally has the right to  rescind with each transaction on the account, Section 125(e) of the Act  provides an exception: the creditor need not provide the right to  rescind at the time of each credit extension made under an open-end  credit plan secured by the consumer's principal dwelling to the extent  that the credit extended is in accordance with a previously established  credit limit for the plan. This limited rescission option is available  whether or not the plan existed prior to the effective date of the Act.</p><p class="depth0">3. Security interest arising from transaction. i. In order for the  right of rescission to apply, the security interest must be retained as  part of the credit transaction. For example:</p><p class="depth0">A. A security interest that is acquired by a contractor who is also  extending the credit in the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">B. A mechanic's or materialman's lien that is retained by a  subcontractor or supplier of a contractor-creditor, even when the latter  has waived its own security interest in the consumer's home.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The security interest is not part of the credit transaction, and  therefore the transaction is not subject to the right of rescission  when, for example:</p><p class="depth0">A. A mechanic's or materialman's lien is obtained by a contractor  who is not a party to the credit transaction but merely is paid with the  proceeds of the consumer's cash advance.</p><p class="depth0">B. All security interests that may arise in connection with the  credit transaction are validly waived.</p><p class="depth0">C. The creditor obtains a lien and completion bond that in effect  satisfies all liens against the consumer's principal dwelling as a  result of the credit transaction.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Although liens arising by operation of law are not considered  security interests for purposes of disclosure under Sec. 1026.2, that  section specifically includes them in the definition for purposes of the  right of rescission. Thus, even though an interest in the consumer's  principal dwelling is not a required disclosure under Sec. 1026.6(c),  it may still give rise to the right of rescission.</p><p class="depth0">4. Consumer. To be a consumer within the meaning of Sec. 1026.2,  that person must at least have an ownership interest in the dwelling  that is encumbered by the creditor's security interest, although that  person need not be a   signatory to the credit agreement. For example, if only one spouse  enters into a secured plan, the other spouse is a consumer if the  ownership interest of that spouse is subject to the security interest.</p><p class="depth0">5. Principal dwelling. A consumer can only have one principal  dwelling at a time. (But see comment 15(a)(1)-6.) A vacation or other  second home would not be a principal dwelling. A transaction secured by  a second home (such as a vacation home) that is not currently being used  as the consumer's principal dwelling is not rescindable, even if the  consumer intends to reside there in the future. When a consumer buys or  builds a new dwelling that will become the consumer's principal dwelling  within one year or upon completion of construction, the new dwelling is  considered the principal dwelling if it secures the open-end credit  line. In that case, the transaction secured by the new dwelling is a  residential mortgage transaction and is not rescindable. For example, if  a consumer whose principal dwelling is currently A builds B, to be  occupied by the consumer upon completion of construction, an advance on  an open-end line to finance B and secured by B is a residential mortgage  transaction. Dwelling, as defined in Sec. 1026.2, includes structures  that are classified as personalty under state law. For example, a  transaction secured by a mobile home, trailer, or houseboat used as the  consumer's principal dwelling may be rescindable.</p><p class="depth0">6. Special rule for principal dwelling. Notwithstanding the general  rule that consumers may have only one principal dwelling, when the  consumer is acquiring or constructing a new principal dwelling, a credit  plan or extension that is subject to Regulation Z and is secured by the  equity in the consumer's current principal dwelling is subject to the  right of rescission regardless of the purpose of that loan (for example,  an advance to be used as a bridge loan). For example, if a consumer  whose principal dwelling is currently A builds B, to be occupied by the  consumer upon completion of construction, a loan to finance B and  secured by A is subject to the right of rescission. Moreover, a loan  secured by both A and B is, likewise, rescindable.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 15(a)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Consumer's exercise of right. The consumer must exercise the  right of rescission in writing but not necessarily on the notice  supplied under Sec. 1026.15(b). Whatever the means of sending the  notification of rescission--mail, telegram or other written means--the  time period for the creditor's performance under Sec. 1026.15(d)(2)  does not begin to run until the notification has been received. The  creditor may designate an agent to receive the notification so long as  the agent's name and address appear on the notice provided to the  consumer under Sec. 1026.15(b). Where the creditor fails to provide the  consumer with a designated address for sending the notification of  rescission, delivery of the notification to the person or address to  which the consumer has been directed to send payments constitutes  delivery to the creditor or assignee. State law determines whether  delivery of the notification to a third party other than the person to  whom payments are made is delivery to the creditor or assignee, in the  case where the creditor fails to designate an address for sending the  notification of rescission.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 15(a)(3)</p><p class="depth0">1. Rescission period. i. The period within which the consumer may  exercise the right to rescind runs for 3 business days from the last of  3 events:</p><p class="depth0">A. The occurrence that gives rise to the right of rescission.</p><p class="depth0">B. Delivery of all material disclosures that are relevant to the  plan.</p><p class="depth0">C. Delivery to the consumer of the required rescission notice.</p><p class="depth0">ii. For example, an account is opened on Friday, June 1, and the  disclosures and notice of the right to rescind were given on Thursday,  May 31; the rescission period will expire at midnight of the third  business day after June 1--that is, Tuesday June 5. In another example,  if the disclosures are given and the account is opened on Friday, June  1, and the rescission notice is given on Monday, June 4, the rescission  period expires at midnight of the third business day after June 4--that  is Thursday, June 7. The consumer must place the rescission notice in  the mail, file it for telegraphic transmission, or deliver it to the  creditor's place of business within that period in order to exercise the  right.</p><p class="depth0">2. Material disclosures. Section 1026.15(a)(3) sets forth the  material disclosures that must be provided before the rescission period  can begin to run. The creditor must provide sufficient information to  satisfy the requirements of Sec. 1026.6 for these disclosures. A  creditor may satisfy this requirement by giving an initial disclosure  statement that complies with the regulation. Failure to give the other  required initial disclosures (such as the billing rights statement) or  the information required under Sec. 1026.40 does not prevent the  running of the rescission period, although that failure may result in  civil liability or administrative sanctions. The payment terms set forth  in Sec. 1026.15(a)(3) apply to any repayment phase set forth in the  agreement. Thus, the payment terms described in Sec. 1026.6(e)(2) for  any repayment phase as well as for the draw period are ``material  disclosures.''</p><p class="depth0">3. Material disclosures--variable rate program. For a variable rate  program, the material disclosures also include the disclosures listed in  Sec. 1026.6(a)(1)(ii): the circumstances   under which the rate may increase; the limitations on the increase; and  the effect of an increase. The disclosures listed in Sec.  1026.6(a)(1)(ii) for any repayment phase also are material disclosures  for variable-rate programs.</p><p class="depth0">4. Unexpired right of rescission. i. When the creditor has failed to  take the action necessary to start the three-day rescission period  running the right to rescind automatically lapses on the occurrence of  the earliest of the following three events:</p><p class="depth0">A. The expiration of three years after the occurrence giving rise to  the right of rescission.</p><p class="depth0">B. Transfer of all the consumer's interest in the property.</p><p class="depth0">C. Sale of the consumer's interest in the property, including a  transaction in which the consumer sells the dwelling and takes back a  purchase money note and mortgage or retains legal title through a device  such as an installment sale contract.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Transfer of all the consumer's interest includes such transfers  as bequests and gifts. A sale or transfer of the property need not be  voluntary to terminate the right to rescind. For example, a foreclosure  sale would terminate an unexpired right to rescind. As provided in  section 125 of the Act, the three-year limit may be extended by an  administrative proceeding to enforce the provisions of Sec. 1026.15. A  partial transfer of the consumer's interest, such as a transfer  bestowing co-ownership on a spouse, does not terminate the right of  rescission.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 15(a)(4)</p><p class="depth0">1. Joint owners. When more than one consumer has the right to  rescind a transaction, any one of them may exercise that right and  cancel the transaction on behalf of all. For example, if both a husband  and wife have the right to rescind a transaction, either spouse acting  alone may exercise the right and both are bound by the rescission.</p><p class="depth0">15(b) Notice of Right To Rescind</p><p class="depth0">1. Who receives notice. Each consumer entitled to rescind must be  given two copies of the rescission notice and the material  disclosures.In a transaction involving joint owners, both of whom are  entitled to rescind, both must receive the notice of the right to  rescind and disclosures. For example, if both spouses are entitled to  rescind a transaction, each must receive two copies of the rescission  notice (one copy to each if the notice is provided in electronic form in  accordance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of  the E-Sign Act) and one copy of the disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">2. Format. The rescission notice may be physically separated from  the material disclosures or combined with the material disclosures, so  long as the information required to be included on the notice is set  forth in a clear and conspicuous manner. See the model notices in  appendix G.</p><p class="depth0">3. Content. The notice must include all of the information outlined  in Sec. 1026.15(b)(1) through (5). The requirement in Sec. 1026.15(b)  that the transaction or occurrence be identified may be met by providing  the date of the transaction or occurrence. The notice may include  additional information related to the required information, such as:</p><p class="depth0">i. A description of the property subject to the security interest.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A statement that joint owners may have the right to rescind and  that a rescission by one is effective for all.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The name and address of an agent of the creditor to receive  notice of rescission.</p><p class="depth0">4. Time of providing notice. The notice required by Sec. 1026.15(b)  need not be given before the occurrence giving rise to the right of  rescission. The creditor may deliver the notice after the occurrence,  but the rescission period will not begin to run until the notice is  given. For example, if the creditor provides the notice on May 15, but  disclosures were given and the credit limit was raised on May 10, the 3- business-day rescission period will run from May 15.</p><p class="depth0">15(c) Delay of Creditor's Performance</p><p class="depth0">1. General rule. i. Until the rescission period has expired and the  creditor is reasonably satisfied that the consumer has not rescinded,  the creditor must not, either directly or through a third party:</p><p class="depth0">A. Disburse advances to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">B. Begin performing services for the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">C. Deliver materials to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A creditor may, however, continue to allow transactions under an  existing open-end credit plan during a rescission period that results  solely from the addition of a security interest in the consumer's  principal dwelling. (See comment 15(c)-3 for other actions that may be  taken during the delay period.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Escrow. The creditor may disburse advances during the rescission  period in a valid escrow arrangement. The creditor may not, however,  appoint the consumer as ``trustee'' or ``escrow agent'' and distribute  funds to the consumer in that capacity during the delay period.</p><p class="depth0">3. Actions during the delay period. Section 1026.15(c) does not  prevent the creditor from taking other steps during the delay, short of  beginning actual performance. Unless otherwise prohibited, such as by  state law, the creditor may, for example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Prepare the cash advance check.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Perfect the security interest.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Accrue finance charges during the delay period.</p><p class="depth0">4. Performance by third party. The creditor is relieved from  liability for failure to delay   performance if a third party with no knowledge that the rescission right  has been activated provides materials or services, as long as any debt  incurred for materials or services obtained by the consumer during the  rescission period is not secured by the security interest in the  consumer's dwelling. For example, if a consumer uses a bank credit card  to purchase materials from a merchant in an amount below the floor  limit, the merchant might not contact the card issuer for authorization  and therefore would not know that materials should not be provided.</p><p class="depth0">5. Delay beyond rescission period. i. The creditor must wait until  it is reasonably satisfied that the consumer has not rescinded. For  example, the creditor may satisfy itself by doing one of the following:</p><p class="depth0">A. Waiting a reasonable time after expiration of the rescission  period to allow for delivery of a mailed notice.</p><p class="depth0">B. Obtaining a written statement from the consumer that the right  has not been exercised.</p><p class="depth0">ii. When more than one consumer has the right to rescind, the  creditor cannot reasonably rely on the assurance of only one consumer,  because other consumers may exercise the right.</p><p class="depth0">15(d) Effects of Rescission</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 15(d)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Termination of security interest. Any security interest giving  rise to the right of rescission becomes void when the consumer exercises  the right of rescission. The security interest is automatically negated,  regardless of its status and whether or not it was recorded or  perfected. Under Sec. 1026.15(d)(2), however, the creditor must take  any action necessary to reflect the fact that the security interest no  longer exists.</p><p class="depth0">2. Extent of termination. The creditor's security interest is void  to the extent that it is related to the occurrence giving rise to the  right of rescission. For example, upon rescission:</p><p class="depth0">i. If the consumer's right to rescind is activated by the opening of  a plan, any security interest in the principal dwelling is void.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the right arises due to an increase in the credit limit, the  security interest is void as to the amount of credit extensions over the  prior limit, but the security interest in amounts up to the original  credit limit is unaffected.</p><p class="depth0">iii. If the right arises with each individual credit extension, then  the interest is void as to that extension, and other extensions are  unaffected.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 15(d)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Refunds to consumer. The consumer cannot be required to pay any  amount in the form of money or property either to the creditor or to a  third party as part of the occurrence subject to the right of  rescission. Any amounts of this nature already paid by the consumer must  be refunded. ``Any amount'' includes finance charges already accrued, as  well as other charges such as broker fees, application and commitment  fees, or fees for a title search or appraisal, whether paid to the  creditor, paid by the consumer directly to a third party, or passed on  from the creditor to the third party. It is irrelevant that these  amounts may not represent profit to the creditor. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. If the occurrence is the opening of the plan, the creditor must  return any membership or application fee paid.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the occurrence is the increase in a credit limit or the  addition of a security interest, the creditor must return any fee  imposed for a new credit report or filing fees.</p><p class="depth0">iii. If the occurrence is a credit extension, the creditors must  return fees such as application, title, and appraisal or survey fees, as  well as any finance charges related to the credit extension.</p><p class="depth0">2. Amounts not refundable to consumer. Creditors need not return any  money given by the consumer to a third party outside of the occurrence,  such as costs incurred for a building permit or for a zoning variance.  Similarly, the term any amount does not apply to money or property given  by the creditor to the consumer; those amounts must be tendered by the  consumer to the creditor under Sec. 1026.15(d)(3).</p><p class="depth0">3. Reflection of security interest termination. The creditor must  take whatever steps are necessary to indicate that the security interest  is terminated. Those steps include the cancellation of documents  creating the security interest, and the filing of release or termination  statements in the public record. In a transaction involving  subcontractors or suppliers that also hold security interests related to  the occurrence rescinded by the consumer, the creditor must insure that  the termination of their security interests is also reflected. The 20- day period for the creditor's action refers to the time within which the  creditor must begin the process. It does not require all necessary steps  to have been completed within that time, but the creditor is responsible  for seeing the process through to completion.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 15(d)(3)</p><p class="depth0">1. Property exchange. Once the creditor has fulfilled its obligation  under Sec. 1026.15(d)(2), the consumer must tender to the creditor any  property or money the creditor has already delivered to the consumer. At  the consumer's option, property may be tendered at the location of the  property. For example, if fixtures or furniture have been delivered to  the consumer's home, the consumer may tender them to the creditor by  making them available for pick-up at the home, rather   than physically returning them to the creditor's premises. Money already  given to the consumer must be tendered at the creditor's place of  business. For purpose of property exchange, the following additional  rules apply:</p><p class="depth0">i. A cash advance is considered money for purposes of this section  even if the creditor knows what the consumer intends to purchase with  the money.</p><p class="depth0">ii. In a 3-party open-end credit plan (that is, if the creditor and  seller are not the same or related persons), extensions by the creditor  that are used by the consumer for purchases from third-party sellers are  considered to be the same as cash advances for purposes of tendering  value to the creditor, even though the transaction is a purchase for  other purposes under the regulation. For example, if a consumer  exercises the unexpired right to rescind after using a 3-party credit  card for one year, the consumer would tender the amount of the purchase  price for the items charged to the account, rather than tendering the  items themselves to the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">2. Reasonable value. If returning the property would be extremely  burdensome to the consumer, the consumer may offer the creditor its  reasonable value rather than returning the property itself. For example,  if building materials have already been incorporated into the consumer's  dwelling, the consumer may pay their reasonable value.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 15(d)(4)</p><p class="depth0">1. Modifications. The procedures outlined in Sec. 1026.15(d)(2) and  (3) may be modified by a court. For example, when a consumer is in  bankruptcy proceedings and prohibited from returning anything to the  creditor, or when the equities dictate, a modification might be made.  The sequence of procedures under Sec. 1026.15(d)(2) and (3), or a  court's modification of those procedures under Sec. 1026.15(d)(4), does  not affect a consumer's substantive right to rescind and to have the  loan amount adjusted accordingly. Where the consumer's right to rescind  is contested by the creditor, a court would normally determine whether  the consumer has a right to rescind and determine the amounts owed  before establishing the procedures for the parties to tender any money  or property.</p><p class="depth0">15(e) Consumer's Waiver of Right To Rescind</p><p class="depth0">1. Need for waiver. To waive the right to rescind, the consumer must  have a bona fide personal financial emergency that must be met before  the end of the rescission period. The existence of the consumer's waiver  will not, of itself, automatically insulate the creditor from liability  for failing to provide the right of rescission.</p><p class="depth0">2. Procedure. To waive or modify the right to rescind, the consumer  must give a written statement that specifically waives or modifies the  right, and also includes a brief description of the emergency. Each  consumer entitled to rescind must sign the waiver statement. In a  transaction involving multiple consumers, such as a husband and wife  using their home as collateral, the waiver must bear the signatures of  both spouses.</p><p class="depth0">15(f) Exempt Transactions</p><p class="depth0">1. Residential mortgage transaction. Although residential mortgage  transactions would seldom be made on bona fide open-end credit plans  (under which repeated transactions must be reasonably contemplated), an  advance on an open-end plan could be for a downpayment for the purchase  of a dwelling that would then secure the remainder of the line. In such  a case, only the particular advance for the downpayment would be exempt  from the rescission right.</p><p class="depth0">2. State creditors. Cities and other political subdivisions of  states acting as creditors are not exempt from Sec. 1026.15.</p><p class="depth0">3. Spreader clause. When the creditor holds a mortgage or deed of  trust on the consumer's principal dwelling and that mortgage or deed of  trust contains a ``spreader clause'' (also known as a ``dragnet'' or  cross-collateralization clause), subsequent occurrences such as the  opening of a plan or individual credit extensions are subject to the  right of rescission to the same degree as if the security interest were  taken directly to secure the open-end plan, unless the creditor  effectively waives its security interest under the spreader clause with  respect to the subsequent open-end credit extensions.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.16--Advertising</p><p class="depth0">1. Clear and conspicuous standard--general. Section 1026.16 is  subject to the general ``clear and conspicuous'' standard for subpart B  (see Sec. 1026.5(a)(1)) but prescribes no specific rules for the format  of the necessary disclosures, other than the format requirements related  to the disclosure of a promotional rate or payment under Sec.  1026.16(d)(6), a promotional rate or promotional fee under Sec.  1026.16(g), or a deferred interest or similar offer under Sec.  1026.16(h). Other than the disclosure of certain terms described in  Sec. Sec. 1026.16(d)(6), (g), or (h), the credit terms need not be  printed in a certain type size nor need they appear in any particular  place in the advertisement.</p><p class="depth0">2. Clear and conspicuous standard--promotional rates or payments;  deferred interest or similar offers. i. For purposes of Sec.  1026.16(d)(6), a clear and conspicuous disclosure means that the  required information in Sec. 1026.16(d)(6)(ii)(A)-(C) is disclosed with  equal prominence and in close proximity to the promotional rate or  payment to which it applies. If the information in Sec.  1026.16(d)(6)(ii)(A)-(C) is the same type size   and is located immediately next to or directly above or below the  promotional rate or payment to which it applies, without any intervening  text or graphical displays, the disclosures would be deemed to be  equally prominent and in close proximity. Notwithstanding the above, for  electronic advertisements that disclose promotional rates or payments,  compliance with the requirements of Sec. 1026.16(c) is deemed to  satisfy the clear and conspicuous standard.</p><p class="depth0">ii. For purposes of Sec. 1026.16(g)(4) as it applies to written or  electronic advertisements only, a clear and conspicuous disclosure means  the required information in Sec. 1026.16(g)(4)(i) and, as applicable,  (g)(4)(ii) and (g)(4)(iii) must be equally prominent to the promotional  rate or promotional fee to which it applies. If the information in Sec.  1026.16(g)(4)(i) and, as applicable, (g)(4)(ii) and (g)(4)(iii) is the  same type size as the promotional rate or promotional fee to which it  applies, the disclosures would be deemed to be equally prominent. For  purposes of Sec. 1026.16(h)(3) as it applies to written or electronic  advertisements only, a clear and conspicuous disclosure means the  required information in Sec. 1026.16(h)(3) must be equally prominent to  each statement of ``no interest,'' ``no payments,'' ``deferred  interest,'' ``same as cash,'' or similar term regarding interest or  payments during the deferred interest period. If the information  required to be disclosed under Sec. 1026.16(h)(3) is the same type size  as the statement of ``no interest,'' ``no payments,'' ``deferred  interest,'' ``same as cash,'' or similar term regarding interest or  payments during the deferred interest period, the disclosure would be  deemed to be equally prominent.</p><p class="depth0">3. Clear and conspicuous standard--Internet advertisements for home- equity plans. For purposes of this section, a clear and conspicuous  disclosure for visual text advertisements on the Internet for home- equity plans subject to the requirements of Sec. 1026.40 means that the  required disclosures are not obscured by techniques such as graphical  displays, shading, coloration, or other devices and comply with all  other requirements for clear and conspicuous disclosures under Sec.  1026.16(d). (See also comment 16(c)(1)-2.)</p><p class="depth0">4. Clear and conspicuous standard--televised advertisements for  home-equity plans. For purposes of this section, including alternative  disclosures as provided for by Sec. 1026.16(e), a clear and conspicuous  disclosure in the context of visual text advertisements on television  for home-equity plans subject to the requirements of Sec. 1026.40 means  that the required disclosures are not obscured by techniques such as  graphical displays, shading, coloration, or other devices, are displayed  in a manner that allows for a consumer to read the information required  to be disclosed, and comply with all other requirements for clear and  conspicuous disclosures under Sec. 1026.16(d). For example, very fine  print in a television advertisement would not meet the clear and  conspicuous standard if consumers cannot see and read the information  required to be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">5. Clear and conspicuous standard--oral advertisements for home- equity plans. For purposes of this section, including alternative  disclosures as provided for by Sec. 1026.16(e), a clear and conspicuous  disclosure in the context of an oral advertisement for home-equity plans  subject to the requirements of Sec. 1026.40, whether by radio,  television, the Internet, or other medium, means that the required  disclosures are given at a speed and volume sufficient for a consumer to  hear and comprehend them. For example, information stated very rapidly  at a low volume in a radio or television advertisement would not meet  the clear and conspicuous standard if consumers cannot hear and  comprehend the information required to be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">6. Expressing the annual percentage rate in abbreviated form.  Whenever the annual percentage rate is used in an advertisement for  open-end credit, it may be expressed using a readily understandable  abbreviation such as APR.</p><p class="depth0">16(a) Actually Available Terms</p><p class="depth0">1. General rule. To the extent that an advertisement mentions  specific credit terms, it may state only those terms that the creditor  is actually prepared to offer. For example, a creditor may not advertise  a very low annual percentage rate that will not in fact be available at  any time. Section 1026.16(a) is not intended to inhibit the promotion of  new credit programs, but to bar the advertising of terms that are not  and will not be available. For example, a creditor may advertise terms  that will be offered for only a limited period, or terms that will  become available at a future date.</p><p class="depth0">2. Specific credit terms. Specific credit terms is not limited to  the disclosures required by the regulation but would include any  specific components of a credit plan, such as the minimum periodic  payment amount or seller's points in a plan secured by real estate.</p><p class="depth0">16(b) Advertisement of Terms That Require Additional Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 16(b)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Triggering terms. Negative as well as affirmative references  trigger the requirement for additional information. For example, if a  creditor states no interest or no annual membership fee in an  advertisement, additional information must be provided. Other examples  of terms that trigger additional disclosures are:</p><p class="depth0">i. Small monthly service charge on the remaining balance, which  describes how the amount of a finance charge will be determined.</p><p class="depth0">ii. 12 percent Annual Percentage Rate or A $15 annual membership fee  buys you $2,000 in credit, which describe required disclosures under  Sec. 1026.6.</p><p class="depth0">2. Implicit terms. Section 1026.16(b) applies even if the triggering  term is not stated explicitly, but may be readily determined from the  advertisement.</p><p class="depth0">3. Membership fees. A membership fee is not a triggering term nor  need it be disclosed under Sec. 1026.16(b)(1)(iii) if it is required  for participation in the plan whether or not an open-end credit feature  is attached. (See comment 6(a)(2)-1 and Sec. 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(B).)</p><p class="depth0">4. Deferred billing and deferred payment programs. Statements such  as ``Charge it--you won't be billed until May'' or ``You may skip your  January payment'' are not in themselves triggering terms, since the  timing for initial billing or for monthly payments are not terms  required to be disclosed under Sec. 1026.6. However, a statement such  as ``No interest charges until May'' or any other statement regarding  when interest or finance charges begin to accrue is a triggering term,  whether appearing alone or in conjunction with a description of a  deferred billing or deferred payment program such as the examples above.</p><p class="depth0">5. Variable-rate plans. In disclosing the annual percentage rate in  an advertisement for a variable-rate plan, as required by Sec.  1026.16(b)(1)(ii), the creditor may use an insert showing the current  rate; or may give the rate as of a specified recent date. The additional  requirement in Sec. 1026.16(b)(1)(ii) to disclose the variable-rate  feature may be satisfied by disclosing that the annual percentage rate  may vary or a similar statement, but the advertisement need not include  the information required by Sec. 1026.6(a)(1)(ii) or (b)(4)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">6. Membership fees for open-end (not home-secured) plans. For  purposes of Sec. 1026.16(b)(1)(iii), membership fees that may be  imposed on open-end (not home-secured) plans shall have the same meaning  as in Sec. 1026.60(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 16(b)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Assumptions. In stating the total of payments and the time period  to repay the obligation, assuming that the consumer pays only the  periodic payment amounts advertised, as required under Sec.  1026.16(b)(2), the following additional assumptions may be made:</p><p class="depth0">i. Payments are made timely so as not to be considered late by the  creditor;</p><p class="depth0">ii. Payments are made each period, and no debt cancellation or  suspension agreement, or skip payment feature applies to the account;</p><p class="depth0">iii. No interest rate changes will affect the account;</p><p class="depth0">iv. No other balances are currently carried or will be carried on  the account;</p><p class="depth0">v. No taxes or ancillary charges are or will be added to the  obligation;</p><p class="depth0">vi. Goods or services are delivered on a single date; and</p><p class="depth0">vii. The consumer is not currently and will not become delinquent on  the account.</p><p class="depth0">2. Positive periodic payment amounts. Only positive periodic payment  amounts trigger the additional disclosures under Sec. 1026.16(b)(2).  Therefore, if the periodic payment amount advertised is not a positive  amount (e.g., ``No payments''), the advertisement need not state the  total of payments and the time period to repay the obligation.</p><p class="depth0">16(c) Catalogs or Other Multiple-Page Advertisements; Electronic</p><p class="depth0">Advertisements</p><p class="depth0">1. Definition. The multiple-page advertisements to which Sec.  1026.16(c) refers are advertisements consisting of a series of  sequentially numbered pages--for example, a supplement to a newspaper. A  mailing consisting of several separate flyers or pieces of promotional  material in a single envelope does not constitute a single multiple-page  advertisement for purposes of Sec. 1026.16(c).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 16(c)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Section 1026.16(c)(1) permits creditors to put credit  information together in one place in a catalog or other multiple-page  advertisement or an electronic advertisement (such as an advertisement  appearing on an Internet Web site). The rule applies only if the  advertisement contains one or more of the triggering terms from Sec.  1026.16(b).</p><p class="depth0">2. Electronic advertisement. If an electronic advertisement (such as  an advertisement appearing on an Internet Web site) contains the table  or schedule permitted under Sec. 1026.16(c)(1), any statement of terms  set forth in Sec. 1026.6 appearing anywhere else in the advertisement  must clearly direct the consumer to the location where the table or  schedule begins. For example, a term triggering additional disclosures  may be accompanied by a link that directly takes the consumer to the  additional information.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 16(c)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Table or schedule if credit terms depend on outstanding balance.  If the credit terms of a plan vary depending on the amount of the  balance outstanding, rather than the amount of any property purchased, a  table or schedule complies with Sec. 1026.16(c)(2) if it includes the  required disclosures for representative balances. For example, a  creditor would disclose that a periodic rate of 1.5% is applied to  balances of $500 or less, and a 1% rate is applied to balances greater  than $500.</p><p class="depth0">16(d) Additional Requirements for Home-Equity Plans</p><p class="depth0">1. Trigger terms. Negative as well as affirmative references trigger  the requirement for additional information. For example, if a creditor  states no annual fee, no points, or we waive closing costs in an  advertisement, additional information must be provided. (See comment  16(d)-4 regarding the use of a phrase such as no closing costs.)  Inclusion of a statement such as low fees, however, would not trigger  the need to state additional information. References to payment terms  include references to the draw period or any repayment period, to the  length of the plan, to how the minimum payments are determined and to  the timing of such payments.</p><p class="depth0">2. Fees to open the plan. Section 1026.16(d)(1)(i) requires a  disclosure of any fees imposed by the creditor or a third party to open  the plan. In providing the fee information required under this  paragraph, the corresponding rules for disclosure of this information  apply. For example, fees to open the plan may be stated as a range.  Similarly, if property insurance is required to open the plan, a  creditor either may estimate the cost of the insurance or provide a  statement that such insurance is required. (See the commentary to Sec.  1026.40(d)(7) and (d)(8).)</p><p class="depth0">3. Statements of tax deductibility. An advertisement that refers to  deductibility for tax purposes is not misleading if it includes a  statement such as ``consult a tax advisor regarding the deductibility of  interest.'' An advertisement distributed in paper form or through the  Internet (rather than by radio or television) that states that the  advertised extension of credit may exceed the fair market value of the  consumer's dwelling is not misleading if it clearly and conspicuously  states the required information in Sec. Sec. 1026.16(d)(4)(i) and  (d)(4)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">4. Misleading terms prohibited. Under Sec. 1026.16(d)(5),  advertisements may not refer to home-equity plans as free money or use  other misleading terms. For example, an advertisement could not state  ``no closing costs'' or ``we waive closing costs'' if consumers may be  required to pay any closing costs, such as recordation fees. In the case  of property insurance, however, a creditor may state, for example, ``no  closing costs'' even if property insurance may be required, as long as  the creditor also provides a statement that such insurance may be  required. (See the commentary to this section regarding fees to open a  plan.)</p><p class="depth0">5. Promotional rates and payments in advertisements for home-equity  plans. Section 1026.16(d)(6) requires additional disclosures for  promotional rates or payments.</p><p class="depth0">i. Variable-rate plans. In advertisements for variable-rate plans,  if the advertised annual percentage rate is based on (or the advertised  payment is derived from) the index and margin that will be used to make  rate (or payment) adjustments over the term of the loan, then there is  no promotional rate or promotional payment. If, however, the advertised  annual percentage rate is not based on (or the advertised payment is not  derived from) the index and margin that will be used to make rate (or  payment) adjustments, and a reasonably current application of the index  and margin would result in a higher annual percentage rate (or, given an  assumed balance, a higher payment) then there is a promotional rate or  promotional payment.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Equal prominence, close proximity. Information required to be  disclosed in Sec. 1026.16(d)(6)(ii) that is immediately next to or  directly above or below the promotional rate or payment (but not in a  footnote) is deemed to be closely proximate to the listing. Information  required to be disclosed in Sec. 1026.16(d)(6)(ii) that is in the same  type size as the promotional rate or payment is deemed to be equally  prominent.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Amounts and time periods of payments. Section  1026.16(d)(6)(ii)(C) requires disclosure of the amount and time periods  of any payments that will apply under the plan. This section may require  disclosure of several payment amounts, including any balloon payment.  For example, if an advertisement for a home-equity plan offers a  $100,000 five-year line of credit and assumes that the entire line is  drawn resulting in a minimum payment of $800 per month for the first six  months, increasing to $1,000 per month after month six, followed by a  $50,000 balloon payment after five years, the advertisement must  disclose the amount and time period of each of the two monthly payment  streams, as well as the amount and timing of the balloon payment, with  equal prominence and in close proximity to the promotional payment.  However, if the final payment could not be more than twice the amount of  other minimum payments, the final payment need not be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Plans other than variable-rate plans. For a plan other than a  variable-rate plan, if an advertised payment is calculated in the same  way as other payments based on an assumed balance, the fact that the  minimum payment could increase solely if the consumer made an additional  draw does not make the payment a promotional payment. For example, if a  payment of $500 results from an assumed $10,000 draw, and the payment  would increase to $1,000 if the consumer made an additional $10,000  draw, the payment is not a promotional payment.</p><p class="depth0">v. Conversion option. Some home-equity plans permit the consumer to  repay all or part of the balance during the draw period at a fixed rate  (rather than a variable rate) and over a specified time period. The  fixed-rate conversion option does not, by itself, make the rate or  payment that would apply if the   consumer exercised the fixed-rate conversion option a promotional rate  or payment.</p><p class="depth0">vi. Preferred-rate provisions. Some home-equity plans contain a  preferred-rate provision, where the rate will increase upon the  occurrence of some event, such as the consumer-employee leaving the  creditor's employ, the consumer closing an existing deposit account with  the creditor, or the consumer revoking an election to make automated  payments. A preferred-rate provision does not, by itself, make the rate  or payment under the preferred-rate provision a promotional rate or  payment.</p><p class="depth0">6. Reasonably current index and margin. For the purposes of this  section, an index and margin is considered reasonably current if:</p><p class="depth0">i. For direct mail advertisements, it was in effect within 60 days  before mailing;</p><p class="depth0">ii. For advertisements in electronic form it was in effect within 30  days before the advertisement is sent to a consumer's email address, or  in the case of an advertisement made on an Internet Web site, when  viewed by the public; or</p><p class="depth0">iii. For printed advertisements made available to the general  public, including ones contained in a catalog, magazine, or other  generally available publication, it was in effect within 30 days before  printing.</p><p class="depth0">7. Relation to other sections. Advertisements for home-equity plans  must comply with all provisions in Sec. 1026.16, not solely the rules  in Sec. 1026.16(d). If an advertisement contains information (such as  the payment terms) that triggers the duty under Sec. 1026.16(d) to  state the annual percentage rate, the additional disclosures in Sec.  1026.16(b) must be provided in the advertisement. While Sec. 1026.16(d)  does not require a statement of fees to use or maintain the plan (such  as membership fees and transaction charges), such fees must be disclosed  under Sec. 1026.16(b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">8. Inapplicability of closed-end rules. Advertisements for home- equity plans are governed solely by the requirements in Sec. 1026.16,  except Sec. 1026.16(g), and not by the closed-end advertising rules in  Sec. 1026.24. Thus, if a creditor states payment information about the  repayment phase, this will trigger the duty to provide additional  information under Sec. 1026.16, but not under Sec. 1026.24.</p><p class="depth0">9. Balloon payment. See comment 40(d)(5)(ii)-3 for information not  required to be stated in advertisements, and on situations in which the  balloon payment requirement does not apply.</p><p class="depth0">16(e) Alternative Disclosures--Television or Radio Advertisements</p><p class="depth0">1. Multi-purpose telephone number. When an advertised telephone  number provides a recording, disclosures must be provided early in the  sequence to ensure that the consumer receives the required disclosures.  For example, in providing several options--such as providing directions  to the advertiser's place of business--the option allowing the consumer  to request disclosures should be provided early in the telephone message  to ensure that the option to request disclosures is not obscured by  other information.</p><p class="depth0">2. Statement accompanying toll free number. Language must accompany  a telephone number indicating that disclosures are available by calling  the telephone number, such as ``call 1-(800) 000-0000 for details about  credit costs and terms.''</p><p class="depth0">16(g) Promotional Rates and Fees</p><p class="depth0">1. Rate in effect at the end of the promotional period. If the  annual percentage rate that will be in effect at the end of the  promotional period (i.e., the post-promotional rate) is a variable rate,  the post-promotional rate for purposes of Sec. 1026.16(g)(2)(i) is the  rate that would have applied at the time the promotional rate was  advertised if the promotional rate was not offered, consistent with the  accuracy requirements in Sec. 1026.60(c)(2) and (e)(4), as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">2. Immediate proximity. For written or electronic advertisements,  including the term ``introductory'' or ``intro'' in the same phrase as  the listing of the introductory rate or introductory fee is deemed to be  in immediate proximity of the listing.</p><p class="depth0">3. Prominent location closely proximate. For written or electronic  advertisements, information required to be disclosed in Sec.  1026.16(g)(4)(i) and, as applicable, (g)(4)(ii) and (g)(4)(iii) that is  in the same paragraph as the first listing of the promotional rate or  promotional fee is deemed to be in a prominent location closely  proximate to the listing. Information disclosed in a footnote will not  be considered in a prominent location closely proximate to the listing.</p><p class="depth0">4. First listing. For purposes of Sec. 1026.16(g)(4) as it applies  to written or electronic advertisements, the first listing of the  promotional rate or promotional fee is the most prominent listing of the  rate or fee on the front side of the first page of the principal  promotional document. The principal promotional document is the document  designed to be seen first by the consumer in a mailing, such as a cover  letter or solicitation letter. If the promotional rate or promotional  fee does not appear on the front side of the first page of the principal  promotional document, then the first listing of the promotional rate or  promotional fee is the most prominent listing of the rate or fee on the  subsequent pages of the principal promotional document. If the  promotional rate or promotional fee is not listed on the principal  promotional document or there is no principal promotional document, the  first listing is the most prominent listing of the rate or fee on the  front side of the first page of each document listing the promotional  rate or promotional fee. If the promotional rate or promotional fee does  not appear on   the front side of the first page of a document, then the first listing  of the promotional rate or promotional fee is the most prominent listing  of the rate or fee on the subsequent pages of the document. If the  listing of the promotional rate or promotional fee with the largest type  size on the front side of the first page (or subsequent pages if the  promotional rate or promotional fee is not listed on the front side of  the first page) of the principal promotional document (or each document  listing the promotional rate or promotional fee if the promotional rate  or promotional fee is not listed on the principal promotional document  or there is no principal promotional document) is used as the most  prominent listing, it will be deemed to be the first listing. Consistent  with comment 16(c)-1, a catalog or multiple-page advertisement is  considered one document for purposes of Sec. 1026.16(g)(4).</p><p class="depth0">5. Post-promotional rate depends on consumer's creditworthiness. For  purposes of disclosing the rate that may apply after the end of the  promotional rate period, at the advertiser's option, the advertisement  may disclose the rates that may apply as either specific rates, or a  range of rates. For example, if there are three rates that may apply  (9.99%, 12.99% or 17.99%), an issuer may disclose these three rates as  specific rates (9.99%, 12.99% or 17.99%) or as a range of rates (9.99%- 17.99%).</p><p class="depth0">16(h) Deferred Interest or Similar Offers</p><p class="depth0">1. Deferred interest or similar offers clarified. Deferred interest  or similar offers do not include offers that allow a consumer to skip  payments during a specified period of time, and under which the consumer  is not obligated under any circumstances for any interest or other  finance charges that could be attributable to that period. Deferred  interest or similar offers also do not include 0% annual percentage rate  offers where a consumer is not obligated under any circumstances for  interest attributable to the time period the 0% annual percentage rate  was in effect, though such offers may be considered promotional rates  under Sec. 1026.16(g)(2)(i). Deferred interest or similar offers also  do not include skip payment programs that have no required minimum  payment for one or more billing cycles but where interest continues to  accrue and is imposed during that period.</p><p class="depth0">2. Deferred interest period clarified. Although the terms of an  advertised deferred interest or similar offer may provide that a  creditor may charge the accrued interest if the balance is not paid in  full by a certain date, creditors sometimes have an informal policy or  practice that delays charging the accrued interest for payment received  a brief period of time after the date upon which a creditor has the  contractual right to charge the accrued interest. The advertisement need  not include the end of an informal ``courtesy period'' in disclosing the  deferred interest period under Sec. 1026.16(h)(3).</p><p class="depth0">3. Immediate proximity. For written or electronic advertisements,  including the deferred interest period in the same phrase as the  statement of ``no interest,'' ``no payments,'' ``deferred interest,'' or  ``same as cash'' or similar term regarding interest or payments during  the deferred interest period is deemed to be in immediate proximity of  the statement.</p><p class="depth0">4. Prominent location closely proximate. For written or electronic  advertisements, information required to be disclosed in Sec.  1026.16(h)(4)(i) and (ii) that is in the same paragraph as the first  statement of ``no interest,'' ``no payments,'' ``deferred interest,'' or  ``same as cash'' or similar term regarding interest or payments during  the deferred interest period is deemed to be in a prominent location  closely proximate to the statement. Information disclosed in a footnote  is not considered in a prominent location closely proximate to the  statement.</p><p class="depth0">5. First listing. For purposes of Sec. 1026.16(h)(4) as it applies  to written or electronic advertisements, the first statement of ``no  interest,'' ``no payments,'' ``deferred interest,'' ``same as cash,'' or  similar term regarding interest or payments during the deferred interest  period is the most prominent listing of one of these statements on the  front side of the first page of the principal promotional document. The  principal promotional document is the document designed to be seen first  by the consumer in a mailing, such as a cover letter or solicitation  letter. If one of the statements does not appear on the front side of  the first page of the principal promotional document, then the first  listing of one of these statements is the most prominent listing of a  statement on the subsequent pages of the principal promotional document.  If one of the statements is not listed on the principal promotional  document or there is no principal promotional document, the first  listing of one of these statements is the most prominent listing of the  statement on the front side of the first page of each document  containing one of these statements. If one of the statements does not  appear on the front side of the first page of a document, then the first  listing of one of these statements is the most prominent listing of a  statement on the subsequent pages of the document. If the listing of one  of these statements with the largest type size on the front side of the  first page (or subsequent pages if one of these statements is not listed  on the front side of the first page) of the principal promotional  document (or each document listing one of these statements if a  statement is not listed on the principal promotional document or there  is no principal promotional document) is   used as the most prominent listing, it will be deemed to be the first  listing. Consistent with comment 16(c)-1, a catalog or multiple-page  advertisement is considered one document for purposes of Sec.  1026.16(h)(4).</p><p class="depth0">6. Additional information. Consistent with comment 5(a)-2, the  information required under Sec. 1026.16(h)(4) need not be segregated  from other information regarding the deferred interest or similar offer.  Advertisements may also be required to provide additional information  pursuant to Sec. 1026.16(b) though such information need not be  integrated with the information required under Sec. 1026.16(h)(4).</p><p class="depth0">7. Examples. Examples of disclosures that could be used to comply  with the requirements of Sec. 1026.16(h)(3) include: ``no interest if  paid in full within 6 months'' and ``no interest if paid in full by  December 31, 2010.''</p><p class="depth0">Subpart C--Closed-End Credit</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.17--General Disclosure Requirements</p><p class="depth0">17(a) Form of Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 17(a)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Clear and conspicuous. This standard requires that disclosures be  in a reasonably understandable form. For example, while the regulation  requires no mathematical progression or format, the disclosures must be  presented in a way that does not obscure the relationship of the terms  to each other. In addition, although no minimum type size is mandated  (except for the interest rate and payment summary for mortgage  transactions required by Sec. 1026.18(s)), the disclosures must be  legible, whether typewritten, handwritten, or printed by computer.</p><p class="depth0">2. Segregation of disclosures. i. The disclosures may be grouped  together and segregated from other information in a variety of ways. For  example, the disclosures may appear on a separate sheet of paper or may  be set off from other information on the contract or other documents:</p><p class="depth0">A. By outlining them in a box.</p><p class="depth0">B. By bold print dividing lines.</p><p class="depth0">C. By a different color background.</p><p class="depth0">D. By a different type style.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The general segregation requirement described in this  subparagraph does not apply to the disclosures required under Sec.  1026.19(b) although the disclosures must be clear and conspicuous.</p><p class="depth0">3. Location. The regulation imposes no specific location  requirements on the segregated disclosures. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. They may appear on a disclosure statement separate from all other  material.</p><p class="depth0">ii. They may be placed on the same document with the credit contract  or other information, so long as they are segregated from that  information.</p><p class="depth0">iii. They may be shown on the front or back of a document.</p><p class="depth0">iv. They need not begin at the top of a page.</p><p class="depth0">v. They may be continued from one page to another.</p><p class="depth0">4. Content of segregated disclosures. Section 1026.17(a)(1) contains  exceptions to the requirement that the disclosures under Sec. 1026.18  be segregated from material that is not directly related to those  disclosures. Section 1026.17(a)(1) lists the items that may be added to  the segregated disclosures, even though not directly related to those  disclosures. The section also lists the items required under Sec.  1026.18 that may be deleted from the segregated disclosures and appear  elsewhere. Any one or more of these additions or deletions may be  combined and appear either together with or separate from the segregated  disclosures. The itemization of the amount financed under Sec.  1026.18(c), however, must be separate from the other segregated  disclosures under Sec. 1026.18, except for private education loan  disclosures made in compliance with Sec. 1026.47. If a creditor chooses  to include the security interest charges required to be itemized under  Sec. 1026.4(e) and Sec. 1026.18(o) in the amount financed itemization,  it need not list these charges elsewhere.</p><p class="depth0">5. Directly related. The segregated disclosures may, at the  creditor's option, include any information that is directly related to  those disclosures. The following is directly related information:</p><p class="depth0">i. A description of a grace period after which a late payment charge  will be imposed. For example, the disclosure given under Sec.  1026.18(l) may state that a late charge will apply to ``any payment  received more than 15 days after the due date.''</p><p class="depth0">ii. A statement that the transaction is not secured. For example,  the creditor may add a category labeled ``unsecured'' or ``not secured''  to the security interest disclosures given under Sec. 1026.18(m).</p><p class="depth0">iii. The basis for any estimates used in making disclosures. For  example, if the maturity date of a loan depends solely on the occurrence  of a future event, the creditor may indicate that the disclosures assume  that event will occur at a certain time.</p><p class="depth0">iv. The conditions under which a demand feature may be exercised.  For example, in a loan subject to demand after five years, the  disclosures may state that the loan will become payable on demand in  five years.</p><p class="depth0">v. An explanation of the use of pronouns or other references to the  parties to the transaction. For example, the disclosures may state, ``  `You' refers to the customer and `we' refers to the creditor.''</p><p class="depth0">vi. Instructions to the creditor or its employees on the use of a  multiple-purpose form. For example, the disclosures may state, ``Check  box if applicable.''</p><p class="depth0">vii. A statement that the borrower may pay a minimum finance charge  upon prepayment in a simple-interest transaction. For example, when  state law prohibits penalties, but would allow a minimum finance charge  in the event of prepayment, the creditor may make the Sec.  1026.18(k)(1) disclosure by stating, ``You may be charged a minimum  finance charge.''</p><p class="depth0">viii. A brief reference to negative amortization in variable-rate  transactions. For example, in the variable-rate disclosure, the creditor  may include a short statement such as ``Unpaid interest will be added to  principal.'' (See the commentary to Sec. 1026.18(f)(1)(iii).)</p><p class="depth0">ix. A brief caption identifying the disclosures. For example, the  disclosures may bear a general title such as ``Federal Truth in Lending  Disclosures'' or a descriptive title such as ``Real Estate Loan  Disclosures.''</p><p class="depth0">x. A statement that a due-on-sale clause or other conditions on  assumption are contained in the loan document. For example, the  disclosure given under Sec. 1026.18(q) may state, ``Someone buying your  home may, subject to conditions in the due-on-sale clause contained in  the loan document, assume the remainder of the mortgage on the original  terms.''</p><p class="depth0">xi. If a state or Federal law prohibits prepayment penalties and  excludes the charging of interest after prepayment from coverage as a  penalty, a statement that the borrower may have to pay interest for some  period after prepayment in full. The disclosure given under Sec.  1026.18(k) may state, for example, ``If you prepay your loan on other  than the regular installment date, you may be assessed interest charges  until the end of the month.''</p><p class="depth0">xii. More than one hypothetical example under Sec.  1026.18(f)(1)(iv) in transactions with more than one variable-rate  feature. For example, in a variable-rate transaction with an option  permitting consumers to convert to a fixed-rate transaction, the  disclosures may include an example illustrating the effects on the  payment terms of an increase resulting from conversion in addition to  the example illustrating an increase resulting from changes in the  index.</p><p class="depth0">xiii. The disclosures set forth under Sec. 1026.18(f)(1) for  variable-rate transactions subject to Sec. 1026.18(f)(2).</p><p class="depth0">xiv. A statement whether or not a subsequent purchaser of the  property securing an obligation may be permitted to assume the remaining  obligation on its original terms.</p><p class="depth0">xv. A late-payment fee disclosure under Sec. 1026.18(l) on a single  payment loan.</p><p class="depth0">xvi. The notice set forth in Sec. 1026.19(a)(4), in a closed-end  transaction not subject to Sec. 1026.19(a)(1)(i). In a mortgage  transaction subject to Sec. 1026.19(a)(1)(i), the creditor must  disclose the notice contained in Sec. 1026.19(a)(4) grouped together  with the disclosures made under Sec. 1026.18. See comment 19(a)(4)-1.</p><p class="depth0">6. Multiple-purpose forms. The creditor may design a disclosure  statement that can be used for more than one type of transaction, so  long as the required disclosures for individual transactions are clear  and conspicuous. (See the commentary to Appendices G and H for a  discussion of the treatment of disclosures that do not apply to specific  transactions.) Any disclosure listed in Sec. 1026.18 (except the  itemization of the amount financed under Sec. 1026.18(c) for  transactions other than private education loans) may be included on a  standard disclosure statement even though not all of the creditor's  transactions include those features. For example, the statement may  include:</p><p class="depth0">i. The variable rate disclosure under Sec. 1026.18(f).</p><p class="depth0">ii. The demand feature disclosure under Sec. 1026.18(i).</p><p class="depth0">iii. A reference to the possibility of a security interest arising  from a spreader clause, under Sec. 1026.18(m).</p><p class="depth0">iv. The assumption policy disclosure under Sec. 1026.18(q).</p><p class="depth0">v. The required deposit disclosure under Sec. 1026.18(r).</p><p class="depth0">7. Balloon payment financing with leasing characteristics. In  certain credit sale or loan transactions, a consumer may reduce the  dollar amount of the payments to be made during the course of the  transaction by agreeing to make, at the end of the loan term, a large  final payment based on the expected residual value of the property. The  consumer may have a number of options with respect to the final payment,  including, among other things, retaining the property and making the  final payment, refinancing the final payment, or transferring the  property to the creditor in lieu of the final payment. Such transactions  may have some of the characteristics of lease transactions subject to  Regulation M (12 CFR Part 1013), but are considered credit transactions  where the consumer assumes the indicia of ownership, including the  risks, burdens and benefits of ownership upon consummation. These  transactions are governed by the disclosure requirements of this part  instead of Regulation M. Creditors should not include in the segregated  Truth in Lending disclosures additional information. Thus, disclosures  should show the large final payment in the payment schedule and should  not, for example, reflect the other options available to the consumer at  maturity.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 17(a)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. When disclosures must be more conspicuous. The following rules  apply to the requirement that the terms ``annual percentage rate''  (except for private education loan disclosures made in compliance with  Sec. 1026.47) and ``finance charge'' be shown more conspicuously:</p><p class="depth0">i. The terms must be more conspicuous only in relation to the other  required disclosures under Sec. 1026.18. For example, when the  disclosures are included on the contract document, those two terms need  not be more conspicuous as compared to the heading on the contract  document or information required by state law.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The terms need not be more conspicuous except as part of the  finance charge and annual percentage rate disclosures under Sec.  1026.18(d) and (e), although they may, at the creditor's option, be  highlighted wherever used in the required disclosures. For example, the  terms may, but need not, be highlighted when used in disclosing a  prepayment penalty under Sec. 1026.18(k) or a required deposit under  Sec. 1026.18(r).</p><p class="depth0">iii. The creditor's identity under Sec. 1026.18(a) may, but need  not, be more prominently displayed than the finance charge and annual  percentage rate.</p><p class="depth0">iv. The terms need not be more conspicuous than figures (including,  for example, numbers, percentages, and dollar signs).</p><p class="depth0">2. Making disclosures more conspicuous. The terms ``finance charge''  and (except for private education loan disclosures made in compliance  with Sec. 1026.47) ``annual percentage rate'' may be made more  conspicuous in any way that highlights them in relation to the other  required disclosures. For example, they may be:</p><p class="depth0">i. Capitalized when other disclosures are printed in capital and  lower case.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Printed in larger type, bold print or different type face.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Printed in a contrasting color.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Underlined.</p><p class="depth0">v. Set off with asterisks.</p><p class="depth0">17(b) Time of Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Consummation. As a general rule, disclosures must be made before  ``consummation'' of the transaction. The disclosures need not be given  by any particular time before consummation, except in certain mortgage  transactions and variable-rate transactions secured by the consumer's  principal dwelling with a term greater than one year under Sec.  1026.19, and in private education loan transactions disclosed in  compliance with Sec. Sec. 1026.46 and 1026.47. (See the commentary to  Sec. 1026.2(a)(13) regarding the definition of consummation.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Converting open-end to closed-end credit. Except for home equity  plans subject to Sec. 1026.40 in which the agreement provides for a  repayment phase, if an open-end credit account is converted to a closed- end transaction under a written agreement with the consumer, the  creditor must provide a set of closed-end credit disclosures before  consummation of the closed-end transaction. (See the commentary to Sec.  1026.19(b) for the timing rules for additional disclosures required upon  the conversion to a variable-rate transaction secured by a consumer's  principal dwelling with a term greater than one year.) If consummation  of the closed-end transaction occurs at the same time as the consumer  enters into the open-end agreement, the closed-end credit disclosures  may be given at the time of conversion. If disclosures are delayed until  conversion and the closed-end transaction has a variable-rate feature,  disclosures should be based on the rate in effect at the time of  conversion. (See the commentary to Sec. 1026.5 regarding conversion of  closed-end to open-end credit.)</p><p class="depth0">3. Disclosures provided on credit contracts. Creditors must give the  required disclosures to the consumer in writing, in a form that the  consumer may keep, before consummation of the transaction. See Sec.  1026.17(a)(1) and (b). Sometimes the disclosures are placed on the same  document with the credit contract. Creditors are not required to give  the consumer two separate copies of the document before consummation,  one for the consumer to keep and a second copy for the consumer to  execute. The disclosure requirement is satisfied if the creditor gives a  copy of the document containing the unexecuted credit contract and  disclosures to the consumer to read and sign; and the consumer receives  a copy to keep at the time the consumer becomes obligated. It is not  sufficient for the creditor merely to show the consumer the document  containing the disclosures before the consumer signs and becomes  obligated. The consumer must be free to take possession of and review  the document in its entirety before signing.</p><p class="depth0">i. Example. To illustrate, a creditor gives a consumer a multiple- copy form containing a credit agreement and TILA disclosures. The  consumer reviews and signs the form and returns it to the creditor, who  separates the copies and gives one copy to the consumer to keep. The  creditor has satisfied the disclosure requirement.</p><p class="depth0">17(c) Basis of Disclosures and Use of Estimates</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 17(c)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Legal obligation. The disclosures shall reflect the credit terms  to which the parties are legally bound as of the outset of the  transaction. In the case of disclosures required under Sec. 1026.20(c)  and (d), the disclosures shall reflect the credit terms to which the  parties are legally bound when the disclosures are provided. The legal  obligation is determined by applicable State law or other law. (Certain  transactions are specifically addressed in this commentary. See, for  example, the discussion of buydown transactions elsewhere in the  commentary to Sec. 1026.17(c).) The fact that a term or contract may  later be deemed unenforceable by a court on the basis of equity or other  grounds does not, by itself, mean that disclosures   based on that term or contract did not reflect the legal obligation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Modification of obligation. The legal obligation normally is  presumed to be contained in the note or contract that evidences the  agreement. But this presumption is rebutted if another agreement between  the parties legally modifies that note or contract. If the parties  informally agree to a modification of the legal obligation, the  modification should not be reflected in the disclosures unless it rises  to the level of a change in the terms of the legal obligation. For  example:</p><p class="depth0">i. If the creditor offers a preferential rate, such as an employee  preferred rate, the disclosures should reflect the terms of the legal  obligation. (See the commentary to Sec. 1026.19(b) for an example of a  preferred-rate transaction that is a variable-rate transaction.)</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the contract provides for a certain monthly payment schedule  but payments are made on a voluntary payroll deduction plan or an  informal principal-reduction agreement, the disclosures should reflect  the schedule in the contract.</p><p class="depth0">iii. If the contract provides for regular monthly payments but the  creditor informally permits the consumer to defer payments from time to  time, for instance, to take account of holiday seasons or seasonal  employment, the disclosures should reflect the regular monthly payments.</p><p class="depth0">3. Third-party buydowns. In certain transactions, a seller or other  third party may pay an amount, either to the creditor or to the  consumer, in order to reduce the consumer's payments or buy down the  interest rate for all or a portion of the credit term. For example, a  consumer and a bank agree to a mortgage with an interest rate of 15% and  level payments over 25 years. By a separate agreement, the seller of the  property agrees to subsidize the consumer's payments for the first 2  years of the mortgage, giving the consumer an effective rate of 12% for  that period.</p><p class="depth0">i. If the lower rate is reflected in the credit contract between the  consumer and the bank, the disclosures must take the buydown into  account. For example, the annual percentage rate must be a composite  rate that takes account of both the lower initial rate and the higher  subsequent rate, and the payment schedule disclosures must reflect the 2  payment levels. However, the amount paid by the seller would not be  specifically reflected in the disclosures given by the bank, since that  amount constitutes seller's points and thus is not part of the finance  charge.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the lower rate is not reflected in the credit contract  between the consumer and the bank and the consumer is legally bound to  the 15% rate from the outset, the disclosures given by the bank must not  reflect the seller buydown in any way. For example, the annual  percentage rate and payment schedule would not take into account the  reduction in the interest rate and payment level for the first 2 years  resulting from the buydown.</p><p class="depth0">4. Consumer buydowns. In certain transactions, the consumer may pay  an amount to the creditor to reduce the payments or obtain a lower  interest rate on the transaction. Consumer buydowns must be reflected in  the disclosures given for that transaction. To illustrate, in a mortgage  transaction, the creditor and consumer agree to a note specifying a 14  percent interest rate. However, in a separate document, the consumer  agrees to pay an amount to the creditor at consummation in return for a  reduction in the interest rate to 12 percent for a portion of the  mortgage term. The amount paid by the consumer may be deposited in an  escrow account or may be retained by the creditor. Depending upon the  buydown plan, the consumer's prepayment of the obligation may or may not  result in a portion of the amount being credited or refunded to the  consumer. In the disclosures given for the mortgage, the creditor must  reflect the terms of the buydown agreement.</p><p class="depth0">i. For example:</p><p class="depth0">A. The amount paid by the consumer is a prepaid finance charge (even  if deposited in an escrow account).</p><p class="depth0">B. A composite annual percentage rate must be calculated, taking  into account both interest rates, as well as the effect of the prepaid  finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">C. The payment schedule must reflect the multiple payment levels  resulting from the buydown.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The rules regarding consumer buydowns do not apply to  transactions known as ``lender buydowns.'' In lender buydowns, a  creditor pays an amount (either into an account or to the party to whom  the obligation is sold) to reduce the consumer's payments or interest  rate for all or a portion of the credit term. Typically, these  transactions are structured as a buydown of the interest rate during an  initial period of the transaction with a higher than usual rate for the  remainder of the term. The disclosures for lender buydowns should be  based on the terms of the legal obligation between the consumer and the  creditor. (See comment 17(c)(1)-3 for the analogous rules concerning  third-party buydowns.)</p><p class="depth0">5. Split buydowns. In certain transactions, a third party (such as a  seller) and a consumer both pay an amount to the creditor to reduce the  interest rate. The creditor must include the portion paid by the  consumer in the finance charge and disclose the corresponding multiple  payment levels and composite annual percentage rate. The portion paid by  the third party and the corresponding reduction in interest rate,  however, should not be reflected in the disclosures unless the lower  rate is reflected in the credit contract. (See   the discussion on third-party and consumer buydown transactions  elsewhere in the commentary to Sec. 1026.17(c).)</p><p class="depth0">6. Wrap-around financing. Wrap-around transactions, usually loans,  involve the creditor's wrapping the outstanding balance on an existing  loan and advancing additional funds to the consumer. The pre-existing  loan, which is wrapped, may be to the same consumer or to a different  consumer. In either case, the consumer makes a single payment to the new  creditor, who makes the payments on the pre-existing loan to the  original creditor. Wrap-around loans or sales are considered new single- advance transactions, with an amount financed equaling the sum of the  new funds advanced by the wrap creditor and the remaining principal owed  to the original creditor on the pre-existing loan. In disclosing the  itemization of the amount financed, the creditor may use a label such as  ``the amount that will be paid to creditor X'' to describe the remaining  principal balance on the pre-existing loan. This approach to Truth in  Lending calculations has no effect on calculations required by other  statutes, such as state usury laws.</p><p class="depth0">7. Wrap-around financing with balloon payments. For wrap-around  transactions involving a large final payment of the new funds before the  maturity of the pre-existing loan, the amount financed is the sum of the  new funds and the remaining principal on the pre-existing loan. The  disclosures should be based on the shorter term of the wrap loan, with a  large final payment of both the new funds and the total remaining  principal on the pre-existing loan (although only the wrap loan will  actually be paid off at that time).</p><p class="depth0">8. Basis of disclosures in variable-rate transactions. The  disclosures for a variable-rate transaction must be given for the full  term of the transaction and must be based on the terms in effect at the  time of consummation. Creditors should base the disclosures only on the  initial rate and should not assume that this rate will increase. For  example, in a loan with an initial rate of 10 percent and a 5 percentage  points rate cap, creditors should base the disclosures on the initial  rate and should not assume that this rate will increase 5 percentage  points. However, in a variable-rate transaction with a seller buydown  that is reflected in the credit contract, a consumer buydown, or a  discounted or premium rate, disclosures should not be based solely on  the initial terms. In those transactions, the disclosed annual  percentage rate should be a composite rate based on the rate in effect  during the initial period and the rate that is the basis of the  variable-rate feature for the remainder of the term. (See the commentary  to Sec. 1026.17(c) for a discussion of buydown, discounted, and premium  transactions and the commentary to Sec. 1026.19(a)(2) for a discussion  of the redisclosure in certain mortgage transactions with a variable- rate feature.)</p><p class="depth0">9. Use of estimates in variable-rate transactions. The variable-rate  feature does not, by itself, make the disclosures estimates.</p><p class="depth0">10. Discounted and premium variable-rate transactions. In some  variable-rate transactions, creditors may set an initial interest rate  that is not determined by the index or formula used to make later  interest rate adjustments. Typically, this initial rate charged to  consumers is lower than the rate would be if it were calculated using  the index or formula. However, in some cases the initial rate may be  higher. In a discounted transaction, for example, a creditor may  calculate interest rates according to a formula using the six-month  Treasury bill rate plus a 2 percent margin. If the Treasury bill rate at  consummation is 10 percent, the creditor may forgo the 2 percent spread  and charge only 10 percent for a limited time, instead of setting an  initial rate of 12 percent.</p><p class="depth0">i. When creditors use an initial interest rate that is not  calculated using the index or formula for later rate adjustments, the  disclosures should reflect a composite annual percentage rate based on  the initial rate for as long as it is charged and, for the remainder of  the term, the rate that would have been applied using the index or  formula at the time of consummation. The rate at consummation need not  be used if a contract provides for a delay in the implementation of  changes in an index value. For example, if the contract specifies that  rate changes are based on the index value in effect 45 days before the  change date, creditors may use any index value in effect during the 45  day period before consummation in calculating a composite annual  percentage rate.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The effect of the multiple rates must also be reflected in the  calculation and disclosure of the finance charge, total of payments, and  payment schedule.</p><p class="depth0">iii. If a loan contains a rate or payment cap that would prevent the  initial rate or payment, at the time of the first adjustment, from  changing to the rate determined by the index or formula at consummation,  the effect of that rate or payment cap should be reflected in the  disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Because these transactions involve irregular payment amounts, an  annual percentage rate tolerance of \1/4\ of 1 percent applies, in  accordance with Sec. 1026.22(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0">v. Examples of discounted variable-rate transactions include:</p><p class="depth0">A. A 30-year loan for $100,000 with no prepaid finance charges and  rates determined by the Treasury bill rate plus 2 percent. Rate and  payment adjustments are made annually. Although the Treasury bill rate  at the time of consummation is 10 percent, the creditor sets the  interest rate for one year at 9 percent, instead of 12 percent according  to the formula. The disclosures should reflect a   composite annual percentage rate of 11.63 percent based on 9 percent for  one year and 12 percent for 29 years. Reflecting those two rate levels,  the payment schedule should show 12 payments of $804.62 and 348 payments  of $1,025.31. The finance charge should be $266,463.32 and the total of  payments $366,463.32.</p><p class="depth0">B. Same loan as above, except with a 2 percent rate cap on periodic  adjustments. The disclosures should reflect a composite annual  percentage rate of 11.53 percent based on 9 percent for the first year,  11 percent for the second year, and 12 percent for the remaining 28  years. Reflecting those three rate levels, the payment schedule should  show 12 payments of $804.62, 12 payments of $950.09, and 336 payments of  $1,024.34. The finance charge should be $265,234.76 and the total of  payments $365,234.76.</p><p class="depth0">C. Same loan as above, except with a 7 \1/2\ percent cap on payment  adjustments. The disclosures should reflect a composite annual  percentage rate of 11.64 percent, based on 9 percent for one year and 12  percent for 29 years. Because of the payment cap, five levels of  payments should be reflected. The payment schedule should show 12  payments of $804.62, 12 payments of $864.97, 12 payments of $929.84, 12  payments of $999.58, and 312 payments of $1,070.04. The finance charge  should be $277,040.60, and the total of payments $377,040.60.</p><p class="depth0">vi. A loan in which the initial interest rate is set according to  the index or formula used for later adjustments but is not set at the  value of the index or formula at consummation is not a discounted  variable-rate loan. For example, if a creditor commits to an initial  rate based on the formula on a date prior to consummation, but the index  has moved during the period between that time and consummation, a  creditor should base its disclosures on the initial rate.</p><p class="depth0">11. Examples of variable-rate transactions. Variable-rate  transactions include:</p><p class="depth0">i. Renewable balloon-payment instruments where the creditor is both  unconditionally obligated to renew the balloon-payment loan at the  consumer's option (or is obligated to renew subject to conditions within  the consumer's control) and has the option of increasing the interest  rate at the time of renewal. Disclosures must be based on the payment  amortization (unless the specified term of the obligation with renewals  is shorter) and on the rate in effect at the time of consummation of the  transaction. (Examples of conditions within a consumer's control include  requirements that a consumer be current in payments or continue to  reside in the mortgaged property. In contrast, setting a limit on the  rate at which the creditor would be obligated to renew or reserving the  right to change the credit standards at the time of renewal are examples  of conditions outside a consumer's control.) If, however, a creditor is  not obligated to renew as described above, disclosures must be based on  the term of the balloon-payment loan. Disclosures also must be based on  the term of the balloon-payment loan in balloon-payment instruments in  which the legal obligation provides that the loan will be renewed by a  ``refinancing'' of the obligation, as that term is defined by Sec.  1026.20(a). If it cannot be determined from the legal obligation that  the loan will be renewed by a ``refinancing,'' disclosures must be based  either on the term of the balloon-payment loan or on the payment  amortization, depending on whether the creditor is unconditionally  obligated to renew the loan as described above. (This discussion does  not apply to construction loans subject to Sec. 1026.17(c)(6).)</p><p class="depth0">ii. ``Shared-equity'' or ``shared-appreciation'' mortgages that have  a fixed rate of interest and an appreciation share based on the  consumer's equity in the mortgaged property. The appreciation share is  payable in a lump sum at a specified time. Disclosures must be based on  the fixed interest rate. (As discussed in the commentary to Sec.  1026.2, other types of shared-equity arrangements are not considered  ``credit'' and are not subject to Regulation Z.)</p><p class="depth0">iii. Preferred-rate loans where the terms of the legal obligation  provide that the initial underlying rate is fixed but will increase upon  the occurrence of some event, such as an employee leaving the employ of  the creditor, and the note reflects the preferred rate. The disclosures  are to be based on the preferred rate.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Graduated-payment mortgages and step-rate transactions without a  variable-rate feature are not considered variable-rate transactions.</p><p class="depth0">v. ``Price level adjusted mortgages'' or other indexed mortgages  that have a fixed rate of interest but provide for periodic adjustments  to payments and the loan balance to reflect changes in an index  measuring prices or inflation. Disclosures are to be based on the fixed  interest rate.</p><p class="depth0">12. Graduated payment adjustable rate mortgages. These mortgages  involve both a variable interest rate and scheduled variations in  payment amounts during the loan term. For example, under these plans, a  series of graduated payments may be scheduled before rate adjustments  affect payment amounts, or the initial scheduled payment may remain  constant for a set period before rate adjustments affect the payment  amount. In any case, the initial payment amount may be insufficient to  cover the scheduled interest, causing negative amortization from the  outset of the transaction. In these transactions, the disclosures should  treat these features as follows:</p><p class="depth0">i. The finance charge includes the amount of negative amortization  based on the assumption that the rate in effect at consummation remains  unchanged.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The amount financed does not include the amount of negative  amortization.</p><p class="depth0">iii. As in any variable-rate transaction, the annual percentage rate  is based on the terms in effect at consummation.</p><p class="depth0">iv. The schedule of payments discloses the amount of any scheduled  initial payments followed by an adjusted level of payments based on the  initial interest rate. Since some mortgage plans contain limits on the  amount of the payment adjustment, the payment schedule may require  several different levels of payments, even with the assumption that the  original interest rate does not increase.</p><p class="depth0">13. Growth-equity mortgages. i. Also referred to as payment- escalated mortgages, these mortgage plans involve scheduled payment  increases to prematurely amortize the loan. The initial payment amount  is determined as for a long-term loan with a fixed interest rate.  Payment increases are scheduled periodically, based on changes in an  index. The larger payments result in accelerated amortization of the  loan. In disclosing these mortgage plans, creditors may either:</p><p class="depth0">A. Estimate the amount of payment increases, based on the best  information reasonably available; or</p><p class="depth0">B. Disclose by analogy to the variable-rate disclosures in  1026.18(f)(1).</p><p class="depth0">ii. This discussion does not apply to growth-equity mortgages in  which the amount of payment increases can be accurately determined at  the time of disclosure. For these mortgages, as for graduated-payment  mortgages, disclosures should reflect the scheduled increases in  payments.</p><p class="depth0">14. Reverse mortgages. Reverse mortgages, also known as reverse  annuity or home equity conversion mortgages, typically involve the  disbursement of monthly advances to the consumer for a fixed period or  until the occurrence of an event such as the consumer's death. Repayment  of the loan (generally a single payment of principal and accrued  interest) may be required to be made at the end of the disbursements or,  for example, upon the death of the consumer. In disclosing these  transactions, creditors must apply the following rules, as applicable:</p><p class="depth0">i. If the reverse mortgage has a specified period for disbursements  but repayment is due only upon the occurrence of a future event such as  the death of the consumer, the creditor must assume that disbursements  will be made until they are scheduled to end. The creditor must assume  repayment will occur when disbursements end (or within a period  following the final disbursement which is not longer than the regular  interval between disbursements). This assumption should be used even  though repayment may occur before or after the disbursements are  scheduled to end. In such cases, the creditor may include a statement  such as ``The disclosures assume that you will repay the loan at the  time our payments to you end. As provided in your agreement, your  repayment may be required at a different time.''</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the reverse mortgage has neither a specified period for  disbursements nor a specified repayment date and these terms will be  determined solely by reference to future events including the consumer's  death, the creditor may assume that the disbursements will end upon the  consumer's death (estimated by using actuarial tables, for example) and  that repayment will be required at the same time (or within a period  following the date of the final disbursement which is not longer than  the regular interval for disbursements). Alternatively, the creditor may  base the disclosures upon another future event it estimates will be most  likely to occur first. (If terms will be determined by reference to  future events which do not include the consumer's death, the creditor  must base the disclosures upon the occurrence of the event estimated to  be most likely to occur first.)</p><p class="depth0">iii. In making the disclosures, the creditor must assume that all  disbursements and accrued interest will be paid by the consumer. For  example, if the note has a nonrecourse provision providing that the  consumer is not obligated for an amount greater than the value of the  house, the creditor must nonetheless assume that the full amount to be  disbursed will be repaid. In this case, however, the creditor may  include a statement such as ``The disclosures assume full repayment of  the amount advanced plus accrued interest, although the amount you may  be required to pay is limited by your agreement.''</p><p class="depth0">iv. Some reverse mortgages provide that some or all of the  appreciation in the value of the property will be shared between the  consumer and the creditor. Such loans are considered variable-rate  mortgages, as described in comment 17(c)(1)-11, and the appreciation  feature must be disclosed in accordance with Sec. 1026.18(f)(1). If the  reverse mortgage has a variable interest rate, is written for a term  greater than one year, and is secured by the consumer's principal  dwelling, the shared appreciation feature must be described under Sec.  1026.19(b)(2)(vii).</p><p class="depth0">15. Morris Plan transactions. When a deposit account is created for  the sole purpose of accumulating payments and then is applied to satisfy  entirely the consumer's obligation in the transaction, each deposit made  into the account is considered the same as a payment on a loan for  purposes of making disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">16. Number of transactions. Creditors have flexibility in handling  credit extensions that may be viewed as multiple transactions. For  example:</p><p class="depth0">i. When a creditor finances the credit sale of a radio and a  television on the same day, the creditor may disclose the sales as  either 1 or 2 credit sale transactions.</p><p class="depth0">ii. When a creditor finances a loan along with a credit sale of  health insurance, the creditor may disclose in one of several ways: a  single credit sale transaction, a single loan transaction, or a loan and  a credit sale transaction.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The separate financing of a downpayment in a credit sale  transaction may, but need not, be disclosed as 2 transactions (a credit  sale and a separate transaction for the financing of the downpayment).</p><p class="depth0">17. Special rules for tax refund anticipation loans. Tax refund  loans, also known as refund anticipation loans (RALs), are transactions  in which a creditor will lend up to the amount of a consumer's expected  tax refund. RAL agreements typically require repayment upon demand, but  also may provide that repayment is required when the refund is made. The  agreements also typically provide that if the amount of the refund is  less than the payment due, the consumer must pay the difference.  Repayment often is made by a preauthorized offset to a consumer's  account held with the creditor when the refund has been deposited by  electronic transfer. Creditors may charge fees for RALs in addition to  fees for filing the consumer's tax return electronically. In RAL  transactions subject to the regulation the following special rules  apply:</p><p class="depth0">i. If, under the terms of the legal obligation, repayment of the  loan is required when the refund is received by the consumer (such as by  deposit into the consumer's account), the disclosures should be based on  the creditor's estimate of the time the refund will be delivered even if  the loan also contains a demand clause. The practice of a creditor to  demand repayment upon delivery of refunds does not determine whether the  legal obligation requires that repayment be made at that time; this  determination must be made according to applicable state or other law.  (See comment 17(c)(5)-1 for the rules regarding disclosures if the loan  is payable solely on demand or is payable either on demand or on an  alternate maturity date.)</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the consumer is required to repay more than the amount  borrowed, the difference is a finance charge unless excluded under Sec.  1026.4. In addition, to the extent that any fees charged in connection  with the loan (such as for filing the tax return electronically) exceed  those fees for a comparable cash transaction (that is, filing the tax  return electronically without a loan), the difference must be included  in the finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">18. Pawn Transactions. When, in connection with an extension of  credit, a consumer pledges or sells an item to a pawnbroker creditor in  return for a sum of money and retains the right to redeem the item for a  greater sum (the redemption price) within a specified period of time,  disclosures are required. In addition to other disclosure requirements  that may be applicable under Sec. 1026.18, for purposes of pawn  transactions:</p><p class="depth0">i. The amount financed is the initial sum paid to the consumer. The  pawnbroker creditor need not provide a separate itemization of the  amount financed if that entire amount is paid directly to the consumer  and the disclosed description of the amount financed is ``the amount of  cash given directly to you'' or a similar phrase.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The finance charge is the difference between the initial sum  paid to the consumer and the redemption price plus any other finance  charges paid in connection with the transaction. (See Sec. 1026.4.)</p><p class="depth0">iii. The term of the transaction, for calculating the annual  percentage rate, is the period of time agreed to by the pawnbroker  creditor and the consumer. The term of the transaction does not include  a grace period (including any statutory grace period) after the agreed  redemption date.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 17(c)(2)(i)</p><p class="depth0">1. Basis for estimates. Disclosures may be estimated when the exact  information is unknown at the time disclosures are made. Information is  unknown if it is not reasonably available to the creditor at the time  the disclosures are made. The ``reasonably available'' standard requires  that the creditor, acting in good faith, exercise due diligence in  obtaining information. For example, the creditor must at a minimum  utilize generally accepted calculation tools, but need not invest in the  most sophisticated computer program to make a particular type of  calculation. The creditor normally may rely on the representations of  other parties in obtaining information. For example, the creditor might  look to the consumer for the time of consummation, to insurance  companies for the cost of insurance, or to realtors for taxes and escrow  fees. The creditor may utilize estimates in making disclosures even  though the creditor knows that more precise information will be  available by the point of consummation. However, new disclosures may be  required under Sec. 1026.17(f) or Sec. 1026.19.</p><p class="depth0">2. Labeling estimates. Estimates must be designated as such in the  segregated disclosures. Even though other disclosures are based on the  same assumption on which a specific estimated disclosure was based, the  creditor has some flexibility in labeling the estimates. Generally, only  the particular disclosure for which the exact information is unknown is  labeled as an estimate. However, when several disclosures are affected  because of the unknown information, the creditor   has the option of labeling either every affected disclosure or only the  disclosure primarily affected. For example, when the finance charge is  unknown because the date of consummation is unknown, the creditor must  label the finance charge as an estimate and may also label as estimates  the total of payments and the payment schedule. When many disclosures  are estimates, the creditor may use a general statement, such as ``all  numerical disclosures except the late payment disclosure are  estimates,'' as a method to label those disclosures as estimates.</p><p class="depth0">3. Simple-interest transactions. If consumers do not make timely  payments in a simple-interest transaction, some of the amounts  calculated for Truth in Lending disclosures will differ from amounts  that consumers will actually pay over the term of the transaction.  Creditors may label disclosures as estimates in these transactions. For  example, because the finance charge and total of payments may be larger  than disclosed if consumers make late payments, creditors may label the  finance charge and total of payments as estimates. On the other hand,  creditors may choose not to label disclosures as estimates and may base  all disclosures on the assumption that payments will be made on time,  disregarding any possible inaccuracies resulting from consumers' payment  patterns.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 17(c)(2)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Per-diem interest. This paragraph applies to any numerical amount  (such as the finance charge, annual percentage rate, or payment amount)  that is affected by the amount of the per-diem interest charge that will  be collected at consummation. If the amount of per-diem interest used in  preparing the disclosures for consummation is based on the information  known to the creditor at the time the disclosure document is prepared,  the disclosures are considered accurate under this rule, and affected  disclosures are also considered accurate, even if the disclosures are  not labeled as estimates. For example, if the amount of per-diem  interest used to prepare disclosures is less than the amount of per-diem  interest charged at consummation, and as a result the finance charge is  understated by $200, the disclosed finance charge is considered accurate  even though the understatement is not within the $100 tolerance of Sec.  1026.18(d)(1), and the finance charge was not labeled as an estimate. In  this example, if in addition to the understatement related to the per- diem interest, a $90 fee is incorrectly omitted from the finance charge,  causing it to be understated by a total of $290, the finance charge is  considered accurate because the $90 fee is within the tolerance in Sec.  1026.18(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 17(c)(3)</p><p class="depth0">1. Minor variations. Section 1026.17(c)(3) allows creditors to  disregard certain factors in calculating and making disclosures. For  example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Creditors may ignore the effects of collecting payments in whole  cents. Because payments cannot be collected in fractional cents, it is  often difficult to amortize exactly an obligation with equal payments;  the amount of the last payment may require adjustment to account for the  rounding of the other payments to whole cents.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Creditors may base their disclosures on calculation tools that  assume that all months have an equal number of days, even if their  practice is to take account of the variations in months for purposes of  collecting interest. For example, a creditor may use a calculation tool  based on a 360-day year, when it in fact collects interest by applying a  factor of \1/365\ of the annual rate to 365 days. This rule does not,  however, authorize creditors to ignore, for disclosure purposes, the  effects of applying \1/360\ of an annual rate to 365 days.</p><p class="depth0">2. Use of special rules. A creditor may utilize the special rules in  Sec. 1026.17(c)(3) for purposes of calculating and making all  disclosures for a transaction or may, at its option, use the special  rules for some disclosures and not others.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 17(c)(4)</p><p class="depth0">1. Payment schedule irregularities. When one or more payments in a  transaction differ from the others because of a long or short first  period, the variations may be ignored in disclosing the payment  schedule, finance charge, annual percentage rate, and other terms. For  example:</p><p class="depth0">i. A 36-month auto loan might be consummated on June 8 with payments  due on July 1 and the first of each succeeding month. The creditor may  base its calculations on a payment schedule that assumes 36 equal  intervals and 36 equal installment payments, even though a precise  computation would produce slightly different amounts because of the  shorter first period.</p><p class="depth0">ii. By contrast, in the same example, if the first payment were not  scheduled until August 1, the irregular first period would exceed the  limits in Sec. 1026.17(c)(4); the creditor could not use the special  rule and could not ignore the extra days in the first period in  calculating its disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">2. Measuring odd periods. i. In determining whether a transaction  may take advantage of the rule in Sec. 1026.17(c)(4), the creditor must  measure the variation against a regular period. For purposes of that  rule:</p><p class="depth0">A. The first period is the period from the date on which the finance  charge begins to be earned to the date of the first payment.</p><p class="depth0">B. The term is the period from the date on which the finance charge  begins to be earned to the date of the final payment.</p><p class="depth0">C. The regular period is the most common interval between payments  in the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">ii. In transactions involving regular periods that are monthly,  semimonthly or multiples of a month, the length of the irregular and  regular periods may be calculated on the basis of either the actual  number of days or an assumed 30-day month. In other transactions, the  length of the periods is based on the actual number of days.</p><p class="depth0">3. Use of special rules. A creditor may utilize the special rules in  Sec. 1026.17(c)(4) for purposes of calculating and making some  disclosures but may elect not to do so for all of the disclosures. For  example, the variations may be ignored in calculating and disclosing the  annual percentage rate but taken into account in calculating and  disclosing the finance charge and payment schedule.</p><p class="depth0">4. Relation to prepaid finance charges. Prepaid finance charges,  including ``odd-days'' or ``per-diem'' interest, paid prior to or at  closing may not be treated as the first payment on a loan. Thus,  creditors may not disregard an irregularity in disclosing such finance  charges.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 17(c)(5)</p><p class="depth0">1. Demand disclosures. Disclosures for demand obligations are based  on an assumed 1-year term, unless an alternate maturity date is stated  in the legal obligation. Whether an alternate maturity date is stated in  the legal obligation is determined by applicable law. An alternate  maturity date is not inferred from an informal principal reduction  agreement or a similar understanding between the parties. However, when  the note itself specifies a principal reduction schedule (for example,  ``payable on demand or $2,000 plus interest quarterly''), an alternate  maturity is stated and the disclosures must reflect that date.</p><p class="depth0">2. Future event as maturity date. An obligation whose maturity date  is determined solely by a future event, as for example, a loan payable  only on the sale of property, is not a demand obligation. Because no  demand feature is contained in the obligation, demand disclosures under  Sec. 1026.18(i) are inapplicable. The disclosures should be based on  the creditor's estimate of the time at which the specified event will  occur, and may indicate the basis for the creditor's estimate, as noted  in the commentary to Sec. 1026.17(a).</p><p class="depth0">3. Demand after stated period. Most demand transactions contain a  demand feature that may be exercised at any point during the term, but  certain transactions convert to demand status only after a fixed period.  For example, in states prohibiting due-on-sale clauses, the Federal  National Mortgage Association (FNMA) requires mortgages that it  purchases to include a call option rider that may be exercised after 7  years. These mortgages are generally written as long-term obligations,  but contain a demand feature that may be exercised only within a 30-day  period at 7 years. The disclosures for these transactions should be  based upon the legally agreed-upon maturity date. Thus, if a mortgage  containing the 7-year FNMA call option is written as a 20-year  obligation, the disclosures should be based on the 20-year term, with  the demand feature disclosed under Sec. 1026.18(i).</p><p class="depth0">4. Balloon mortgages. Balloon payment mortgages, with payments based  on a long-term amortization schedule and a large final payment due after  a shorter term, are not demand obligations unless a demand feature is  specifically contained in the contract. For example, a mortgage with a  term of 5 years and a payment schedule based on 20 years would not be  treated as a mortgage with a demand feature, in the absence of any  contractual demand provisions. In this type of mortgage, disclosures  should be based on the 5-year term.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 17(c)(6)</p><p class="depth0">1. Series of advances. Section 1026.17(c)(6)(i) deals with a series  of advances under an agreement to extend credit up to a certain amount.  A creditor may treat all of the advances as a single transaction or  disclose each advance as a separate transaction. If these advances are  treated as 1 transaction and the timing and amounts of advances are  unknown, creditors must make disclosures based on estimates, as provided  in Sec. 1026.17(c)(2). If the advances are disclosed separately,  disclosures must be provided before each advance occurs, with the  disclosures for the first advance provided by consummation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Construction loans. Section 1026.17(c)(6)(ii) provides a flexible  rule for disclosure of construction loans that may be permanently  financed. These transactions have 2 distinct phases, similar to 2  separate transactions. The construction loan may be for initial  construction or subsequent construction, such as rehabilitation or  remodeling. The construction period usually involves several  disbursements of funds at times and in amounts that are unknown at the  beginning of that period, with the consumer paying only accrued interest  until construction is completed. Unless the obligation is paid at that  time, the loan then converts to permanent financing in which the loan  amount is amortized just as in a standard mortgage transaction. Section  1026.17(c)(6)(ii) permits the creditor to give either one combined  disclosure for both the construction financing and the permanent  financing, or a separate set of disclosures for the 2 phases. This rule  is available whether   the consumer is initially obligated to accept construction financing  only or is obligated to accept both construction and permanent financing  from the outset. If the consumer is obligated on both phases and the  creditor chooses to give 2 sets of disclosures, both sets must be given  to the consumer initially, because both transactions would be  consummated at that time. (Appendix D provides a method of calculating  the annual percentage rate and other disclosures for construction loans,  which may be used, at the creditor's option, in disclosing construction  financing.)</p><p class="depth0">3. Multiple-advance construction loans. Section 1026.17(c)(6)(i) and  (ii) are not mutually exclusive. For example, in a transaction that  finances the construction of a dwelling that may be permanently financed  by the same creditor, the construction phase may consist of a series of  advances under an agreement to extend credit up to a certain amount. In  these cases, the creditor may disclose the construction phase as either  1 or more than 1 transaction and also disclose the permanent financing  as a separate transaction.</p><p class="depth0">4. Residential mortgage transaction. See the commentary to Sec.  1026.2(a)(24) for a discussion of the effect of Sec. 1026.17(c)(6) on  the definition of a residential mortgage transaction.</p><p class="depth0">5. Allocation of points. When a creditor utilizes the special rule  in Sec. 1026.17(c)(6) to disclose credit extensions as multiple  transactions, buyers points or similar amounts imposed on the consumer  must be allocated for purposes of calculating disclosures. While such  amounts should not be taken into account more than once in making  calculations, they may be allocated between the transactions in any  manner the creditor chooses. For example, if a construction-permanent  loan is subject to 5 points imposed on the consumer and the creditor  chooses to disclose the 2 phases separately, the 5 points may be  allocated entirely to the construction loan, entirely to the permanent  loan, or divided in any manner between the two. However, the entire 5  points may not be applied twice, that is, to both the construction and  the permanent phases.</p><p class="depth0">17(d) Multiple Creditors; Multiple Consumers</p><p class="depth0">1. Multiple creditors. If a credit transaction involves more than  one creditor:</p><p class="depth0">i. The creditors must choose which of them will make the  disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A single, complete set of disclosures must be provided, rather  than partial disclosures from several creditors.</p><p class="depth0">iii. All disclosures for the transaction must be given, even if the  disclosing creditor would not otherwise have been obligated to make a  particular disclosure. For example, if one of the creditors is the  seller, the total sale price disclosure under Sec. 1026.18(j) must be  made, even though the disclosing creditor is not the seller.</p><p class="depth0">2. Multiple consumers. When two consumers are joint obligors with  primary liability on an obligation, the disclosures may be given to  either one of them. If one consumer is merely a surety or guarantor, the  disclosures must be given to the principal debtor. In rescindable  transactions, however, separate disclosures must be given to each  consumer who has the right to rescind under Sec. 1026.23, although the  disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(b) need only be provided to the  consumer who expresses an interest in a variable-rate loan program.</p><p class="depth0">17(e) Effect of Subsequent Events</p><p class="depth0">1. Events causing inaccuracies. Inaccuracies in disclosures are not  violations if attributable to events occurring after the disclosures are  made. For example, when the consumer fails to fulfill a prior commitment  to keep the collateral insured and the creditor then provides the  coverage and charges the consumer for it, such a change does not make  the original disclosures inaccurate. The creditor may, however, be  required to make new disclosures under Sec. 1026.17(f) or Sec. 1026.19  if the events occurred between disclosure and consummation or under  Sec. 1026.20 if the events occurred after consummation.</p><p class="depth0">17(f) Early Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Change in rate or other terms. Redisclosure is required for  changes that occur between the time disclosures are made and  consummation if the annual percentage rate in the consummated  transaction exceeds the limits prescribed in this section, even if the  initial disclosures would be considered accurate under the tolerances in  Sec. 1026.18(d) or 1026.22(a). To illustrate:</p><p class="depth0">i. General. A. If disclosures are made in a regular transaction on  July 1, the transaction is consummated on July 15, and the actual annual  percentage rate varies by more than \1/8\ of 1 percentage point from the  disclosed annual percentage rate, the creditor must either redisclose  the changed terms or furnish a complete set of new disclosures before  consummation. Redisclosure is required even if the disclosures made on  July 1 are based on estimates and marked as such.</p><p class="depth0">B. In a regular transaction, if early disclosures are marked as  estimates and the disclosed annual percentage rate is within \1/8\ of 1  percentage point of the rate at consummation, the creditor need not  redisclose the changed terms (including the annual percentage rate).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Nonmortgage loan. If disclosures are made on July 1, the  transaction is consummated on July 15, and the finance charge increased  by $35 but the disclosed annual percentage rate is within the permitted  tolerance, the creditor must at least redisclose   the changed terms that were not marked as estimates. (See Sec.  1026.18(d)(2) of this part.)</p><p class="depth0">iii. Mortgage loan. At the time TILA disclosures are prepared in  July, the loan closing is scheduled for July 31 and the creditor does  not plan to collect per-diem interest at consummation. Consummation  actually occurs on August 5, and per-diem interest for the remainder of  August is collected as a prepaid finance charge. Assuming there were no  other changes requiring redisclosure, the creditor may rely on the  disclosures prepared in July that were accurate when they were prepared.  However, if the creditor prepares new disclosures in August that will be  provided at consummation, the new disclosures must take into account the  amount of the per-diem interest known to the creditor at that time.</p><p class="depth0">2. Variable rate. The addition of a variable rate feature to the  credit terms, after early disclosures are given, requires new  disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">3. Content of new disclosures. If redisclosure is required, the  creditor has the option of either providing a complete set of new  disclosures, or providing disclosures of only the terms that vary from  those originally disclosed. (See the commentary to Sec. 1026.19(a)(2).)</p><p class="depth0">4. Special rules. In mortgage transactions subject to Sec. 1026.19,  the creditor must redisclose if, between the delivery of the required  early disclosures and consummation, the annual percentage rate changes  by more than a stated tolerance. When subsequent events occur after  consummation, new disclosures are required only if there is a  refinancing or an assumption within the meaning of Sec. 1026.20.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 17(f)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Irregular transactions. For purposes of this paragraph, a  transaction is deemed to be ``irregular'' according to the definition in  Sec. 1026.22(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0">17(g) Mail or Telephone Orders--Delay in Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Conditions for use. When the creditor receives a mail or  telephone request for credit, the creditor may delay making the  disclosures until the first payment is due if the following conditions  are met:</p><p class="depth0">i. The credit request is initiated without face-to-face or direct  telephone solicitation. (Creditors may, however, use the special rule  when credit requests are solicited by mail.)</p><p class="depth0">ii. The creditor has supplied the specified credit information about  its credit terms either to the individual consumer or to the public  generally. That information may be distributed through advertisements,  catalogs, brochures, special mailers, or similar means.</p><p class="depth0">2. Insurance. The location requirements for the insurance  disclosures under Sec. 1026.18(n) permit them to appear apart from the  other disclosures. Therefore, a creditor may mail an insurance  authorization to the consumer and then prepare the other disclosures to  reflect whether or not the authorization is completed by the consumer.  Creditors may also disclose the insurance cost on a unit-cost basis, if  the transaction meets the requirements of Sec. 1026.17(g).</p><p class="depth0">17(h) Series of Sales--Delay in Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicability. The creditor may delay the disclosures for  individual credit sales in a series of such sales until the first  payment is due on the current sale, assuming the two conditions in this  paragraph are met. If those conditions are not met, the general timing  rules in Sec. 1026.17(b) apply.</p><p class="depth0">2. Basis of disclosures. Creditors structuring disclosures for a  series of sales under Sec. 1026.17(h) may compute the total sale price  as either:</p><p class="depth0">i. The cash price for the sale plus that portion of the finance  charge and other charges applicable to that sale; or</p><p class="depth0">ii. The cash price for the sale, other charges applicable to the  sale, and the total finance charge and outstanding principal.</p><p class="depth0">17(i) Interim Student Credit Extensions</p><p class="depth0">1. Definition. Student credit plans involve extensions of credit for  education purposes where the repayment amount and schedule are not known  at the time credit is advanced. These plans include loans made under any  student credit plan, whether government or private, where the repayment  period does not begin immediately. (Certain student credit plans that  meet this definition are exempt from Regulation Z. See Sec. 1026.3(f).)</p><p class="depth0">2. Relation to other sections. For disclosures made before the  mandatory compliance date of the disclosures required under Sec. Sec.  1026.46, 47, and 48, paragraph 17(i) permitted creditors to omit from  the disclosures the terms set forth in that paragraph at the time the  credit was actually extended. However, creditors were required to make  complete disclosures at the time the creditor and consumer agreed upon  the repayment schedule for the total obligation. At that time, a new set  of disclosures of all applicable items under Sec. 1026.18 was required.  Most student credit plans are subject to the requirements in Sec. Sec.  1026.46, 47, and 48. Consequently, for applications for student credit  plans received on or after the mandatory compliance date of Sec. Sec.  1026.46, 47, and 48, the creditor may not omit from the disclosures the  terms set forth in paragraph 17(i). Instead, the creditor must comply  with Sec. Sec. 1026.46, 47, and 48, if applicable, or with Sec. Sec.  1026.17 and 1026.18.</p><p class="depth0">3. Basis of disclosures. The disclosures given at the time of  execution of the interim note should reflect two annual percentage  rates, one for the interim period and one for the repayment period. The  use of Sec. 1026.17(i) in making disclosures does not, by itself, make  those disclosures estimates. Any portion of the finance charge, such as  statutory interest, that is attributable to the interim period and is  paid by the student (either as a prepaid finance charge, periodically  during the interim period, in one payment at the end of the interim  period, or capitalized at the beginning of the repayment period) must be  reflected in the interim annual percentage rate. Interest subsidies,  such as payments made by either a state or the Federal Government on an  interim loan, must be excluded in computing the annual percentage rate  on the interim obligation, when the consumer has no contingent liability  for payment of those amounts. Any finance charges that are paid  separately by the student at the outset or withheld from the proceeds of  the loan are prepaid finance charges. An example of this type of charge  is the loan guarantee fee. The sum of the prepaid finance charges is  deducted from the loan proceeds to determine the amount financed and  included in the calculation of the finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">4. Consolidation. Consolidation of the interim student credit  extensions through a renewal note with a set repayment schedule is  treated as a new transaction with disclosures made as they would be for  a refinancing. Any unearned portion of the finance charge must be  reflected in the new finance charge and annual percentage rate, and is  not added to the new amount financed. In itemizing the amount financed  under Sec. 1026.18(c), the creditor may combine the principal balances  remaining on the interim extensions at the time of consolidation and  categorize them as the amount paid on the consumer's account.</p><p class="depth0">5. Approved student credit forms. See the commentary to appendix H  regarding disclosure forms approved for use in certain student credit  programs for which applications were received prior to the mandatory  compliance date of Sec. Sec. 1026.46, 1026.47, and 1026.48.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.18--Content of Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. As applicable. i. The disclosures required by this section need  be made only as applicable. Any disclosure not relevant to a particular  transaction may be eliminated entirely. For example:</p><p class="depth0">A. In a loan transaction, the creditor may delete disclosure of the  total sale price.</p><p class="depth0">B. In a credit sale requiring disclosure of the total sale price  under Sec. 1026.18(j), the creditor may delete any reference to a  downpayment where no downpayment is involved.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Where the amounts of several numerical disclosures are the same,  the ``as applicable'' language also permits creditors to combine the  terms, so long as it is done in a clear and conspicuous manner. For  example:</p><p class="depth0">A. In a transaction in which the amount financed equals the total of  payments, the creditor may disclose ``amount financed/total of  payments,'' together with descriptive language, followed by a single  amount.</p><p class="depth0">B. However, if the terms are separated on the disclosure statement  and separate space is provided for each amount, both disclosures must be  completed, even though the same amount is entered in each space.</p><p class="depth0">2. Format. See the commentary to Sec. 1026.17 and appendix H for a  discussion of the format to be used in making these disclosures, as well  as acceptable modifications.</p><p class="depth0">18(a) Creditor</p><p class="depth0">1. Identification of creditor. The creditor making the disclosures  must be identified. This disclosure may, at the creditor's option,  appear apart from the other disclosures. Use of the creditor's name is  sufficient, but the creditor may also include an address and/or  telephone number. In transactions with multiple creditors, any one of  them may make the disclosures; the one doing so must be identified.</p><p class="depth0">18(b) Amount Financed</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure required. The net amount of credit extended must be  disclosed using the term amount financed and a descriptive explanation  similar to the phrase in the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Rebates and loan premiums. In a loan transaction, the creditor  may offer a premium in the form of cash or merchandise to prospective  borrowers. Similarly, in a credit sale transaction, a seller's or  manufacturer's rebate may be offered to prospective purchasers of the  creditor's goods or services. At the creditor's option, these amounts  may be either reflected in the Truth in Lending disclosures or  disregarded in the disclosures. If the creditor chooses to reflect them  in the Sec. 1026.18 disclosures, rather than disregard them, they may  be taken into account in any manner as part of those disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(b)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Downpayments. A downpayment is defined in Sec. 1026.2(a)(18) to  include, at the creditor's option, certain deferred downpayments or  pick-up payments. A deferred downpayment that meets the criteria set  forth in the definition may be treated as part of the downpayment, at  the creditor's option.</p><p class="depth0">i. Deferred downpayments that are not treated as part of the  downpayment (either because they do not meet the definition or because  the creditor simply chooses not to treat them as downpayments) are  included in the amount financed.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Deferred downpayments that are treated as part of the  downpayment are not part of the amount financed under Sec.  1026.18(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(b)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Adding other amounts. Fees or other charges that are not part of  the finance charge and that are financed rather than paid separately at  consummation of the transaction are included in the amount financed.  Typical examples are real estate settlement charges and premiums for  voluntary credit life and disability insurance excluded from the finance  charge under Sec. 1026.4. This paragraph does not include any amounts  already accounted for under Sec. 1026.18(b)(1), such as taxes, tag and  title fees, or the costs of accessories or service policies that the  creditor includes in the cash price.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(b)(3)</p><p class="depth0">1. Prepaid finance charges. i. Prepaid finance charges that are paid  separately in cash or by check should be deducted under Sec.  1026.18(b)(3) in calculating the amount financed. To illustrate:</p><p class="depth0">A. A consumer applies for a loan of $2,500 with a $40 loan fee. The  face amount of the note is $2,500 and the consumer pays the loan fee  separately by cash or check at closing. The principal loan amount for  purposes of Sec. 1026.18(b)(1) is $2,500 and $40 should be deducted  under Sec. 1026.18(b(3), thereby yielding an amount financed of $2,460.</p><p class="depth0">ii. In some instances, as when loan fees are financed by the  creditor, finance charges are incorporated in the face amount of the  note. Creditors have the option, when the charges are not add-on or  discount charges, of determining a principal loan amount under Sec.  1026.18(b)(1) that either includes or does not include the amount of the  finance charges. (Thus the principal loan amount may, but need not, be  determined to equal the face amount of the note.) When the finance  charges are included in the principal loan amount, they should be  deducted as prepaid finance charges under Sec. 1026.18(b)(3). When the  finance charges are not included in the principal loan amount, they  should not be deducted under Sec. 1026.18(b)(3). The following examples  illustrate the application of Sec. 1026.18(b) to this type of  transaction. Each example assumes a loan request of $2,500 with a loan  fee of $40; the creditor assesses the loan fee by increasing the face  amount of the note to $2,540.</p><p class="depth0">A. If the creditor determines the principal loan amount under Sec.  1026.18(b)(1) to be $2,540, it has included the loan fee in the  principal loan amount and should deduct $40 as a prepaid finance charge  under Sec. 1026.18(b)(3), thereby obtaining an amount financed of  $2,500.</p><p class="depth0">B. If the creditor determines the principal loan amount under Sec.  1026.18(b)(1) to be $2,500, it has not included the loan fee in the  principal loan amount and should not deduct any amount under Sec.  1026.18(b)(3), thereby obtaining an amount financed of $2,500.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The same rules apply when the creditor does not increase the  face amount of the note by the amount of the charge but collects the  charge by withholding it from the amount advanced to the consumer. To  illustrate, the following examples assume a loan request of $2,500 with  a loan fee of $40; the creditor prepares a note for $2,500 and advances  $2,460 to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">A. If the creditor determines the principal loan amount under Sec.  1026.18(b)(1) to be $2,500, it has included the loan fee in the  principal loan amount and should deduct $40 as a prepaid finance charge  under Sec. 1026.18(b)(3), thereby obtaining an amount financed of  $2,460.</p><p class="depth0">B. If the creditor determines the principal loan amount under Sec.  1026.18(b)(1) to be $2,460, it has not included the loan fee in the  principal loan amount and should not deduct any amount under Sec.  1026.18(b)(3), thereby obtaining an amount financed of $2,460.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Thus in the examples where the creditor derives the net amount  of credit by determining a principal loan amount that does not include  the amount of the finance charge, no subtraction is appropriate.  Creditors should note, however, that although the charges are not  subtracted as prepaid finance charges in those examples, they are  nonetheless finance charges and must be treated as such.</p><p class="depth0">2. Add-on or discount charges. All finance charges must be deducted  from the amount of credit in calculating the amount financed. If the  principal loan amount reflects finance charges that meet the definition  of a prepaid finance charge in Sec. 1026.2, those charges are included  in the Sec. 1026.18(b)(1) amount and deducted under Sec.  1026.18(b)(3). However, if the principal loan amount includes finance  charges that do not meet the definition of a prepaid finance charge, the  Sec. 1026.18(b)(1) amount must exclude those finance charges. The  following examples illustrate the application of Sec. 1026.18(b) to  these types of transactions. Each example assumes a loan request of  $1000 for 1 year, subject to a 6 percent precomputed interest rate, with  a $10 loan fee paid separately at consummation.</p><p class="depth0">i. The creditor assesses add-on interest of $60 which is added to  the $1000 in loan proceeds for an obligation with a face amount of  $1060. The principal for purposes of Sec. 1026.18(b)(1) is $1000, no  amounts are added under Sec. 1026.18(b)(2), and the $10 loan fee is a  prepaid finance charge to be deducted under Sec. 1026.18(b)(3). The  amount financed is $990.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The creditor assesses discount interest of $60 and distributes  $940 to the consumer, who is liable for an obligation with a face amount  of $1000. The principal under Sec. 1026.18(b)(1) is $940, which results  in an   amount financed of $930, after deduction of the $10 prepaid finance  charge under Sec. 1026.18(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0">iii. The creditor assesses $60 in discount interest by increasing  the face amount of the obligation to $1060, with the consumer receiving  $1000. The principal under Sec. 1026.18(b)(1) is thus $1000 and the  amount financed $990, after deducting the $10 prepaid finance charge  under Sec. 1026.18(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0">18(c) Itemization of Amount Financed</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure required. i. The creditor has 2 alternatives in  complying with Sec. 1026.18(c):</p><p class="depth0">A. The creditor may inform the consumer, on the segregated  disclosures, that a written itemization of the amount financed will be  provided on request, furnishing the itemization only if the customer in  fact requests it.</p><p class="depth0">B. The creditor may provide an itemization as a matter of course,  without notifying the consumer of the right to receive it or waiting for  a request.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Whether given as a matter of course or only on request, the  itemization must be provided at the same time as the other disclosures  required by Sec. 1026.18, although separate from those disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">2. Additional information. Section 1026.18(c) establishes only a  minimum standard for the material to be included in the itemization of  the amount financed. Creditors have considerable flexibility in revising  or supplementing the information listed in Sec. 1026.18(c) and shown in  model form H-3, although no changes are required. The creditor may, for  example, do one or more of the following:</p><p class="depth0">i. Include amounts that reflect payments not part of the amount  financed. For example, escrow items and certain insurance premiums may  be included, as discussed in the commentary to Sec. 1026.18(g).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Organize the categories in any order. For example, the creditor  may rearrange the terms in a mathematical progression that depicts the  arithmetic relationship of the terms.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Add categories. For example, in a credit sale, the creditor may  include the cash price and the downpayment. If the credit sale involves  a trade-in of the consumer's car and an existing lien on that car  exceeds the value of the trade-in amount, the creditor may disclose the  consumer's trade-in value, the creditor's payoff of the existing lien,  and the resulting additional amount financed.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Further itemize each category. For example, the amount paid  directly to the consumer may be subdivided into the amount given by  check and the amount credited to the consumer's savings account.</p><p class="depth0">v. Label categories with different language from that shown in Sec.  1026.18(c). For example, an amount paid on the consumer's account may be  revised to specifically identify the account as ``your auto loan with  us.''</p><p class="depth0">vi. Delete, leave blank, mark ``N/A,'' or otherwise note  inapplicable categories in the itemization. For example, in a credit  sale with no prepaid finance charges or amounts paid to others, the  amount financed may consist of only the cash price less downpayment. In  this case, the itemization may be composed of only a single category and  all other categories may be eliminated.</p><p class="depth0">3. Amounts appropriate to more than one category. When an amount may  appropriately be placed in any of several categories and the creditor  does not wish to revise the categories shown in Sec. 1026.18(c), the  creditor has considerable flexibility in determining where to show the  amount. For example, in a credit sale, the portion of the purchase price  being financed by the creditor may be viewed as either an amount paid to  the consumer or an amount paid on the consumer's account.</p><p class="depth0">4. RESPA transactions. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act  (RESPA) requires creditors to provide a good faith estimate of closing  costs and a settlement statement listing the amounts paid by the  consumer. Transactions subject to RESPA are exempt from the requirements  of Sec. 1026.18(c) if the creditor complies with RESPA's requirements  for a good faith estimate and settlement statement. The itemization of  the amount financed need not be given, even though the content and  timing of the good faith estimate and settlement statement under RESPA  differ from the requirements of Sec. Sec. 1026.18(c) and 1026.19(a)(2).  If a creditor chooses to substitute RESPA's settlement statement for the  itemization when redisclosure is required under Sec. 1026.19(a)(2), the  statement must be delivered to the consumer at or prior to consummation.  The disclosures required by Sec. Sec. 1026.18(c) and 1026.19(a)(2) may  appear on the same page or on the same document as the good faith  estimate or the settlement statement, so long as the requirements of  Sec. 1026.17(a) are met.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(c)(1)(i)</p><p class="depth0">1. Amounts paid to consumer. This encompasses funds given to the  consumer in the form of cash or a check, including joint proceeds  checks, as well as funds placed in an asset account. It may include  money in an interest-bearing account even if that amount is considered a  required deposit under Sec. 1026.18(r). For example, in a transaction  with total loan proceeds of $500, the consumer receives a check for $300  and $200 is required by the creditor to be put into an interest-bearing  account. Whether or not the $200 is a required deposit, it is part of  the amount financed. At the creditor's option, it may be broken out and  labeled in the itemization of the amount financed.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(c)(1)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Amounts credited to consumer's account. The term consumer's  account refers to an account in the nature of a debt with that creditor.  It may include, for example, an unpaid balance on a prior loan, a credit  sale balance or other amounts owing to that creditor. It does not  include asset accounts of the consumer such as savings or checking  accounts.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(c)(1)(iii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Amounts paid to others. This includes, for example, tag and title  fees; amounts paid to insurance companies for insurance premiums;  security interest fees, and amounts paid to credit bureaus, appraisers  or public officials. When several types of insurance premiums are  financed, they may, at the creditor's option, be combined and listed in  one sum, labeled ``insurance'' or similar term. This includes, but is  not limited to, different types of insurance premiums paid to one  company and different types of insurance premiums paid to different  companies. Except for insurance companies and other categories noted in  Sec. 1026.18(c)(1)(iii), third parties must be identified by name.</p><p class="depth0">2. Charges added to amounts paid to others. A sum is sometimes added  to the amount of a fee charged to a consumer for a service provided by a  third party (such as for an extended warranty or a service contract)  that is payable in the same amount in comparable cash and credit  transactions. In the credit transaction, the amount is retained by the  creditor. Given the flexibility permitted in meeting the requirements of  the amount financed itemization (see the commentary to Sec.  1026.18(c)), the creditor in such cases may reflect that the creditor  has retained a portion of the amount paid to others. For example, the  creditor could add to the category ``amount paid to others'' language  such as ``(we may be retaining a portion of this amount).''</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(c)(1)(iv)</p><p class="depth0">1. Prepaid finance charge. Prepaid finance charges that are deducted  under Sec. 1026.18(b)(3) must be disclosed under this section. The  prepaid finance charges must be shown as a total amount but may, at the  creditor's option, also be further itemized and described. All amounts  must be reflected in this total, even if portions of the prepaid finance  charge are also reflected elsewhere. For example, if at consummation the  creditor collects interim interest of $30 and a credit report fee of  $10, a total prepaid finance charge of $40 must be shown. At the  creditor's option, the credit report fee paid to a third party may also  be shown elsewhere as an amount included in Sec. 1026.18(c)(1)(iii).  The creditor may also further describe the 2 components of the prepaid  finance charge, although no itemization of this element is required by  Sec. 1026.18(c)(1)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">2. Prepaid mortgage insurance premiums. RESPA requires creditors to  give consumers a settlement statement disclosing the costs associated  with mortgage loan transactions. Included on the settlement statement  are mortgage insurance premiums collected at settlement, which are  prepaid finance charges. In calculating the total amount of prepaid  finance charges, creditors should use the amount for mortgage insurance  listed on the line for mortgage insurance on the settlement statement  (line 1002 on HUD-1 or HUD 1-A), without adjustment, even if the actual  amount collected at settlement may vary because of RESPA's escrow  accounting rules. Figures for mortgage insurance disclosed in  conformance with RESPA shall be deemed to be accurate for purposes of  Regulation Z.</p><p class="depth0">18(d) Finance Charge</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure required. The creditor must disclose the finance  charge as a dollar amount, using the term finance charge, and must  include a brief description similar to that in Sec. 1026.18(d). The  creditor may, but need not, further modify the descriptor for variable  rate transactions with a phrase such as which is subject to change. The  finance charge must be shown on the disclosures only as a total amount;  the elements of the finance charge must not be itemized in the  segregated disclosures, although the regulation does not prohibit their  itemization elsewhere.</p><p class="depth0">18(d)(2) Other Credit</p><p class="depth0">1. Tolerance. When a finance charge error results in a misstatement  of the amount financed, or some other dollar amount for which the  regulation provides no specific tolerance, the misstated disclosure does  not violate the Act or the regulation if the finance charge error is  within the permissible tolerance under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0">18(e) Annual Percentage Rate</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure required. The creditor must disclose the cost of the  credit as an annual rate, using the term annual percentage rate, plus a  brief descriptive phrase comparable to that used in Sec. 1026.18(e).  For variable rate transactions, the descriptor may be further modified  with a phrase such as which is subject to change. Under Sec.  1026.17(a), the terms annual percentage rate and finance charge must be  more conspicuous than the other required disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">2. Exception. Section 1026.18(e) provides an exception for certain  transactions in which no annual percentage rate disclosure is required.</p><p class="depth0">18(f) Variable Rate</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. The requirements of Sec. 1026.18(f) apply to all  transactions in which the terms of the legal obligation allow the  creditor to increase the rate originally disclosed to the consumer. It  includes not only increases in the interest rate but also increases in  other components, such as the rate of required credit life insurance.  The provisions, however, do not apply to increases resulting from  delinquency (including late payment), default, assumption, acceleration  or transfer of the collateral. Section 1026.18(f)(1) applies to  variable-rate transactions that are not secured by the consumer's  principal dwelling and to those that are secured by the principal  dwelling but have a term of one year or less. Section 1026.18(f)(2)  applies to variable-rate transactions that are secured by the consumer's  principal dwelling and have a term greater than one year. Moreover,  transactions subject to Sec. 1026.18(f)(2) are subject to the special  early disclosure requirements of Sec. 1026.19(b). (However, ``shared- equity'' or ``shared-appreciation'' mortgages are subject to the  disclosure requirements of Sec. 1026.18(f)(1) and not to the  requirements of Sec. Sec. 1026.18(f)(2) and 1026.19(b) regardless of  the general coverage of those sections.) Creditors are permitted under  Sec. 1026.18(f)(1) to substitute in any variable-rate transaction the  disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(b) for those disclosures  ordinarily required under Sec. 1026.18(f)(1). Creditors who provide  variable-rate disclosures under Sec. 1026.19(b) must comply with all of  the requirements of that section, including the timing of disclosures,  and must also provide the disclosures required under Sec.  1026.18(f)(2). Creditors substituting Sec. 1026.19(b) disclosures for  Sec. 1026.18(f)(1) disclosures may, but need not, also provide  disclosures pursuant to Sec. 1026.20(c). (Substitution of disclosures  under Sec. 1026.18(f)(1) in transactions subject to Sec. 1026.19(b) is  not permitted.)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(f)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Terms used in disclosure. In describing the variable rate  feature, the creditor need not use any prescribed terminology. For  example, limitations and hypothetical examples may be described in terms  of interest rates rather than annual percentage rates. The model forms  in appendix H provide examples of ways in which the variable rate  disclosures may be made.</p><p class="depth0">2. Conversion feature. In variable-rate transactions with an option  permitting consumers to convert to a fixed-rate transaction, the  conversion option is a variable-rate feature that must be disclosed. In  making disclosures under Sec. 1026.18(f)(1), creditors should disclose  the fact that the rate may increase upon conversion; identify the index  or formula used to set the fixed rate; and state any limitations on and  effects of an increase resulting from conversion that differ from other  variable-rate features. Because Sec. 1026.18(f)(1)(iv) requires only  one hypothetical example (such as an example of the effect on payments  resulting from changes in the index), a second hypothetical example need  not be given.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(f)(1)(i)</p><p class="depth0">1. Circumstances. The circumstances under which the rate may  increase include identification of any index to which the rate is tied,  as well as any conditions or events on which the increase is contingent.</p><p class="depth0">i. When no specific index is used, any identifiable factors used to  determine whether to increase the rate must be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">ii. When the increase in the rate is purely discretionary, the fact  that any increase is within the creditor's discretion must be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">iii. When the index is internally defined (for example, by that  creditor's prime rate), the creditor may comply with this requirement by  either a brief description of that index or a statement that any  increase is in the discretion of the creditor. An externally defined  index, however, must be identified.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(f)(1)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Limitations. This includes any maximum imposed on the amount of  an increase in the rate at any time, as well as any maximum on the total  increase over the life of the transaction. Except for private education  loans disclosures, when there are no limitations, the creditor may, but  need not, disclose that fact, and limitations do not include legal  limits in the nature of usury or rate ceilings under state or Federal  statutes or regulations. (See Sec. 1026.30 for the rule requiring that  a maximum interest rate be included in certain variable-rate  transactions.) For disclosures with respect to private education loan  disclosures, see comment 47(b)(1)-2.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(f)(1)(iii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Effects. Disclosure of the effect of an increase refers to an  increase in the number or amount of payments or an increase in the final  payment. In addition, the creditor may make a brief reference to  negative amortization that may result from a rate increase. (See the  commentary to Sec. 1026.17(a)(1) regarding directly related  information.) If the effect cannot be determined, the creditor must  provide a statement of the possible effects. For example, if the  exercise of the variable-rate feature may result in either more or  larger payments, both possibilities must be noted.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(f)(1)(iv)</p><p class="depth0">1. Hypothetical example. The example may, at the creditor's option  appear apart from   the other disclosures. The creditor may provide either a standard  example that illustrates the terms and conditions of that type of credit  offered by that creditor or an example that directly reflects the terms  and conditions of the particular transaction. In transactions with more  than one variable-rate feature, only one hypothetical example need be  provided. (See the commentary to Sec. 1026.17(a)(1) regarding  disclosure of more than one hypothetical example as directly related  information.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Hypothetical example not required. The creditor need not provide  a hypothetical example in the following transactions with a variable- rate feature:</p><p class="depth0">i. Demand obligations with no alternate maturity date.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Private education loans as defined in Sec. 1026.46(b)(5).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Multiple-advance construction loans disclosed pursuant to  appendix D, Part I.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(f)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure required. In variable-rate transactions that have a  term greater than one year and are secured by the consumer's principal  dwelling, the creditor must give special early disclosures under Sec.  1026.19(b) in addition to the later disclosures required under Sec.  1026.18(f)(2). The disclosures under Sec. 1026.18(f)(2) must state that  the transaction has a variable-rate feature and that variable-rate  disclosures have been provided earlier. (See the commentary to Sec.  1026.17(a)(1) regarding the disclosure of certain directly related  information in addition to the variable-rate disclosures required under  Sec. 1026.18(f)(2).)</p><p class="depth0">18(g) Payment Schedule</p><p class="depth0">1. Amounts included in repayment schedule. The repayment schedule  should reflect all components of the finance charge, not merely the  portion attributable to interest. A prepaid finance charge, however,  should not be shown in the repayment schedule as a separate payment. The  payments may include amounts beyond the amount financed and finance  charge. For example, the disclosed payments may, at the creditor's  option, reflect certain insurance premiums where the premiums are not  part of either the amount financed or the finance charge, as well as  real estate escrow amounts such as taxes added to the payment in  mortgage transactions.</p><p class="depth0">2. Deferred downpayments. As discussed in the commentary to Sec.  1026.2(a)(18), deferred downpayments or pick-up payments that meet the  conditions set forth in the definition of downpayment may be treated as  part of the downpayment. Even if treated as a downpayment, that amount  may nevertheless be disclosed as part of the payment schedule, at the  creditor's option.</p><p class="depth0">3. Total number of payments. In disclosing the number of payments  for transactions with more than one payment level, creditors may but  need not disclose as a single figure the total number of payments for  all levels. For example, in a transaction calling for 108 payments of  $350, 240 payments of $335, and 12 payments of $330, the creditor need  not state that there will be a total of 360 payments.</p><p class="depth0">4. Timing of payments. i. General rule. Section 1026.18(g) requires  creditors to disclose the timing of payments. To meet this requirement,  creditors may list all of the payment due dates. They also have the  option of specifying the ``period of payments'' scheduled to repay the  obligation. As a general rule, creditors that choose this option must  disclose the payment intervals or frequency, such as ``monthly''or ``bi- weekly,'' and the calendar date that the beginning payment is due. For  example, a creditor may disclose that payments are due ``monthly  beginning on July 1, 1998.'' This information, when combined with the  number of payments, is necessary to define the repayment period and  enable a consumer to determine all of the payment due dates.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Exception. In a limited number of circumstances, the beginning- payment date is unknown and difficult to determine at the time  disclosures are made. For example, a consumer may become obligated on a  credit contract that contemplates the delayed disbursement of funds  based on a contingent event, such as the completion of home repairs.  Disclosures may also accompany loan checks that are sent by mail, in  which case the initial disbursement and repayment dates are solely  within the consumer's control. In such cases, if the beginning-payment  date is unknown the creditor may use an estimated date and label the  disclosure as an estimate pursuant to Sec. 1026.17(c). Alternatively,  the disclosure may refer to the occurrence of a particular event, for  example, by disclosing that the beginning payment is due ``30 days after  the first loan disbursement.'' This information also may be included  with an estimated date to explain the basis for the creditor's estimate.  See comment 17(a)(1)-5.iii.</p><p class="depth0">5. Mortgage insurance. The payment schedule should reflect the  consumer's mortgage insurance payments until the date on which the  creditor must automatically terminate coverage under applicable law,  even though the consumer may have a right to request that the insurance  be cancelled earlier. The payment schedule must reflect the legal  obligation, as determined by applicable state or other law. For example,  assume that under applicable law, mortgage insurance must terminate  after the 130th scheduled monthly payment, and the creditor collects at  closing and places in escrow two months of premiums. If, under the legal  obligation, the creditor will include mortgage insurance   premiums in 130 payments and refund the escrowed payments when the  insurance is terminated, the payment schedule should reflect 130 premium  payments. If, under the legal obligation, the creditor will apply the  amount escrowed to the two final insurance payments, the payment  schedule should reflect 128 monthly premium payments. (For assumptions  in calculating a payment schedule that includes mortgage insurance that  must be automatically terminated, see comments 17(c)(1)-8 and 17(c)(1)- 10.)</p><p class="depth0">6. Mortgage transactions. Section 1026.18(g) applies only to closed- end transactions other than transactions that are subject to Sec.  1026.18(s). Section 1026.18(s) applies to closed-end transactions  secured by real property or a dwelling. Thus, if a closed-end consumer  credit transaction is secured by real property or a dwelling, the  creditor discloses an interest rate and payment summary table in  accordance with Sec. 1026.18(s) and does not observe the requirements  of Sec. 1026.18(g). On the other hand, if a closed-end consumer credit  transaction is not secured by real property or a dwelling, the creditor  discloses a payment schedule in accordance with Sec. 1026.18(g) and  does not observe the requirements of Sec. 1026.18(s).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(g)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Demand obligations. In demand obligations with no alternate  maturity date, the creditor has the option of disclosing only the due  dates or periods of scheduled interest payments in the first year (for  example, ``interest payable quarterly'' or ``interest due the first of  each month''). The amounts of the interest payments need not be shown.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(g)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Abbreviated disclosure. The creditor may disclose an abbreviated  payment schedule when the amount of each regularly scheduled payment  (other than the first or last payment) includes an equal amount to be  applied on principal and a finance charge computed by application of a  rate to the decreasing unpaid balance. This option is also available  when mortgage-guarantee insurance premiums, paid either monthly or  annually, cause variations in the amount of the scheduled payments,  reflecting the continual decrease or increase in the premium due. In  addition, in transactions where payments vary because interest and  principal are paid at different intervals, the two series of payments  may be disclosed separately and the abbreviated payment schedule may be  used for the interest payments. For example, in transactions with fixed  quarterly principal payments and monthly interest payments based on the  outstanding principal balance, the amount of the interest payments will  change quarterly as principal declines. In such cases the creditor may  treat the interest and principal payments as two separate series of  payments, separately disclosing the number, amount, and due dates of  principal payments, and, using the abbreviated payment schedule, the  number, amount, and due dates of interest payments. This option may be  used when interest and principal are scheduled to be paid on the same  date of the month as well as on different dates of the month. The  creditor using this alternative must disclose the dollar amount of the  highest and lowest payments and make reference to the variation in  payments.</p><p class="depth0">2. Combined payment schedule disclosures. Creditors may combine the  option in this paragraph with the general payment schedule requirements  in transactions where only a portion of the payment schedule meets the  conditions of Sec. 1026.18(g)(2). For example, in a graduated payment  mortgage where payments rise sharply for 5 years and then decline over  the next 25 years because of decreasing mortgage insurance premiums, the  first 5 years would be disclosed under the general rule in Sec.  1026.18(g) and the next 25 years according to the abbreviated schedule  in Sec. 1026.18(g)(2).</p><p class="depth0">3. Effect on other disclosures. Section 1026.18(g)(2) applies only  to the payment schedule disclosure. The actual amounts of payments must  be taken into account in calculating and disclosing the finance charge  and the annual percentage rate.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(h) Total of Payments</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure required. The total of payments must be disclosed  using that term, along with a descriptive phrase similar to the one in  the regulation. The descriptive explanation may be revised to reflect a  variable rate feature with a brief phrase such as ``based on the current  annual percentage rate which may change.''</p><p class="depth0">2. Calculation of total of payments. The total of payments is the  sum of the payments disclosed under Sec. 1026.18(g). For example, if  the creditor disclosed a deferred portion of the downpayment as part of  the payment schedule, that payment must be reflected in the total  disclosed under this paragraph. To calculate the total of payments  amount for transactions subject to Sec. 1026.18(s), creditors should  use the rules in Sec. 1026.18(g) and associated commentary and, for  adjustable-rate transactions, comments 17(c)(1)-8 and -10.</p><p class="depth0">3. Exception. Section 1026.18(h) permits creditors to omit  disclosure of the total of payments in single-payment transactions. This  exception does not apply to a transaction calling for a single payment  of principal combined with periodic payments of interest.</p><p class="depth0">4. Demand obligations. In demand obligations with no alternate  maturity date, the creditor may omit disclosure of payment   amounts under Sec. 1026.18(g)(1). In those transactions, the creditor  need not disclose the total of payments.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(i) Demand Feature</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure requirements. The disclosure requirements of this  provision apply not only to transactions payable on demand from the  outset, but also to transactions that are not payable on demand at the  time of consummation but convert to a demand status after a stated  period. In demand obligations in which the disclosures are based on an  assumed maturity of 1 year under Sec. 1026.17(c)(5), that fact must  also be stated. appendix H contains model clauses that may be used in  making this disclosure.</p><p class="depth0">2. Covered demand features. The type of demand feature triggering  the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.18(i) includes only those demand  features contemplated by the parties as part of the legal obligation.  For example, this provision does not apply to transactions that covert  to a demand status as a result of the consumer's default. A due-on-sale  clause is not considered a demand feature. A creditor may, but need not,  treat its contractual right to demand payment of a loan made to its  executive officers as a demand feature to the extent that the  contractual right is required by Regulation O of the Board of Governors  of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR 215.5) or other Federal law.</p><p class="depth0">3. Relationship to payment schedule disclosures. As provided in  Sec. 1026.18(g)(1), in demand obligations with no alternate maturity  date, the creditor need only disclose the due dates or payment periods  of any scheduled interest payments for the first year. If the demand  obligation states an alternate maturity, however, the disclosed payment  schedule must reflect that stated term; the special rule in Sec.  1026.18(g)(1) is not available.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(j) Total Sale Price</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure required. In a credit sale transaction, the total sale  price must be disclosed using that term, along with a descriptive  explanation similar to the one in the regulation. For variable rate  transactions, the descriptive phrase may, at the creditor's option, be  modified to reflect the variable rate feature. For example, the  descriptor may read: ``The total cost of your purchase on credit, which  is subject to change, including your downpayment of * * *.'' The  reference to a downpayment may be eliminated in transactions calling for  no downpayment.</p><p class="depth0">2. Calculation of total sale price. The figure to be disclosed is  the sum of the cash price, other charges added under Sec.  1026.18(b)(2), and the finance charge disclosed under Sec. 1026.18(d).</p><p class="depth0">3. Effect of existing liens. When a credit sale transaction involves  property that is being used as a trade-in (an automobile, for example)  and that has a lien exceeding the value of the trade-in, the total sale  price is affected by the amount of any cash provided. (See comment  2(a)(18)-3.) To illustrate, assume a consumer finances the purchase of  an automobile with a cash price of $20,000. Another vehicle used as a  trade-in has a value of $8,000 but has an existing lien of $10,000,  leaving a $2,000 deficit that the consumer must finance.</p><p class="depth0">i. If the consumer pays $1,500 in cash, the creditor may apply the  cash first to the lien, leaving a $500 deficit, and reflect a  downpayment of $0. The total sale price would include the $20,000 cash  price, an additional $500 financed under Sec. 1026.18(b)(2), and the  amount of the finance charge. Alternatively, the creditor may reflect a  downpayment of $1,500 and finance the $2,000 deficit. In that case, the  total sale price would include the sum of the $20,000 cash price, the  $2,000 lien payoff amount as an additional amount financed, and the  amount of the finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the consumer pays $3,000 in cash, the creditor may apply the  cash first to extinguish the lien and reflect the remainder as a  downpayment of $1,000. The total sale price would reflect the $20,000  cash price and the amount of the finance charge. (The cash payment  extinguishes the trade-in deficit and no charges are added under Sec.  1026.18(b)(2).) Alternatively, the creditor may elect to reflect a  downpayment of $3,000 and finance the $2,000 deficit. In that case, the  total sale price would include the sum of the $20,000 cash price, the  $2,000 lien payoff amount as an additional amount financed, and the  amount of the finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">18(k) Prepayment</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure required. The creditor must give a definitive  statement of whether or not a penalty will be imposed or a rebate will  be given.</p><p class="depth0">i. The fact that no penalty will be imposed may not simply be  inferred from the absence of a penalty disclosure; the creditor must  indicate that prepayment will not result in a penalty.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If a penalty or refund is possible for one type of prepayment,  even though not for all, a positive disclosure is required. This applies  to any type of prepayment, whether voluntary or involuntary as in the  case of prepayments resulting from acceleration.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Any difference in rebate or penalty policy, depending on  whether prepayment is voluntary or not, must not be disclosed with the  segregated disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">2. Rebate-penalty disclosure. A single transaction may involve both  a precomputed finance charge and a finance charge computed by  application of a rate to the unpaid balance (for example, mortgages with  mortgage-guarantee insurance). In these cases, disclosures about both  prepayment rebates   and penalties are required. Sample form H-15 in appendix H illustrates a  mortgage transaction in which both rebate and penalty disclosures are  necessary.</p><p class="depth0">3. Prepaid finance charge. The existence of a prepaid finance charge  in a transaction does not, by itself, require a disclosure under Sec.  1026.18(k). A prepaid finance charge is not considered a penalty under  Sec. 1026.18(k)(1), nor does it require a disclosure under Sec.  1026.18(k)(2). At its option, however, a creditor may consider a prepaid  finance charge to be under Sec. 1026.18(k)(2). If a disclosure is made  under Sec. 1026.18(k)(2) with respect to a prepaid finance charge or  other finance charge, the creditor may further identify that finance  charge. For example, the disclosure may state that the borrower ``will  not be entitled to a refund of the prepaid finance charge'' or some  other term that describes the finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(k)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Penalty. This applies only to those transactions in which the  interest calculation takes account of all scheduled reductions in  principal, as well as transactions in which interest calculations are  made daily. The term penalty as used here encompasses only those charges  that are assessed strictly because of the prepayment in full of a  simple-interest obligation, as an addition to all other amounts. Items  which are penalties include, for example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Interest charges for any period after prepayment in full is made.  (See the commentary to Sec. 1026.17(a)(1) regarding disclosure of  interest charges assessed for periods after prepayment in full as  directly related information.)</p><p class="depth0">ii. A minimum finance charge in a simple-interest transaction. (See  the commentary to Sec. 1026.17(a)(1) regarding the disclosure of a  minimum finance charge as directly related information.) Items which are  not penalties include, for example, loan guarantee fees.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(k)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Rebate of finance charge. i. This applies to any finance charges  that do not take account of each reduction in the principal balance of  an obligation. This category includes, for example:</p><p class="depth0">A. Precomputed finance charges such as add-on charges.</p><p class="depth0">B. Charges that take account of some but not all reductions in  principal, such as mortgage guarantee insurance assessed on the basis of  an annual declining balance, when the principal is reduced on a monthly  basis.</p><p class="depth0">ii. No description of the method of computing earned or unearned  finance charges is required or permitted as part of the segregated  disclosures under this section.</p><p class="depth0">18(l) Late Payment</p><p class="depth0">1. Definition. This paragraph requires a disclosure only if charges  are added to individual delinquent installments by a creditor who  otherwise considers the transaction ongoing on its original terms. Late  payment charges do not include:</p><p class="depth0">i. The right of acceleration.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Fees imposed for actual collection costs, such as repossession  charges or attorney's fees.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Deferral and extension charges.</p><p class="depth0">iv. The continued accrual of simple interest at the contract rate  after the payment due date. However, an increase in the interest rate is  a late payment charge to the extent of the increase.</p><p class="depth0">2. Content of disclosure. Many state laws authorize the calculation  of late charges on the basis of either a percentage or a specified  dollar amount, and permit imposition of the lesser or greater of the 2  charges. The disclosure made under Sec. 1026.18(l) may reflect this  alternative. For example, stating that the charge in the event of a late  payment is 5% of the late amount, not to exceed $5.00, is sufficient.  Many creditors also permit a grace period during which no late charge  will be assessed; this fact may be disclosed as directly related  information. (See the commentary to Sec. 1026.17(a).)</p><p class="depth0">18(m) Security Interest</p><p class="depth0">1. Purchase money transactions. When the collateral is the item  purchased as part of, or with the proceeds of, the credit transaction,  Sec. 1026.18(m) requires only a general identification such as ``the  property purchased in this transaction.'' However, the creditor may  identify the property by item or type instead of identifying it more  generally with a phrase such as ``the property purchased in this  transaction.'' For example, a creditor may identify collateral as ``a  motor vehicle,'' or as ``the property purchased in this transaction.''  Any transaction in which the credit is being used to purchase the  collateral is considered a purchase money transaction and the  abbreviated identification may be used, whether the obligation is  treated as a loan or a credit sale.</p><p class="depth0">2. Nonpurchase money transactions. In nonpurchase money  transactions, the property subject to the security interest must be  identified by item or type. This disclosure is satisfied by a general  disclosure of the category of property subject to the security interest,  such as ``motor vehicles,'' ``securities,'' ``certain household items,''  or ``household goods.'' (Creditors should be aware, however, that the  Federal credit practices rules, as well as some state laws, prohibit  certain security interests in household goods.) At the creditor's  option, however, a more precise identification of the property or goods  may be provided.</p><p class="depth0">3. Mixed collateral. In some transactions in which the credit is  used to purchase the collateral, the creditor may also take other  property of the consumer as security. In those cases, a combined  disclosure must be provided, consisting of an identification of the  purchase money collateral consistent with comment 18(m)-1 and a specific  identification of the other collateral consistent with comment 18(m)-2.</p><p class="depth0">4. After-acquired property. An after-acquired property clause is not  a security interest to be disclosed under Sec. 1026.18(m).</p><p class="depth0">5. Spreader clause. The fact that collateral for pre-existing credit  with the institution is being used to secure the present obligation  constitutes a security interest and must be disclosed. (Such security  interests may be known as ``spreader'' or ``dragnet'' clauses, or as  ``cross-collateralization'' clauses.) A specific identification of that  collateral is unnecessary but a reminder of the interest arising from  the prior indebtedness is required. The disclosure may be made by using  language such as ``collateral securing other loans with us may also  secure this loan.'' At the creditor's option, a more specific  description of the property involved may be given.</p><p class="depth0">6. Terms used in disclosure. No specified terminology is required in  disclosing a security interest. Although the disclosure may, at the  creditor's option, use the term security interest, the creditor may  designate its interest by using, for example, pledge, lien, or mortgage.</p><p class="depth0">7. Collateral from third party. In certain transactions, the  consumer's obligation may be secured by collateral belonging to a third  party. For example, a loan to a student may be secured by an interest in  the property of the student's parents. In such cases, the security  interest is taken in connection with the transaction and must be  disclosed, even though the property encumbered is owned by someone other  than the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">18(n) Insurance and Debt Cancellation</p><p class="depth0">1. Location. This disclosure may, at the creditor's option, appear  apart from the other disclosures. It may appear with any other  information, including the amount financed itemization, any information  prescribed by state law, or other supplementary material. When this  information is disclosed with the other segregated disclosures, however,  no additional explanatory material may be included.</p><p class="depth0">2. Debt cancellation. Creditors may use the model credit insurance  disclosures only if the debt cancellation coverage constitutes insurance  under state law. Otherwise, they may provide a parallel disclosure that  refers to debt cancellation coverage.</p><p class="depth0">18(o) Certain Security Interest Charges</p><p class="depth0">1. Format. No special format is required for these disclosures;  under Sec. 1026.4(e), taxes and fees paid to government officials with  respect to a security interest may be aggregated, or may be broken down  by individual charge. For example, the disclosure could be labeled  ``filing fees and taxes'' and all funds disbursed for such purposes may  be aggregated in a single disclosure. This disclosure may appear, at the  creditor's option, apart from the other required disclosures. The  inclusion of this information on a statement required under the Real  Estate Settlement Procedures Act is sufficient disclosure for purposes  of Truth in Lending.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(p) Contract Reference</p><p class="depth0">1. Content. Creditors may substitute, for the phrase ``appropriate  contract document,'' a reference to specific transaction documents in  which the additional information is found, such as ``promissory note''  or ``retail installment sale contract.'' A creditor may, at its option,  delete inapplicable items in the contract reference, as for example when  the contract documents contain no information regarding the right of  acceleration.</p><p class="depth0">18(q) Assumption Policy</p><p class="depth0">1. Policy statement. In many mortgages, the creditor cannot  determine, at the time disclosure must be made, whether a loan may be  assumable at a future date on its original terms. For example, the  assumption clause commonly used in mortgages sold to the Federal  National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage  Corporation conditions an assumption on a variety of factors such as the  creditworthiness of the subsequent borrower, the potential for  impairment of the lender's security, and execution of an assumption  agreement by the subsequent borrower. In cases where uncertainty exists  as to the future assumability of a mortgage, the disclosure under Sec.  1026.18(q) should reflect that fact. In making disclosures in such  cases, the creditor may use phrases such as ``subject to conditions,''  ``under certain circumstances,'' or ``depending on future conditions.''  The creditor may provide a brief reference to more specific criteria  such as a due-on-sale clause, although a complete explanation of all  conditions is not appropriate. For example, the disclosure may state,  ``Someone buying your home may be allowed to assume the mortgage on its  original terms, subject to certain conditions, such as payment of an  assumption fee.'' See comment 17(a)(1)-5 for an example for a reference  to a due-on-sale clause.</p><p class="depth0">2. Original terms. The phrase original terms for purposes of Sec.  1026.18(q) does not preclude the imposition of an assumption fee, but a  modification of the basic credit agreement,   such as a change in the contract interest rate, represents different  terms.</p><p class="depth0">18(r) Required Deposit</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure required. The creditor must inform the consumer of the  existence of a required deposit. (Appendix H provides a model clause  that may be used in making that disclosure.) Section 1026.18(r)  describes 3 types of deposits that need not be considered required  deposits. Use of the phrase ``need not'' permits creditors to include  the disclosure even in cases where there is doubt as to whether the  deposit constitutes a required deposit.</p><p class="depth0">2. Pledged account mortgages. In these transactions, a consumer  pledges as collateral funds that the consumer deposits in an account  held by the creditor. The creditor withdraws sums from that account to  supplement the consumer's periodic payments. Creditors may treat these  pledged accounts as required deposits or they may treat them as consumer  buydowns in accordance with the commentary to Sec. 1026.17(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0">3. Escrow accounts. The escrow exception in Sec. 1026.18(r)  applies, for example, to accounts for such items as maintenance fees,  repairs, or improvements, whether in a realty or a nonrealty  transaction. (See the commentary to Sec. 1026.17(c)(1) regarding the  use of escrow accounts in consumer buydown transactions.)</p><p class="depth0">4. Interest-bearing accounts. When a deposit earns at least 5  percent interest per year, no disclosure is required under Sec.  1026.18(r). This exception applies whether the deposit is held by the  creditor or by a third party.</p><p class="depth0">5. Morris Plan transactions. A deposit under a Morris Plan, in which  a deposit account is created for the sole purpose of accumulating  payments and this is applied to satisfy entirely the consumer's  obligation in the transaction, is not a required deposit.</p><p class="depth0">6. Examples of amounts excluded. The following are among the types  of deposits that need not be treated as required deposits:</p><p class="depth0">i. Requirement that a borrower be a customer or a member even if  that involves a fee or a minimum balance.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Required property insurance escrow on a mobile home transaction.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Refund of interest when the obligation is paid in full.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Deposits that are immediately available to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">v. Funds deposited with the creditor to be disbursed (for example,  for construction) before the loan proceeds are advanced.</p><p class="depth0">vi. Escrow of condominium fees.</p><p class="depth0">vii. Escrow of loan proceeds to be released when the repairs are  completed.</p><p class="depth0">18(s) Interest Rate and Payment Summary for Mortgage Transactions</p><p class="depth0">1. In general. Section 1026.18(s) prescribes format and content for  disclosure of interest rates and monthly (or other periodic) payments  for mortgage loans. The information in Sec. 1026.18(s)(2)-(4) is  required to be in the form of a table, except as otherwise provided,  with headings and format substantially similar to Model Clause H-4(E),  H-4(F), H-4(G), or H-4(H) in appendix H to this part. A disclosure that  does not include the shading shown in a model clause but otherwise  follows the model clause's headings and format is substantially similar  to that model clause. Where Sec. 1026.18(s)(2)-(4) or the applicable  model clause requires that a column or row of the table be labeled using  the word ``monthly'' but the periodic payments are not due monthly, the  creditor should use the appropriate term, such as ``bi-weekly'' or  ``quarterly.'' In all cases, the table should have no more than five  vertical columns corresponding to applicable interest rates at various  times during the loan's term; corresponding payments would be shown in  horizontal rows. Certain loan types and terms are defined for purposes  of Sec. 1026.18(s) in Sec. 1026.18(s)(7).</p><p class="depth0">2. Amortizing loans. Loans described as amortizing in Sec. Sec.  1026.18(s)(2)(i) and 1026.18(s)(3) include interest-only loans if they  do not also permit negative amortization. (For rules relating to loans  with balloon payments, see Sec. 1026.18(s)(5)). If an amortizing loan  is an adjustable-rate mortgage with an introductory rate (less than the  fully-indexed rate), creditors must provide a special explanation of  introductory rates. See Sec. 1026.18(s)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">3. Negative amortization. For negative amortization loans, creditors  must follow the rules in Sec. Sec. 1026.18(s)(2)(ii) and 1026.18(s)(4)  in disclosing interest rates and monthly payments. Loans with negative  amortization also require special explanatory disclosures about rates  and payments. See Sec. 1026.18(s)(6). Loans with negative amortization  include ``payment option'' loans, in which the consumer is permitted to  make minimum payments that will cover only some of the interest accruing  each month. See also comment 17(c)(1)-12, regarding graduated-payment  adjustable-rate mortgages.</p><p class="depth0">18(s)(2) Interest Rates</p><p class="depth0">18(s)(2)(i) Amortizing Loans</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(s)(2)(i)(A)</p><p class="depth0">1. Fixed rate loans--payment increases. Although the interest rate  will not change after consummation for a fixed-rate loan, some fixed- rate loans may have periodic payments that increase after consummation.   For example, the terms of the legal obligation may permit the consumer  to make interest-only payments for a specified period such as the first  five years after consummation. In such cases, the creditor must include  the increased payment under Sec. 1026.18(s)(3)(ii)(B) in the payment  row, and must show the interest rate in the column for that payment,  even though the rate has not changed since consummation. See also  comment 17(c)(1)-13, regarding growth equity mortgages.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(s)(2)(i)(B)</p><p class="depth0">1. Adjustable-rate mortgages and step-rate mortgages. Creditors must  disclose more than one interest rate for adjustable-rate mortgages and  step-rate mortgages, in accordance with Sec. 1026.18(s)(2)(i)(B).  Creditors must assume that an adjustable-rate mortgage's interest rate  will increase after consummation as rapidly as possible, taking into  account the terms of the legal obligation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Maximum interest rate during first five years--adjustable-rate  mortgages and step-rate mortgages. The creditor must disclose the  maximum rate that could apply during the first five years after  consummation. If there are no interest rate caps other than the maximum  rate required under Sec. 1026.30, then the creditor should disclose  only the rate at consummation and the maximum rate. Such a table would  have only two columns.</p><p class="depth0">i. For an adjustable-rate mortgage, the creditor must take into  account any interest rate caps when disclosing the maximum interest rate  during the first five years. The creditor must also disclose the  earliest date on which that adjustment may occur.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the transaction is a step-rate mortgage, the creditor should  disclose the rate that will apply after consummation. For example, the  legal obligation may provide that the rate is 6 percent for the first  two years following consummation, and then increases to 7 percent for at  least the next three years. The creditor should disclose the maximum  rate during the first five years as 7 percent and the date on which the  rate is scheduled to increase to 7 percent.</p><p class="depth0">3. Maximum interest rate at any time. The creditor must disclose the  maximum rate that could apply at any time during the term of the loan  and the earliest date on which the maximum rate could apply.</p><p class="depth0">i. For an adjustable-rate mortgage, the creditor must take into  account any interest rate caps in disclosing the maximum interest rate.  For example, if the legal obligation provides that at each annual  adjustment the rate may increase by no more than 2 percentage points,  the creditor must take this limit into account in determining the  earliest date on which the maximum possible rate may be reached.</p><p class="depth0">ii. For a step-rate mortgage, the creditor should disclose the  highest rate that could apply under the terms of the legal obligation  and the date on which that rate will first apply.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(s)(2)(i)(C)</p><p class="depth0">1. Payment increases. For some loans, the payment may increase  following consummation for reasons unrelated to an interest rate  adjustment. For example, an adjustable-rate mortgage may have an  introductory fixed rate for the first five years following consummation  and permit the borrower to make interest-only payments for the first  three years. The disclosure requirement of Sec. 1026.18(s)(2)(i)(C)  applies to all amortizing loans, including interest-only loans, if the  consumer's payment can increase in the manner described in Sec.  1026.18(s)(3)(i)(B), even if it is not the type of loan covered by Sec.  1026.18(s)(3)(i). Thus, Sec. 1026.18(s)(2)(i)(C) requires that the  creditor disclose the interest rate that corresponds to the first  payment that includes principal as well as interest, even though the  interest rate will not adjust at that time. In such cases, if the loan  is an interest-only loan, the creditor also must disclose the  corresponding periodic payment pursuant to Sec. 1026.18(s)(3)(ii). The  table would show, from left to right: The interest rate and payment at  consummation with the payment itemized to show that the payment is being  applied to interest only; the interest rate and payment when the  interest-only option ends; the maximum interest rate and payment during  the first five years; and the maximum possible interest rate and  payment. The disclosure requirements of Sec. 1026.18(s)(2)(i)(C) do not  apply to minor payment variations resulting solely from the fact that  months have different numbers of days.</p><p class="depth0">18(s)(2)(ii) Negative Amortization Loans</p><p class="depth0">1. Rate at consummation. In all cases the interest rate in effect at  consummation must be disclosed, even if it will apply only for a short  period such as one month.</p><p class="depth0">2. Rates for adjustable-rate mortgages. The creditor must assume  that interest rates rise as quickly as possible after consummation, in  accordance with any interest rate caps under the legal obligation. For  adjustable-rate mortgages with no rate caps except a lifetime maximum,  creditors must assume that interest rate reaches the maximum at the  first adjustment. For example, assume that the legal obligation provides  for an interest rate at consummation of 1.5 percent. One month after  consummation, the interest rate adjusts and will adjust monthly  thereafter, according to changes in the index. The consumer may make  payments that cover only part of the interest accrued each month, until  the date the principal balance reaches 115 percent of its original  balance, or   until the end of the fifth year after consummation, whichever comes  first. The maximum possible rate is 10.5 percent. No other limits on  interest rates apply. The minimum required payment adjusts each year,  and may increase by no more than 7.5 percent over the previous year's  payment. The creditor should disclose the following rates and the dates  when they are scheduled to occur: A rate of 1.5 percent for the first  month following consummation and the minimum payment; a rate of 10.5  percent, and the corresponding minimum payment taking into account the  7.5 percent limit on payment increases, at the beginning of the second  year; and a rate of 10.5 percent and the corresponding minimum payment  taking into account the 7.5 percent payment increase limit, at the  beginning of the third year. The creditor also must disclose the rate of  10.5 percent, the fully amortizing payment, and the date on which the  consumer must first make such a payment under the terms of the legal  obligation.</p><p class="depth0">18(s)(2)(iii) Introductory Rate Disclosure for Amortizing Adjustable-</p><p class="depth0">Rate Mortgage</p><p class="depth0">1. Introductory rate. In some adjustable-rate mortgages, creditors  may set an initial interest rate that is lower than the fully indexed  rate at consummation. For amortizing loans with an introductory rate,  creditors must disclose the information required in Sec.  1026.18(s)(2)(iii) directly below the table.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(s)(2)(iii)(B)</p><p class="depth0">1. Place in sequence. ``Designation of the place in sequence''  refers to identifying the month or year, as applicable, of the change in  the rate resulting from the expiration of an introductory rate by its  place in the sequence of months or years, as applicable, of the  transaction's term. For example, if a transaction has a discounted rate  for the first three years, Sec. 1026.18(s)(2)(iii)(B) requires a  statement such as, ``In the fourth year, even if market rates do not  change, this rate will increase to ----%.''</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(s)(2)(iii)(C)</p><p class="depth0">1. Fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is defined in Sec.  1026.18(s)(7) as the index plus the margin at consummation. For purposes  of Sec. 1026.18(s)(2)(iii)(C), ``at consummation'' refers to  disclosures delivered at consummation, or three business days before  consummation pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(a)(2)(ii); for early disclosures  delivered within three business days after receipt of a consumer's  application pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(a)(1), the fully indexed rate  disclosed under Sec. 1026.18(s)(2)(iii)(C) may be based on the index in  effect at the time the disclosures are provided. The index in effect at  consummation (or at the time of early disclosures) need not be used if a  contract provides for a delay in the implementation of changes in an  index value. For example, if the contract specifies that rate changes  are based on the index value in effect 45 days before the change date,  creditors may use any index value in effect during the 45 days before  consummation (or any earlier date of disclosure) in calculating the  fully indexed rate to be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">18(s)(3) Payments for Amortizing Loans</p><p class="depth0">1. Payments corresponding to interest rates. Creditors must disclose  the periodic payment that corresponds to each interest rate disclosed  under Sec. 1026.18(s)(2)(i)(A)-(C). The corresponding periodic payment  is the regular payment for each such interest rate, without regard to  any final payment that differs from others because of the rounding of  periodic payments to account for payment amounts including fractions of  cents. Balloon payments, however, must be disclosed as provided in Sec.  1026.18(s)(5).</p><p class="depth0">2. Principal and interest payment amounts; examples. i. For fixed- rate interest-only transactions, Sec. 1026.18(s)(3)(ii)(B) requires  scheduled increases in the regular periodic payment amounts to be  disclosed along with the date of the increase. For example, in a fixed- rate interest-only loan, a scheduled increase in the payment amount from  an interest-only payment to a fully amortizing payment must be  disclosed. Similarly, in a fixed-rate balloon loan, the balloon payment  must be disclosed in accordance with Sec. 1026.18(s)(5).</p><p class="depth0">ii. For adjustable-rate mortgage transactions, Sec.  1026.18(s)(3)(i)(A) requires that for each interest rate required to be  disclosed under Sec. 1026.18(s)(2)(i) (the interest rate at  consummation, the maximum rate during the first five years, and the  maximum possible rate) a corresponding payment amount must be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The format of the payment disclosure varies depending on  whether all regular periodic payment amounts will include principal and  interest, and whether there will be an escrow account for taxes and  insurance.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(s)(3)(i)(C)</p><p class="depth0">1. Taxes and insurance. An estimated payment amount for taxes and  insurance must be disclosed if the creditor will establish an escrow  account for such amounts. If the escrow account will include amounts for  items other than taxes and insurance, such as homeowners association  dues, the creditor may but is not required to include such items in the  estimate. When such estimated escrow payments must be disclosed in  multiple columns of the table, such as for adjustable- and step-rate  transactions, each column should use the same estimate for taxes and  insurance except that the estimate should reflect changes in periodic  mortgage   insurance premiums that are known to the creditor at the time the  disclosure is made. The estimated amounts of mortgage insurance premiums  should be based on the declining principal balance that will occur as a  result of changes to the interest rate that are assumed for purposes of  disclosing those rates under Sec. 1026.18(s)(2) and accompanying  commentary. The payment amount must include estimated amounts for  property taxes and premiums for mortgage-related insurance required by  the creditor, such as insurance against loss of or damage to property,  or against liability arising out of the ownership or use of the  property, or insurance protecting the creditor against the consumer's  default or other credit loss. Premiums for credit insurance, debt  suspension and debt cancellation agreements, however, should not be  included. Except for periodic mortgage insurance premiums included in  the escrow payment under Sec. 1026.18(s)(3)(i)(C), amounts included in  the escrow payment disclosure such as property taxes and homeowner's  insurance generally are not finance charges under Sec. 1026.4 and,  therefore, do not affect other disclosures, including the finance charge  and annual percentage rate.</p><p class="depth0">2. Mortgage insurance. Payment amounts under Sec. 1026.18(s)(3)(i)  should reflect the consumer's mortgage insurance payments until the date  on which the creditor must automatically terminate coverage under  applicable law, even though the consumer may have a right to request  that the insurance be cancelled earlier. The payment amount must reflect  the terms of the legal obligation, as determined by applicable state or  other law. For example, assume that under applicable law, mortgage  insurance must terminate after the 130th scheduled monthly payment, and  the creditor collects at closing and places in escrow two months of  premiums. If, under the legal obligation, the creditor will include  mortgage insurance premiums in 130 payments and refund the escrowed  payments when the insurance is terminated, payment amounts disclosed  through the 130th payment should reflect premium payments. If, under the  legal obligation, the creditor will apply the amount escrowed to the two  final insurance payments, payments disclosed through the 128th payment  should reflect premium payments. The escrow amount reflected on the  disclosure should include mortgage insurance premiums even if they are  not escrowed and even if there is no escrow account established for the  transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(s)(3)(i)(D)</p><p class="depth0">1. Total monthly payment. For amortizing loans, each column should  add up to a total estimated payment. The total estimated payment amount  should be labeled. If periodic payments are not due monthly, the  creditor should use the appropriate term such as ``quarterly'' or  ``annually.''</p><p class="depth0">18(s)(3)(ii) Interest-Only Payments</p><p class="depth0">1. Interest-only loans that are also negative amortization loans.  The rules in Sec. 1026.18(s)(3)(ii) for disclosing payments on  interest-only loans apply only if the loan is not also a negative  amortization loan. If the loan is a negative amortization loan, even if  it also has an interest-only feature, payments are disclosed under the  rules in Sec. 1026.18(s)(4).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(s)(3)(ii)(C)</p><p class="depth0">1. Escrows. See the commentary under Sec. 1026.18(s)(3)(i)(C) for  guidance on escrows for purposes of Sec. 1026.18(s)(3)(ii)(C).</p><p class="depth0">18(s)(4) Payments for Negative Amortization Loans</p><p class="depth0">1. Table. Section 1026.18(s)(1) provides that tables shall include  only the information required in Sec. 1026.18(s)(2)-(4). Thus, a table  for a negative amortization loan must contain no more than two  horizontal rows of payments and no more than five vertical columns of  interest rates.</p><p class="depth0">2. Payment amounts. The payment amounts disclosed under Sec.  1026.18(s)(4) are the minimum or fully amortizing periodic payments, as  applicable, corresponding to the interest rates disclosed under Sec.  1026.18(s)(2)(ii). The corresponding periodic payment is the regular  payment for each such interest rate, without regard to any final payment  that differs from the rest because of the rounding of periodic payments  to account for payment amounts including fractions of cents.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(s)(4)(i)</p><p class="depth0">1. Minimum required payments. In one row of the table, the creditor  must disclose the minimum required payment in each column of the table,  corresponding to each interest rate or adjustment required in Sec.  1026.18(s)(2)(ii). The payments in this row must be calculated based on  an assumption that the consumer makes the minimum required payment for  as long as possible under the terms of the legal obligation. This row  should be identified as the minimum payment option, and the statement  required by Sec. 1026.18(s)(4)(i)(C) should be included in the heading  for the row.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(s)(4)(iii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Fully amortizing payments. In one row of the table, the creditor  must disclose the fully amortizing payment in each column of the table,  corresponding to each interest rate required in Sec. 1026.18(s)(2)(ii).  The creditor must assume, for purposes of calculating the amounts in  this row that the consumer makes only fully amortizing payments starting  with the first scheduled payment.</p><p class="depth0">18(s)(5) Balloon Payments</p><p class="depth0">1. General. A balloon payment is one that is more than two times the  regular periodic payment. In a reverse mortgage transaction, the single  payment is not considered a balloon payment. A balloon payment must be  disclosed outside and below the table, unless the balloon payment  coincides with an interest rate adjustment or a scheduled payment  increase. In those cases, the balloon payment must be disclosed in the  table.</p><p class="depth0">18(s)(6) Special Disclosures for Loans With Negative Amortization</p><p class="depth0">1. Escrows. See the commentary under Sec. 1026.18(s)(3)(i)(C) for  guidance on escrows for purposes of Sec. 1026.18(s)(6). Under that  guidance, because mortgage insurance payments decline over a loan's  term, the payment amounts shown in the table should reflect the mortgage  insurance payment that will be applicable at the time each disclosed  periodic payment will be in effect. Accordingly, the disclosed mortgage  insurance payment will be zero if it corresponds to a periodic payment  that will occur after the creditor will be legally required to terminate  mortgage insurance. On the other hand, because only one escrow amount is  disclosed under Sec. 1026.18(s)(6) for negative amortization loans and  escrows are not itemized in the payment amounts, the single escrow  amount disclosed should reflect the mortgage insurance amount that will  be collected at the outset of the loan's term, even though that amount  will decline in the future and ultimately will be discontinued pursuant  to the terms of the mortgage insurance policy.</p><p class="depth0">18(s)(7) Definitions</p><p class="depth0">1. Negative amortization loans. Under Sec. 1026.18(s)(7)(v), a  negative amortization loan is one that requires only a minimum periodic  payment that covers only a portion of the accrued interest, resulting in  negative amortization. For such a loan, Sec. 1026.18(s)(4)(iii)  requires creditors to disclose the fully amortizing periodic payment for  each interest rate disclosed under Sec. 1026.18(s)(2)(ii), in addition  to the minimum periodic payment, regardless of whether the legal  obligation explicitly recites that the consumer may make the fully  amortizing payment. Some loan types that result in negative amortization  do not meet the definition of negative amortization loan for purposes of  Sec. 1026.18(s). These include, for example, loans requiring level,  amortizing payments but having a payment schedule containing gaps during  which interest accrues and is added to the principal balance before  regular, amortizing payments begin (or resume). For example, ``seasonal  income'' loans may provide for amortizing payments during nine months of  the year and no payments for the other three months; the required  minimum payments (when made) are amortizing payments, thus such loans  are not negative amortization loans under Sec. 1026.18(s)(7)(v). An  adjustable-rate loan that has fixed periodic payments that do not adjust  when the interest rate adjusts also would not be disclosed as a negative  amortization loan under Sec. 1026.18(s). For example, assume the  initial rate is 4%, for which the fully amortizing payment is $1500.  Under the terms of the legal obligation, the consumer will make $1500  monthly payments even if the interest rate increases, and the additional  interest is capitalized. The possibility (but not certainty) of negative  amortization occurring after consummation does not make this transaction  a negative amortization loan for purposes of Sec. 1026.18(s). Loans  that do not meet the definition of negative amortization loan, even if  they may have negative amortization, are amortizing loans and are  disclosed under Sec. Sec. 1026.18(s)(2)(i) and 1026.18(s)(3).</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.19--Certain Mortgage and Variable-Rate Transactions</p><p class="depth0">19(a)(1)(i) Time of Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. This section requires early disclosure of credit terms  in mortgage transactions that are secured by a consumer's dwelling  (other than home equity lines of credit subject to Sec. 1026.40 or  mortgage transactions secured by an interest in a timeshare plan) that  are also subject to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA)  and its implementing Regulation X. To be covered by Sec. 1026.19, a  transaction must be a federally related mortgage loan under RESPA.  ``Federally related mortgage loan'' is defined under RESPA (12 U.S.C.  2602) and Regulation X (12 CFR 1024.2), and is subject to any  interpretations by the Bureau.</p><p class="depth0">2. Timing and use of estimates. The disclosures required by Sec.  1026.19(a)(1)(i) must be delivered or mailed not later than three  business days after the creditor receives the consumer's written  application. The general definition of ``business day'' in Sec.  1026.2(a)(6)--a day on which the creditor's offices are open to the  public for substantially all of its business functions--is used for  purposes of Sec. 1026.19(a)(1)(i). See comment 2(a)(6)-1. This general  definition is consistent with the definition of ``business day'' in  Regulation X--a day on which the creditor's offices are open to the  public for carrying on substantially all of its business functions. See  12 CFR 1024.2. Accordingly, the three-business-day period in Sec.  1026.19(a)(1)(i) for making early disclosures coincides with the time  period within which creditors subject to RESPA must provide good faith  estimates of settlement costs. If the creditor does not know the precise  credit terms, the creditor must base the disclosures on the best  information reasonably available and indicate that the disclosures are  estimates under Sec. 1026.17(c)(2). If   many of the disclosures are estimates, the creditor may include a  statement to that effect (such as ``all numerical disclosures except the  late-payment disclosure are estimates'') instead of separately labeling  each estimate. In the alternative, the creditor may label as an estimate  only the items primarily affected by unknown information. (See the  commentary to Sec. 1026.17(c)(2).) The creditor may provide explanatory  material concerning the estimates and the contingencies that may affect  the actual terms, in accordance with the commentary to Sec.  1026.17(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">3. Written application. Creditors may rely on RESPA and Regulation X  (including any interpretations issued by the Bureau) in deciding whether  a ``written application'' has been received. In general, Regulation X  defines ``application'' to mean the submission of a borrower's financial  information in anticipation of a credit decision relating to a federally  related mortgage loan. See 12 CFR 1024.2(b). An application is received  when it reaches the creditor in any of the ways applications are  normally transmitted--by mail, hand delivery, or through an intermediary  agent or broker. (See comment 19(b)-3 for guidance in determining  whether or not the transaction involves an intermediary agent or  broker.) If an application reaches the creditor through an intermediary  agent or broker, the application is received when it reaches the  creditor, rather than when it reaches the agent or broker.</p><p class="depth0">4. Denied or withdrawn applications. The creditor may determine  within the three-business-day period that the application will not or  cannot be approved on the terms requested, as, for example, when a  consumer applies for a type or amount of credit that the creditor does  not offer, or the consumer's application cannot be approved for some  other reason. In that case, or if the consumer withdraws the application  within the three-business-day period, the creditor need not make the  disclosures under this section. If the creditor fails to provide early  disclosures and the transaction is later consummated on the original  terms, the creditor will be in violation of this provision. If, however,  the consumer amends the application because of the creditor's  unwillingness to approve it on its original terms, no violation occurs  for not providing disclosures based on the original terms. But the  amended application is a new application subject to Sec.  1026.19(a)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">5. Itemization of amount financed. In many mortgage transactions,  the itemization of the amount financed required by Sec. 1026.18(c) will  contain items, such as origination fees or points, that also must be  disclosed as part of the good faith estimates of settlement costs  required under RESPA. Creditors furnishing the RESPA good faith  estimates need not give consumers any itemization of the amount  financed.</p><p class="depth0">19(a)(1)(ii) Imposition of Fees</p><p class="depth0">1. Timing of fees. The consumer must receive the disclosures  required by this section before paying or incurring any fee imposed by a  creditor or other person in connection with the consumer's application  for a mortgage transaction that is subject to Sec. 1026.19(a)(1)(i),  except as provided in Sec. 1026.19(a)(1)(iii). If the creditor delivers  the disclosures to the consumer in person, a fee may be imposed anytime  after delivery. If the creditor places the disclosures in the mail, the  creditor may impose a fee after the consumer receives the disclosures  or, in all cases, after midnight on the third business day following  mailing of the disclosures. For purposes of Sec. 1026.19(a)(1)(ii), the  term ``business day'' means all calendar days except Sundays and legal  public holidays referred to in Sec. 1026.2(a)(6). See comment 2(a)(6)- 2. For example, assuming that there are no intervening legal public  holidays, a creditor that receives the consumer's written application on  Monday and mails the early mortgage loan disclosure on Tuesday may  impose a fee on the consumer after midnight on Friday.</p><p class="depth0">2. Fees restricted. A creditor or other person may not impose any  fee, such as for an appraisal, underwriting, or broker services, until  the consumer has received the disclosures required by Sec.  1026.19(a)(1)(i). The only exception to the fee restriction allows the  creditor or other person to impose a bona fide and reasonable fee for  obtaining a consumer's credit history, such as for a credit report(s).</p><p class="depth0">3. Collection of fees. A creditor complies with Sec.  1026.19(a)(1)(ii) if:</p><p class="depth0">i. The creditor receives a consumer's written application directly  from the consumer and does not collect any fee, other than a fee for  obtaining a consumer's credit history, until the consumer receives the  early mortgage loan disclosure.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A third party submits a consumer's written application to a  creditor and both the creditor and third party do not collect any fee,  other than a fee for obtaining a consumer's credit history, until the  consumer receives the early mortgage loan disclosure from the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">iii. A third party submits a consumer's written application to a  second creditor following a prior creditor's denial of an application  made by the same consumer (or following the consumer's withdrawal), and,  if a fee already has been assessed, the new creditor or third party does  not collect or impose any additional fee until the consumer receives an  early mortgage loan disclosure from the new creditor.</p><p class="depth0">19(a)(1)(iii) Exception to Fee Restriction</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirements. A creditor or other person may impose a fee before  the consumer receives the required disclosures if it is for obtaining  the consumer's credit history, such as by purchasing a credit report(s)  on the consumer. The fee also must be bona fide and reasonable in  amount. For example, a creditor may collect a fee for obtaining a credit  report(s) if it is in the creditor's ordinary course of business to  obtain a credit report(s). If the criteria in Sec. 1026.19(a)(1)(iii)  are met, the creditor may describe or refer to this fee, for example, as  an ``application fee.''  19(a)(2) Waiting Periods for Early Disclosures and Corrected Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Business day definition. For purposes of Sec. 1026.19(a)(2),  ``business day'' means all calendar days except Sundays and the legal  public holidays referred to in Sec. 1026.2(a)(6). See comment 2(a)(6)- 2.</p><p class="depth0">2. Consummation after both waiting periods expire. Consummation may  not occur until both the seven-business-day waiting period and the  three-business-day waiting period have expired. For example, assume a  creditor delivers the early disclosures to the consumer in person or  places them in the mail on Monday, June 1, and the creditor then  delivers corrected disclosures in person to the consumer on Wednesday,  June 3. Although Saturday, June 6 is the third business day after the  consumer received the corrected disclosures, consummation may not occur  before Tuesday, June 9, the seventh business day following delivery or  mailing of the early disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(a)(2)(i)</p><p class="depth0">1. Timing. The disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(a)(1)(i) must  be delivered or placed in the mail no later than the seventh business  day before consummation. The seven-business-day waiting period begins  when the creditor delivers the early disclosures or places them in the  mail, not when the consumer receives or is deemed to have received the  early disclosures. For example, if a creditor delivers the early  disclosures to the consumer in person or places them in the mail on  Monday, June 1, consummation may occur on or after Tuesday, June 9, the  seventh business day following delivery or mailing of the early  disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(a)(2)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Conditions for redisclosure. If, at the time of consummation, the  annual percentage rate disclosed is accurate under Sec. 1026.22, the  creditor does not have to make corrected disclosures under Sec.  1026.19(a)(2). If, on the other hand, the annual percentage rate  disclosed is not accurate under Sec. 1026.22, the creditor must make  corrected disclosures of all changed terms (including the annual  percentage rate) so that the consumer receives them not later than the  third business day before consummation. For example, assume consummation  is scheduled for Thursday, June 11 and the early disclosures for a  regular mortgage transaction disclose an annual percentage rate of  7.00%:</p><p class="depth0">i. On Thursday, June 11, the annual percentage rate will be 7.10%.  The creditor is not required to make corrected disclosures under Sec.  1026.19(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0">ii. On Thursday, June 11, the annual percentage rate will be 7.15%.  The creditor must make corrected disclosures so that the consumer  receives them on or before Monday, June 8.</p><p class="depth0">2. Content of new disclosures. If redisclosure is required, the  creditor may provide a complete set of new disclosures, or may  redisclose only the changed terms. If the creditor chooses to provide a  complete set of new disclosures, the creditor may but need not highlight  the new terms, provided that the disclosures comply with the format  requirements of Sec. 1026.17(a). If the creditor chooses to disclose  only the new terms, all the new terms must be disclosed. For example, a  different annual percentage rate will almost always produce a different  finance charge, and often a new schedule of payments; all of these  changes would have to be disclosed. If, in addition, unrelated terms  such as the amount financed or prepayment penalty vary from those  originally disclosed, the accurate terms must be disclosed. However, no  new disclosures are required if the only inaccuracies involve estimates  other than the annual percentage rate, and no variable rate feature has  been added. For a discussion of the requirement to redisclose when a  variable-rate feature is added, see comment 17(f)-2. For a discussion of  redisclosure requirements in general, see the commentary on Sec.  1026.17(f).</p><p class="depth0">3. Timing. When redisclosures are necessary because the annual  percentage rate has become inaccurate, they must be received by the  consumer no later than the third business day before consummation. (For  redisclosures triggered by other events, the creditor must provide  corrected disclosures before consummation. See Sec. 1026.17(f).) If the  creditor delivers the corrected disclosures to the consumer in person,  consummation may occur any time on the third business day following  delivery. If the creditor provides the corrected disclosures by mail,  the consumer is considered to have received them three business days  after they are placed in the mail, for purposes of determining when the  three-business-day waiting period required under Sec. 1026.19(a)(2)(ii)  begins. Creditors that use electronic mail or a courier other than the  postal service may also follow this approach.</p><p class="depth0">4. Basis for annual percentage rate comparison. To determine whether  a creditor must make corrected disclosures under Sec. 1026.22, a  creditor compares (a) what the annual percentage rate will be at  consummation to (b) the annual percentage rate stated in the most recent  disclosures the creditor made to the consumer. For example, assume  consummation for a regular mortgage transaction is scheduled for  Thursday, June 11, the early disclosures provided in May stated an  annual percentage rate of 7.00%, and corrected disclosures received by  the consumer on Friday, June 5 stated an annual percentage rate of  7.15%:</p><p class="depth0">i. On Thursday, June 11, the annual percentage rate will be 7.25%,  which exceeds the most recently disclosed annual percentage rate by less  than the applicable tolerance. The creditor is not required to make  additional corrected disclosures or wait an additional three business  days under Sec. 1026.19(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0">ii. On Thursday, June 11, the annual percentage rate will be 7.30%,  which exceeds the most recently disclosed annual percentage rate by more  than the applicable tolerance. The creditor must make corrected  disclosures such that the consumer receives them on or before Monday,  June 8.</p><p class="depth0">19(a)(3) Consumer's Waiver of Waiting Period Before Consummation</p><p class="depth0">1. Modification or waiver. A consumer may modify or waive the right  to a waiting period required by Sec. 1026.19(a)(2) only after the  creditor makes the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.18. The consumer  must have a bona fide personal financial emergency that necessitates  consummating the credit transaction before the end of the waiting  period. Whether these conditions are met is determined by the facts  surrounding individual situations. The imminent sale of the consumer's  home at foreclosure, where the foreclosure sale will proceed unless loan  proceeds are made available to the consumer during the waiting period,  is one example of a bona fide personal financial emergency. Each  consumer who is primarily liable on the legal obligation must sign the  written statement for the waiver to be effective.</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples of waivers within the seven-business-day waiting period.  Assume the early disclosures are delivered to the consumer in person on  Monday, June 1, and at that time the consumer executes a waiver of the  seven-business-day waiting period (which would end on Tuesday, June 9)  so that the loan can be consummated on Friday, June 5:</p><p class="depth0">i. If the annual percentage rate on the early disclosures is  inaccurate under Sec. 1026.22, the creditor must provide a corrected  disclosure to the consumer before consummation, which triggers the  three-business-day waiting period in Sec. 1026.19(a)(2)(ii). After the  consumer receives the corrected disclosure, the consumer must execute a  waiver of the three-business-day waiting period in order to consummate  the transaction on Friday, June 5.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If a change occurs that does not render the annual percentage  rate on the early disclosures inaccurate under Sec. 1026.22, the  creditor must disclose the changed terms before consummation, consistent  with Sec. 1026.17(f). Disclosure of the changed terms does not trigger  an additional waiting period, and the transaction may be consummated on  June 5 without the consumer giving the creditor an additional  modification or waiver.</p><p class="depth0">3. Examples of waivers made after the seven-business-day waiting  period. Assume the early disclosures are delivered to the consumer in  person on Monday, June 1 and consummation is scheduled for Friday, June  19. On Wednesday, June 17, a change to the annual percentage rate  occurs:</p><p class="depth0">i. If the annual percentage rate on the early disclosures is  inaccurate under Sec. 1026.22, the creditor must provide a corrected  disclosure to the consumer before consummation, which triggers the  three-business-day waiting period in Sec. 1026.19(a)(2). After the  consumer receives the corrected disclosure, the consumer must execute a  waiver of the three-business-day waiting period in order to consummate  the transaction on Friday, June 19.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If a change occurs that does not render the annual percentage  rate on the early disclosures inaccurate under Sec. 1026.22, the  creditor must disclose the changed terms before consummation, consistent  with Sec. 1026.17(f). Disclosure of the changed terms does not trigger  an additional waiting period, and the transaction may be consummated on  Friday, June 19 without the consumer giving the creditor an additional  modification or waiver.</p><p class="depth0">19(a)(4) Notice</p><p class="depth0">1. Inclusion in other disclosures. The notice required by Sec.  1026.19(a)(4) must be grouped together with the disclosures required by  Sec. 1026.19(a)(1)(i) or Sec. 1026.19(a)(2). See comment 17(a)(1)-2  for a discussion of the rules for segregating disclosures. In other  cases, the notice set forth in Sec. 1026.19(a)(4) may be disclosed  together with or separately from the disclosures required under Sec.  1026.18. See comment 17(a)(1)-5.xvi.</p><p class="depth0">19(a)(5) Timeshare Plans</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(a)(5)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Timing. A mortgage transaction secured by a consumer's interest  in a ``timeshare plan,'' as defined in 11 U.S.C. 101(53D), that is also  a federally related mortgage loan under RESPA is subject to the  requirements of Sec. 1026.19(a)(5) instead of the requirements of Sec.  1026.19(a)(1) through Sec. 1026.19(a)(4). See comment 19(a)(1)(i)-1.  Early disclosures for   transactions subject to Sec. 1026.19(a)(5) must be given (a) before  consummation or (b) within three business days after the creditor  receives the consumer's written application, whichever is earlier. The  general definition of ``business day'' in Sec. 1026.2(a)(6)--a day on  which the creditor's offices are open to the public for substantially  all of its business functions--applies for purposes of Sec.  1026.19(a)(5)(ii). See comment 2(a)(6)-1. These timing requirements are  different from the timing requirements under Sec. 1026.19(a)(1)(i).  Timeshare transactions covered by Sec. 1026.19(a)(5) may be consummated  any time after the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(a)(5)(ii) are  provided.</p><p class="depth0">2. Use of estimates. If the creditor does not know the precise  credit terms, the creditor must base the disclosures on the best  information reasonably available and indicate that the disclosures are  estimates under Sec. 1026.17(c)(2). If many of the disclosures are  estimates, the creditor may include a statement to that effect (such as  ``all numerical disclosures except the late-payment disclosure are  estimates'') instead of separately labeling each estimate. In the  alternative, the creditor may label as an estimate only the items  primarily affected by unknown information. (See the commentary to Sec.  1026.17(c)(2).) The creditor may provide explanatory material concerning  the estimates and the contingencies that may affect the actual terms, in  accordance with the commentary to Sec. 1026.17(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">3. Written application. For timeshare transactions, creditors may  rely on comment 19(a)(1)(i)-3 in determining whether a ``written  application'' has been received.</p><p class="depth0">4. Denied or withdrawn applications. For timeshare transactions,  creditors may rely on comment 19(a)(1)(i)-4 in determining that  disclosures are not required by Sec. 1026.19(a)(5)(ii) because the  consumer's application will not or cannot be approved on the terms  requested or the consumer has withdrawn the application.</p><p class="depth0">5. Itemization of amount financed. For timeshare transactions,  creditors may rely on comment 19(a)(1)(i)-5 in determining whether  providing the good faith estimates of settlement costs required by RESPA  satisfies the requirement of Sec. 1026.18(c) to provide an itemization  of the amount financed.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(a)(5)(iii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Consummation or settlement. For extensions of credit secured by a  consumer's timeshare plan, when corrected disclosures are required, they  must be given no later than ``consummation or settlement.''  ``Consummation'' is defined in Sec. 1026.2(a). ``Settlement'' is  defined in Regulation X (12 CFR 1024.2(b)) and is subject to any  interpretations issued by the Bureau. In some cases, a creditor may  delay redisclosure until settlement, which may be at a time later than  consummation. If a creditor chooses to redisclose at settlement,  disclosures may be based on the terms in effect at settlement, rather  than at consummation. For example, in a variable-rate transaction, a  creditor may choose to base disclosures on the terms in effect at  settlement, despite the general rule in comment 17(c)(1)-8 that  variable-rate disclosures should be based on the terms in effect at  consummation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Content of new disclosures. Creditors may rely on comment  19(a)(2)(ii)-2 in determining the content of corrected disclosures  required under Sec. 1026.19(a)(5)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">19(b) Certain Variable-Rate Transactions</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. Section 1026.19(b) applies to all closed-end variable- rate transactions that are secured by the consumer's principal dwelling  and have a term greater than one year. The requirements of this section  apply not only to transactions financing the initial acquisition of the  consumer's principal dwelling, but also to any other closed-end  variable-rate transaction secured by the principal dwelling. Closed-end  variable-rate transactions that are not secured by the principal  dwelling, or are secured by the principal dwelling but have a term of  one year or less, are subject to the disclosure requirements of Sec.  1026.18(f)(1) rather than those of Sec. 1026.19(b). (Furthermore,  ``shared-equity'' or ``shared-appreciation'' mortgages are subject to  the disclosure requirements of Sec. 1026.18(f)(1) rather than those of  Sec. 1026.19(b) regardless of the general coverage of those sections.)  For purposes of this section, the term of a variable-rate demand loan is  determined in accordance with the commentary to Sec. 1026.17(c)(5). In  determining whether a construction loan that may be permanently financed  by the same creditor is covered under this section, the creditor may  treat the construction and the permanent phases as separate transactions  with distinct terms to maturity or as a single combined transaction. For  purposes of the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.18, the creditor  may nevertheless treat the two phases either as separate transactions or  as a single combined transaction in accordance with Sec. 1026.17(c)(6).  Finally, in any assumption of a variable-rate transaction secured by the  consumer's principal dwelling with a term greater than one year,  disclosures need not be provided under Sec. Sec. 1026.18(f)(2)(ii) or  1026.19(b).</p><p class="depth0">2. Timing. A creditor must give the disclosures required under this  section at the time an application form is provided or before the  consumer pays a nonrefundable fee, whichever is earlier.</p><p class="depth0">i. Intermediary agent or broker. In cases where a creditor receives  a written application through an intermediary agent or broker, however,  Sec. 1026.19(b) provides a substitute timing rule requiring the  creditor to deliver the disclosures or place them in the   mail not later than three business days after the creditor receives the  consumer's written application. (See comment 19(b)-3 for guidance in  determining whether or not the transaction involves an intermediary  agent or broker.) This three-day rule also applies where the creditor  takes an application over the telephone.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Telephone request. In cases where the consumer merely requests  an application over the telephone, the creditor must include the early  disclosures required under this section with the application that is  sent to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Mail solicitations. In cases where the creditor solicits  applications through the mail, the creditor must also send the  disclosures required under this section if an application form is  included with the solicitation.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Conversion. In cases where an open-end credit account will  convert to a closed-end transaction subject to this section under a  written agreement with the consumer, disclosures under this section may  be given at the time of conversion. (See the commentary to Sec.  1026.20(a) for information on the timing requirements for Sec.  1026.19(b)(2) disclosures when a variable-rate feature is later added to  a transaction.)</p><p class="depth0">v. Form of electronic disclosures provided on or with electronic  applications. Creditors must provide the disclosures required by this  section (including the brochure) on or with a blank application that is  made available to the consumer in electronic form, such as on a  creditor's Internet Web site. Creditors have flexibility in satisfying  this requirement. There are various methods creditors could use to  satisfy the requirement. Whatever method is used, a creditor need not  confirm that the consumer has read the disclosures. Methods include, but  are not limited to, the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">A. The disclosures could automatically appear on the screen when the  application appears;</p><p class="depth0">B. The disclosures could be located on the same web page as the  application (whether or not they appear on the initial screen), if the  application contains a clear and conspicuous reference to the location  of the disclosures and indicates that the disclosures contain rate, fee,  and other cost information, as applicable;</p><p class="depth0">C. Creditors could provide a link to the electronic disclosures on  or with the application as long as consumers cannot bypass the  disclosures before submitting the application. The link would take the  consumer to the disclosures, but the consumer need not be required to  scroll completely through the disclosures; or</p><p class="depth0">D. The disclosures could be located on the same web page as the  application without necessarily appearing on the initial screen,  immediately preceding the button that the consumer will click to submit  the application.</p><p class="depth0">3. Intermediary agent or broker. i. In certain transactions  involving an ``intermediary agent or broker,'' a creditor may delay  providing disclosures. A creditor may not delay providing disclosures in  transactions involving either a legal agent (as determined by applicable  law) or any other third party that is not an ``intermediary agent or  broker.'' In determining whether or not a transaction involves an  ``intermediary agent or broker'' the following factors should be  considered:</p><p class="depth0">A. The number of applications submitted by the broker to the  creditor as compared to the total number of applications received by the  creditor. The greater the percentage of total loan applications  submitted by the broker in any given period of time, the less likely it  is that the broker would be considered an ``intermediary agent or  broker'' of the creditor during the next period.</p><p class="depth0">B. The number of applications submitted by the broker to the  creditor as compared to the total number of applications received by the  broker. (This factor is applicable only if the creditor has such  information.) The greater the percentage of total loan applications  received by the broker that is submitted to a creditor in any given  period of time, the less likely it is that the broker would be  considered an ``intermediary agent or broker'' of the creditor during  the next period.</p><p class="depth0">C. The amount of work (such as document preparation) the creditor  expects to be done by the broker on an application based on the  creditor's prior dealings with the broker and on the creditor's  requirements for accepting applications, taking into consideration the  customary practice of brokers in a particular area. The more work that  the creditor expects the broker to do on an application, in excess of  what is usually expected of a broker in that area, the less likely it is  that the broker would be considered an ``intermediary agent or broker''  of the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">ii. An example of an ``intermediary agent or broker'' is a broker  who, customarily within a brief period of time after receiving an  application, inquires about the credit terms of several creditors with  whom the broker does business and submits the application to one of  them. The broker is responsible for only a small percentage of the  applications received by that creditor. During the time the broker has  the application, it might request a credit report and an appraisal (or  even prepare an entire loan package if customary in that particular  area).</p><p class="depth0">4. Other variable-rate regulations. Transactions in which the  creditor is required to comply with and has complied with the disclosure  requirements of the variable-rate regulations of other Federal agencies  are exempt from the requirements of Sec. 1026.19(b), by virtue of Sec.  1026.19(d). The exception is also   available to creditors that are required by State law to comply with the  Federal variable-rate regulations noted above. Creditors using this  exception should comply with the timing requirements of those  regulations rather than the timing requirements of Regulation Z in  making the variable-rate disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">5. Examples of variable-rate transactions. i. The following  transactions, if they have a term greater than one year and are secured  by the consumer's principal dwelling, constitute variable-rate  transactions subject to the disclosure requirements of Sec. 1026.19(b).</p><p class="depth0">A. Renewable balloon-payment instruments where the creditor is both  unconditionally obligated to renew the balloon-payment loan at the  consumer's option (or is obligated to renew subject to conditions within  the consumer's control) and has the option of increasing the interest  rate at the time of renewal. (See comment 17(c)(1)-11 for a discussion  of conditions within a consumer's control in connection with renewable  balloon-payment loans.)</p><p class="depth0">B. Preferred-rate loans where the terms of the legal obligation  provide that the initial underlying rate is fixed but will increase upon  the occurrence of some event, such as an employee leaving the employ of  the creditor, and the note reflects the preferred rate. The disclosures  under Sec. Sec. 1026.19(b)(1) and 1026.19(b)(2)(v), (viii), (ix), and  (xii) are not applicable to such loans.</p><p class="depth0">C. ``Price-level-adjusted mortgages'' or other indexed mortgages  that have a fixed rate of interest but provide for periodic adjustments  to payments and the loan balance to reflect changes in an index  measuring prices or inflation. The disclosures under Sec. 1026.19(b)(1)  are not applicable to such loans, nor are the following provisions to  the extent they relate to the determination of the interest rate by the  addition of a margin, changes in the interest rate, or interest rate  discounts: Sec. 1026.19(b)(2)(i), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii),  (viii), and (ix). (See comments 20(c)(1)(ii)-3.ii, 20(d)(1)(ii)-2.ii,  and 30-1 regarding the inapplicability of variable-rate adjustment  notices and interest rate limitations to price-level-adjusted or similar  mortgages.)</p><p class="depth0">ii. Graduated-payment mortgages and step-rate transactions without a  variable-rate feature are not considered variable-rate transactions.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Substitute. Creditors who wish to use publications other than the  Consumer Handbook on Adjustable Rate Mortgages, available on the  Bureau's Web site, must make a good faith determination that their  brochures are suitable substitutes to the Consumer Handbook. A  substitute is suitable if it is, at a minimum, comparable to the  Consumer Handbook in substance and comprehensiveness. Creditors are  permitted to provide more detailed information than is contained in the  Consumer Handbook.</p><p class="depth0">2. Applicability. The Consumer Handbook need not be given for  variable-rate transactions subject to this section in which the  underlying interest rate is fixed. (See comment 19(b)-5 for an example  of a variable-rate transaction where the underlying interest rate is  fixed.)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure for each variable-rate program. A creditor must  provide disclosures to the consumer that fully describe each of the  creditor's variable-rate loan programs in which the consumer expresses  an interest. If a program is made available only to certain customers of  an institution, a creditor need not provide disclosures for that program  to other consumers who express a general interest in a creditor's ARM  programs. Disclosures must be given at the time an application form is  provided or before the consumer pays a nonrefundable fee, whichever is  earlier. If program disclosures cannot be provided because a consumer  expresses an interest in individually negotiating loan terms that are  not generally offered, disclosures reflecting those terms may be  provided as soon as reasonably possible after the terms have been  decided upon, but not later than the time a non-refundable fee is paid.  If a consumer who has received program disclosures subsequently  expresses an interest in other available variable-rate programs subject  to 1026.19(b)(2), or the creditor and consumer decide on a program for  which the consumer has not received disclosures, the creditor must  provide appropriate disclosures as soon as reasonably possible. The  creditor, of course, is permitted to give the consumer information about  additional programs subject to Sec. 1026.19(b) initially.</p><p class="depth0">2. Variable-rate loan program defined. i. Generally, if the  identification, the presence or absence, or the exact value of a loan  feature must be disclosed under this section, variable-rate loans that  differ as to such features constitute separate loan programs. For  example, separate loan programs would exist based on differences in any  of the following loan features:</p><p class="depth0">A. The index or other formula used to calculate interest rate  adjustments.</p><p class="depth0">B. The rules relating to changes in the index value, interest rate,  payments, and loan balance.</p><p class="depth0">C. The presence or absence of, and the amount of, rate or payment  caps.</p><p class="depth0">D. The presence of a demand feature.</p><p class="depth0">E. The possibility of negative amortization.</p><p class="depth0">F. The possibility of interest rate carryover.</p><p class="depth0">G. The frequency of interest rate and payment adjustments.</p><p class="depth0">H. The presence of a discount feature.</p><p class="depth0">I. In addition, if a loan feature must be taken into account in  preparing the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(b)(2)(viii),  variable-rate loans that differ as to that feature constitute separate  programs under Sec. 1026.19(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">ii. If, however, a representative value may be given for a loan  feature or the feature need not be disclosed under Sec. 1026.19(b)(2),  variable-rate loans that differ as to such features do not constitute  separate loan programs. For example, separate programs would not exist  based on differences in the following loan features:</p><p class="depth0">A. The amount of a discount.</p><p class="depth0">B. The amount of a margin.</p><p class="depth0">3. Form of program disclosures. A creditor may provide separate  program disclosure forms for each ARM program it offers or a single  disclosure form that describes multiple programs. A disclosure form may  consist of more than one page. For example, a creditor may attach a  separate page containing the historical payment example for a particular  program. A disclosure form describing more than one program need not  repeat information applicable to each program that is described. For  example, a form describing multiple programs may disclose the  information applicable to all of the programs in one place with the  various program features (such as options permitting conversion to a  fixed rate) disclosed separately. The form, however, must state if any  program feature that is described is available only in conjunction with  certain other program features. Both the separate and multiple program  disclosures may illustrate more than one loan maturity or payment  amortization--for example, by including multiple payment and loan  balance columns in the historical payment example. Disclosures may be  inserted or printed in the Consumer Handbook (or a suitable substitute)  as long as they are identified as the creditor's loan program  disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">4. As applicable. The disclosures required by this section need only  be made as applicable. Any disclosure not relevant to a particular  transaction may be eliminated. For example, if the transaction does not  contain a demand feature, the disclosure required under Sec.  1026.19(b)(2)(x) need not be given. As used in this section, payment  refers only to a payment based on the interest rate, loan balance and  loan term, and does not refer to payment of other elements such as  mortgage insurance premiums.</p><p class="depth0">5. Revisions. A creditor must revise the disclosures required under  this section once a year as soon as reasonably possible after the new  index value becomes available. Revisions to the disclosures also are  required when the loan program changes.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2)(i)</p><p class="depth0">1. Change in interest rate, payment, or term. A creditor must  disclose the fact that the terms of the legal obligation permit the  creditor, after consummation of the transaction, to increase (or  decrease) the interest rate, payment, or term of the loan initially  disclosed to the consumer. For example, the disclosures for a variable- rate program in which the interest rate and payment (but not loan term)  can change might read, ``Your interest rate and payment can change  yearly.'' In transactions where the term of the loan may change due to  rate fluctuations, the creditor must state that fact.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Identification of index or formula. If a creditor ties interest  rate changes to a particular index, this fact must be disclosed, along  with a source of information about the index. For example, if a creditor  uses the weekly average yield on U.S. Treasury Securities adjusted to a  constant maturity as its index, the disclosure might read, ``Your index  is the weekly average yield on U.S. Treasury Securities adjusted to a  constant maturity of one year published weekly in the Wall Street  Journal.'' If no particular index is used, the creditor must briefly  describe the formula used to calculate interest rate changes.</p><p class="depth0">2. Changes at creditor's discretion. If interest rate changes are at  the creditor's discretion, this fact must be disclosed. If an index is  internally defined, such as by a creditor's prime rate, the creditor  should either briefly describe that index or state that interest rate  changes are at the creditor's discretion.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2)(iii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Determination of interest rate and payment. This provision  requires an explanation of how the creditor will determine the  consumer's interest rate and payment. In cases where a creditor bases  its interest rate on a specific index and adjusts the index through the  addition of a margin, for example, the disclosure might read, ``Your  interest rate is based on the index plus a margin, and your payment will  be based on the interest rate, loan balance, and remaining loan term.''  In transactions where paying the periodic payments will not fully  amortize the outstanding balance at the end of the loan term and where  the final payment will equal the periodic payment plus the remaining  unpaid balance, the creditor must disclose this fact. For example, the  disclosure might read, ``Your periodic payments will not fully amortize  your loan and you will be required to make a single payment of the  periodic payment plus the remaining unpaid balance at   the end of the loan term.'' The creditor, however, need not reflect any  irregular final payment in the historical example or in the disclosure  of the initial and maximum rates and payments. If applicable, the  creditor should also disclose that the rate and payment will be rounded.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2)(iv)</p><p class="depth0">1. Current margin value and interest rate. Because the disclosures  can be prepared in advance, the interest rate and margin may be several  months old when the disclosures are delivered. A statement, therefore,  is required alerting consumers to the fact that they should inquire  about the current margin value applied to the index and the current  interest rate. For example, the disclosure might state, ``Ask us for our  current interest rate and margin.''</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2)(v)</p><p class="depth0">1. Discounted and premium interest rate. In some variable-rate  transactions, creditors may set an initial interest rate that is not  determined by the index or formula used to make later interest rate  adjustments. Typically, this initial rate charged to consumers is lower  than the rate would be if it were calculated using the index or formula.  However, in some cases the initial rate may be higher. If the initial  interest rate will be a discount or a premium rate, creditors must alert  the consumer to this fact. For example, if a creditor discounted a  consumer's initial rate, the disclosure might state, ``Your initial  interest rate is not based on the index used to make later  adjustments.'' (See the commentary to Sec. 1026.17(c)(1) for a further  discussion of discounted and premium variable-rate transactions.) In  addition, the disclosure must suggest that consumers inquire about the  amount that the program is currently discounted. For example, the  disclosure might state, ``Ask us for the amount our adjustable rate  mortgages are currently discounted.'' In a transaction with a consumer  buydown or with a third-party buydown that will be incorporated in the  legal obligation, the creditor should disclose the program as a  discounted variable-rate transaction, but need not disclose additional  information regarding the buydown in its program disclosures. (See the  commentary to Sec. 1026.19(b)(2)(viii) for a discussion of how to  reflect the discount or premium in the historical example or the maximum  rate and payment disclosure).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2)(vi)</p><p class="depth0">1. Frequency. The frequency of interest rate and payment adjustments  must be disclosed. If interest rate changes will be imposed more  frequently or at different intervals than payment changes, a creditor  must disclose the frequency and timing of both types of changes. For  example, in a variable-rate transaction where interest rate changes are  made monthly, but payment changes occur on an annual basis, this fact  must be disclosed. In certain ARM transactions, the interval between  loan closing and the initial adjustment is not known and may be  different from the regular interval for adjustments. In such cases, the  creditor may disclose the initial adjustment period as a range of the  minimum and maximum amount of time from consummation or closing. For  example, the creditor might state: ``The first adjustment to your  interest rate and payment will occur no sooner than 6 months and no  later than 18 months after closing. Subsequent adjustments may occur  once each year after the first adjustment.'' (See comments  19(b)(2)(viii)(A)-7 and 19(b)(2)(viii)(B)-4 for guidance on other  disclosures when this alternative disclosure rule is used.)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2)(vii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Rate and payment caps. The creditor must disclose limits on  changes (increases or decreases) in the interest rate or payment. If an  initial discount is not taken into account in applying overall or  periodic rate limitations, that fact must be disclosed. If separate  overall or periodic limitations apply to interest rate increases  resulting from other events, such as the exercise of a fixed-rate  conversion option or leaving the creditor's employ, those limitations  must also be stated. Limitations do not include legal limits in the  nature of usury or rate ceilings under state or Federal statutes or  regulations. (See Sec. 1026.30 for the rule requiring that a maximum  interest rate be included in certain variable-rate transactions.) The  creditor need not disclose each periodic or overall rate limitation that  is currently available. As an alternative, the creditor may disclose the  range of the lowest and highest periodic and overall rate limitations  that may be applicable to the creditor's ARM transactions. For example,  the creditor might state: ``The limitation on increases to your interest  rate at each adjustment will be set at an amount in the following range:  Between 1 and 2 percentage points at each adjustment. The limitation on  increases to your interest rate over the term of the loan will be set at  an amount in the following range: Between 4 and 7 percentage points  above the initial interest rate.'' A creditor using this alternative  rule must include a statement in its program disclosures suggesting that  the consumer ask about the overall rate limitations currently offered  for the creditor's ARM programs. (See comments 19(b)(2)(viii)(A)-6 and  19(b)(2)(viii)(B)-3 for an explanation of the additional requirements  for a creditor using this alternative rule for disclosure of periodic  and overall rate limitations.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Negative amortization and interest rate carryover. A creditor  must disclose, where applicable, the possibility of negative  amortization. For example, the disclosure might state, ``If any of your  payments is not sufficient to cover the interest due, the difference  will be added to your loan amount.'' Loans that provide for more than  one way to trigger negative amortization are separate variable-rate  programs requiring separate disclosures. (See the commentary to Sec.  1026.19(b)(2) for a discussion on the definition of a variable-rate loan  program and the format for disclosure.) If a consumer is given the  option to cap monthly payments that may result in negative amortization,  the creditor must fully disclose the rules relating to the option,  including the effects of exercising the option (such as negative  amortization will occur and the principal loan balance will increase);  however, the disclosure in Sec. 1026.19(b)(2)(viii) need not be  provided.</p><p class="depth0">3. Conversion option. If a loan program permits consumers to convert  their variable-rate loans to fixed-rate loans, the creditor must  disclose that the interest rate may increase if the consumer converts  the loan to a fixed-rate loan. The creditor must also disclose the rules  relating to the conversion feature, such as the period during which the  loan may be converted, that fees may be charged at conversion, and how  the fixed rate will be determined. The creditor should identify any  index or other measure or formula used to determine the fixed rate and  state any margin to be added. In disclosing the period during which the  loan may be converted and the margin, the creditor may use information  applicable to the conversion feature during the six months preceding  preparation of the disclosures and state that the information is  representative of conversion features recently offered by the creditor.  The information may be used until the program disclosures are otherwise  revised. Although the rules relating to the conversion option must be  disclosed, the effect of exercising the option should not be reflected  elsewhere in the disclosures, such as in the historical example or in  the calculation of the initial and maximum interest rate and payments.</p><p class="depth0">4. Preferred-rate loans. Section 1026.19(b) applies to preferred- rate loans, where the rate will increase upon the occurrence of some  event, such as an employee leaving the creditor's employ, whether or not  the underlying rate is fixed or variable. In these transactions, the  creditor must disclose the event that would allow the creditor to  increase the rate such as that the rate may increase if the employee  leaves the creditor's employ. The creditor must also disclose the rules  relating to termination of the preferred rate, such as that fees may be  charged when the rate is changed and how the new rate will be  determined.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2)(viii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Historical example and initial and maximum interest rates and  payments. A creditor may disclose both the historical example and the  initial and maximum interest rates and payments.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2)(viii)(A)</p><p class="depth0">1. Index movement. This section requires a creditor to provide an  historical example, based on a $10,000 loan amount originating in 1977,  showing how interest rate changes implemented according to the terms of  the loan program would have affected payments and the loan balance at  the end of each year during a 15-year period. (In all cases, the  creditor need only calculate the payments and loan balance for the term  of the loan. For example, in a five-year loan, a creditor would show the  payments and loan balance for the five-year term, from 1977 to 1981,  with a zero loan balance reflected for 1981. For the remaining ten  years, 1982-1991, the creditor need only show the remaining index  values, margin and interest rate and must continue to reflect all  significant loan program terms such as rate limitations affecting them.)  Pursuant to this section, the creditor must provide a history of index  values for the preceding 15 years. Initially, the disclosures would give  the index values from 1977 to the present. Each year thereafter, the  revised program disclosures should include an additional year's index  value until 15 years of values are shown. If the values for an index  have not been available for 15 years, a creditor need only go back as  far as the values are available in giving a history and payment example.  In all cases, only one index value per year need be shown. Thus, in  transactions where interest rate adjustments are implemented more  frequently than once per year, a creditor may assume that the interest  rate and payment resulting from the index value chosen will stay in  effect for the entire year for purposes of calculating the loan balance  as of the end of the year and for reflecting other loan program terms.  In cases where interest rate changes are at the creditor's discretion  (see the commentary to Sec. 1026.19(b)(2)(ii)), the creditor must  provide a history of the rates imposed for the preceding 15 years,  beginning with the rates in 1977. In giving this history, the creditor  need only go back as far as the creditor's rates can reasonably be  determined.</p><p class="depth0">2. Selection of index values. The historical example must reflect  the method by which index values are determined under the program. If a  creditor uses an average of index values or any other index formula, the  history given should reflect those values. The creditor should select  one date or, when an average of single values is used as an index, one  period and should base the example on index values measured as of that  same date   or period for each year shown in the history. A date or period at any  time during the year may be selected, but the same date or period must  be used for each year in the historical example. For example, a creditor  could use values for the first business day in July or for the first  week ending in July for each of the 15 years shown in the example.</p><p class="depth0">3. Selection of margin. For purposes of the disclosure required  under Sec. 1026.19(b)(2)(viii)(A), a creditor may select a  representative margin that has been used during the six months preceding  preparation of the disclosures, and should disclose that the margin is  one that the creditor has used recently. The margin selected may be used  until a creditor revises the disclosure form.</p><p class="depth0">4. Amount of discount or premium. For purposes of the disclosure  required under Sec. 1026.19(b)(2)(viii)(A), a creditor may select a  discount or premium (amount and term) that has been used during the six  months preceding preparation of the disclosures, and should disclose  that the discount or premium is one that the creditor has used recently.  The discount or premium should be reflected in the historical example  for as long as the discount or premium is in effect. A creditor may  assume that a discount that would have been in effect for any part of a  year was in effect for the full year for purposes of reflecting it in  the historical example. For example, a 3-month discount may be treated  as being in effect for the entire first year of the example; a 15-month  discount may be treated as being in effect for the first two years of  the example. In illustrating the effect of the discount or premium,  creditors should adjust the value of the interest rate in the historical  example, and should not adjust the margin or index values. For example,  if during the six months preceding preparation of the disclosures the  fully indexed rate would have been 10% but the first year's rate under  the program was 8%, the creditor would discount the first interest rate  in the historical example by 2 percentage points.</p><p class="depth0">5. Term of the loan. In calculating the payments and loan balances  in the historical example, a creditor need not base the disclosures on  each term to maturity or payment amortization that it offers. Instead,  disclosures for ARMs may be based upon terms to maturity or payment  amortizations of 5, 15 and 30 years, as follows: ARMs with terms or  amortizations from over 1 year to 10 years may be based on a 5-year term  or amortization; ARMs with terms or amortizations from over 10 years to  20 years may be based on a 15-year term or amortization; and ARMs with  terms or amortizations over 20 years may be based on a 30-year term or  amortization. Thus, disclosures for ARMs offered with any term from over  1 year to 40 years may be based solely on terms of 5, 15 and 30 years.  Of course, a creditor may always base the disclosures on the actual  terms or amortizations offered. If the creditor bases the disclosures on  5-, 15- or 30-year terms or payment amortization as provided above, the  term or payment amortization used in making the disclosure must be  stated.</p><p class="depth0">6. Rate caps. A creditor using the alternative rule described in  comment 19(b)(2)(vii)-1 for disclosure of rate limitations must base the  historical example upon the highest periodic and overall rate  limitations disclosed under Sec. 1026.19(b)(2)(vii). In addition, the  creditor must state the limitations used in the historical example. (See  comment 19(b)(2)(viii)(B)-3 for an explanation of the use of the highest  rate limitation in other disclosures.)</p><p class="depth0">7. Frequency of adjustments. In certain transactions, creditors may  use the alternative rule described in comment 19(b)(2)(vi)-1 for  disclosure of the frequency of rate and payment adjustments. In such  cases, the creditor may assume for purposes of the historical example  that the first adjustment occurred at the end of the first full year in  which the adjustment could occur. For example, in an ARM in which the  first adjustment may occur between 6 and 18 months after closing and  annually thereafter, the creditor may assume that the first adjustment  occurred at the end of the first year in the historical example. (See  comment 19(b)(2)(viii)(B)-4 for an explanation of how to compute the  maximum interest rate and payment when the initial adjustment period is  not known.)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2)(viii)(B)</p><p class="depth0">1. Initial and maximum interest rates and payments. The disclosure  form must state the initial and maximum interest rates and payments for  a $10,000 loan originated at an initial interest rate (index value plus  margin adjusted by the amount of any discount or premium) in effect as  of an identified month and year for the loan program disclosure. (See  comment 19(b)(2)-5 on revisions to the loan program disclosure.) In  calculating the maximum payment under this paragraph, a creditor should  assume that the interest rate increases as rapidly as possible under the  loan program, and the maximum payment disclosed should reflect the  amortization of the loan during this period. Thus, in a loan with 2  percentage point annual (and 5 percentage point overall) interest rate  limitations or ``caps,'' the maximum interest rate would be 5 percentage  points higher than the initial interest rate disclosed. Moreover, the  loan would not reach the maximum interest rate until the fourth year  because of the 2 percentage point annual rate limitations, and the  maximum payment disclosed would reflect the amortization of the loan  during this period. If the loan program includes a discounted or premium  initial interest rate,   the initial interest rate should be adjusted by the amount of the  discount or premium.</p><p class="depth0">2. Term of the loan. In calculating the initial and maximum  payments, the creditor need not base the disclosures on each term to  maturity or payment amortization offered under the program. Instead, the  creditor may follow the rules set out in comment 19(b)(2)(viii)(A)-5. If  a historical example is provided under Sec. 1026.19(b)(2)(viii)(A), the  terms to maturity or payment amortization used in the historical example  must be used in calculating the initial and maximum payment. In  addition, creditors must state the term or payment amortization used in  making the disclosures under this section.</p><p class="depth0">3. Rate caps. A creditor using the alternative rule for disclosure  of interest rate limitations described in comment 19(b)(2)(vii)-1 must  calculate the maximum interest rate and payment based upon the highest  periodic and overall rate limitations disclosed under Sec.  1026.19(b)(2)(vii). In addition, the creditor must state the rate  limitations used in calculating the maximum interest rate and payment.  (See comment 19(b)(2)(viii)(A)-6 for an explanation of the use of the  highest rate limitation in other disclosures.)</p><p class="depth0">4. Frequency of adjustments. In certain transactions, a creditor may  use the alternative rule for disclosure of the frequency of rate and  payment adjustments described in comment 19(b)(2)(vi)-1. In such cases,  the creditor must base the calculations of the initial and maximum rates  and payments upon the earliest possible first adjustment disclosed under  Sec. 1026.19(b)(2)(vi). (See comment 19(b)(2)(viii)(A)-7 for an  explanation of how to disclose the historical example when the initial  adjustment period is not known.)</p><p class="depth0">5. Periodic payment statement. The statement that the periodic  payment may increase or decrease substantially may be satisfied by the  disclosure in paragraph 19(b)(2)(vi) if it states for example, ``your  monthly payment can increase or decrease substantially based on annual  changes in the interest rate.''</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2)(ix)</p><p class="depth0">1. Calculation of payments. A creditor is required to include a  statement on the disclosure form that explains how a consumer may  calculate his or her actual monthly payments for a loan amount other  than $10,000. The example should be based upon the most recent payment  shown in the historical example or upon the initial interest rate  reflected in the maximum rate and payment disclosure. In transactions in  which the latest payment shown in the historical example is not for the  latest year of index values shown (such as in a five-year loan), a  creditor may provide additional examples based on the initial and  maximum payments disclosed under Sec. 1026.19(b)(2)(viii)(B). The  creditor, however, is not required to calculate the consumer's payments.  (See the model clauses in appendix H-4(C).)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2)(x)</p><p class="depth0">1. Demand feature. If a variable-rate loan subject to Sec.  1026.19(b) requirements contains a demand feature as discussed in the  commentary to Sec. 1026.18(i), this fact must be disclosed. (Pursuant  to Sec. 1026.18(i), creditors would also disclose the demand feature in  the standard disclosures given later.)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2)(xi)</p><p class="depth0">1. Adjustment notices. A creditor must disclose to the consumer the  type of information that will be contained in subsequent notices of  adjustments and when such notices will be provided. (See the commentary  to Sec. 1026.20(c) and (d) regarding notices of adjustments.) For  example, the disclosure provided pursuant to Sec. 1026.20(d) might  state, ``You will be notified at least 210, but no more than 240, days  before the first payment at the adjusted level is due after the initial  interest rate adjustment of the loan. This notice will contain  information about the adjustment, including the interest rate, payment  amount, and loan balance.'' The disclosure provided pursuant to Sec.  1026.20(c) might state, ``You will be notified at least 60, but no more  than 120, days before the first payment at the adjusted level is due  after any interest rate adjustment resulting in a corresponding payment  change. This notice will contain information about the adjustment,  including the interest rate, payment amount, and loan balance.''</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 19(b)(2)(xii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Multiple loan programs. A creditor that offers multiple variable- rate loan programs is required to have disclosures for each variable- rate loan program subject to Sec. 1026.19(b)(2). Unless disclosures for  all of its variable-rate programs are provided initially, the creditor  must inform the consumer that other closed-end variable-rate programs  exist, and that disclosure forms are available for these additional loan  programs. For example, the disclosure form might state, ``Information on  other adjustable rate mortgage programs is available upon request.''</p><p class="depth0">19(c) Electronic Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Form of disclosures. Whether disclosures must be in electronic  form depends upon the following:</p><p class="depth0">i. If a consumer accesses an ARM loan application electronically  (other than as described under ii. below), such as online at a home  computer, the creditor must provide the disclosures in electronic form  (such as with the application form on its Web site) in order to meet the  requirement to provide   disclosures in a timely manner on or with the application. If the  creditor instead mailed paper disclosures to the consumer, this  requirement would not be met.</p><p class="depth0">ii. In contrast, if a consumer is physically present in the  creditor's office, and accesses an ARM loan application electronically,  such as via a terminal or kiosk (or if the consumer uses a terminal or  kiosk located on the premises of an affiliate or third party that has  arranged with the creditor to provide applications to consumers), the  creditor may provide disclosures in either electronic or paper form,  provided the creditor complies with the timing, delivery, and  retainability requirements of the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.20 Disclosure Requirements Regarding Post-Consummation</p><p class="depth0">Events</p><p class="depth0">20(a) Refinancings</p><p class="depth0">1. Definition. A refinancing is a new transaction requiring a  complete new set of disclosures. Whether a refinancing has occurred is  determined by reference to whether the original obligation has been  satisfied or extinguished and replaced by a new obligation, based on the  parties' contract and applicable law. The refinancing may involve the  consolidation of several existing obligations, disbursement of new money  to the consumer or on the consumer's behalf, or the rescheduling of  payments under an existing obligation. In any form, the new obligation  must completely replace the prior one.</p><p class="depth0">i. Changes in the terms of an existing obligation, such as the  deferral of individual installments, will not constitute a refinancing  unless accomplished by the cancellation of that obligation and the  substitution of a new obligation.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A substitution of agreements that meets the refinancing  definition will require new disclosures, even if the substitution does  not substantially alter the prior credit terms.</p><p class="depth0">2. Exceptions. A transaction is subject to Sec. 1026.20(a) only if  it meets the general definition of a refinancing. Section 1026.20(a)(1)  through (5) lists 5 events that are not treated as refinancings, even if  they are accomplished by cancellation of the old obligation and  substitution of a new one.</p><p class="depth0">3. Variable-rate. i. If a variable-rate feature was properly  disclosed under the regulation, a rate change in accord with those  disclosures is not a refinancing. For example, no new disclosures are  required when the variable-rate feature is invoked on a renewable  balloon-payment mortgage that was previously disclosed as a variable- rate transaction.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Even if it is not accomplished by the cancellation of the old  obligation and substitution of a new one, a new transaction subject to  new disclosures results if the creditor either:</p><p class="depth0">A. Increases the rate based on a variable-rate feature that was not  previously disclosed; or</p><p class="depth0">B. Adds a variable-rate feature to the obligation. A creditor does  not add a variable-rate feature by changing the index of a variable-rate  transaction to a comparable index, whether the change replaces the  existing index or substitutes an index for one that no longer exists.</p><p class="depth0">iii. If either of the events in paragraph 20(a)-3.ii.A or ii.B  occurs in a transaction secured by a principal dwelling with a term  longer than one year, the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(b)  also must be given at that time.</p><p class="depth0">4. Unearned finance charge. In a transaction involving precomputed  finance charges, the creditor must include in the finance charge on the  refinanced obligation any unearned portion of the original finance  charge that is not rebated to the consumer or credited against the  underlying obligation. For example, in a transaction with an add-on  finance charge, a creditor advances new money to a consumer in a fashion  that extinguishes the original obligation and replaces it with a new  one. The creditor neither refunds the unearned finance charge on the  original obligation to the consumer nor credits it to the remaining  balance on the old obligation. Under these circumstances, the unearned  finance charge must be included in the finance charge on the new  obligation and reflected in the annual percentage rate disclosed on  refinancing. Accrued but unpaid finance charges are included in the  amount financed in the new obligation.</p><p class="depth0">5. Coverage. Section 1026.20(a) applies only to refinancings  undertaken by the original creditor or a holder or servicer of the  original obligation. A ``refinancing'' by any other person is a new  transaction under the regulation, not a refinancing under this section.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(a)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Renewal. This exception applies both to obligations with a single  payment of principal and interest and to obligations with periodic  payments of interest and a final payment of principal. In determining  whether a new obligation replacing an old one is a renewal of the  original terms or a refinancing, the creditor may consider it a renewal  even if:</p><p class="depth0">i. Accrued unpaid interest is added to the principal balance.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Changes are made in the terms of renewal resulting from the  factors listed in Sec. 1026.17(c)(3).</p><p class="depth0">iii. The principal at renewal is reduced by a curtailment of the  obligation.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(a)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Annual percentage rate reduction. A reduction in the annual  percentage rate with a   corresponding change in the payment schedule is not a refinancing. If  the annual percentage rate is subsequently increased (even though it  remains below its original level) and the increase is effected in such a  way that the old obligation is satisfied and replaced, new disclosures  must then be made.</p><p class="depth0">2. Corresponding change. A corresponding change in the payment  schedule to implement a lower annual percentage rate would be a  shortening of the maturity, or a reduction in the payment amount or the  number of payments of an obligation. The exception in Sec.  1026.20(a)(2) does not apply if the maturity is lengthened, or if the  payment amount or number of payments is increased beyond that remaining  on the existing transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(a)(3)</p><p class="depth0">1. Court agreements. This exception includes, for example,  agreements such as reaffirmations of debts discharged in bankruptcy,  settlement agreements, and post-judgment agreements. (See the commentary  to Sec. 1026.2(a)(14) for a discussion of court-approved agreements  that are not considered ``credit.'')</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(a)(4)</p><p class="depth0">1. Workout agreements. A workout agreement is not a refinancing  unless the annual percentage rate is increased or additional credit is  advanced beyond amounts already accrued plus insurance premiums.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(a)(5)</p><p class="depth0">1. Insurance renewal. The renewal of optional insurance added to an  existing credit transaction is not a refinancing, assuming that  appropriate Truth in Lending disclosures were provided for the initial  purchase of the insurance.</p><p class="depth0">20(b) Assumptions</p><p class="depth0">1. General definition. i. An assumption as defined in Sec.  1026.20(b) is a new transaction and new disclosures must be made to the  subsequent consumer. An assumption under the regulation requires the  following three elements:</p><p class="depth0">A. A residential mortgage transaction.</p><p class="depth0">B. An express acceptance of the subsequent consumer by the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">C. A written agreement.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The assumption of a nonexempt consumer credit obligation  requires no disclosures unless all three elements are present. For  example, an automobile dealer need not provide Truth in Lending  disclosures to a customer who assumes an existing obligation secured by  an automobile. However, a residential mortgage transaction with the  elements described in Sec. 1026.20(b) is an assumption that calls for  new disclosures; the disclosures must be given whether or not the  assumption is accompanied by changes in the terms of the obligation.  (See comment 2(a)(24)-5 for a discussion of assumptions that are not  considered residential mortgage transactions.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Existing residential mortgage transaction. A transaction may be a  residential mortgage transaction as to one consumer and not to the other  consumer. In that case, the creditor must look to the assuming consumer  in determining whether a residential mortgage transaction exists. To  illustrate: The original consumer obtained a mortgage to purchase a home  for vacation purposes. The loan was not a residential mortgage  transaction as to that consumer. The mortgage is assumed by a consumer  who will use the home as a principal dwelling. As to that consumer, the  loan is a residential mortgage transaction. For purposes of Sec.  1026.20(b), the assumed loan is an ``existing residential mortgage  transaction'' requiring disclosures, if the other criteria for an  assumption are met.</p><p class="depth0">3. Express agreement. Expressly agrees means that the creditor's  agreement must relate specifically to the new debtor and must  unequivocally accept that debtor as a primary obligor. The following  events are not construed to be express agreements between the creditor  and the subsequent consumer:</p><p class="depth0">i. Approval of creditworthiness.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Notification of a change in records.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Mailing of a coupon book to the subsequent consumer.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Acceptance of payments from the new consumer.</p><p class="depth0">4. Retention of original consumer. The retention of the original  consumer as an obligor in some capacity does not prevent the change from  being an assumption, provided the new consumer becomes a primary  obligor. But the mere addition of a guarantor to an obligation for which  the original consumer remains primarily liable does not give rise to an  assumption. However, if neither party is designated as the primary  obligor but the creditor accepts payment from the subsequent consumer,  an assumption exists for purposes of Sec. 1026.20(b).</p><p class="depth0">5. Status of parties. Section 1026.20(b) applies only if the  previous debtor was a consumer and the obligation is assumed by another  consumer. It does not apply, for example, when an individual takes over  the obligation of a corporation.</p><p class="depth0">6. Disclosures. For transactions that are assumptions within this  provision, the creditor must make disclosures based on the ``remaining  obligation.'' For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. The amount financed is the remaining principal balance plus any  arrearages or other accrued charges from the original transaction.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the finance charge is computed from time to time by  application of a percentage rate to an unpaid balance, in determining  the amount of the finance charge and the annual percentage rate to be  disclosed, the   creditor should disregard any prepaid finance charges paid by the  original obligor, but must include in the finance charge any prepaid  finance charge imposed in connection with the assumption.</p><p class="depth0">iii. If the creditor requires the assuming consumer to pay any  charges as a condition of the assumption, those sums are prepaid finance  charges as to that consumer, unless exempt from the finance charge under  Sec. 1026.4. If a transaction involves add-on or discount finance  charges, the creditor may make abbreviated disclosures, as outlined in  Sec. 1026.20(b)(1) through (5). Creditors providing disclosures  pursuant to this section for assumptions of variable-rate transactions  secured by the consumer's principal dwelling with a term longer than one  year need not provide new disclosures under Sec. 1026.18(f)(2)(ii) or  Sec. 1026.19(b). In such transactions, a creditor may disclose the  variable-rate feature solely in accordance with Sec. 1026.18(f)(1).</p><p class="depth0">7. Abbreviated disclosures. The abbreviated disclosures permitted  for assumptions of transactions involving add-on or discount finance  charges must be made clearly and conspicuously in writing in a form that  the consumer may keep. However, the creditor need not comply with the  segregation requirement of Sec. 1026.17(a)(1). The terms annual  percentage rate and total of payments, when disclosed according to Sec.  1026.20(b)(4) and (5), are not subject to the description requirements  of Sec. 1026.18(e) and (h). The term annual percentage rate disclosed  under Sec. 1026.20(b)(4) need not be more conspicuous than other  disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">20(c) Rate adjustments with a corresponding change in payment.</p><p class="depth0">1. Creditors, assignees, and servicers. Creditors, assignees, and  servicers that own either the applicable adjustable-rate mortgage or the  applicable mortgage servicing rights or both are subject to the  requirements of Sec. 1026.20(c). Creditors, assignees, and servicers  are also subject to the requirements of any provision of subpart C that  governs Sec. 1026.20(c). For example, the form requirements of Sec.  1026.17(a) apply to Sec. 1026.20(c) disclosures and thus, assignees and  servicers, as well as creditors, are subject to those requirements.  While creditors, assignees, and servicers are all subject to the  requirements of Sec. 1026.20(c), they may decide among themselves which  of them will provide the required disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">2. Loan modifications. Under Sec. 1026.20(c), the interest rate  adjustment disclosures are required only for interest rate adjustments  occurring pursuant to the loan contract. Accordingly, creditors,  assignees, and servicers need not provide the disclosures for interest  rate adjustments occurring in loan modifications made for loss  mitigation purposes. Subsequent interest rate adjustments resulting in a  corresponding payment change occurring pursuant to the modified loan  contract, however, are subject to the requirements of Sec. 1026.20(c).</p><p class="depth0">3. Conversions. In addition to the disclosures required for interest  rate adjustments under an adjustable-rate mortgage, Sec. 1026.20(c)  also requires the disclosures for an ARM converting to a fixed-rate  transaction when the conversion changes the interest rate and results in  a corresponding payment change. When an open-end account converts to a  closed-end adjustable-rate mortgage, the Sec. 1026.20(c) disclosure is  not required until the implementation of an interest rate adjustment  post-conversion that results in a corresponding payment change. For  example, for an open-end account that converts to a closed-end 3/1  hybrid ARM, i.e., an ARM with a fixed rate of interest for the first  three years after which the interest rate adjusts annually, the first  Sec. 1026.20(c) disclosure would not be required until three years  after the conversion, and only if that first adjustment resulted in a  payment change.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(c)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. In general. An adjustable-rate mortgage, as defined in Sec.  1026.20(c)(1)(i), is a variable-rate transaction as that term is used in  subpart C, except as distinguished by comment Sec. 1026.20(c)(1)(ii)-3.  The requirements of this section are not limited to transactions  financing the initial acquisition of the consumer's principal dwelling.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(c)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Short-term ARMs. Under Sec. 1026.20(c)(1)(ii), construction,  home improvement, bridge, and other loans with terms of one year or less  are not subject to the requirements in Sec. 1026.20(c). In determining  the term of a construction loan that may be permanently financed by the  same creditor or assignee, the creditor or assignee may treat the  construction and the permanent phases as separate transactions with  distinct terms to maturity or as a single combined transaction.</p><p class="depth0">2. First new payment due within 210 days after consummation. Section  1026.20(c) disclosures are not required if the first payment at the  adjusted level is due within 210 days after consummation, when the new  interest rate disclosed at consummation pursuant to Sec. 1026.20(d) is  not an estimate. For example, the creditor, assignee, or servicer would  not be required to provide the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.20(c)  for the first time an ARM interest rate adjusts if the first payment at  the adjusted level was due 120 days after consummation and the adjusted  interest rate disclosed at consummation pursuant to Sec. 1026.20(d) was  not an estimate.</p><p class="depth0">3. Non-adjustable-rate mortgages. The following transactions, if  structured as fixed-rate and not as adjustable-rate mortgages based on  an index or formula, are not subject to Sec. 1026.20(c):</p><p class="depth0">i. Shared-equity or shared-appreciation mortgages;</p><p class="depth0">ii. Price-level adjusted or other indexed mortgages that have a  fixed rate of interest but provide for periodic adjustments to payments  and the loan balance to reflect changes in an index measuring prices or  inflation;</p><p class="depth0">iii. Graduated-payment mortgages or step-rate transactions;</p><p class="depth0">iv. Renewable balloon-payment instruments; and</p><p class="depth0">v. Preferred-rate loans.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Timing. The requirement that Sec. 1026.20(c) disclosures be  provided to consumers within a certain timeframe means that the  creditor, assignee, or servicer must deliver the notice or place it in  the mail within that timeframe, excluding any grace or courtesy periods.  The requirement that the Sec. 1026.20(c) disclosures must be provided  between 25 and 120 days before the first payment at the adjusted level  is due for frequently-adjusting ARMs, applies to ARMs that adjust  regularly at a maximum of every 60 days.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(c)(2)(ii)(A).</p><p class="depth0">1. Current and new interest rates. The current interest rate is the  interest rate that applies on the date the disclosure is provided to the  consumer. The new interest rate is the actual interest rate that will  apply on the date of the adjustment. The new interest rate is used to  determine the new payment. The ``new interest rate'' has the same  meaning as the ``adjusted interest rate.'' The requirements of Sec.  1026.20(c)(2)(ii)(A) do not preclude creditors, assignees, and servicers  from rounding the interest rate, pursuant to the requirements of the ARM  contract.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(c)(2)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">1. Rate limits and foregone interest rate increases. Interest rate  carryover, or foregone interest rate increases, is the amount of  interest rate increase foregone at any ARM interest rate adjustment  that, subject to rate caps, can be added to future interest rate  adjustments to increase, or to offset decreases in, the rate determined  by using the index or formula. The disclosures required by Sec.  1026.20(c)(2)(iv) regarding foregone interest rate increases apply only  to transactions permitting interest rate carryover.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(c)(2)(v)(B).</p><p class="depth0">1. Application of previously foregone interest rate increases. The  disclosures regarding the application of previously foregone interest  rate increases apply only to transactions permitting interest rate  carryover.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(c)(2)(vi).</p><p class="depth0">1. Amortization statement. For ARMs requiring the payment of  interest only, such as interest-only loans, Sec. 1026.20(c)(2)(vi)  requires a statement that the new payment covers all of the interest but  none of the principal, and therefore will not reduce the loan balance.  For negatively-amortizing ARMs, Sec. 1026.20(c)(2)(vi) requires a  statement that the new payment covers only part of the interest and none  of the principal, and therefore the unpaid interest will be added to the  principal balance.</p><p class="depth0">2. Amortization payment. Disclosure of the payment needed to  amortize fully the outstanding balance at the new interest rate over the  remainder of the loan term is required only when negative amortization  occurs as a result of the interest rate adjustment. The disclosure is  not required simply because a loan has interest-only or partially- amortizing payments. For example, an ARM with a five-year term and  payments based on a longer amortization schedule, in which the final  payment will equal the periodic payment plus the remaining unpaid  balance, does not require disclosure of the payment necessary to  amortize fully the loan in the remainder of the five-year term. A  disclosure is also not required when the new payment is sufficient to  prevent negative amortization but the final loan payment will be a  different amount due to rounding.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(c)(2)(vii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Prepayment penalty. The creditor, assignee, or servicer of an ARM  with no prepayment penalty, as that term is used in Sec.  1026.20(c)(2)(vii), may decide to exclude the prepayment section from  the Sec. 1026.20(c) disclosure, retain the prepayment section and  insert after the heading ``None'' or other indication that there is no  prepayment penalty, or indicate there is no prepayment penalty in some  other manner. See also comment 1.vi to Appendices G and H--Open-End and  Closed-End Model Forms and Clauses.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(c)(3)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Format of disclosures. The requirements of Sec. 1026.20(c)(3)(i)  and (ii) to provide the Sec. 1026.20(c) disclosures in the same order  as, and with headings and format substantially similar to, the model and  sample forms do not preclude creditors, assignees, and servicers from  modifying the disclosures to accommodate particular consumer  circumstances or transactions not addressed by the forms. For example,  in the case of a consumer bankruptcy or under certain State laws, the  creditor, assignee, or servicer may modify the forms to remove language  regarding personal liability. Creditors, assignees, and servicers  providing the required notice to a consumer whose ARM is converting to a  fixed-rate mortgage, may modify the model language to explain that the  interest rate will no longer adjust. Creditors, assignees, and servicers  electing to provide consumers with interest rate notices in cases where  the interest rate adjusts without a corresponding change in payment may  modify   the forms to fit that circumstance. A payment-option ARM, which is an  ARM permitting consumers to choose among several different payment  options for each billing period, is an example of a loan that may  require modification of the Sec. 1026.20(c) model and sample forms. See  appendix H-30(C) for an example of an allocation table for a payment- option loan.</p><p class="depth0">20(d) Initial rate adjustment.</p><p class="depth0">1. Creditors, assignees, and servicers. Creditors, assignees, and  servicers that own either the applicable adjustable-rate mortgage or the  applicable mortgage servicing rights or both are subject to the  requirements of Sec. 1026.20(d). Creditors, assignees, and servicers  are also subject to the requirements of any provision of subpart C that  governs Sec. 1026.20(d). For example, the form requirements of Sec.  1026.17(a) apply to Sec. 1026.20(d) disclosures and thus, assignees and  servicers, as well as creditors, are subject to those requirements.  While creditors, assignees, and servicers are all subject to the  requirements of Sec. 1026.20(d), they may decide among themselves which  of them will provide the required disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">2. Loan modifications. Under Sec. 1026.20(d), the interest rate  adjustment disclosures are required only for the initial interest rate  adjustment occurring pursuant to the loan contract. Accordingly,  creditors, assignees, and servicers need not provide the disclosures for  interest rate adjustments occurring in loan modifications made for loss  mitigation purposes. The initial interest rate adjustment occurring  pursuant to the modified loan contract, however, is subject to the  requirements of Sec. 1026.20(d).</p><p class="depth0">3. Timing and form of initial rate adjustment. The requirement that  Sec. 1026.20(d) disclosures be provided in writing, separate and  distinct from all other correspondence, means that the initial ARM  interest rate adjustment notice must be provided to consumers as a  separate document but may, in the case of mailing the disclosure, be in  the same envelope with other material and, in the case of emailing the  disclosure, be a separate attachment from other attachments in the same  email. The requirement that the disclosures be provided to consumers  between 210 and 240 days ``before the first payment at the adjusted  level is due'' means the creditor, assignee, or servicer must deliver  the notice or place it in the mail between 210 and 240 days prior to the  due date, excluding any grace or courtesy periods, of the first payment  calculated using the adjusted interest rate.</p><p class="depth0">4. Conversions. When an open-end account converts to a closed-end  adjustable-rate mortgage, the Sec. 1026.20(d) disclosure is not  required until the implementation of the initial interest rate  adjustment post-conversion. For example, for an open-end account that  converts to a closed-end 3/1 hybrid ARM, i.e., an ARM with a fixed rate  of interest for the first three years after which the interest rate  adjusts annually, the Sec. 1026.20(d) disclosure would not be required  until three years after the conversion when the interest rate adjusts  for the first time.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(d)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. In general. An adjustable-rate mortgage, as defined in Sec.  1026.20(d)(1)(i), is a variable-rate transaction as that term is used in  subpart C, except as distinguished by comment Sec. 1026.20(d)(1)(ii)-2.  The requirements of this section are not limited to transactions  financing the initial acquisition of the consumer's principal dwelling.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(d)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Short-term ARMs. Under Sec. 1026.20(d)(1)(ii), construction,  home improvement, bridge, and other loans with terms of one year or less  are not subject to the requirements in Sec. 1026.20(d). In determining  the term of a construction loan that may be permanently financed by the  same creditor or assignee, the creditor or assignee may treat the  construction and the permanent phases as separate transactions with  distinct terms to maturity or as a single combined transaction.</p><p class="depth0">2. Non-adjustable-rate mortgages. The following transactions, if  structured as fixed-rate and not as adjustable-rate mortgages based on  an index or formula, are not subject to Sec. 1026.20(d):</p><p class="depth0">i. Shared-equity or shared-appreciation mortgages;</p><p class="depth0">ii. Price-level adjusted or other indexed mortgages that have a  fixed rate of interest but provide for periodic adjustments to payments  and the loan balance to reflect changes in an index measuring prices or  inflation;</p><p class="depth0">iii. Graduated-payment mortgages or step-rate transactions;</p><p class="depth0">iv. Renewable balloon-payment instruments; and</p><p class="depth0">v. Preferred-rate loans.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(d)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Date of the disclosure. The date that must appear on the  disclosure is the date the creditor, assignee, or servicer generates the  notice to be provided to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(d)(2)(iii)(A).</p><p class="depth0">1. Current and new interest rates. The current interest rate is the  interest rate that applies on the date of the disclosure. The new  interest rate is the interest rate used to calculate the new payment and  may be an estimate pursuant to Sec. 1026.20(d)(2). The new payment, if  calculated from an estimated new interest rate, will also be an  estimate. The ``new interest rate'' has the same meaning as the  ``adjusted interest rate.'' The requirements of Sec.  1026.20(d)(2)(iii)(A) do not preclude creditors, assignees, and  servicers from rounding the interest rate, pursuant to the requirements  of the ARM contract.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(d)(2)(v).</p><p class="depth0">1. Rate limits and foregone interest rate increases. Interest rate  carryover, or foregone interest rate increases, is the amount of  interest rate increase foregone at the first ARM interest rate  adjustment that, subject to rate caps, can be added to future interest  rate adjustments to increase, or to offset decreases in, the rate  determined by using the index or formula. The disclosures required by  Sec. 1026.20(d)(2)(v) regarding foregone interest rate increases apply  only to transactions permitting interest rate carryover.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(d)(2)(vii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Amortization statement. For ARMs requiring the payment of  interest only, such as interest-only loans, Sec. 1026.20(d)(2)(vii)  requires a statement that the new payment covers all of the interest but  none of the principal, and therefore will not reduce the loan balance.  For negatively-amortizing ARMs, Sec. 1026.20(d)(2)(vii) requires a  statement that the new payment covers only part of the interest and none  of the principal, and therefore the unpaid interest will be added to the  principal balance.</p><p class="depth0">2. Amortization payment. Disclosure of the payment needed to  amortize fully the outstanding balance at the new interest rate over the  remainder of the loan term is required only when negative amortization  occurs as a result of the interest rate adjustment. The disclosure is  not required simply because a loan has interest-only or partially- amortizing payments. For example, an ARM with a five-year term and  payments based on a longer amortization schedule, in which the final  payment will equal the periodic payment plus the remaining unpaid  balance, does not require disclosure of the payment necessary to  amortize fully the loan in the remainder of the five-year term. A  disclosure is also not required when the new payment is sufficient to  prevent negative amortization but the final loan payment will be a  different amount due to rounding.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(d)(2)(viii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Prepayment penalty. The creditor, assignee, or servicer of an ARM  with no prepayment penalty, as that term is used in Sec.  1026.20(d)(2)(viii), may decide to exclude the prepayment section from  the Sec. 1026.20(d) disclosure, retain the prepayment section and  insert after the heading ``None'' or other indication that there is no  prepayment penalty, or indicate there is no prepayment penalty in some  other manner. See also comment to Appendices G and H--Open-End and  Closed-End Model Forms and Clauses--1.vi.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 20(d)(3)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Format of disclosures. The requirements of Sec. 1026.20(d)(3)(i)  and (iii) to provide the Sec. 1026.20(d) disclosures in the same order  as, and with headings and format substantially similar to, the model and  sample forms do not preclude creditors, assignees, and servicers from  modifying the disclosures to accommodate particular consumer  circumstances or transactions not addressed by the forms. For example,  in the case of a consumer bankruptcy or under certain State laws, the  creditor, assignee, or servicer may modify the forms to remove language  regarding personal liability. A payment-option ARM, which is an ARM  permitting consumers to choose among several different payment options  for each billing period, is an example of a loan that may require  modification of the Sec. 1026.20(d) model and sample forms. See  appendix H-30(C) for an example of an allocation table for a payment- option loan.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.21--Treatment of Credit Balances</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 21(a)</p><p class="depth0">1. Credit balance. A credit balance arises whenever the creditor  receives or holds funds in an account in excess of the total balance due  from the consumer on that account. A balance might result, for example,  from the debtor's paying off a loan by transmitting funds in excess of  the total balance owed on the account, or from the early payoff of a  loan entitling the consumer to a rebate of insurance premiums and  finance charges. However, Sec. 1026.21 does not determine whether the  creditor in fact owes or holds sums for the consumer. For example, if a  creditor has no obligation to rebate any portion of precomputed finance  charges on prepayment, the consumer's early payoff would not create a  credit balance with respect to those charges. Similarly, nothing in this  provision interferes with any rights the creditor may have under the  contract or under state law with respect to set-off, cross  collateralization, or similar provisions.</p><p class="depth0">2. Total balance due. The phrase total balance due refers to the  total outstanding balance. Thus, this provision does not apply where the  consumer has simply paid an amount in excess of the payment due for a  given period.</p><p class="depth0">3. Timing of refund. The creditor may also fulfill its obligation  under this section by:</p><p class="depth0">i. Refunding any credit balance to the consumer immediately.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Refunding any credit balance prior to a written request from the  consumer.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Making a good faith effort to refund any credit balance before  6 months have passed. If that attempt is unsuccessful, the creditor need  not try again to refund the credit balance at the end of the 6-month  period.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 21(b)</p><p class="depth0">1. Written requests--standing orders. The creditor is not required  to honor standing orders requesting refunds of any credit balance that  may be created on the consumer's account.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 21(c)</p><p class="depth0">1. Good faith effort to refund. The creditor must take positive  steps to return any credit balance that has remained in the account for  over 6 months. This includes, if necessary, attempts to trace the  consumer through the consumer's last known address or telephone number,  or both.</p><p class="depth0">2. Good faith effort unsuccessful. Section 1026.21 imposes no  further duties on the creditor if a good faith effort to return the  balance is unsuccessful. The ultimate disposition of the credit balance  (or any credit balance of $1 or less) is to be determined under other  applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.22--Determination of Annual Percentage Rate</p><p class="depth0">22(a) Accuracy of Annual Percentage Rate</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 22(a)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Calculation method. The regulation recognizes both the actuarial  method and the United States Rule Method (U.S. Rule) as measures of an  exact annual percentage rate. Both methods yield the same annual  percentage rate when payment intervals are equal. They differ in their  treatment of unpaid accrued interest.</p><p class="depth0">2. Actuarial method. When no payment is made, or when the payment is  insufficient to pay the accumulated finance charge, the actuarial method  requires that the unpaid finance charge be added to the amount financed  and thereby capitalized. Interest is computed on interest since in  succeeding periods the interest rate is applied to the unpaid balance  including the unpaid finance charge. Appendix J provides instructions  and examples for calculating the annual percentage rate using the  actuarial method.</p><p class="depth0">3. U.S. Rule. The U.S. Rule produces no compounding of interest in  that any unpaid accrued interest is accumulated separately and is not  added to principal. In addition, under the U.S. Rule, no interest  calculation is made until a payment is received.</p><p class="depth0">4. Basis for calculations. When a transaction involves ``step  rates'' or ``split rates''--that is, different rates applied at  different times or to different portions of the principal balance--a  single composite annual percentage rate must be calculated and disclosed  for the entire transaction. Assume, for example, a step-rate transaction  in which a $10,000 loan is repayable in 5 years at 10 percent interest  for the first 2 years, 12 percent for years 3 and 4, and 14 percent for  year 5. The monthly payments are $210.71 during the first 2 years of the  term, $220.25 for years 3 and 4, and $222.59 for year 5. The composite  annual percentage rate, using a calculator with a ``discounted cash flow  analysis'' or ``internal rate of return'' function, is 10.75 percent.</p><p class="depth0">5. Good faith reliance on faulty calculation tools. Section  1026.22(a)(1) absolves a creditor of liability for an error in the  annual percentage rate or finance charge that resulted from a  corresponding error in a calculation tool used in good faith by the  creditor. Whether or not the creditor's use of the tool was in good  faith must be determined on a case-by-case basis, but the creditor must  in any case have taken reasonable steps to verify the accuracy of the  tool, including any instructions, before using it. Generally, the  creditor is not liable only for errors directly attributable to the  calculation tool itself, including software programs; Sec.  1026.22(a)(1) is not intended to absolve a creditor of liability for its  own errors, or for errors arising from improper use of the tool, from  incorrect data entry, or from misapplication of the law.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 22(a)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Regular transactions. The annual percentage rate for a regular  transaction is considered accurate if it varies in either direction by  not more than \1/8\ of 1 percentage point from the actual annual  percentage rate. For example, when the exact annual percentage rate is  determined to be 101/8%, a disclosed annual percentage rate from 10% to  10 \1/4\%, or the decimal equivalent, is deemed to comply with the  regulation.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 22(a)(3)</p><p class="depth0">1. Irregular transactions. The annual percentage rate for an  irregular transaction is considered accurate if it varies in either  direction by not more than \1/4\ of 1 percentage point from the actual  annual percentage rate. This tolerance is intended for more complex  transactions that do not call for a single advance and a regular series  of equal payments at equal intervals. The \1/4\ of 1 percentage point  tolerance may be used, for example, in a construction loan where  advances are made as construction progresses, or in a transaction where  payments vary to reflect the consumer's seasonal income. It may also be  used in transactions with graduated payment schedules where the contract  commits the consumer to several series of payments in different amounts.  It does not apply, however, to loans with variable rate features where  the initial disclosures are based on a regular amortization schedule  over the life of the loan, even though payments may later change because  of the variable rate feature.</p><p class="depth0">22(a)(4) Mortgage Loans</p><p class="depth0">1. Example. If a creditor improperly omits a $75 fee from the  finance charge on a regular transaction, the understated finance charge  is considered accurate under Sec. 1026.18(d)(1), and the annual  percentage rate corresponding to that understated finance charge also is  considered accurate even if it   falls outside the tolerance of \1/8\ of 1 percentage point provided  under Sec. 1026.22(a)(2). Because a $75 error was made, an annual  percentage rate corresponding to a $100 understatement of the finance  charge would not be considered accurate.</p><p class="depth0">22(a)(5) Additional Tolerance for Mortgage Loans</p><p class="depth0">1. Example. This paragraph contains an additional tolerance for a  disclosed annual percentage rate that is incorrect but is closer to the  actual annual percentage rate than the rate that would be considered  accurate under the tolerance in Sec. 1026.22(a)(4). To illustrate: in  an irregular transaction subject to a \1/4\ of 1 percentage point  tolerance, if the actual annual percentage rate is 9.00 percent and a  $75 omission from the finance charge corresponds to a rate of 8.50  percent that is considered accurate under Sec. 1026.22(a)(4), a  disclosed APR of 8.65 percent is within the tolerance in Sec.  1026.22(a)(5). In this example of an understated finance charge, a  disclosed annual percentage rate below 8.50 or above 9.25 percent will  not be considered accurate.</p><p class="depth0">22(b) Computation Tools</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 22(b)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Bureau tables. Volumes I and II of the Bureau's Annual Percentage  Rate Tables provide a means of calculating annual percentage rates for  regular and irregular transactions, respectively. An annual percentage  rate computed in accordance with the instructions in the tables is  deemed to comply with the regulation, even where use of the tables  produces a rate that falls outside the general standard of accuracy. To  illustrate:Volume I may be used for single advance transactions with  completely regular payment schedules or with payment schedules that are  regular except for an odd first payment, odd first period or odd final  payment. When used for a transaction with a large final balloon payment,  Volume I may produce a rate that is considerably higher than the exact  rate produced using a computer program based directly on appendix J.  However, the Volume I rate--produced using certain adjustments in that  volume--is considered to be in compliance.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 22(b)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Other calculation tools. Creditors need not use the Bureau tables  in calculating the annual percentage rates. Any computation tools may be  used, so long as they produce annual percentage rates within \1/8\ or  \1/4\ of 1 percentage point, as applicable, of the precise actuarial or  U.S. Rule annual percentage rate.</p><p class="depth0">22(c) Single Add-On Rate Transactions</p><p class="depth0">1. General rule. Creditors applying a single add-on rate to all  transactions up to 60 months in length may disclose the same annual  percentage rate for all those transactions, although the actual annual  percentage rate varies according to the length of the transaction.  Creditors utilizing this provision must show the highest of those rates.  For example, an add-on rate of 10 percent converted to an annual  percentage rate produces the following actual annual percentage rates at  various maturities: At 3 months, 14.94 percent; at 21 months, 18.18  percent; and at 60 months, 17.27 percent. The creditor must disclose an  annual percentage rate of 18.18 percent (the highest annual percentage  rate) for any transaction up to 5 years, even though that rate is  precise only for a transaction of 21 months.</p><p class="depth0">22(d) Certain Transactions Involving Ranges of Balances</p><p class="depth0">1. General rule. Creditors applying a fixed dollar finance charge to  all balances within a specified range of balances may understate the  annual percentage rate by up to 8 percent of that rate, by disclosing  for all those balances the annual percentage rate computed on the median  balance within that range. For example: If a finance charge of $9  applies to all balances between $91 and $100, an annual percentage rate  of 10 percent (the rate on the median balance) may be disclosed as the  annual percentage rate for all balances, even though a $9 finance charge  applied to the lowest balance ($91) would actually produce an annual  percentage rate of 10.7 percent.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.23--Right of Rescission</p><p class="depth0">1. Transactions not covered. Credit extensions that are not subject  to the regulation are not covered by Sec. 1026.23 even if a customer's  principal dwelling is the collateral securing the credit. For example,  the right of rescission does not apply to a business purpose loan, even  though the loan is secured by the customer's principal dwelling.</p><p class="depth0">23(a) Consumer's Right to Rescind</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 23(a)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Security interest arising from transaction. i. In order for the  right of rescission to apply, the security interest must be retained as  part of the credit transaction. For example:</p><p class="depth0">A. A security interest that is acquired by a contractor who is also  extending the credit in the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">B. A mechanic's or materialman's lien that is retained by a  subcontractor or supplier of the contractor-creditor, even when the  latter has waived its own security interest in the consumer's home.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The security interest is not part of the credit transaction and  therefore the transaction is not subject to the right of rescission  when, for example:</p><p class="depth0">A. A mechanic's or materialman's lien is obtained by a contractor  who is not a party to the credit transaction but is merely paid with the  proceeds of the consumer's unsecured bank loan.</p><p class="depth0">B. All security interests that may arise in connection with the  credit transaction are validly waived.</p><p class="depth0">C. The creditor obtains a lien and completion bond that in effect  satisfies all liens against the consumer's principal dwelling as a  result of the credit transaction.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Although liens arising by operation of law are not considered  security interests for purposes of disclosure under Sec. 1026.2, that  section specifically includes them in the definition for purposes of the  right of rescission. Thus, even though an interest in the consumer's  principal dwelling is not a required disclosure under Sec. 1026.18(m),  it may still give rise to the right of rescission.</p><p class="depth0">2. Consumer. To be a consumer within the meaning of Sec. 1026.2,  that person must at least have an ownership interest in the dwelling  that is encumbered by the creditor's security interest, although that  person need not be a signatory to the credit agreement. For example, if  only one spouse signs a credit contract, the other spouse is a consumer  if the ownership interest of that spouse is subject to the security  interest.</p><p class="depth0">3. Principal dwelling. A consumer can only have one principal  dwelling at a time. (But see comment 23(a)(1)-4.) A vacation or other  second home would not be a principal dwelling. A transaction secured by  a second home (such as a vacation home) that is not currently being used  as the consumer's principal dwelling is not rescindable, even if the  consumer intends to reside there in the future. When a consumer buys or  builds a new dwelling that will become the consumer's principal dwelling  within one year or upon completion of construction, the new dwelling is  considered the principal dwelling if it secures the acquisition or  construction loan. In that case, the transaction secured by the new  dwelling is a residential mortgage transaction and is not rescindable.  For example, if a consumer whose principal dwelling is currently A  builds B, to be occupied by the consumer upon completion of  construction, a construction loan to finance B and secured by B is a  residential mortgage transaction. Dwelling, as defined in Sec. 1026.2,  includes structures that are classified as personalty under state law.  For example, a transaction secured by a mobile home, trailer, or  houseboat used as the consumer's principal dwelling may be rescindable.</p><p class="depth0">4. Special rule for principal dwelling. Notwithstanding the general  rule that consumers may have only one principal dwelling, when the  consumer is acquiring or constructing a new principal dwelling, any loan  subject to Regulation Z and secured by the equity in the consumer's  current principal dwelling (for example, a bridge loan) is subject to  the right of rescission regardless of the purpose of that loan. For  example, if a consumer whose principal dwelling is currently A builds B,  to be occupied by the consumer upon completion of construction, a  construction loan to finance B and secured by A is subject to the right  of rescission. A loan secured by both A and B is, likewise, rescindable.</p><p class="depth0">5. Addition of a security interest. Under Sec. 1026.23(a), the  addition of a security interest in a consumer's principal dwelling to an  existing obligation is rescindable even if the existing obligation is  not satisfied and replaced by a new obligation, and even if the existing  obligation was previously exempt under Sec. 1026.3(b). The right of  rescission applies only to the added security interest, however, and not  to the original obligation. In those situations, only the Sec.  1026.23(b) notice need be delivered, not new material disclosures; the  rescission period will begin to run from the delivery of the notice.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 23(a)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Consumer's exercise of right. The consumer must exercise the  right of rescission in writing but not necessarily on the notice  supplied under Sec. 1026.23(b). Whatever the means of sending the  notification of rescission--mail, telegram or other written means--the  time period for the creditor's performance under Sec. 1026.23(d)(2)  does not begin to run until the notification has been received. The  creditor may designate an agent to receive the notification so long as  the agent's name and address appear on the notice provided to the  consumer under Sec. 1026.23(b). Where the creditor fails to provide the  consumer with a designated address for sending the notification of  rescission, delivering notification to the person or address to which  the consumer has been directed to send, payments constitutes delivery to  the creditor or assignee. State law determines whether delivery of the  notification to a third party other than the person to whom payments are  made is delivery to the creditor or assignee, in the case where the  creditor fails to designate an address for sending the notification of  rescission.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 23(a)(3)</p><p class="depth0">1. Rescission period. i. The period within which the consumer may  exercise the right to rescind runs for 3 business days from the last of  3 events:</p><p class="depth0">A. Consummation of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">B. Delivery of all material disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">C. Delivery to the consumer of the required rescission notice.</p><p class="depth0">ii. For example:</p><p class="depth0">A. If a transaction is consummated on Friday, June 1, and the  disclosures and notice of the right to rescind were given on Thursday,  May 31, the rescission period will expire at midnight of the third  business day after June 1--that is, Tuesday, June 5.</p><p class="depth0">B. If the disclosures are given and the transaction consummated on  Friday, June 1, and the rescission notice is given on Monday, June 4,  the rescission period expires at midnight of the third business day  after June 4--that is, Thursday, June 7. The consumer must place the  rescission notice in the mail, file it for telegraphic transmission, or  deliver it to the creditor's place of business within that period in  order to exercise the right.</p><p class="depth0">2. Material disclosures. Section 1026.23(a)(3)(ii) sets forth the  material disclosures that must be provided before the rescission period  can begin to run. Failure to provide information regarding the annual  percentage rate also includes failure to inform the consumer of the  existence of a variable rate feature. Failure to give the other required  disclosures does not prevent the running of the rescission period,  although that failure may result in civil liability or administrative  sanctions.</p><p class="depth0">3. Unexpired right of rescission. i. When the creditor has failed to  take the action necessary to start the three-business day rescission  period running, the right to rescind automatically lapses on the  occurrence of the earliest of the following three events:</p><p class="depth0">A. The expiration of three years after consummation of the  transaction.</p><p class="depth0">B. Transfer of all the consumer's interest in the property.</p><p class="depth0">C. Sale of the consumer's interest in the property, including a  transaction in which the consumer sells the dwelling and takes back a  purchase money note and mortgage or retains legal title through a device  such as an installment sale contract.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Transfer of all the consumers' interest includes such transfers  as bequests and gifts. A sale or transfer of the property need not be  voluntary to terminate the right to rescind. For example, a foreclosure  sale would terminate an unexpired right to rescind. As provided in  Section 125 of the Act, the three-year limit may be extended by an  administrative proceeding to enforce the provisions of this section. A  partial transfer of the consumer's interest, such as a transfer  bestowing co-ownership on a spouse, does not terminate the right of  rescission.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 23(a)(4)</p><p class="depth0">1. Joint owners. When more than one consumer has the right to  rescind a transaction, any of them may exercise that right and cancel  the transaction on behalf of all. For example, if both husband and wife  have the right to rescind a transaction, either spouse acting alone may  exercise the right and both are bound by the rescission.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 23(b)</p><p class="depth0">23(b)(1) Notice of Right To Rescind</p><p class="depth0">1. Who receives notice. Each consumer entitled to rescind must be  given two copies of the rescission notice and the material disclosures.  In a transaction involving joint owners, both of whom are entitled to  rescind, both must receive the notice of the right to rescind and  disclosures. For example, if both spouses are entitled to rescind a  transaction, each must receive two copies of the rescission notice (one  copy to each if the notice is provided in electronic form in accordance  with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the E-Sign  Act) and one copy of the disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">2. Format. The notice must be on a separate piece of paper, but may  appear with other information such as the itemization of the amount  financed. The material must be clear and conspicuous, but no minimum  type size or other technical requirements are imposed. The notices in  appendix H provide models that creditors may use in giving the notice.</p><p class="depth0">3. Content. The notice must include all of the information outlined  in Section 1026.23(b)(1)(i) through (v). The requirement in Sec.  1026.23(b) that the transaction be identified may be met by providing  the date of the transaction. The creditor may provide a separate form  that the consumer may use to exercise the right of rescission, or that  form may be combined with the other rescission disclosures, as  illustrated in appendix H. The notice may include additional information  related to the required information, such as:</p><p class="depth0">i. A description of the property subject to the security interest.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A statement that joint owners may have the right to rescind and  that a rescission by one is effective for all.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The name and address of an agent of the creditor to receive  notice of rescission.</p><p class="depth0">4. Time of providing notice. The notice required by Sec. 1026.23(b)  need not be given before consummation of the transaction. The creditor  may deliver the notice after the transaction is consummated, but the  rescission period will not begin to run until the notice is given. For  example, if the creditor provides the notice on May 15, but disclosures  were given and the transaction was consummated on May 10, the 3-business  day rescission period will run from May 15.</p><p class="depth0">23(c) Delay of Creditor's Performance</p><p class="depth0">1. General rule. Until the rescission period has expired and the  creditor is reasonably satisfied that the consumer has not rescinded,  the creditor must not, either directly or through a third party:</p><p class="depth0">i. Disburse loan proceeds to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Begin performing services for the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Deliver materials to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">2. Escrow. The creditor may disburse loan proceeds during the  rescission period in a valid escrow arrangement. The creditor may not,  however, appoint the consumer as ``trustee'' or ``escrow agent'' and  distribute funds to the consumer in that capacity during the delay  period.</p><p class="depth0">3. Actions during the delay period. Section 1026.23(c) does not  prevent the creditor from taking other steps during the delay, short of  beginning actual performance. Unless otherwise prohibited, such as by  state law, the creditor may, for example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Prepare the loan check.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Perfect the security interest.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Prepare to discount or assign the contract to a third party.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Accrue finance charges during the delay period.</p><p class="depth0">4. Delay beyond rescission period. i. The creditor must wait until  it is reasonably satisfied that the consumer has not rescinded. For  example, the creditor may satisfy itself by doing one of the following:</p><p class="depth0">A. Waiting a reasonable time after expiration of the rescission  period to allow for delivery of a mailed notice.</p><p class="depth0">B. Obtaining a written statement from the consumer that the right  has not been exercised.</p><p class="depth0">ii. When more than one consumer has the right to rescind, the  creditor cannot reasonably rely on the assurance of only one consumer,  because other consumers may exercise the right.</p><p class="depth0">23(d) Effects of Rescission</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 23(d)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Termination of security interest. Any security interest giving  rise to the right of rescission becomes void when the consumer exercises  the right of rescission. The security interest is automatically negated  regardless of its status and whether or not it was recorded or  perfected. Under Sec. 1026.23(d)(2), however, the creditor must take  any action necessary to reflect the fact that the security interest no  longer exists.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 23(d)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Refunds to consumer. The consumer cannot be required to pay any  amount in the form of money or property either to the creditor or to a  third party as part of the credit transaction. Any amounts of this  nature already paid by the consumer must be refunded. ``Any amount''  includes finance charges already accrued, as well as other charges, such  as broker fees, application and commitment fees, or fees for a title  search or appraisal, whether paid to the creditor, paid directly to a  third party, or passed on from the creditor to the third party. It is  irrelevant that these amounts may not represent profit to the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">2. Amounts not refundable to consumer. Creditors need not return any  money given by the consumer to a third party outside of the credit  transaction, such as costs incurred for a building permit or for a  zoning variance. Similarly, the term any amount does not apply to any  money or property given by the creditor to the consumer; those amounts  must be tendered by the consumer to the creditor under Sec.  1026.23(d)(3).</p><p class="depth0">3. Reflection of security interest termination. The creditor must  take whatever steps are necessary to indicate that the security interest  is terminated. Those steps include the cancellation of documents  creating the security interest, and the filing of release or termination  statements in the public record. In a transaction involving  subcontractors or suppliers that also hold security interests related to  the credit transaction, the creditor must insure that the termination of  their security interests is also reflected. The 20-day period for the  creditor's action refers to the time within which the creditor must  begin the process. It does not require all necessary steps to have been  completed within that time, but the creditor is responsible for seeing  the process through to completion.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 23(d)(3)</p><p class="depth0">1. Property exchange. Once the creditor has fulfilled its  obligations under Sec. 1026.23(d)(2), the consumer must tender to the  creditor any property or money the creditor has already delivered to the  consumer. At the consumer's option, property may be tendered at the  location of the property. For example, if lumber or fixtures have been  delivered to the consumer's home, the consumer may tender them to the  creditor by making them available for pick-up at the home, rather than  physically returning them to the creditor's premises. Money already  given to the consumer must be tendered at the creditor's place of  business.</p><p class="depth0">2. Reasonable value. If returning the property would be extremely  burdensome to the consumer, the consumer may offer the creditor its  reasonable value rather than returning the property itself. For example,  if building materials have already been incorporated into the consumer's  dwelling, the consumer may pay their reasonable value.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 23(d)(4)</p><p class="depth0">1. Modifications. The procedures outlined in Sec. 1026.23(d)(2) and  (3) may be modified by a court. For example, when a consumer is in  bankruptcy proceedings and prohibited from returning anything to the  creditor, or when the equities dictate, a modification might be made.  The sequence of procedures under Sec. 1026.23(d)(2) and (3), or a  court's modification of those procedures under Sec. 1026.23(d)(4),   does not affect a consumer's substantive right to rescind and to have  the loan amount adjusted accordingly. Where the consumer's right to  rescind is contested by the creditor, a court would normally determine  whether the consumer has a right to rescind and determine the amounts  owed before establishing the procedures for the parties to tender any  money or property.</p><p class="depth0">23(e) Consumer's Waiver of Right to Rescind</p><p class="depth0">1. Need for waiver. To waive the right to rescind, the consumer must  have a bona fide personal financial emergency that must be met before  the end of the rescission period. The existence of the consumer's waiver  will not, of itself, automatically insulate the creditor from liability  for failing to provide the right of rescission.</p><p class="depth0">2. Procedure. To waive or modify the right to rescind, the consumer  must give a written statement that specifically waives or modifies the  right, and also includes a brief description of the emergency. Each  consumer entitled to rescind must sign the waiver statement. In a  transaction involving multiple consumers, such as a husband and wife  using their home as collateral, the waiver must bear the signatures of  both spouses.</p><p class="depth0">23(f) Exempt Transactions</p><p class="depth0">1. Residential mortgage transaction. Any transaction to construct or  acquire a principal dwelling, whether considered real or personal  property, is exempt. (See the commentary to Sec. 1026.23(a).) For  example, a credit transaction to acquire a mobile home or houseboat to  be used as the consumer's principal dwelling would not be rescindable.</p><p class="depth0">2. Lien status. The lien status of the mortgage is irrelevant for  purposes of the exemption in Sec. 1026.23(f)(1); the fact that a loan  has junior lien status does not by itself preclude application of this  exemption. For example, a home buyer may assume the existing first  mortgage and create a second mortgage to finance the balance of the  purchase price. Such a transaction would not be rescindable.</p><p class="depth0">3. Combined-purpose transaction. A loan to acquire a principal  dwelling and make improvements to that dwelling is exempt if treated as  one transaction. If, on the other hand, the loan for the acquisition of  the principal dwelling and the subsequent advances for improvements are  treated as more than one transaction, then only the transaction that  finances the acquisition of that dwelling is exempt.</p><p class="depth0">4. New advances. The exemption in Sec. 1026.23(f)(2) applies only  to refinancings (including consolidations) by the original creditor. The  original creditor is the creditor to whom the written agreement was  initially made payable. In a merger, consolidation or acquisition, the  successor institution is considered the original creditor for purposes  of the exemption in Sec. 1026.23(f)(2). If the refinancing involves a  new advance of money, the amount of the new advance is rescindable. In  determining whether there is a new advance, a creditor may rely on the  amount financed, refinancing costs, and other figures stated in the  latest Truth in Lending disclosures provided to the consumer and is not  required to use, for example, more precise information that may only  become available when the loan is closed. For purposes of the right of  rescission, a new advance does not include amounts attributed solely to  the costs of the refinancing. These amounts would include Sec.  1026.4(c)(7) charges (such as attorneys fees and title examination and  insurance fees, if bona fide and reasonable in amount), as well as  insurance premiums and other charges that are not finance charges.  (Finance charges on the new transaction--points, for example--would not  be considered in determining whether there is a new advance of money in  a refinancing since finance charges are not part of the amount  financed.) To illustrate, if the sum of the outstanding principal  balance plus the earned unpaid finance charge is $50,000 and the new  amount financed is $51,000, then the refinancing would be exempt if the  extra $1,000 is attributed solely to costs financed in connection with  the refinancing that are not finance charges. Of course, if new advances  of money are made (for example, to pay for home improvements) and the  consumer exercises the right of rescission, the consumer must be placed  in the same position as he or she was in prior to entering into the new  credit transaction. Thus, all amounts of money (which would include all  the costs of the refinancing) already paid by the consumer to the  creditor or to a third party as part of the refinancing would have to be  refunded to the consumer. (See the commentary to Sec. 1026.23(d)(2) for  a discussion of refunds to consumers.) A model rescission notice  applicable to transactions involving new advances appears in appendix H.  The general rescission notice (model form H-8) is the appropriate form  for use by creditors not considered original creditors in refinancing  transactions.</p><p class="depth0">5. State creditors. Cities and other political subdivisions of  states acting as creditors are not exempted from this section.</p><p class="depth0">6. Multiple advances. Just as new disclosures need not be made for  subsequent advances when treated as one transaction, no new rescission  rights arise so long as the appropriate notice and disclosures are given  at the outset of the transaction. For example, the creditor extends  credit for home improvements secured by the consumer's principal  dwelling, with advances made as repairs progress. As permitted by Sec.  1026.17(c)(6), the creditor makes a single set of disclosures at the  beginning of the construction period,   rather than separate disclosures for each advance. The right of  rescission does not arise with each advance. However, if the advances  are treated as separate transactions, the right of rescission applies to  each advance.7. Spreader clauses. When the creditor holds a mortgage or  deed of trust on the consumer's principal dwelling and that mortgage or  deed of trust contains a ``spreader clause,'' subsequent loans made are  separate transactions and are subject to the right of rescission. Those  loans are rescindable unless the creditor effectively waives its  security interest under the spreader clause with respect to the  subsequent transactions.</p><p class="depth0">8. Converting open-end to closed-end credit. Under certain state  laws, consummation of a closed-end credit transaction may occur at the  time a consumer enters into the initial open-end credit agreement. As  provided in the commentary to Sec. 1026.17(b), closed-end credit  disclosures may be delayed under these circumstances until the  conversion of the open-end account to a closed-end transaction. In  accounts secured by the consumer's principal dwelling, no new right of  rescission arises at the time of conversion. Rescission rights under  Sec. 1026.15 are unaffected.</p><p class="depth0">23(g) Tolerances for Accuracy</p><p class="depth0">23(g)(2) One Percent Tolerance</p><p class="depth0">1. New advance.

General rule. To the extent that an advertisement mentions  specific credit terms, it may state only those terms that the creditor  is actually prepared to offer. For example, a creditor may not advertise  a very low annual percentage rate that will not in fact be available at  any time. This provision is not intended to inhibit the promotion of new  credit programs, but to bar the advertising of terms that are not and  will not be available. For example, a creditor may advertise terms that  will be offered for only a limited period, or terms that will become  available at a future date.</p><p class="depth0">24(b) Clear and Conspicuous Standard</p><p class="depth0">1. Clear and conspicuous standard--general. This section is subject  to the general ``clear and conspicuous'' standard for this subpart, see  Sec. 1026.17(a)(1), but prescribes no specific rules for the format of  the necessary disclosures, other than the format requirements related to  the advertisement of rates and payments as described in comment 24(b)-2  below. The credit terms need not be printed in a certain type size nor  need they appear in any particular place in the advertisement. For  example, a merchandise tag that is an advertisement under the regulation  complies with this section if the necessary credit terms are on both  sides of the tag, so long as each side is accessible.</p><p class="depth0">2. Clear and conspicuous standard--rates and payments in  advertisements for credit secured by a dwelling. For purposes of Sec.  1026.24(f), a clear and conspicuous disclosure means that the required  information in Sec. Sec. 1026.24(f)(2)(i) and 1026.24(f)(3)(i)(A) and  (B) is disclosed with equal prominence and in close proximity to the  advertised rates or payments triggering the required disclosures, and  that the required information in Sec. 1026.24(f)(3)(i)(C) is disclosed  prominently and in close proximity to the advertised rates or payments  triggering the required disclosures. If the required information in  Sec. Sec. 1026.24(f)(2)(i) and 1026.24(f)(3)(i)(A) and (B) is the same  type size as the advertised rates or payments triggering the required  disclosures, the disclosures are deemed to be equally prominent. The  information in Sec. 1026.24(f)(3)(i)(C) must be disclosed prominently,  but need not be disclosed with equal prominence or be the same type size  as the payments triggering the required disclosures. If the required  information in Sec. Sec. 1026.24(f)(2)(i) and 1026.24(f)(3)(i) is  located immediately next to or directly above or below the advertised  rates or payments triggering the required disclosures, without any  intervening text or graphical displays, the disclosures are deemed to be  in close proximity. Notwithstanding the above, for electronic  advertisements that disclose rates or payments, compliance with the  requirements of Sec. 1026.24(e) is deemed to satisfy the clear and  conspicuous standard.</p><p class="depth0">3. Clear and conspicuous standard--Internet advertisements for  credit secured by a dwelling. For purposes of this section, a clear and  conspicuous disclosure for visual text advertisements on the Internet  for credit secured by   a dwelling means that the required disclosures are not obscured by  techniques such as graphical displays, shading, coloration, or other  devices and comply with all other requirements for clear and conspicuous  disclosures under Sec. 1026.24. See also comment 24(e)-4.</p><p class="depth0">4. Clear and conspicuous standard--televised advertisements for  credit secured by a dwelling. For purposes of this section, including  alternative disclosures as provided for by Sec. 1026.24(g), a clear and  conspicuous disclosure in the context of visual text advertisements on  television for credit secured by a dwelling means that the required  disclosures are not obscured by techniques such as graphical displays,  shading, coloration, or other devices, are displayed in a manner that  allows a consumer to read the information required to be disclosed, and  comply with all other requirements for clear and conspicuous disclosures  under Sec. 1026.24. For example, very fine print in a television  advertisement would not meet the clear and conspicuous standard if  consumers cannot see and read the information required to be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">5. Clear and conspicuous standard--oral advertisements for credit  secured by a dwelling. For purposes of this section, including  alternative disclosures as provided for by Sec. 1026.24(g), a clear and  conspicuous disclosure in the context of an oral advertisement for  credit secured by a dwelling, whether by radio, television, or other  medium, means that the required disclosures are given at a speed and  volume sufficient for a consumer to hear and comprehend them. For  example, information stated very rapidly at a low volume in a radio or  television advertisement would not meet the clear and conspicuous  standard if consumers cannot hear and comprehend the information  required to be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">24(c) Advertisement of Rate of Finance Charge</p><p class="depth0">1. Annual percentage rate. Advertised rates must be stated in terms  of an annual percentage rate, as defined in Sec. 1026.22. Even though  state or local law permits the use of add-on, discount, time-price  differential, or other methods of stating rates, advertisements must  state them as annual percentage rates. Unlike the transactional  disclosure of an annual percentage rate under Sec. 1026.18(e), the  advertised annual percentage rate need not include a descriptive  explanation of the term and may be expressed using the abbreviation APR.  The advertisement must state that the rate is subject to increase after  consummation if that is the case, but the advertisement need not  describe the rate increase, its limits, or how it would affect the  payment schedule. As under Sec. 1026.18(f), relating to disclosure of a  variable rate, the rate increase disclosure requirement in this  provision does not apply to any rate increase due to delinquency  (including late payment), default, acceleration, assumption, or transfer  of collateral.</p><p class="depth0">2. Simple or periodic rates. The advertisement may not  simultaneously state any other rate, except that a simple annual rate or  periodic rate applicable to an unpaid balance may appear along with (but  not more conspicuously than) the annual percentage rate. An  advertisement for credit secured by a dwelling may not state a periodic  rate, other than a simple annual rate, that is applied to an unpaid  balance. For example, in an advertisement for credit secured by a  dwelling, a simple annual interest rate may be shown in the same type  size as the annual percentage rate for the advertised credit, subject to  the requirements of Sec. 1026.24(f). A simple annual rate or periodic  rate that is applied to an unpaid balance is the rate at which interest  is accruing; those terms do not include a rate lower than the rate at  which interest is accruing, such as an effective rate, payment rate, or  qualifying rate.</p><p class="depth0">3. Buydowns. When a third party (such as a seller) or a creditor  wishes to promote the availability of reduced interest rates (consumer  or seller buydowns), the advertised annual percentage rate must be  determined in accordance with the commentary to Sec. 1026.17(c)  regarding the basis of transactional disclosures for buydowns. The  seller or creditor may advertise the reduced simple interest rate,  provided the advertisement shows the limited term to which the reduced  rate applies and states the simple interest rate applicable to the  balance of the term. The advertisement may also show the effect of the  buydown agreement on the payment schedule for the buydown period, but  this will trigger the additional disclosures under Sec. 1026.24(d)(2).</p><p class="depth0">4. Discounted variable-rate transactions. The advertised annual  percentage rate for discounted variable-rate transactions must be  determined in accordance with comment 17(c)(1)-10 regarding the basis of  transactional disclosures for such financing.</p><p class="depth0">i. A creditor or seller may promote the availability of the initial  rate reduction in such transactions by advertising the reduced simple  annual rate, provided the advertisement shows with equal prominence and  in close proximity the limited term to which the reduced rate applies  and the annual percentage rate that will apply after the term of the  initial rate reduction expires. See Sec. 1026.24(f).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Limits or caps on periodic rate or payment adjustments need not  be stated. To illustrate using the second example in comment 17(c)(1)- 10, the fact that the rate is presumed to be 11 percent in the second  year and 12 percent for the remaining 28 years need not be included in  the advertisement.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The advertisement may also show the effect of the discount on  the payment schedule for the discount period, but this will trigger the  additional disclosures under Sec. 1026.24(d).</p><p class="depth0">24(d) Advertisement of Terms That Require Additional Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. General rule. Under Sec. 1026.24(d)(1), whenever certain  triggering terms appear in credit advertisements, the additional credit  terms enumerated in Sec. 1026.24(d)(2) must also appear. These  provisions apply even if the triggering term is not stated explicitly  but may be readily determined from the advertisement. For example, an  advertisement may state ``80 percent financing available,'' which is in  fact indicating that a 20 percent downpayment is required.</p><p class="depth0">24(d)(1) Triggering Terms</p><p class="depth0">1. Downpayment. i. The dollar amount of a downpayment or a statement  of the downpayment as a percentage of the price requires further  information. By virtue of the definition of downpayment in Sec. 1026.2,  this triggering term is limited to credit sale transactions. It includes  such statements as:</p><p class="depth0">A. Only 5% down.</p><p class="depth0">B. As low as $100 down.</p><p class="depth0">C. Total move-in costs of $800.</p><p class="depth0">ii. This provision applies only if a downpayment is actually  required; statements such as no downpayment or no trade-in required do  not trigger the additional disclosures under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0">2. Payment period. i. The number of payments required or the total  period of repayment includes such statements as:</p><p class="depth0">A. 48-month payment terms.</p><p class="depth0">B. 30-year mortgage.</p><p class="depth0">C. Repayment in as many as 36 monthly installments.</p><p class="depth0">ii. But it does not include such statements as ``pay weekly,''  ``monthly payment terms arranged,'' or ``take years to repay,'' since  these statements do not indicate a time period over which a loan may be  financed.</p><p class="depth0">3. Payment amount. i. The dollar amount of any payment includes  statements such as:</p><p class="depth0">A. ``Payable in installments of $103.''</p><p class="depth0">B. ``$25 weekly.''</p><p class="depth0">C. ``$500,000 loan for just $1,650 per month.''</p><p class="depth0">D. ``$1,200 balance payable in 10 equal installments.''</p><p class="depth0">ii. In the last example, the amount of each payment is readily  determinable, even though not explicitly stated. But statements such as  ``monthly payments to suit your needs'' or ``regular monthly payments''  are not deemed to be statements of the amount of any payment.</p><p class="depth0">4. Finance charge. i. The dollar amount of the finance charge or any  portion of it includes statements such as:</p><p class="depth0">A. ``$500 total cost of credit.''</p><p class="depth0">B. ``$2 monthly carrying charge.''</p><p class="depth0">C. ``$50,000 mortgages, 2 points to the borrower.''</p><p class="depth0">ii. In the last example, the $1,000 prepaid finance charge can be  readily determined from the information given. Statements of the annual  percentage rate or statements that there is no particular charge for  credit (such as ``no closing costs'') are not triggering terms under  this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0">24(d)(2) Additional Terms</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure of downpayment. The total downpayment as a dollar  amount or percentage must be shown, but the word ``downpayment'' need  not be used in making this disclosure. For example, ``10% cash required  from buyer'' or ``credit terms require minimum $100 trade-in'' would  suffice.</p><p class="depth0">2. Disclosure of repayment terms. The phrase ``terms of repayment''  generally has the same meaning as the ``payment schedule'' required to  be disclosed under Sec. 1026.18(g). Section 1026.24(d)(2)(ii) provides  flexibility to creditors in making this disclosure for advertising  purposes. Repayment terms may be expressed in a variety of ways in  addition to an exact repayment schedule; this is particularly true for  advertisements that do not contemplate a single specific transaction.  Repayment terms, however, must reflect the consumer's repayment  obligations over the full term of the loan, including any balloon  payment, see comment 24(d)(2)-3, not just the repayment terms that will  apply for a limited period of time. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. A creditor may use a unit-cost approach in making the required  disclosure, such as ``48 monthly payments of $27.83 per $1,000  borrowed.''</p><p class="depth0">ii. In an advertisement for credit secured by a dwelling, when any  series of payments varies because of the inclusion of mortgage insurance  premiums, a creditor may state the number and timing of payments, the  fact that payments do not include amounts for mortgage insurance  premiums, and that the actual payment obligation will be higher.</p><p class="depth0">iii. In an advertisement for credit secured by a dwelling, when one  series of monthly payments will apply for a limited period of time  followed by a series of higher monthly payments for the remaining term  of the loan, the advertisement must state the number and time period of  each series of payments, and the amounts of each of those payments. For  this purpose, the creditor must assume that the consumer makes the lower  series of payments for the maximum allowable period of time.</p><p class="depth0">3. Balloon payment; disclosure of repayment terms. In some  transactions, a balloon payment will occur when the consumer only makes  the minimum payments specified in an advertisement. A balloon payment  results if paying the minimum payments does not fully amortize the  outstanding balance by a   specified date or time, usually the end of the term of the loan, and the  consumer must repay the entire outstanding balance at such time. If a  balloon payment will occur when the consumer only makes the minimum  payments specified in an advertisement, the advertisement must state  with equal prominence and in close proximity to the minimum payment  statement the amount and timing of the balloon payment that will result  if the consumer makes only the minimum payments for the maximum period  of time that the consumer is permitted to make such payments.</p><p class="depth0">4. Annual percentage rate. The advertised annual percentage rate may  be expressed using the abbreviation ``APR.'' The advertisement must also  state, if applicable, that the annual percentage rate is subject to  increase after consummation.</p><p class="depth0">5. Use of examples. A creditor may use illustrative credit  transactions to make the necessary disclosures under Sec.  1026.24(d)(2). That is, where a range of possible combinations of credit  terms is offered, the advertisement may use examples of typical  transactions, so long as each example contains all of the applicable  terms required by Sec. 1026.24(d). The examples must be labeled as such  and must reflect representative credit terms made available by the  creditor to present and prospective customers.</p><p class="depth0">24(e) Catalogs or Other Multiple-Page Advertisements; Electronic</p><p class="depth0">Advertisements</p><p class="depth0">1. Definition. The multiple-page advertisements to which this  section refers are advertisements consisting of a series of sequentially  numbered pages--for example, a supplement to a newspaper. A mailing  consisting of several separate flyers or pieces of promotional material  in a single envelope does not constitute a single multiple-page  advertisement for purposes of Sec. 1026.24(e).</p><p class="depth0">2. General. Section 1026.24(e) permits creditors to put credit  information together in one place in a catalog or other multiple-page  advertisement or in an electronic advertisement (such as an  advertisement appearing on an Internet Web site). The rule applies only  if the advertisement contains one or more of the triggering terms from  Sec. 1026.24(d)(1). A list of different annual percentage rates  applicable to different balances, for example, does not trigger further  disclosures under Sec. 1026.24(d)(2) and so is not covered by Sec.  1026.24(e).</p><p class="depth0">3. Representative examples. The table or schedule must state all the  necessary information for a representative sampling of amounts of  credit. This must reflect amounts of credit the creditor actually  offers, up to and including the higher-priced items. This does not mean  that the chart must make the disclosures for the single most expensive  item the seller offers, but only that the chart cannot be limited to  information about less expensive sales when the seller commonly offers a  distinct level of more expensive goods or services. The range of  transactions shown in the table or schedule in a particular catalog or  multiple-page advertisement need not exceed the range of transactions  actually offered in that advertisement.</p><p class="depth0">4. Electronic advertisement. If an electronic advertisement (such as  an advertisement appearing on an Internet Web site) contains the table  or schedule permitted under Sec. 1026.24(e)(1), any statement of terms  set forth in Sec. 1026.24(d)(1) appearing anywhere else in the  advertisement must clearly direct the consumer to the location where the  table or schedule begins. For example, a term triggering additional  disclosures may be accompanied by a link that directly takes the  consumer to the additional information.</p><p class="depth0">24(f) Disclosure of Rates and Payments in Advertisements for Credit</p><p class="depth0">Secured by a Dwelling</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicability. The requirements of Sec. 1026.24(f)(2) apply to  advertisements for loans where more than one simple annual rate of  interest will apply. The requirements of Sec. 1026.24(f)(3)(i)(A)  require a clear and conspicuous disclosure of each payment that will  apply over the term of the loan. In determining whether a payment will  apply when the consumer may choose to make a series of lower monthly  payments that will apply for a limited period of time, the creditor must  assume that the consumer makes the series of lower payments for the  maximum allowable period of time. See comment 24(d)(2)-2.iii. However,  for purposes of Sec. 1026.24(f), the creditor may, but need not, assume  that specific events which trigger changes to the simple annual rate of  interest or to the applicable payments will occur. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Fixed-rate conversion loans. If a loan program permits consumers  to convert their variable-rate loans to fixed rate loans, the creditor  need not assume that the fixed-rate conversion option, by itself, means  that more than one simple annual rate of interest will apply to the loan  under Sec. 1026.24(f)(2) and need not disclose as a separate payment  under Sec. 1026.24(f)(3)(i)(A) the payment that would apply if the  consumer exercised the fixed-rate conversion option.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Preferred-rate loans. Some loans contain a preferred-rate  provision, where the rate will increase upon the occurrence of some  event, such as the consumer-employee leaving the creditor's employ or  the consumer closing an existing deposit account with the creditor or  the consumer revoking an election to make automated payments. A creditor  need not assume that the preferred-rate provision, by itself, means that  more than one simple annual rate of interest will apply   to the loan under Sec. 1026.24(f)(2) and the payments that would apply  upon occurrence of the event that triggers the rate increase need not be  disclosed as a separate payment under Sec. 1026.24(f)(3)(i)(A).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Rate reductions. Some loans contain a provision where the rate  will decrease upon the occurrence of some event, such as if the consumer  makes a series of payments on time. A creditor need not assume that the  rate reduction provision, by itself, means that more than one simple  annual rate of interest will apply to the loan under Sec. 1026.24(f)(2)  and need not disclose the payments that would apply upon occurrence of  the event that triggers the rate reduction as a separate payment under  Sec. 1026.24(f)(3)(i)(A).</p><p class="depth0">2. Equal prominence, close proximity. Information required to be  disclosed under Sec. Sec. 1026.24(f)(2)(i) and 1026.24(f)(3)(i) that is  immediately next to or directly above or below the simple annual rate or  payment amount (but not in a footnote) is deemed to be closely proximate  to the listing. Information required to be disclosed under Sec. Sec.  1026.24(f)(2)(i) and 1026.24(f)(3)(i)(A) and (B) that is in the same  type size as the simple annual rate or payment amount is deemed to be  equally prominent.</p><p class="depth0">3. Clear and conspicuous standard. For more information about the  applicable clear and conspicuous standard, see comment 24(b)-2.</p><p class="depth0">4. Comparisons in advertisements. When making any comparison in an  advertisement between actual or hypothetical credit payments or rates  and the payments or rates available under the advertised product, the  advertisement must state all applicable payments or rates for the  advertised product and the time periods for which those payments or  rates will apply, as required by this section.</p><p class="depth0">5. Application to variable-rate transactions--disclosure of rates.  In advertisements for variable-rate transactions, if a simple annual  rate that applies at consummation is not based on the index and margin  that will be used to make subsequent rate adjustments over the term of  the loan, the requirements of Sec. 1026.24(f)(2)(i) apply.</p><p class="depth0">6. Reasonably current index and margin. For the purposes of this  section, an index and margin is considered reasonably current if:</p><p class="depth0">i. For direct mail advertisements, it was in effect within 60 days  before mailing;</p><p class="depth0">ii. For advertisements in electronic form it was in effect within 30  days before the advertisement is sent to a consumer's email address, or  in the case of an advertisement made on an Internet Web site, when  viewed by the public; or</p><p class="depth0">iii. For printed advertisements made available to the general  public, including ones contained in a catalog, magazine, or other  generally available publication, it was in effect within 30 days before  printing.</p><p class="depth0">24(f)(3) Disclosure of Payments</p><p class="depth0">1. Amounts and time periods of payments. Section 1026.24(f)(3)(i)  requires disclosure of the amounts and time periods of all payments that  will apply over the term of the loan. This section may require  disclosure of several payment amounts, including any balloon payment.  For example, if an advertisement for credit secured by a dwelling offers  $300,000 of credit with a 30-year loan term for a payment of $600 per  month for the first six months, increasing to $1,500 per month after  month six, followed by a balloon payment of $30,000 at the end of the  loan term, the advertisement must disclose the amount and time periods  of each of the two monthly payment streams, as well as the amount and  timing of the balloon payment, with equal prominence and in close  proximity to each other. However, if the final scheduled payment of a  fully amortizing loan is not greater than two times the amount of any  other regularly scheduled payment, the final payment need not be  disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">2. Application to variable-rate transactions--disclosure of  payments. In advertisements for variable-rate transactions, if the  payment that applies at consummation is not based on the index and  margin that will be used to make subsequent payment adjustments over the  term of the loan, the requirements of Sec. 1026.24(f)(3)(i) apply.</p><p class="depth0">24(g) Alternative Disclosures--Television or Radio Advertisements</p><p class="depth0">1. Multi-purpose telephone number. When an advertised telephone  number provides a recording, disclosures should be provided early in the  sequence to ensure that the consumer receives the required disclosures.  For example, in providing several options--such as providing directions  to the advertiser's place of business--the option allowing the consumer  to request disclosures should be provided early in the telephone message  to ensure that the option to request disclosures is not obscured by  other information.</p><p class="depth0">2. Statement accompanying telephone number. Language must accompany  a telephone number indicating that disclosures are available by calling  the telephone number, such as ``call 1-(800) 000-0000 for details about  credit costs and terms.''  24(i) Prohibited Acts or Practices in Advertisements for Credit Secured</p><p class="depth0">by a Dwelling</p><p class="depth0">1. Comparisons in advertisements. The requirements of Sec.  1026.24(i)(2) apply to all advertisements for credit secured by a  dwelling, including radio and television advertisements. A comparison  includes a claim about the amount a consumer may save under the  advertised product. For example, a statement such as ``save $300 per  month on a   $300,000 loan'' constitutes an implied comparison between the advertised  product's payment and a consumer's current payment.</p><p class="depth0">2. Misrepresentations about government endorsement. A statement that  the Federal Community Reinvestment Act entitles the consumer to  refinance his or her mortgage at the low rate offered in the  advertisement is prohibited because it conveys a misleading impression  that the advertised product is endorsed or sponsored by the Federal  government.</p><p class="depth0">3. Misleading claims of debt elimination. The prohibition against  misleading claims of debt elimination or waiver or forgiveness does not  apply to legitimate statements that the advertised product may reduce  debt payments, consolidate debts, or shorten the term of the debt.  Examples of misleading claims of debt elimination or waiver or  forgiveness of loan terms with, or obligations to, another creditor of  debt include: ``Wipe-Out Personal Debts!'', ``New DEBT-FREE Payment'',  ``Set yourself free; get out of debt today'', ``Refinance today and wipe  your debt clean!'', ``Get yourself out of debt * * * Forever!'', and  ``Pre-payment Penalty Waiver.''</p><p class="depth0">Subpart D--Miscellaneous</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.25--Record Retention</p><p class="depth0">25(a) General Rule</p><p class="depth0">1. Evidence of required actions. The creditor must retain evidence  that it performed the required actions as well as made the required  disclosures. This includes, for example, evidence that the creditor  properly handled adverse credit reports in connection with amounts  subject to a billing dispute under Sec. 1026.13, and properly handled  the refunding of credit balances under Sec. Sec. 1026.11 and 1026.21.</p><p class="depth0">2. Methods of retaining evidence. Adequate evidence of compliance  does not necessarily mean actual paper copies of disclosure statements  or other business records. The evidence may be retained by any method  that reproduces records accurately (including computer programs). Unless  otherwise required, the creditor need retain only enough information to  reconstruct the required disclosures or other records. Thus, for  example, the creditor need not retain each open-end periodic statement,  so long as the specific information on each statement can be retrieved.</p><p class="depth0">3. Certain variable-rate transactions. In variable-rate transactions  that are subject to the disclosure requirements of Sec. 1026.19(b),  written procedures for compliance with those requirements as well as a  sample disclosure form for each loan program represent adequate evidence  of compliance. (See comment 25(a)-2 pertaining to permissible methods of  retaining the required disclosures.)</p><p class="depth0">4. Home equity plans. In home equity plans that are subject to the  requirements of Sec. 1026.40, written procedures for compliance with  those requirements as well as a sample disclosure form and contract for  each home equity program represent adequate evidence of compliance. (See  comment 25(a)-2 pertaining to permissible methods of retaining the  required disclosures.)</p><p class="depth0">25(c) Records Related to Certain Requirements for Mortgage Loans.</p><p class="depth0">25(c)(2) Records Related to Requirements for Loan Originator</p><p class="depth0">Compensation</p><p class="depth0">1. Scope of records of loan originator compensation. Section  1026.25(c)(2)(i) requires a creditor to maintain records sufficient to  evidence all compensation it pays to a loan originator, as well as the  compensation agreements that govern those payments, for three years  after the date of the payments. Section 1026.25(c)(2)(ii) requires that  a loan originator organization maintain records sufficient to evidence  all compensation it receives from a creditor, a consumer, or another  person and all compensation it pays to any individual loan originators,  as well as the compensation agreements that govern those payments or  receipts, for three years after the date of the receipts or payments.</p><p class="depth0">i. Records sufficient to evidence payment and receipt of  compensation. Records are sufficient to evidence payment and receipt of  compensation if they demonstrate the following facts: The nature and  amount of the compensation; that the compensation was paid, and by whom;  that the compensation was received, and by whom; and when the payment  and receipt of compensation occurred. The compensation agreements  themselves are to be retained in all circumstances consistent with Sec.  1026.25(c)(2)(i). The additional records that are sufficient necessarily  will vary on a case-by-case basis depending on the facts and  circumstances, particularly with regard to the nature of the  compensation. For example, if the compensation is in the form of a  salary, records to be retained might include copies of required filings  under the Internal Revenue Code that demonstrate the amount of the  salary. If the compensation is in the form of a contribution to or a  benefit under a designated tax-advantaged plan, records to be maintained  might include copies of required filings under the Internal Revenue Code  or other applicable Federal law relating to the plan, copies of the plan  and amendments thereto in which individual loan originators participate  and the names of any loan originators covered by the plan, or  determination letters from the Internal Revenue Service regarding the  plan. If the compensation is in the nature of a commission or bonus,  records to be retained might include a settlement agent ``flow of  funds'' worksheet or other written record or a creditor closing  instructions letter directing disbursement of   fees at consummation. Where a loan originator is a mortgage broker, a  disclosure of compensation or broker agreement required by applicable  State law that recites the broker's total compensation for a transaction  is a record of the amount actually paid to the loan originator in  connection with the transaction, unless actual compensation deviates  from the amount in the disclosure or agreement. Where compensation has  been decreased to defray the cost, in whole or part, of an unforeseen  increase in an actual settlement cost over an estimated settlement cost  disclosed to the consumer pursuant to section 5(c) of RESPA (or omitted  from that disclosure), records to be maintained are those documenting  the decrease in compensation and reasons for it.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Compensation agreement. For purposes of Sec. 1026.25(c)(2), a  compensation agreement includes any agreement, whether oral, written, or  based on a course of conduct that establishes a compensation arrangement  between the parties (e.g., a brokerage agreement between a creditor and  a mortgage broker or provisions of employment contracts between a  creditor and an individual loan originator employee addressing payment  of compensation). Where a compensation agreement is oral or based on a  course of conduct and cannot itself be maintained, the records to be  maintained are those, if any, evidencing the existence or terms of the  oral or course of conduct compensation agreement. Creditors and loan  originators are free to specify what transactions are governed by a  particular compensation agreement as they see fit. For example, they may  provide, by the terms of the agreement, that the agreement governs  compensation payable on transactions consummated on or after some future  effective date (in which case, a prior agreement governs transactions  consummated in the meantime). For purposes of applying the record  retention requirement to transaction-specific commissions, the relevant  compensation agreement for a given transaction is the agreement pursuant  to which compensation for that transaction is determined.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Three-year retention period. The requirements in Sec.  1026.25(c)(2)(i) and (ii) that the records be retained for three years  after the date of receipt or payment, as applicable, means that the  records are retained for three years after each receipt or payment, as  applicable, even if multiple compensation payments relate to a single  transaction. For example, if a loan originator organization pays an  individual loan originator a commission consisting of two separate  payments of $1,000 each on June 5 and July 7, 2014, then the loan  originator organization is required to retain records sufficient to  evidence the two payments through June 4, 2017, and July 6, 2017,  respectively.</p><p class="depth0">2. Example. An example of the application of Sec. 1026.25(c)(2) to  a loan originator organization is as follows: Assume a loan originator  organization originates only transactions that are not subject to Sec.  1026.36(d)(2), thus all of its origination compensation is paid  exclusively by creditors that fund its originations. Further assume that  the loan originator organization pays its individual loan originator  employees commissions and annual bonuses. The loan originator  organization must retain a copy of the agreement with any creditor that  pays the loan originator organization compensation for originating  consumer credit transactions subject to Sec. 1026.36 and documentation  evidencing the specific payment it receives from the creditor for each  transaction originated. In addition, the loan originator organization  must retain copies of the agreements with its individual loan originator  employees governing their commissions and their annual bonuses and  records of any specific commissions and bonuses paid.</p><p class="depth0">25(c)(3) Records related to minimum standards for transactions  secured by a dwelling.</p><p class="depth0">1. Evidence of compliance with repayment ability provisions. A  creditor must retain evidence of compliance with Sec. 1026.43 for three  years after the date of consummation of a consumer credit transaction  covered by that section. (See comment 25(c)(3)-2 for guidance on the  retention of evidence of compliance with the requirement to offer a  consumer a loan without a prepayment penalty under Sec. 1026.43(g)(3).)  If a creditor must verify and document information used in underwriting  a transaction subject to Sec. 1026.43, the creditor shall retain  evidence sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the documentation  requirements of the rule. Although a creditor need not retain actual  paper copies of the documentation used in underwriting a transaction  subject to Sec. 1026.43, to comply with Sec. 1026.25(c)(3), the  creditor must be able to reproduce such records accurately. For example,  if the creditor uses a consumer's Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form W- 2 to verify the consumer's income, the creditor must be able to  reproduce the IRS Form W-2 itself, and not merely the income information  that was contained in the form.</p><p class="depth0">2. Dwelling-secured transactions and prepayment penalties. If a  transaction covered by Sec. 1026.43 has a prepayment penalty, the  creditor must maintain records that document that the creditor complied  with requirements for offering the consumer an alternative transaction  that does not include a prepayment penalty under Sec. 1026.43(g)(3),  (4), or (5). However, the creditor need not maintain records that  document compliance with those provisions if a transaction is  consummated without a prepayment penalty or if the creditor and consumer  do not consummate a covered transaction. If a creditor offers a  transaction with a prepayment penalty to a consumer through a mortgage  broker, to evidence compliance with   Sec. 1026.43(g)(4) the creditor should retain evidence of the  alternative covered transaction presented to the mortgage broker, such  as a rate sheet, and the agreement with the mortgage broker required by  Sec. 1026.43(g)(4)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.26--Use of Annual Percentage Rate in Oral Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Application of rules. The restrictions of Sec. 1026.26 apply  only if the creditor chooses to respond orally to the consumer's request  for credit cost information. Nothing in the regulation requires the  creditor to supply rate information orally. If the creditor volunteers  information (including rate information) through oral solicitations  directed generally to prospective customers, as through a telephone  solicitation, those communications may be advertisements subject to the  rules in Sec. Sec. 1026.16 and 1026.24.</p><p class="depth0">26(a) Open-End Credit</p><p class="depth0">1. Information that may be given. The creditor may state periodic  rates in addition to the required annual percentage rate, but it need  not do so. If the annual percentage rate is unknown because transaction  charges, loan fees, or similar finance charges may be imposed, the  creditor must give the corresponding annual percentage rate (that is,  the periodic rate multiplied by the number of periods in a year, as  described in Sec. Sec. 1026.6(a)(1)(ii) and (b)(4)(i)(A) and  1026.7(a)(4) and (b)(4)). In such cases, the creditor may, but need not,  also give the consumer information about other finance charges and other  charges.</p><p class="depth0">26(b) Closed-End Credit</p><p class="depth0">1. Information that may be given. The creditor may state other  annual or periodic rates that are applied to an unpaid balance, along  with the required annual percentage rate. This rule permits disclosure  of a simple interest rate, for example, but not an add-on, discount, or  similar rate. If the creditor cannot give a precise annual percentage  rate in its oral response because of variables in the transaction, it  must give the annual percentage rate for a comparable sample  transaction; in this case, other cost information may, but need not, be  given. For example, the creditor may be unable to state a precise annual  percentage rate for a mortgage loan without knowing the exact amount to  be financed, the amount of loan fees or mortgage insurance premiums, or  similar factors. In this situation, the creditor should state an annual  percentage rate for a sample transaction; it may also provide  information about the consumer's specific case, such as the contract  interest rate, points, other finance charges, and other charges.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.27--Language of Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Subsequent disclosures. If a creditor provides account-opening  disclosures in a language other than English, subsequent disclosures  need not be in that other language. For example, if the creditor gave  Spanish-language account-opening disclosures, periodic statements and  change-in-terms notices may be made in English.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.28--Effect on State Laws</p><p class="depth0">28(a) Inconsistent Disclosure Requirements</p><p class="depth0">1. General. There are 3 sets of preemption criteria: 1 applies to  the general disclosure and advertising rules of the regulation, and 2  apply to the credit billing provisions. Section 1026.28 also provides  for Bureau determinations of preemption.</p><p class="depth0">2. Rules for chapters 1, 2, and 3. The standard for judging whether  state laws that cover the types of requirements in chapters 1 (General  provisions), 2 (Credit transactions), and 3 (Credit advertising) of the  Act are inconsistent and therefore preempted, is contradiction of the  Federal law. Examples of laws that would be preempted include:</p><p class="depth0">i. A state law that requires use of the term finance charge, but  defines the term to include fees that the Federal law excludes, or to  exclude fees the Federal law includes.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A state law that requires a label such as nominal annual  interest rate to be used for what the Federal law calls the annual  percentage rate.</p><p class="depth0">3. Laws not contradictory to chapters 1, 2, and 3. i. Generally,  state law requirements that call for the disclosure of items of  information not covered by the Federal law, or that require more  detailed disclosures, do not contradict the Federal requirements.  Examples of laws that are not preempted include:</p><p class="depth0">A. A state law that requires disclosure of the minimum periodic  payment for open-end credit, even though not required by Sec. 1026.7.</p><p class="depth0">B. A state law that requires contracts to contain warnings such as:  ``Read this contract before you sign. Do not sign if any spaces are left  blank. You are entitled to a copy of this contract.''</p><p class="depth0">ii. Similarly, a state law that requires itemization of the amount  financed does not automatically contradict the permissive itemization  under Sec. 1026.18(c). However, a state law requirement that the  itemization appear with the disclosure of the amount financed in the  segregated closed-end credit disclosures is inconsistent, and this  location requirement would be preempted.</p><p class="depth0">4. Creditor's options. Before the Bureau makes a determination about  a specific state law, the creditor has certain options.</p><p class="depth0">i. Since the prohibition against giving the state disclosures does  not apply until the Bureau makes its determination, the creditor   may choose to give state disclosures until the Bureau formally  determines that the state law is inconsistent. (The Bureau will provide  sufficient time for creditors to revise forms and procedures as  necessary to conform to its determinations.) Under this first approach,  as in all cases, the Federal disclosures must be clear and conspicuous,  and the closed-end disclosures must be properly segregated in accordance  with Sec. 1026.17(a)(1). This ability to give state disclosures  relieves any uncertainty that the creditor might have prior to Bureau  determinations of inconsistency.</p><p class="depth0">ii. As a second option, the creditor may apply the preemption  standards to a state law, conclude that it is inconsistent, and choose  not to give the state-required disclosures. However, nothing in Sec.  1026.28(a) provides the creditor with immunity for violations of state  law if the creditor chooses not to make state disclosures and the Bureau  later determines that the state law is not preempted.</p><p class="depth0">5. Rules for correction of billing errors and regulation of credit  reports. The preemption criteria for the fair credit billing provisions  set forth in Sec. 1026.28 have two parts. With respect to the rules on  correction of billing errors and regulation of credit reports (which are  in Sec. 1026.13), Sec. 1026.28(a)(2)(i) provides that a state law is  inconsistent and preempted if its requirements are different from the  Federal law. An exception is made, however, for state laws that allow  the consumer to inquire about an account and require the creditor to  respond to such inquiries beyond the time limits in the Federal law.  Such a state law is not preempted with respect to the extra time period.  For example, Sec. 1026.13 requires the consumer to submit a written  notice of billing error within 60 days after transmittal of the periodic  statement showing the alleged error. If a state law allows the consumer  90 days to submit a notice, the state law remains in effect to provide  the extra 30 days. Any state law disclosures concerning this extended  state time limit must reflect the qualifications and conform to the  format specified in Sec. 1026.28(a)(2)(i). Examples of laws that would  be preempted include:</p><p class="depth0">i. A state law that has a narrower or broader definition of billing  error.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A state law that requires the creditor to take different steps  to resolve errors.</p><p class="depth0">iii. A state law that provides different timing rules for error  resolution (subject to the exception discussed above).</p><p class="depth0">6. Rules for other fair credit billing provisions. The second part  of the criteria for fair credit billing relates to the other rules  implementing chapter 4 of the Act (addressed in Sec. Sec. 1026.4(c)(8),  1026.5(b)(2)(ii), 1026.6(a)(5) and (b)(5)(iii), 1026.7(a)(9) and (b)(9),  1026.9(a), 1026.10, 1026.11, 1026.12(c) through (f), 1026.13, and  1026.21). Section 1026.28(a)(2)(ii) provides that the test of  inconsistency is whether the creditor can comply with state law without  violating Federal law. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. A state law that allows the card issuer to offset the consumer's  credit-card indebtedness against funds held by the card issuer would be  preempted, since Sec. 1026.12(d) prohibits such action.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A state law that requires periodic statements to be sent more  than 14 days before the end of a free-ride period would not be  preempted.</p><p class="depth0">iii. A state law that permits consumers to assert claims and  defenses against the card issuer without regard to the $50 and 100-mile  limitations of Sec. 1026.12(c)(3)(ii) would not be preempted.</p><p class="depth0">iv. In paragraphs ii. and iii. of this comment, compliance with  state law would involve no violation of the Federal law.</p><p class="depth0">7. Who may receive a chapter 4 determination. Only states (through  their authorized officials) may request and receive determinations on  inconsistency with respect to the fair credit billing provisions.</p><p class="depth0">8. Preemption determination--Arizona. The Bureau recognizes state  law preemption determinations made by the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System prior to July 21, 2011, until and unless the  Bureau makes and publishes any contrary determination. Effective October  1, 1983, the Board of Governors determined that the following provisions  in the state law of Arizona are preempted by the Federal law:</p><p class="depth0">i. Section 44-287 B.5--Disclosure of final cash price balance. This  provision is preempted in those transactions in which the amount of the  final cash price balance is the same as the Federal amount financed,  since in such transactions the state law requires the use of a term  different from the Federal term to represent the same amount.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Section 44-287 B.6--Disclosure of finance charge. This provision  is preempted in those transactions in which the amount of the finance  charge is different from the amount of the Federal finance charge, since  in such transactions the state law requires the use of the same term as  the Federal law to represent a different amount.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Section 44-287 B.7--Disclosure of the time balance. The time  balance disclosure provision is preempted in those transactions in which  the amount is the same as the amount of the Federal total of payments,  since in such transactions the state law requires the use of a term  different from the Federal term to represent the same amount.</p><p class="depth0">9. Preemption determination--Florida. The Bureau recognizes state  law preemption determinations made by the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System prior to July 21, 2011, until and unless the  Bureau makes and publishes any contrary determination. Effective October  1, 1983, the   Board of Governors determined that the following provisions in the state  law of Florida are preempted by the Federal law:</p><p class="depth0">i. Sections 520.07(2)(f) and 520.34(2)(f)--Disclosure of amount  financed. This disclosure is preempted in those transactions in which  the amount is different from the Federal amount financed, since in such  transactions the state law requires the use of the same term as the  Federal law to represent a different amount.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Sections 520.07(2)(g), 520.34(2)(g), and 520.35(2)(d)-- Disclosure of finance charge and a description of its components. The  finance charge disclosure is preempted in those transactions in which  the amount of the finance charge is different from the Federal amount,  since in such transactions the state law requires the use of the same  term as the Federal law to represent a different amount. The requirement  to describe or itemize the components of the finance charge, which is  also included in these provisions, is not preempted.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Sections 520.07(2)(h) and 520.34(2)(h)--Disclosure of total of  payments. The total of payments disclosure is preempted in those  transactions in which the amount differs from the amount of the Federal  total of payments, since in such transactions the state law requires the  use of the same term as the Federal law to represent a different amount  than the Federal law.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Sections 520.07(2)(i) and 520.34(2)(i)--Disclosure of deferred  payment price. This disclosure is preempted in those transactions in  which the amount is the same as the Federal total sale price, since in  such transactions the state law requires the use of a different term  than the Federal law to represent the same amount as the Federal law.</p><p class="depth0">10. Preemption determination--Missouri. The Bureau recognizes state  law preemption determinations made by the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System prior to July 21, 2011, until and unless the  Bureau makes and publishes any contrary determination. Effective October  1, 1983, the Board of Governors determined that the following provisions  in the state law of Missouri are preempted by the Federal law:</p><p class="depth0">i. Sections 365.070-6(9) and 408.260-5(6)--Disclosure of principal  balance. This disclosure is preempted in those transactions in which the  amount of the principal balance is the same as the Federal amount  financed, since in such transactions the state law requires the use of a  term different from the Federal term to represent the same amount.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Sections 365.070-6(10) and 408.260-5(7)--Disclosure of time  price differential and time charge, respectively. These disclosures are  preempted in those transactions in which the amount is the same as the  Federal finance charge, since in such transactions the state law  requires the use of a term different from the Federal law to represent  the same amount.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Sections 365.070-2 and 408.260-2--Use of the terms time price  differential and time charge in certain notices to the buyer. In those  transactions in which the state disclosure of the time price  differential or time charge is preempted, the use of the terms in this  notice also is preempted. The notice itself is not preempted.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Sections 365.070-6(11) and 408.260-5(8)--Disclosure of time  balance. The time balance disclosure is preempted in those transactions  in which the amount is the same as the amount of the Federal total of  payments, since in such transactions the state law requires the use of a  different term than the Federal law to represent the same amount.</p><p class="depth0">v. Sections 365.070-6(12) and 408.260-5(9)--Disclosure of time sale  price.

Preemption determination--Mississippi. The Bureau recognizes  state law preemption determinations made by the Board of Governors of  the Federal Reserve System prior to July 21, 2011, until and unless the  Bureau makes and publishes any contrary determination.

Section 63-19-31(2)(g)--Disclosure of finance charge. This  disclosure is preempted in those cases in which the term finance charge  would be used under state law to describe a different amount than the  finance charge disclosed under Federal law.</p><p class="depth0">12. Preemption determination--South Carolina. The Bureau recognizes  state law preemption determinations made by the Board of Governors of  the Federal Reserve System prior to July 21, 2011, until and unless the  Bureau makes and publishes any contrary determination. Effective October  1, 1984, the Board of Governors determined that the following provision  in the state law of South Carolina is preempted by the Federal law.</p><p class="depth0">i. Section 37-10-102(c)--Disclosure of due-on-sale clause. This  provision is preempted, but only to the extent that the creditor is  required to include the disclosure with the segregated Federal  disclosures. If the creditor may comply with the state law by placing  the due-on-sale notice apart from the Federal disclosures, the state law  is not preempted.</p><p class="depth0">13. Preemption determination--Arizona. The Bureau recognizes state  law preemption determinations made by the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System prior to July 21, 2011, until and unless the  Bureau   makes and publishes any contrary determination.</p><p class="depth0">i. Effective October 1, 1986, the Board of Governors determined that  the following provision in the state law of Arizona is preempted by the  Federal law:</p><p class="depth0">A. Section 6-621A.2--Use of the term the total sum of $-------- in  certain notices provided to borrowers. This term describes the same item  that is disclosed under Federal law as the total of payments. Since the  state law requires the use of a different term than Federal law to  describe the same item, the state-required term is preempted. The notice  itself is not preempted.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Note: The state disclosure notice that incorporated the above  preempted term was amended on May 4, 1987, to provide that disclosures  must now be made pursuant to the Federal disclosure provisions.</p><p class="depth0">14.

The Bureau recognizes state  law preemption determinations made by the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System prior to July 21, 2011, until and unless the  Bureau makes and publishes any contrary determination. Effective October  1, 1988, the Board of Governors determined that the following provision  in the state law of Indiana is preempted by the Federal law:</p><p class="depth0">i. Section 23-2-5-8--Inclusion of the loan broker's fees and charges  in the calculation of, among other items, the finance charge and annual  percentage rate disclosed to potential borrowers. This disclosure is  inconsistent with section 106(a) and Sec. 1026.4(a) of the Federal  statute and regulation, respectively, and is preempted in those  instances where the use of the same term would disclose a different  amount than that required to be disclosed under Federal law.</p><p class="depth0">15. Preemption determination--Wisconsin. The Bureau recognizes state  law preemption determinations made by the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System prior to July 21, 2011, until and unless the  Bureau makes and publishes any contrary determination.

Section 422.308(1)--the disclosure of the annual percentage rate  in cases where the amount of the annual percentage rate disclosed to  consumers under the state law differs from the amount that would be  disclosed under Federal law, since in those cases the state law requires  the use of the same term as the Federal law to represent a different  amount than the Federal law.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Section 766.565(5)--the provision permitting a creditor to  include in an open-end home equity agreement authorization to declare  the account balance due and payable upon receiving notice of termination  from a non-obligor spouse, since such provision is inconsistent with the  purpose of the Federal law.</p><p class="depth0">28(b) Equivalent Disclosure Requirements</p><p class="depth0">1. General. A state disclosure may be substituted for a Federal  disclosure only after the Bureau has made a finding of substantial  similarity. Thus, the creditor may not unilaterally choose to make a  state disclosure in place of a Federal disclosure, even if it believes  that the state disclosure is substantially similar. Since the rule  stated in Sec. 1026.28(b) does not extend to any requirement relating  to the finance charge or annual percentage rate, no state provision on  computation, description, or disclosure of these terms may be  substituted for the Federal provision.</p><p class="depth0">28(d) Special Rule for Credit and Charge Cards</p><p class="depth0">1. General. The standard that applies to preemption of state laws as  they affect transactions of the type subject to Sec. Sec. 1026.60 and  1026.9(e) differs from the preemption standards generally applicable  under the Truth in Lending Act. The Fair Credit and Charge Card  Disclosure Act fully preempts state laws relating to the disclosure of  credit information in consumer credit or charge card applications or  solicitations. (For purposes of this section, a single credit or charge  card application or solicitation that may be used to open either an  account for consumer purposes or an account for business purposes is  deemed to be a ``consumer credit or charge card application or  solicitation.'') For example, a state law requiring disclosure of credit  terms in direct mail solicitations for consumer credit card accounts is  preempted. A state law requiring disclosures in telephone applications  for consumer credit card accounts also is preempted, even if it applies  to applications initiated by the consumer rather than the issuer,  because the state law relates to the disclosure of credit information in  applications or solicitations within the general field of preemption,  that is, consumer credit and charge cards.</p><p class="depth0">2. Limitations on field of preemption. Preemption under the Fair  Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act does not extend to state laws  applying to types of credit other than open-end consumer credit and  charge card accounts. Thus, for example, a state law is not preempted as  it applies to disclosures in credit and charge card applications and  solicitations solely for business-purpose accounts. On the other hand,  state credit disclosure laws will not apply to a single application or  solicitation to open either an account for consumer purposes or an  account for business purposes. Such ``dual purpose'' applications and  solicitations are treated as ``consumer credit or charge card  applications or solicitations'' under this section and state   credit disclosure laws applicable to them are preempted. Preemption  under this statute does not extend to state laws applicable to home  equity plans; preemption determinations in this area are based on the  Home Equity Loan Consumer Protection Act, as implemented in Sec.  1026.40 of the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">3. Laws not preempted. State laws relating to disclosures concerning  credit and charge cards other than in applications, solicitations, or  renewal notices are not preempted under Sec. 1026.28(d). In addition,  state laws regulating the terms of credit and charge card accounts are  not preempted, nor are laws preempted that regulate the form or content  of information unrelated to the information required to be disclosed  under Sec. Sec. 1026.60 and 1026.9(e). Finally, state laws concerning  the enforcement of the requirements of Sec. Sec. 1026.60 and 1026.9(e)  and state laws prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices  concerning credit and charge card applications, solicitations and  renewals are not preempted. Examples of laws that are not preempted  include:</p><p class="depth0">i. A state law that requires card issuers to offer a grace period or  that prohibits certain fees in credit and charge card transactions.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A state retail installment sales law or a state plain language  law, except to the extent that it regulates the disclosure of credit  information in applications, solicitations and renewals of accounts of  the type subject to Sec. Sec. 1026.60 and 1026.9(e).</p><p class="depth0">iii. A state law requiring notice of a consumer's rights under  antidiscrimination or similar laws or a state law requiring notice about  credit information available from state authorities.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.29--State Exemptions</p><p class="depth0">29(a) General Rule</p><p class="depth0">1. Classes eligible. The state determines the classes of  transactions for which it will request an exemption, and makes its  application for those classes. Classes might be, for example, all open- end credit transactions, all open-end and closed-end transactions, or  all transactions in which the creditor is a bank.</p><p class="depth0">2. Substantial similarity. The ``substantially similar'' standard  requires that state statutory or regulatory provisions and state  interpretations of those provisions be generally the same as the Federal  Act and Regulation Z. This includes the requirement that state  provisions for reimbursement to consumers for overcharges be at least  equivalent to those required in section 108 of the Act. A state will be  eligible for an exemption even if its law covers classes of transactions  not covered by the Federal law. For example, if a state's law covers  agricultural credit, this will not prevent the Bureau from granting an  exemption for consumer credit, even though agricultural credit is not  covered by the Federal law.</p><p class="depth0">3. Adequate enforcement. The standard requiring adequate provision  for enforcement generally means that appropriate state officials must be  authorized to enforce the state law through procedures and sanctions  comparable to those available to Federal enforcement agencies.  Furthermore, state law must make adequate provision for enforcement of  the reimbursement rules.</p><p class="depth0">4. Exemptions granted. The Bureau recognizes exemptions granted by  the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System prior to July 21,  2011, until and unless the Bureau makes and publishes any contrary  determination. Effective October 1, 1982, the Board of Governors granted  the following exemptions from portions of the revised Truth in Lending  Act:</p><p class="depth0">i. Maine. Credit or lease transactions subject to the Maine Consumer  Credit Code and its implementing regulations are exempt from chapters 2,  4 and 5 of the Federal Act. (The exemption does not apply to  transactions in which a federally chartered institution is a creditor or  lessor.)</p><p class="depth0">ii. Connecticut. Credit transactions subject to the Connecticut  Truth in Lending Act are exempt from chapters 2 and 4 of the Federal  Act. (The exemption does not apply to transactions in which a federally  chartered institution is a creditor.)</p><p class="depth0">iii. Massachusetts. Credit transactions subject to the Massachusetts  Truth in Lending Act are exempt from chapters 2 and 4 of the Federal  Act. (The exemption does not apply to transactions in which a federally  chartered institution is a creditor.)</p><p class="depth0">iv. Oklahoma. Credit or lease transactions subject to the Oklahoma  Consumer Credit Code are exempt from chapters 2 and 5 of the Federal  Act. (The exemption does not apply to sections 132 through 135 of the  Federal Act, nor does it apply to transactions in which a federally  chartered institution is a creditor or lessor.)</p><p class="depth0">v. Wyoming. Credit transactions subject to the Wyoming Consumer  Credit Code are exempt from chapter 2 of the Federal Act. (The exemption  does not apply to transactions in which a federally chartered  institution is a creditor.)</p><p class="depth0">29(b) Civil Liability</p><p class="depth0">1. Not eligible for exemption. The provision that an exemption may  not extend to sections 130 and 131 of the Act assures that consumers  retain access to both Federal and state courts in seeking damages or  civil penalties for violations, while creditors retain the defenses  specified in those sections.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.30--Limitation on Rates</p><p class="depth0">1. Scope of coverage. i. The requirement of this section applies to  consumer credit obligations secured by a dwelling (as dwelling is  defined in Sec. 1026.2(a)(19)) in which the annual   percentage rate may increase after consummation (or during the term of  the plan, in the case of open-end credit) as a result of an increase in  the interest rate component of the finance charge--whether those  increases are tied to an index or formula or are within a creditor's  discretion. The section applies to credit sales as well as loans.  Examples of credit obligations subject to this section include:</p><p class="depth0">A. Dwelling-secured credit obligations that require variable-rate  disclosures under the regulation because the interest rate may increase  during the term of the obligation.</p><p class="depth0">B. Dwelling-secured open-end credit plans entered into before  November 7, 1989 (the effective date of the home equity rules) that are  not considered variable-rate obligations for purposes of disclosure  under the regulation but where the creditor reserves the contractual  right to increase the interest rate--periodic rate and corresponding  annual percentage rate--during the term of the plan.</p><p class="depth0">ii. In contrast, credit obligations in which there is no contractual  right to increase the interest rate during the term of the obligation  are not subject to this section. Examples include:</p><p class="depth0">A. ``Shared-equity'' or ``shared-appreciation'' mortgage loans that  have a fixed rate of interest and a shared-appreciation feature based on  the consumer's equity in the mortgaged property. (The appreciation share  is payable in a lump sum at a specified time.)</p><p class="depth0">B. Dwelling-secured fixed-rate closed-end balloon-payment mortgage  loans and dwelling-secured fixed-rate open-end plans with a stated term  that the creditor may renew at maturity. (Contrast with the renewable  balloon-payment mortgage instrument described in comment 17(c)(1)-11.)</p><p class="depth0">C. Dwelling-secured fixed-rate closed-end multiple advance  transactions in which each advance is disclosed as a separate  transaction.</p><p class="depth0">D. ``Price level adjusted mortgages'' or other indexed mortgages  that have a fixed rate of interest but provide for periodic adjustments  to payments and the loan balance to reflect changes in an index  measuring prices or inflation.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The requirement of this section does not apply to credit  obligations entered into prior to December 9, 1987. Consequently, new  advances under open-end credit plans existing prior to December 9, 1987,  are not subject to this section.</p><p class="depth0">2. Refinanced obligations. On or after December 9, 1987, when a  credit obligation is refinanced, as defined in Sec. 1026.20(a), the new  obligation is subject to this section if it is dwelling-secured and  allows for increases in the interest rate.</p><p class="depth0">3. Assumptions. On or after December 9, 1987, when a credit  obligation is assumed, as defined in Sec. 1026.20(b), the obligation  becomes subject to this section if it is dwelling-secured and allows for  increases in the interest rate.</p><p class="depth0">4. Modifications of obligations. The modification of an obligation,  regardless of when the obligation was entered into, is generally not  covered by this section. For example, increasing the credit limit on a  dwelling-secured, open-end plan with a variable interest rate entered  into before the effective date of the rule does not make the obligation  subject to this section. If, however, a security interest in a dwelling  is added on or after December 9, 1987, to a credit obligation that  allows for interest rate increases, the obligation becomes subject to  this section. Similarly, if a variable interest rate feature is added to  a dwelling-secured credit obligation, the obligation becomes subject to  this section.</p><p class="depth0">5. Land trusts. In some states, a land trust is used in residential  real estate transactions. (See discussion in comment 3(a)-8.) If a  consumer-purpose loan that allows for interest rate increases is secured  by an assignment of a beneficial interest in a land trust that holds  title to a consumer's dwelling, that loan is subject to this section.</p><p class="depth0">6. Relationship to other sections. Unless otherwise provided for in  the commentary to this section, other provisions of the regulation such  as definitions, exemptions, rules and interpretations also apply to this  section where appropriate. To illustrate:</p><p class="depth0">i. An adjustable interest rate business-purpose loan is not subject  to this section even if the loan is secured by a dwelling because such  credit extensions are not subject to the regulation. (See generally  Sec. 1026.3(a).)</p><p class="depth0">ii. Creditors subject to this section are only those that fall  within the definition of a creditor in Sec. 1026.2(a)(17).</p><p class="depth0">7. Consumer credit contract. Creditors are required to specify a  lifetime maximum interest rate in their credit contracts--the instrument  that creates personal liability and generally contains the terms and  conditions of the agreement (for example, a promissory note or home- equity line of credit agreement). In some states, the signing of a  commitment letter may create a binding obligation, for example,  constituting consummation as defined in Sec. 1026.2(a)(13). The maximum  interest rate must be included in the credit contract, but a creditor  may include the rate ceiling in the commitment instrument as well.</p><p class="depth0">8. Manner of stating the maximum interest rate. The maximum interest  rate must be stated in the credit contract either as a specific amount  or in any other manner that would allow the consumer to easily  ascertain, at the time of entering into the obligation, what the rate  ceiling will be over the term of the obligation.</p><p class="depth0">i. For example, the following statements would be sufficiently  specific:</p><p class="depth0">A. The maximum interest rate will not exceed X%.</p><p class="depth0">B. The interest rate will never be higher than X percentage points  above the initial rate of Y%.</p><p class="depth0">C. The interest rate will not exceed X%, or X percentage points  above [a rate to be determined at some future point in time], whichever  is less.</p><p class="depth0">D. The maximum interest rate will not exceed X%, or the state usury  ceiling, whichever is less.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The following statements would not comply with this section:</p><p class="depth0">A. The interest rate will never be higher than X percentage points  over the prevailing market rate.</p><p class="depth0">B. The interest rate will never be higher than X percentage points  above [a rate to be determined at some future point in time].</p><p class="depth0">C. The interest rate will not exceed the state usury ceiling which  is currently X%.</p><p class="depth0">iii. A creditor may state the maximum rate in terms of a maximum  annual percentage rate that may be imposed. Under an open-end credit  plan, this normally would be the corresponding annual percentage rate.  (See generally Sec. 1026.6(a)(1)(ii) and (b)(4)(i)(A).)</p><p class="depth0">9. Multiple interest rate ceilings. Creditors are not prohibited  from setting multiple interest rate ceilings. For example, on loans with  multiple variable-rate features, creditors may establish a maximum  interest rate for each feature. To illustrate, in a variable-rate loan  that has an option to convert to a fixed rate, a creditor may set one  maximum interest rate for the initially imposed index-based variable- rate feature and another for the conversion option. Of course, a  creditor may establish one maximum interest rate applicable to all  features.</p><p class="depth0">10. Interest rate charged after default. State law may allow an  interest rate after default higher than the contract rate in effect at  the time of default; however, the interest rate after default is subject  to a maximum interest rate set forth in a credit obligation that is  otherwise subject to this section. This rule applies only in situations  in which a post-default agreement is still considered part of the  original obligation.</p><p class="depth0">11. Increasing the maximum interest rate--general rule. Generally, a  creditor may not increase the maximum interest rate originally set on a  credit obligation subject to this section unless the consumer and the  creditor enter into a new obligation. Therefore, under an open-end plan,  a creditor may not increase the rate ceiling imposed merely because  there is an increase in the credit limit. If an open-end plan is closed  and another opened, a new rate ceiling may be imposed. Furthermore,  where an open-end plan has a fixed maturity and a creditor renews the  plan at maturity, or enters into a closed-end credit transaction, a new  maximum interest rate may be set at that time. If the open-end plan  provides for a repayment phase, the maximum interest rate cannot be  increased when the repayment phase begins unless the agreement provided  for such an increase. For a closed-end credit transaction, a new maximum  interest rate may be set only if the transaction is satisfied and  replaced by a new obligation. (The exceptions in Sec. 1026.20(a)(1)-(5)  which limit what transactions are considered refinancings for purposes  of disclosure do not apply with respect to increasing a rate ceiling  that has been imposed; if a transaction is satisfied and replaced, the  rate ceiling may be increased.)</p><p class="depth0">12. Increasing the maximum interest rate--assumption of an  obligation. If an obligation subject to this section is assumed by a new  obligor and the original obligor is released from liability, the maximum  interest rate set on the obligation may be increased as part of the  assumption agreement. (This rule applies whether or not the transaction  constitutes an assumption as defined in Sec. 1026.20(b).)</p><p class="depth0">Subpart E--Special Rules for Certain Home Mortgage Transactions</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.31--General Rules</p><p class="depth0">31(c) Timing of Disclosure</p><p class="depth0">1. Furnishing disclosures. Disclosures are considered furnished when  received by the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">31(c)(1) Disclosures for high-cost mortgages.</p><p class="depth0">1. Pre-consummation or account opening waiting period. A creditor  must furnish Sec. 1026.32 disclosures at least three business days  prior to consummation for a closed-end, high-cost mortgage and at least  three business days prior to account opening for an open-end, high-cost  mortgage. Under Sec. 1026.32, ``business day'' has the same meaning as  the rescission rule in comment 2(a)(6)-2--all calendar days except  Sundays and the Federal legal holidays listed in 5 U.S.C. 6103(a).  However, while the disclosure rule under Sec. Sec. 1026.15 and 1026.23  extends to midnight of the third business day, the rule under Sec.  1026.32 does not. For example, under Sec. 1026.32, if disclosures were  provided on a Friday, consummation or account opening could occur any  time on Tuesday, the third business day following receipt of the  disclosures. If the timing of the rescission rule were to be used,  consummation or account opening could not occur until after midnight on  Tuesday.</p><p class="depth0">31(c)(1)(i) Change in Terms</p><p class="depth0">1. Redisclosure required. Creditors must provide new disclosures  when a change in terms makes disclosures previously provided under Sec.  1026.32(c) inaccurate, including disclosures based on and labeled as an  estimate. A   change in terms may result from a formal written agreement or otherwise.</p><p class="depth0">2. Premiums or other charges financed at consummation or account  opening. If the consumer finances the payment of premiums or other  charges as permitted under Sec. 1026.34(a)(10), and as a result the  monthly payment differs from what was previously disclosed under Sec.  1026.32, redisclosure is required and a new three-day waiting period  applies.</p><p class="depth0">31(c)(1)(ii) Telephone disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">1. Telephone disclosures. Disclosures by telephone must be furnished  at least three business days prior to consummation or account opening,  as applicable, calculated in accordance with the timing rules under  Sec. 1026.31(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0">31(c)(1)(iii) Consumer's waiver of waiting period before  consummation or account opening.</p><p class="depth0">31(c)(1)(iii) Consumer's waiver of waiting period before  consummation or account opening.</p><p class="depth0">1. Modification or waiver. A consumer may modify or waive the right  to the three-day waiting period only after receiving the disclosures  required by Sec. 1026.32 and only if the circumstances meet the  criteria for establishing a bona fide personal financial emergency under  Sec. 1026.23(e). Whether these criteria are met is determined by the  facts surrounding individual situations. The imminent sale of the  consumer's home at foreclosure during the three-day period is one  example of a bona fide personal financial emergency. Each consumer  entitled to the three-day waiting period must sign the handwritten  statement for the waiver to be effective.</p><p class="depth0">31(c)(2) Disclosures for Reverse Mortgages</p><p class="depth0">1. Business days. For purposes of providing reverse mortgage  disclosures, ``business day'' has the same meaning as in comment  31(c)(1)-1--all calendar days except Sundays and the Federal legal  holidays listed in 5 U.S.C. 6103(a). This means if disclosures are  provided on a Friday, consummation could occur any time on Tuesday, the  third business day following receipt of the disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">2. Open-end plans. Disclosures for open-end reverse mortgages must  be provided at least three business days before the first transaction  under the plan (see Sec. 1026.5(b)(1)).</p><p class="depth0">31(d) Basis of Disclosures and Use of Estimates</p><p class="depth0">1. Redisclosure. Section 1026.31(d) allows the use of estimates when  information necessary for an accurate disclosure is unknown to the  creditor, provided that the disclosure is clearly identified as an  estimate. For purposes of Subpart E, the rule in Sec. 1026.31(c)(1)(i)  requiring new disclosures when the creditor changes terms also applies  to disclosures labeled as estimates.</p><p class="depth0">31(d)(3) Per-Diem Interest</p><p class="depth0">1. Per-diem interest. This paragraph applies to the disclosure of  any numerical amount (such as the finance charge, annual percentage  rate, or payment amount) that is affected by the amount of the per-diem  interest charge that will be collected at consummation. If the amount of  per-diem interest used in preparing the disclosures for consummation is  based on the information known to the creditor at the time the  disclosure document is prepared, the disclosures are considered accurate  under this rule, and affected disclosures are also considered accurate,  even if the disclosures were not labeled as estimates. (See comment  17(c)(2)(ii)-1 generally.)</p><p class="depth0">31(h) Corrections and unintentional violations.</p><p class="depth0">1. Notice requirements. Notice of a violation pursuant to Sec.  1026.31(h)(1) or (2) should be in writing. The notice should make the  consumer aware of the choices available under Sec. 1026.31(h)(1)(iii)  and (2)(iii). For notice to be adequate, the consumer should have at  least 60 days in which to consider the available options and communicate  a choice to the creditor or assignee.</p><p class="depth0">2. Reasonable time. To claim the benefit of Sec. 1026.31(h), a  creditor or assignee must implement appropriate restitution and the  consumer's elected adjustment within a reasonable time after the  consumer provides notice of that election to the creditor or assignee.  What length of time is reasonable will depend on what changes to a loan  or credit plan's documentation, disclosure, or terms are necessary to  effectuate the adjustment. In general, implementing appropriate  restitution and completing an adjustment within 30 days of the  consumer's providing notice of the election can be considered  reasonable.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.32--Requirements for High-Cost Mortgages</p><p class="depth0">32(a) Coverage</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. The term high-cost mortgage includes both a closed-end credit  transaction and an open-end credit plan secured by the consumer's  principal dwelling. For purposes of determining coverage under Sec.  1026.32, an open-end consumer credit transaction is the account opening  of an open-end credit plan. An advance of funds or a draw on the credit  line under an open-end credit plan subsequent to account opening does  not constitute an open-end ``transaction.''</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(a)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Average prime offer rate. High-cost mortgages include closed- and  open-end consumer credit transactions secured by the consumer's  principal dwelling with an annual percentage rate that exceeds the  average   prime offer rate for a comparable transaction as of the date the  interest rate is set by the specified amount. The term ``average prime  offer rate'' is defined in Sec. 1026.35(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0">2. Comparable transaction. Guidance for determining a comparable  transaction is set forth in comments 35(a)(1)-1 and 35(a)(2)-2 and -3,  which direct creditors to published tables of average prime offer rates  for fixed- and variable-rate closed-end credit transactions. Creditors  opening open-end credit plans must compare the annual percentage rate  for the plan to the average prime offer rate for the most closely  comparable closed-end transaction. To identify the most closely  comparable closed-end transaction, the creditor should identify whether  the credit plan is fixed- or variable-rate; if the plan is fixed-rate,  the term of the plan to maturity; if the plan is variable-rate, the  duration of any initial, fixed-rate period; and the date the interest  rate for the plan is set. If a fixed-rate plan has no definite plan  length, a creditor must use the average prime offer rate for a 30-year  fixed-rate loan. If a variable-rate plan has an optional, fixed-rate  feature, a creditor must use the rate table for variable-rate  transactions. If a variable-rate plan has an initial, fixed-rate period  that is not in whole years, a creditor must identify the most closely- comparable transaction by using the number of whole years closest to the  actual fixed-rate period. For example, if a variable-rate plan has an  initial fixed-rate period of 20 months, a creditor must use the average  prime offer rate for a two-year adjustable-rate loan. If a variable-rate  plan has no initial fixed-rate period, or if it has an initial fixed- rate period of less than one year, a creditor must use the average prime  offer rate for a one-year adjustable-rate loan. Thus, for example, if  the initial fixed-rate period is six months, a creditor must use the  average prime offer rate for a one-year adjustable-rate loan.</p><p class="depth0">3. Rate set. Comment 35(a)(1)-2 provides guidance for determining  the average prime offer rate in effect on the date that the interest  rate for the transaction is set.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(a)(1)(i)(B).</p><p class="depth0">1. Loan amount less than $50,000.

Annual adjustment of $1,000 amount.

For purposes of Sec. 1026.32(a)(1)(ii), a  creditor must determine the applicable points and fees threshold based  on the face amount of the note (or, in the case of an open-end credit  plan, the credit limit for the plan when the account is opened).  However, the creditor must apply the allowable points and fees  percentage to the ``total loan amount,'' as defined in Sec.  1026.32(b)(4). For closed-end credit transactions, the total loan amount  may be different than the face amount of the note. The $20,000 amount in  Sec. 1026.32(a)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) is adjusted annually on January 1 by  the annual percentage change in the CPI that was in effect on the  preceding June 1.</p><p class="depth0">i.

Maximum period and amount. Section 1026.32(a)(1)(iii) provides  that a closed-end credit transaction or an open-end credit plan is a  high-cost mortgage if, under the terms of the loan contract or open-end  credit agreement, a creditor can charge either a prepayment penalty more  than 36 months after consummation or account opening, or total  prepayment penalties that exceed 2 percent of any amount prepaid.  Section 1026.32(a)(1)(iii) applies only for purposes of determining  whether a transaction is subject to the high-cost mortgage requirements  and restrictions in Sec. 1026.32(c) and (d) and Sec. 1026.34. However,  if a transaction is subject to those requirements and restrictions by  operation of any provision of Sec. 1026.32(a)(1), including by  operation of Sec. 1026.32(a)(1)(iii), then the transaction may not  include a prepayment penalty. See Sec. 1026.32(d)(6). As a result,  Sec. 1026.32(a)(1)(iii) effectively establishes a maximum period during  which a prepayment penalty may be imposed, and a maximum prepayment  penalty amount that may be imposed, on a closed-end credit transaction  or open-end credit plan (other than such a mortgage as described in  Sec. 1026.32(a)(2)) secured by a consumer's principal dwelling. Closed- end credit transactions covered by Sec. 1026.43 are subject to the  additional prepayment penalty restrictions set forth in Sec.  1026.43(g).</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples; open-end credit. If the terms of an open-end credit  agreement allow for a prepayment penalty that exceeds 2 percent of the  initial credit limit for the plan, the agreement will be deemed to be a  transaction with a prepayment penalty that exceeds 2 percent of the  ``amount prepaid'' within the meaning of Sec. 1026.32(a)(1)(iii). The  following examples illustrate how to calculate whether the terms of an  open-end credit agreement comply with the maximum prepayment penalty  period and amounts described in Sec. 1026.32(a)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that the terms of a home-equity line of credit with an  initial credit limit of $10,000 require the consumer to pay a $500 flat  fee if the consumer terminates the plan less than 36 months after  account opening. The $500 fee constitutes a prepayment penalty under  Sec. 1026.32(b)(6)(ii), and the penalty is greater than 2 percent of  the $10,000 initial credit limit, which is $200. Under Sec.  1026.32(a)(1)(iii), the plan is a high-cost mortgage subject to the  requirements and restrictions set forth in Sec. Sec. 1026.32 and  1026.34.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume that the terms of a home-equity line of credit with an  initial credit limit of $10,000 and a ten-year term require the consumer  to pay a $200 flat fee if the consumer terminates the plan prior to its  normal expiration. The $200 prepayment penalty does not exceed 2 percent  of the initial credit limit, but the terms of the agreement permit the  creditor to charge the fee more than 36 months after account opening.  Thus, under Sec. 1026.32(a)(1)(iii), the plan is a high-cost mortgage  subject to the requirements and restrictions set forth in Sec. Sec.  1026.32 and 1026.34.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Assume that, under the terms of a home-equity line of credit  with an initial credit limit of $150,000, the creditor may charge the  consumer any closing costs waived by the creditor if the consumer  terminates the plan less than 36 months after account opening. Assume  also that the creditor waived closing costs of $1,000. Bona fide third- party charges comprised $800 of the $1,000 in waived closing costs, and  origination charges retained by the creditor or its affiliate comprised  the remaining $200. Under Sec. 1026.32(b)(6)(ii), the $800 in bona fide  third-party charges is not a prepayment penalty, while the $200 for the  creditor's own originations costs is a prepayment penalty. The total  prepayment penalty of $200 is less than 2 percent of the initial  $150,000 credit limit, and the penalty does not apply if the consumer  terminates the plan more than 36 months after account opening. Thus, the  plan is not a high-cost mortgage under Sec. 1026.32(a)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">32(a)(2) Exemptions.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(a)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Construction-permanent loans. Section 1026.32 does not apply to a  transaction to finance the initial construction of a dwelling. This  exemption applies to a construction-only loan as well as to the  construction phase of a construction-to-permanent loan. Section 1026.32  may apply, however, to permanent financing that replaces a construction  loan, whether the permanent financing is extended by the same or a  different creditor. When a construction loan may be permanently financed  by the same creditor, Sec. 1026.17(c)(6)(ii) permits the creditor to  give either one combined disclosure for both the construction financing  and the permanent financing, or a separate set of disclosures for each  of the two phases as though they were two separate transactions. See  also comment 17(c)(6)-2. Section 1026.17(c)(6)(ii) addresses   only how a creditor may elect to disclose a construction to permanent  transaction. Which disclosure option a creditor elects under Sec.  1026.17(c)(6)(ii) does not affect the determination of whether the  permanent phase of the transaction is subject to Sec. 1026.32. When the  creditor discloses the two phases as separate transactions, the annual  percentage rate for the permanent phase must be compared to the average  prime offer rate for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent  financing to determine coverage under Sec. 1026.32. Likewise, a single  amount of points and fees, also reflecting the appropriate charges from  the permanent phase, must be calculated and compared with the total loan  amount to determine coverage under Sec. 1026.32. When the creditor  discloses the two phases as a single transaction, a single annual  percentage rate, reflecting the appropriate charges from both phases,  must be calculated for the transaction in accordance with Sec.  1026.32(a)(3) and appendix D to part 1026. This annual percentage rate  must be compared to the average prime offer rate for a transaction that  is comparable to the permanent financing to determine coverage under  Sec. 1026.32. Likewise, a single amount of points and fees, also  reflecting the appropriate charges from both phases of the transaction,  must be calculated and compared with the total loan amount to determine  coverage under Sec. 1026.32. If the transaction is determined to be a  high-cost mortgage, only the permanent phase is subject to the  requirements of Sec. Sec. 1026.32 and 1026.34.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(a)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Housing Finance Agency.

In general. The guidance set forth in the commentary to Sec.  1026.17(c)(1) and in Sec. 1026.40 addresses calculation of the annual  percentage rate disclosures for closed-end credit transactions and open- end credit plans, respectively. Section 1026.32(a)(3) requires a  different calculation of the annual percentage rate solely to determine  coverage under Sec. 1026.32(a)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">2. Open-end credit. The annual percentage rate for an open-end  credit plan must be determined in accordance with Sec. 1026.32(a)(3),  regardless of whether there is an advance of funds at account opening.  Section 1026.32(a)(3) does not require the calculation of the annual  percentage rate for any extensions of credit subsequent to account  opening. Any draw on the credit line subsequent to account opening is  not treated as a separate transaction for purposes of determining annual  percentage rate threshold coverage.</p><p class="depth0">3. Rates that vary; index rate plus maximum margin. i. Section  1026.32(a)(3)(ii) applies in the case of a closed- or open-end credit  transaction when the interest rate for the transaction varies solely in  accordance with an index. For purposes of Sec. 1026.32(a)(3)(ii), a  transaction's interest rate varies in accordance with an index even if  the transaction has an initial rate that is not determined by the index  used to make later interest rate adjustments provided that, following  the first rate adjustment, the interest rate for the transaction varies  solely in accordance with an index.</p><p class="depth0">ii. In general, for transactions subject to Sec. 1026.32(a)(3)(ii),  the annual percentage rate is determined by adding the index rate in  effect on the date that the interest rate for the transaction is set to  the maximum margin for the transaction, as set forth in the agreement  for the loan or plan. In some cases, a transaction subject to Sec.  1026.32(a)(3)(ii) may have an initial rate that is a premium rate and is  higher than the index rate plus the maximum margin as of the date the  interest rate for the transaction is set. In such cases, the annual  percentage rate is determined based on the initial ``premium'' rate.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The following examples illustrate the rule:</p><p class="depth0">A. Assume that the terms of a closed-end, adjustable-rate mortgage  loan provide for a fixed, initial interest rate of 2 percent for two  years following consummation, after which the interest rate will adjust  annually in accordance with an index plus a 2 percent margin. Also  assume that the applicable index is 3 percent as of the date the  interest rate for the transaction is set, and a lifetime interest rate  cap of 15 percent applies to the transaction. Pursuant to Sec.  1026.32(a)(3)(ii), for purposes of determining the annual percentage  rate for Sec. 1026.32(a)(1)(i), the interest rate for the transaction  is 5 percent (3 percent index rate plus 2 percent margin).</p><p class="depth0">B. Assume the same transaction terms set forth in paragraph 3.iii.A,  except that an initial interest rate of 6 percent applies to the  transaction. Pursuant to Sec. 1026.32(a)(3)(ii), for purposes of  determining the annual percentage rate for Sec. 1026.32(a)(1)(i), the  interest rate for the transaction is 6 percent.</p><p class="depth0">C. Assume that the terms of an open-end credit agreement with a  five-year draw period and a five-year repayment period provide for a  fixed, initial interest rate of 2 percent for the first year of the  repayment period, after which the interest rate will adjust annually  pursuant to a publicly-available index outside the creditor's control,  in accordance with the limitations applicable to open-end credit plans  in Sec. 1026.40(f). Also assume that, pursuant to the terms of the  open-end credit agreement, a margin of 2 percent applies because the  consumer is employed by the creditor, but that the margin will increase  to 4 percent if the consumer's employment with the creditor ends.  Finally, assume that the applicable index rate is 3.5 percent as of the  date the interest rate for   the transaction is set, and a lifetime interest rate cap of 15 percent  applies to the transaction. Pursuant to Sec. 1026.32(a)(3)(ii), for  purposes of determining the annual percentage rate for Sec.  1026.32(a)(1)(i), the interest rate for the transaction is 7.5 percent  (3.5 percent index rate plus 4 percent maximum margin).</p><p class="depth0">D. Assume the same transaction terms set forth in paragraph 3.iii.C,  except that an initial interest rate of 8 percent applies to the  transaction. Pursuant to Sec. 1026.32(a)(3)(ii), for purposes of  determining the annual percentage rate for Sec. 1026.32(a)(1)(i), the  interest rate for the transaction is 8 percent.</p><p class="depth0">4. Rates that vary other than in accordance with an index. Section  1026.32(a)(3)(iii) applies when the interest rate applicable to a  closed- or open-end transaction may or will vary, except as described in  Sec. 1026.32(a)(3)(ii). Section 1026.32(a)(3)(iii) thus applies where  multiple fixed rates apply to a transaction, such as in a step-rate  mortgage. For example, assume the following interest rates will apply to  a transaction: 3 percent for the first six months, 4 percent for the  next 10 years, and 5 percent for the remaining loan term. In this  example, Sec. 1026.32(a)(3)(iii) would be used to determine the  interest rate, and 5 percent would be the maximum interest rate  applicable to the transaction used to determine the annual percentage  rate for purposes of Sec. 1026.32(a)(1)(i). Section 1026.32(a)(3)(iii)  also applies to any other adjustable-rate loan where the interest rate  may vary but according to a formula other than the sum of an index and a  margin.</p><p class="depth0">5. Fixed-rate and -term payment options. If an open-end credit plan  has only a fixed rate during the draw period, a creditor must use the  interest rate applicable to that feature to determine the annual  percentage rate, as required by Sec. 1026.32(a)(3)(i). However, if an  open-end credit plan has a variable rate, but also offers a fixed-rate  and -term payment option during the draw period, Sec. 1026.32(a)(3)  requires a creditor to use the terms applicable to the variable-rate  feature for determining the annual percentage rate, as described in  Sec. 1026.32(a)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">32(b) Definitions.</p><p class="depth0">32(b) Definitions</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Known at or before consummation. Section 1026.32(b)(1) includes  in points and fees for closed-end credit transactions those items listed  in Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(i) through (vi) that are known at or before  consummation. The following examples clarify how to determine whether a  charge or fee is known at or before consummation.</p><p class="depth0">i. General. In general, a charge or fee is ``known at or before  consummation'' if the creditor knows at or before consummation that the  charge or fee will be imposed in connection with the transaction, even  if the charge or fee is scheduled to be paid after consummation. Thus,  for example, if the creditor charges the consumer $400 for an appraisal  conducted by an affiliate of the creditor, the $400 is included in  points and fees, even if the consumer finances it and repays it over the  loan term, because the creditor knows at or before consummation that the  charge or fee is imposed in connection with the transaction. By  contrast, if a creditor does not know whether a charge or fee will be  imposed, it is not included in points and fees. For example, charges or  fees that the creditor may impose if the consumer seeks to modify a loan  after consummation are not included in points and fees, because the  creditor does not know at or before consummation whether the consumer  will seek to modify the loan and therefore incur the fees or charges.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Prepayment penalties. Notwithstanding the guidance in comment  32(b)(1)-1.i, under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(v) the maximum prepayment  penalty that may be charged or collected under the terms of the mortgage  loan is included in points and fees because the amount of the maximum  prepayment penalty that may be charged or collected is known at or  before consummation.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Certain mortgage and credit insurance premiums. Notwithstanding  the guidance in comment 32(b)(1)-1.i, under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(C)(1)  and (iii) premiums and charges for private mortgage insurance and credit  insurance that are payable after consummation are not included in points  and fees, even if the amounts of such premiums and charges are known at  or before consummation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Charges paid by parties other than the consumer. Under Sec.  1026.32(b)(1), points and fees may include charges paid by third parties  in addition to charges paid by the consumer. Specifically, charges paid  by third parties that fall within the definition of points and fees set  forth in Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(i) through (vi) are included in points and  fees. In calculating points and fees in connection with a transaction,  creditors may rely on written statements from the consumer or third  party paying for a charge, including the seller, to determine the source  and purpose of any third-party payment for a charge.</p><p class="depth0">i. Examples--included in points and fees. A creditor's origination  charge paid by a consumer's employer on the consumer's behalf that is  included in the finance charge as defined in Sec. 1026.4(a) or (b),  must be included in points and fees under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(i), unless  other exclusions under Sec. 1026.4 or Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(A) through  (F) apply. In addition, consistent with comment 32(b)(1)(i)-1, a third- party payment of an item excluded from the finance charge under a  provision of Sec. 1026.4, while not included in the total points and  fees under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(i), may be included under Sec.  1026.32(b)(1)(ii) through (vi). For example, a payment by a third party  of   a creditor-imposed fee for an appraisal performed by an employee of the  creditor is included in points and fees under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(iii).  See comment 32(b)(1)(i)-1.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Examples--not included in points and fees. A charge paid by a  third party is not included in points and fees under Sec.  1026.32(b)(1)(i) if the exclusions to points and fees in Sec.  1026.32(b)(1)(i)(A) through (F) apply. For example, certain bona fide  third-party charges not retained by the creditor, loan originator, or an  affiliate of either are excluded from points and fees under Sec.  1026.32(b)(1)(i)(D), regardless of whether those charges are paid by a  third party or the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Seller's points. Seller's points, as described in Sec.  1026.4(c)(5) and commentary, are excluded from the finance charge and  thus are not included in points and fees under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(i).  However, charges paid by the seller for items listed in Sec.  1026.32(b)(1)(ii) through (vi) are included in points and fees.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Creditor-paid charges. Charges that are paid by the creditor,  other than loan originator compensation paid by the creditor that is  required to be included in points and fees under Sec.  1026.32(b)(1)(ii), are excluded from points and fees. See Sec. Sec.  1026.32(b)(1)(i)(A), 1026.4(a), and comment 4(a)-(2).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(b)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Section 1026.32(b)(1)(i) includes in the total ``points  and fees'' items included in the finance charge under Sec. 1026.4(a)  and (b). However, certain items that may be included in the finance  charge are excluded from points and fees under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(A)  through (F). Items excluded from the finance charge under other  provisions of Sec. 1026.4 are not included in the total points and fees  under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(i), but may be included in points and fees  under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(ii) through (vi). To illustrate: A fee imposed  by the creditor for an appraisal performed by an employee of the  creditor meets the definition of ``finance charge'' under Sec.  1026.4(a) as ``any charge payable directly or indirectly by the consumer  and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to or  a condition of the extension of credit.'' However, Sec. 1026.4(c)(7)  specifies that appraisal fees are not included in the finance charge. A  fee imposed by the creditor for an appraisal performed by an employee of  the creditor therefore would not be included in the finance charge and  would not be counted in points and fees under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(i).  Section 1026.32(b)(1)(iii), however, expressly includes in points and  fees items listed in Sec. 1026.4(c)(7) (including appraisal fees) if  the creditor receives compensation in connection with the charge. A  creditor would receive compensation for an appraisal performed by its  own employee. Thus, the appraisal fee in this example must be included  in the calculation of points and fees.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(b)(1)(i)(B).</p><p class="depth0">1. Federal and State mortgage insurance premiums and guaranty fees.  Under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(B), mortgage insurance premiums or guaranty  fees in connection with a Federal or State agency program are excluded  from points and fees, even though they are included in the finance  charge under Sec. 1026.4(a) and (b). For example, if a consumer is  required to pay a $2,000 mortgage insurance premium for a loan insured  by the Federal Housing Administration, the $2,000 must be included in  the finance charge but is not counted in points and fees. Similarly, if  a consumer pays a 2 percent funding fee for a loan guaranteed by the  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs or through the U.S Department of  Agriculture's Rural Development Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan  Program, the fee is included in the finance charge but is not included  in points and fees.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(b)(1)(i)(C).</p><p class="depth0">1. Private mortgage insurance premiums. i. Payable after  consummation. Under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(C)(1), private mortgage  insurance premiums payable after consummation are excluded from points  and fees.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Payable at or before consummation. A. General. Under Sec.  1026.32(b)(1)(i)(C)(2), private mortgage insurance premiums payable at  or before consummation (i.e., single or up-front premiums) may be  excluded from points and fees, even though they are included in the  finance charge under Sec. 1026.4(a) and (b). However, the portion of  the premium that exceeds the amount payable under policies in effect at  the time of origination under section 203(c)(2)(A) of the National  Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1709(c)(2)(A)) is included in points and fees. To  determine whether any portion of the premium exceeds the amount payable  under policies in effect at the time of origination under section  203(c)(2)(A) of the National Housing Act, a creditor references the  premium amount that would be payable for the transaction under that Act,  as implemented by applicable regulations and other written authorities  issued by the Federal Housing Administration (such as Mortgagee  Letters), even if the transaction would not qualify to be insured under  that Act (including, for example, because the principal amount exceeds  the maximum insurable under that Act).</p><p class="depth0">B. Non-refundable premiums. To qualify for the exclusion from points  and fees, private mortgage insurance premiums payable at or before  consummation must be required to be refunded on a pro rata basis and the  refund must be automatically issued upon notification of the  satisfaction of the underlying mortgage loan.</p><p class="depth0">C. Example. Assume that a $3,000 private mortgage insurance premium  charged on a closed-end mortgage loan is payable at or before closing  and is required to be refunded on   a pro rata basis and that the refund is automatically issued upon  notification of the satisfaction of the underlying mortgage loan. Assume  also that the maximum premium allowable under the National Housing Act  is $2,000. In this case, the creditor could exclude $2,000 from points  and fees but would have to include the $1,000 that exceeds the allowable  premium under the National Housing Act. However, if the $3,000 private  mortgage insurance premium were not required to be refunded on a pro  rata basis or if the refund were not automatically issued upon  notification of the satisfaction of the underlying mortgage loan, the  entire $3,000 premium would be included in points and fees.</p><p class="depth0">2. Method of paying private mortgage insurance premiums. The portion  of any private mortgage insurance premiums payable at or before  consummation that does not qualify for an exclusion from points and fees  under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(C)(2) must be included in points and fees  for purposes of Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(i) whether paid in cash or financed  and whether the insurance is optional or required.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(b)(1)(i)(D).</p><p class="depth0">1. Charges not retained by the creditor, loan originator, or an  affiliate of either. In general, a creditor is not required to count in  points and fees any bona fide third-party charge not retained by the  creditor, loan originator, or an affiliate of either. For example, if  bona fide charges are imposed by a third-party settlement agent and are  not retained by the creditor, loan originator, or an affiliate of  either, those charges are not included in points and fees, even if those  charges are included in the finance charge under Sec. 1026.4(a)(2). The  term loan originator has the same meaning as in Sec. 1026.36(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">2. Private mortgage insurance. The exclusion for bona fide third- party charges not retained by the creditor, loan originator, or an  affiliate of either is limited by Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(C) in the  general definition of ``points and fees.'' Section 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(C)  requires inclusion in points and fees of premiums or other charges  payable at or before consummation for any private guaranty or insurance  protecting the creditor against the consumer's default or other credit  loss to the extent that the premium or charge exceeds the amount payable  under policies in effect at the time of origination under section  203(c)(2)(A) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1709(c)(2)(A)).  These premiums or charges must also be included if the premiums or  charges are not required to be refundable on a pro-rated basis, or the  refund is not required to be automatically issued upon notification of  the satisfaction of the underlying mortgage loan. Under these  circumstances, even if the premiums or other charges are not retained by  the creditor, loan originator, or an affiliate of either, they must be  included in the points and fees calculation for qualified mortgages. See  comments 32(b)(1)(i)(c)-1 and -2 for further discussion of including  private mortgage insurance premiums payable at or before consummation in  the points and fees calculation.</p><p class="depth0">3. Real estate-related fees. The exclusion for bona fide third-party  charges not retained by the creditor, loan originator, or an affiliate  of either is limited by Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(iii) in the general  definition of points and fees. Section 1026.32(b)(1)(iii) requires  inclusion in points and fees of items listed in Sec. 1026.4(c)(7)  unless the charge is reasonable, the creditor receives no direct or  indirect compensation in connection with the charge, and the charge is  not paid to an affiliate of the creditor. If a charge is required to be  included in points and fees under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(iii), it may not  be excluded under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(D), even if the criteria for  exclusion in Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(D) are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0">4. Credit insurance. The exclusion for bona fide third-party charges  not retained by the creditor, loan originator, or an affiliate of either  is limited by Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(iv) in the general definition of  points and fees. Section 1026.32(b)(1)(iv) requires inclusion in points  and fees of premiums and other charges for credit insurance and certain  other types of insurance. If a charge is required to be included in  points and fees under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(iv), it may not be excluded  under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(D), even if the criteria for exclusion in  Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(D) are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(b)(1)(i)(E).</p><p class="depth0">1.

Finally, assume that the average  prime offer rate as of May 1, 2014 for home mortgages with a fixed  interest rate and a 30-year term is 5.5 percent. The creditor may  exclude two bona fide discount points from the points and fees  calculation because the rate from which the discounted rate was derived  (6.5 percent) exceeded the average   prime offer rate for a comparable transaction as of the date the rate on  the transaction was set (5.5 percent) by only 1 percentage point.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(b)(1)(i)(F).</p><p class="depth0">1.

Finally, assume that the average  prime offer rate as of May 1, 2014, for home mortgages with a fixed  interest rate and a 30-year term is 5 percent. The creditor may exclude  one discount point from the points and fees calculation because the rate  from which the discounted rate was derived (7 percent) exceeded the  average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction as of the date the  rate on the transaction was set (5 percent) by only 2 percentage points.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(b)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Loan originator compensation--general. Compensation paid by a  consumer or creditor to a loan originator, other than an employee of the  creditor, is included in the calculation of points and fees for a  transaction, provided that such compensation can be attributed to that  particular transaction at the time the interest rate is set.  Compensation paid to an employee of a creditor is not included in points  and fees. Loan originator compensation includes amounts the loan  originator retains and is not dependent on the label or name of any fee  imposed in connection with the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">2. Loan originator compensation--attributable to a particular  transaction. Loan originator compensation is compensation that is paid  by a consumer or creditor to a loan originator that can be attributed to  that particular transaction. The amount of compensation that can be  attributed to a particular transaction is the dollar value of  compensation that the loan originator will receive if the transaction is  consummated. As explained in comment 32(b)(1)(ii)-3, the amount of  compensation that a loan originator will receive is calculated as of the  date the interest rate is set and includes compensation that is paid  before, at, or after consummation.</p><p class="depth0">3. Loan originator compensation--timing. Compensation paid to a loan  originator that can be attributed to a transaction must be included in  the points and fees calculation for that loan regardless of whether the  compensation is paid before, at, or after consummation. The amount of  loan originator compensation that can be attributed to a transaction is  determined as of the date the interest rate is set. Thus, loan  originator compensation for a transaction includes compensation that can  be attributed to that transaction at the time the creditor sets the  interest rate for the transaction, even if that compensation is not paid  until after consummation.</p><p class="depth0">4. Loan originator compensation--calculating loan originator  compensation in connection with other charges or payments included in  the finance charge or made to loan originators. i. Consumer payments to  mortgage brokers. As provided in Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(ii)(A), consumer  payments to a mortgage broker already included in the points and fees  calculation under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(i) need not be counted again under  Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(ii). For example, assume a consumer pays a mortgage  broker a $3,000 fee for a transaction. The $3,000 mortgage broker fee is  included in the finance charge under Sec. 1026.4(a)(3). Because the  $3,000 mortgage broker fee is already included in points and fees under  Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(i), it is not counted again under Sec.  1026.32(b)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Payments by a mortgage broker to its individual loan originator  employee. As provided in Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(ii)(B), compensation paid  by a mortgage broker to its individual loan originator employee is not  included in points and fees under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(ii). For example,  assume a consumer pays a $3,000 fee to a mortgage broker, and the  mortgage broker pays a $1,500 commission to its individual loan  originator employee for that transaction. The $3,000 mortgage broker fee  is included in points and fees, but the $1,500 commission is not  included in points and fees because it has already been included in  points and fees as part of the $3,000 mortgage broker fee.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Creditor's origination fees--loan originator not employed by  creditor. Compensation paid by a creditor to a loan originator who is  not employed by the creditor is included in the calculation of points  and fees under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(ii). Such compensation is included in  points and fees in addition to any origination fees or charges paid by  the consumer to the creditor that are included in points and fees under  Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(i). For example, assume that a consumer pays to the  creditor a $3,000 origination fee and that the creditor pays a mortgage  broker $1,500 in compensation attributed to the transaction. Assume  further that the consumer pays no other charges to the creditor that are  included in points and fees under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(i) and that the  mortgage broker receives no other compensation that is included in  points and fees under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(ii). For purposes of  calculating points and fees, the $3,000 origination fee is included in  points and fees under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(i) and the $1,500 in loan  originator compensation is included in points and fees under Sec.  1026.32(b)(1)(ii), equaling $4,500 in   total points and fees, provided that no other points and fees are paid  or compensation received.</p><p class="depth0">5. Loan originator compensation--calculating loan originator  compensation in manufactured home transactions. i. If a manufactured  home retailer qualifies as a loan originator under Sec. 1026.36(a)(1),  then compensation that is paid by a consumer or creditor to the retailer  for loan origination activities and that can be attributed to the  transaction at the time the interest rate is set must be included in  points and fees. For example, assume a manufactured home retailer takes  a residential mortgage loan application and is entitled to receive at  consummation a $1,000 commission from the creditor for taking the  mortgage loan application. The $1,000 commission is loan originator  compensation that must be included in points and fees.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the creditor has knowledge that the sales price of a  manufactured home includes loan originator compensation, then such  compensation can be attributed to the transaction at the time the  interest rate is set and therefore is included in points and fees under  Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(ii). However, the creditor is not required to  investigate the sales price of a manufactured home to determine if the  sales price includes loan originator compensation.</p><p class="depth0">iii. As provided in Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(ii)(D), compensation paid by  a manufactured home retailer to its employees is not included in points  and fees under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the creditor has knowledge that the sales price of a  manufactured home includes loan originator compensation, then such  compensation can be attributed to the transaction at the time the  interest rate is set and therefore is included in points and fees under  Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(ii). However, the creditor is not required to  investigate the sales price of a manufactured home to determine if the  sales price includes loan originator compensation.</p><p class="depth0">iii. As provided in Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(ii)(D), compensation paid by  a manufactured home retailer to its employees is not included in points  and fees under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(b)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Other charges. Section 1026.32(b)(1)(iii) defines points and fees  to include all items listed in Sec. 1026.4(c)(7), other than amounts  held for the future payment of taxes, unless certain exclusions apply.  An item listed in Sec. 1026.4(c)(7) may be excluded from the points and  fees calculation if the charge is reasonable; the creditor receives no  direct or indirect compensation from the charge; and the charge is not  paid to an affiliate of the creditor. For example, a reasonable fee paid  by the consumer to an independent, third-party appraiser may be excluded  from the points and fees calculation (assuming no compensation is paid  to the creditor or its affiliate and no charge is paid to an affiliate).  By contrast, a fee paid by the consumer for an appraisal performed by  the creditor must be included in the calculation, even though the fee  may be excluded from the finance charge if it is bona fide and  reasonable in amount.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(b)(1)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">1. Credit insurance and debt cancellation or suspension coverage. In  determining points and fees for purposes of Sec. 1026.32(b)(1),  premiums paid at or before consummation for credit insurance or any debt  cancellation or suspension agreement or contract are included in points  and fees whether they are paid in cash or, if permitted by applicable  law, financed and whether the insurance or coverage is optional or  required. Such charges are also included whether the amount represents  the entire premium or payment for the coverage or an initial payment.</p><p class="depth0">2. Credit property insurance. Credit property insurance includes  insurance against loss of or damage to personal property, such as a  houseboat or manufactured home. Credit property insurance covers the  creditor's security interest in the property. Credit property insurance  does not include homeowners' insurance, which, unlike credit property  insurance, typically covers not only the dwelling but its contents and  protects the consumer's interest in the property.</p><p class="depth0">3. Life, accident, health, or loss-of-income insurance. Premiums or  other charges for these types of insurance are included in points and  fees only if the creditor is a beneficiary. If the consumer or another  person designated by the consumer is the sole beneficiary, then the  premiums or other charges are not included in points and fees.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1.

Section  1026.32(b)(2)(viii) requires creditors in open-end credit plans to  include in points and fees any transaction fee, including any per- transaction fee, that will be charged for a draw on the credit line.  Section 1026.32(b)(2)(viii) requires the creditor to assume that the  consumer will make at least one draw during the term of the credit plan.  Thus, if the terms of the open-end credit plan permit the creditor to  charge a $10 transaction fee each time the consumer draws on the credit  line, Sec. 1026.32(b)(2)(viii) requires the creditor to include one $10  charge in the points and fees calculation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Fixed-rate loan option. If the terms of an open-end credit plan  permit a consumer to draw on the credit line using either a variable- rate feature or a fixed-rate feature, Sec. 1026.32(b)(2)(viii) requires  the creditor to use the terms applicable to the variable-rate feature  for determining the transaction fee that must be included in the points  and fees calculation.</p><p class="depth0">32(b)(3) Bona fide discount point.</p><p class="depth0">32(b)(3)(i) Closed-end credit.</p><p class="depth0">1. Definition of bona fide discount point. Section 1026.32(b)(3)  provides that, to be bona fide, a discount point must reduce the  interest rate based on a calculation that is consistent with established  industry practices for determining the amount of reduction in the  interest rate or time-price differential appropriate for the amount of  discount points paid by the consumer. To satisfy this standard, a  creditor may show that the reduction is reasonably consistent with  established industry norms and practices for secondary mortgage market  transactions. For example, a creditor may rely on pricing in the to-be- announced (TBA) market for mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to establish  that the interest rate reduction is consistent with the compensation  that the creditor could reasonably expect to receive in the secondary  market. The creditor may also establish that its interest rate reduction  is consistent with established industry practices by showing that its  calculation complies with requirements prescribed in Fannie Mae or  Freddie Mac guidelines for interest rate reductions from bona fide  discount points. For example, assume that the Fannie Mae Single-Family  Selling Guide or the Freddie Mac Single Family Seller/Servicer Guide  imposes a cap on points and fees but excludes from the cap discount  points that result in a bona fide reduction in the interest rate. Assume  the guidelines require that, for a discount point to be bona fide so  that it would not count against the cap, a discount point must result in  at least a 25 basis point reduction in the interest rate. Accordingly,  if the creditor offers a 25 basis point interest rate reduction for a  discount point and the requirements of Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(i)(E) or (F)  are satisfied, the discount point is bona fide and is excluded from the  calculation of points and fees.</p><p class="depth0">32(b)(4) Total loan amount.</p><p class="depth0">32(b)(4)(i) Closed-end credit.</p><p class="depth0">1. Total loan amount; examples. Below are several examples showing  how to calculate the total loan amount for closed-end mortgage loans,  each using a $10,000 amount borrowed, a $300 appraisal fee, and $400 in  prepaid finance charges. A $500 single premium for optional credit  unemployment insurance is used in one example.</p><p class="depth0">i. If the consumer finances a $300 fee for a creditor-conducted  appraisal and pays $400 in prepaid finance charges at closing, the  amount financed under Sec. 1026.18(b) is $9,900 ($10,000 plus the $300  appraisal fee that is paid to and financed by the creditor, less $400 in  prepaid finance charges). The $300 appraisal fee paid to the creditor is  added to other points and fees under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(iii). It is  deducted from the amount financed ($9,900) to derive a total loan amount  of $9,600.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the consumer pays the $300 fee for the creditor-conducted  appraisal in cash at closing, the $300 is included in the points and  fees calculation because it is paid to the creditor. However, because  the $300 is not financed by the creditor, the fee is not part of the  amount financed under Sec. 1026.18(b). In this case, the amount  financed is the same as the total loan amount: $9,600 ($10,000, less  $400 in prepaid finance charges).</p><p class="depth0">iii. If the consumer finances a $300 fee for an appraisal conducted  by someone other than the creditor or an affiliate, the $300 fee is not  included with other points and fees under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(iii). In  this case, the amount financed is the same as the total loan amount:  $9,900 ($10,000 plus the $300 fee for an independently-conducted  appraisal that is financed by the creditor, less the $400 paid in cash  and deducted as prepaid finance charges).</p><p class="depth0">iv. If the consumer finances a $300 fee for a creditor-conducted  appraisal and a $500 single premium for optional credit unemployment  insurance, and pays $400 in prepaid finance charges at closing, the  amount financed under Sec. 1026.18(b) is $10,400 ($10,000, plus the  $300 appraisal fee that is paid to and financed by the creditor, plus  the $500 insurance premium that is financed by the creditor, less $400  in prepaid finance charges). The $300 appraisal fee paid to the creditor  is added to other points and fees under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(ii), and the  $500 insurance premium is added under 1026.32(b)(1)(iv). The $300 and  $500 costs are deducted from the amount financed ($10,400) to derive a  total loan amount of $9,600.</p><p class="depth0">32(b)(6) Prepayment penalty.</p><p class="depth0">1. Examples of prepayment penalties; closed-end credit transactions.  For purposes of Sec. 1026.32(b)(6)(i), the following are examples of  prepayment penalties:</p><p class="depth0">i. A charge determined by treating the loan balance as outstanding  for a period of time after prepayment in full and applying the interest  rate to such ``balance,'' even if the charge results from interest  accrual amortization used for other payments in the transaction under  the terms of the loan contract. ``Interest accrual amortization'' refers  to the method by which the amount of interest due for each period (e.g.,  month) in a transaction's term is determined. For example, ``monthly  interest accrual amortization'' treats each payment as made on the  scheduled, monthly due date even if it is actually paid early or late  (until the expiration of any grace period). Thus, under the terms of a  loan contract providing for monthly interest accrual amortization, if  the amount of interest due on May 1 for the preceding month of April is  $3,000, the loan contract will require payment of $3,000 in interest for  the month of April whether the payment is made on April 20, on May 1, or  on May 10. In this example, if the consumer prepays the loan in full on  April 20 and if the accrued interest as of that date is $2,000, then  assessment of a charge of $3,000 constitutes a prepayment penalty of  $1,000 because the amount of interest actually earned through April 20  is only $2,000.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A fee, such as an origination or other loan closing cost, that  is waived by the creditor on the condition that the consumer does not  prepay the loan. However, the term prepayment penalty does not include a  waived bona fide third-party charge imposed by the creditor if the  consumer pays all of a covered transaction's principal before the date  on which the principal is due sooner than 36 months after consummation.  For example, assume that at consummation, the creditor waives $3,000 in  closing costs to cover bona fide third-party charges but the terms of  the loan agreement provide that the creditor may recoup the $3,000 in  waived charges if the consumer repays the entire loan balance sooner  than 36 months after consummation. The $3,000 charge is not a prepayment  penalty. In contrast, for example, assume that at consummation, the  creditor waives $3,000 in closing costs to cover bona fide third-party  charges but the terms of the loan agreement provide that the creditor  may recoup $4,500, in part to recoup waived charges, if the consumer  repays the entire loan balance sooner than 36 months after consummation.  The $3,000 that the creditor may impose to cover the waived bona fide  third-party charges is not a prepayment penalty, but the additional  $1,500 charge is a prepayment penalty and subject to the restrictions  under Sec. 1026.43(g).</p><p class="depth0">iii. A minimum finance charge in a simple interest transaction.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Computing a refund of unearned interest by a method that is less  favorable to the consumer than the actuarial method, as defined by  section 933(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, 15  U.S.C. 1615(d). For purposes of computing a refund of unearned interest,  if using the actuarial method defined by applicable State law results in  a refund that is greater than the refund calculated by using the method  described in section 933(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act  of 1992, creditors should use the State law definition in determining if  a refund is a prepayment penalty.</p><p class="depth0">2. Fees that are not prepayment penalties; closed-end credit  transactions. For purposes of Sec. 1026.32(b)(6)(i), fees that are not  prepayment penalties include, for example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Fees imposed for preparing and providing documents when a loan is  paid in full if such fees are imposed whether or not the loan is  prepaid. Examples include a loan payoff statement, a reconveyance  document, or another document releasing the creditor's security interest  in the dwelling that secures the loan.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Loan guarantee fees.</p><p class="depth0">3. Examples of prepayment penalties; open-end credit. For purposes  of Sec. 1026.32(b)(6)(ii), the term prepayment penalty includes a  charge, including a waived closing cost, imposed by the creditor if the  consumer terminates the open-end credit plan prior to the end of its  term. This includes a charge imposed if the consumer terminates the plan  outright or, for example, if the consumer terminates the plan in  connection with obtaining a new loan or plan with the current holder of  the existing plan, a servicer acting on behalf of the current holder, or  an affiliate of either. However, the term prepayment penalty does not  include a waived bona fide third-party charge imposed by the creditor if  the consumer terminates the open-end credit plan during the first 36  months after account opening.</p><p class="depth0">4. Fees that are not prepayment penalties; open-end credit. For  purposes of Sec. 1026.32(b)(6)(ii), fees that are not prepayment  penalties include, for example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Fees imposed for preparing and providing documents when an open- end credit plan is terminated, if such fees are imposed whether or not  the consumer terminates the plan prior to the end of its term. Examples  include a payoff statement, a reconveyance document, or another document  releasing the creditor's security interest in the dwelling that secures  the line of credit.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Loan guarantee fees.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Any fee that the creditor may impose in lieu of termination and  acceleration under comment 40(f)(2)-2.</p><p class="depth0">32(c)(2) Annual percentage rate.</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosing annual percentage rate for open-end high-cost  mortgages. In disclosing the annual percentage rate for an open-end,  high-cost mortgage under Sec. 1026.32(c)(2), creditors must comply with  Sec. 1026.6(a)(1). If a fixed-rate, discounted introductory or initial  interest rate is offered on the transaction, Sec. 1026.32(c)(2)  requires a creditor to disclose the annual percentage rate of the fixed- rate, discounted introductory or initial interest rate feature, and the  rate that would apply when the feature expires.</p><p class="depth0">32(c)(3) Regular payment; minimum periodic payment example; balloon  payment.</p><p class="depth0">1. Balloon payment.

General. The regular payment is the amount due from the consumer  at regular intervals, such as monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, or  annually. There must be at least two payments, and the payments must be  in an amount and at such intervals that they fully amortize the amount  owed. In disclosing the regular payment, creditors may rely on the rules  set forth in Sec. 1026.18(g); however, the amounts for voluntary items,  such as credit life insurance, may be included in the regular payment  disclosure only if the consumer has previously agreed to the amounts.</p><p class="depth0">i. If the loan has more than one payment level, the regular payment  for each level must be disclosed. For example:</p><p class="depth0">A. In a 30-year graduated payment mortgage where there will be  payments of $300 for the first 120 months, $400 for the next 120 months,  and $500 for the last 120 months, each payment amount must be disclosed,  along with the length of time that the payment will be in effect.</p><p class="depth0">B. If interest and principal are paid at different times, the  regular amount for each must be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">C. In discounted or premium variable-rate transactions where the  creditor sets the initial interest rate and later rate adjustments are  determined by an index or formula, the creditor must disclose both the  initial payment based on the discount or premium and the payment that  will be in effect thereafter. Additional explanatory material which does  not detract from the required disclosures may accompany the disclosed  amounts. For example, if a monthly payment is $250 for the first six  months and then increases based on an index and margin, the creditor  could use language such as the following: ``Your regular monthly payment  will be $250 for six months. After six months your regular monthly  payment will be based on an index and margin, which currently would make  your payment $350. Your actual payment at that time may be higher or  lower.''</p><p class="depth0">32(c)(4) Variable-rate.</p><p class="depth0">1. Calculating ``worst-case'' payment example. For a closed-end  credit transaction, creditors may rely on instructions in Sec.  1026.19(b)(2)(viii)(B) for calculating the maximum possible increases in  rates in the shortest possible timeframe, based on the face amount of  the note (not the hypothetical loan amount of $10,000 required by Sec.  1026.19(b)(2)(viii)(B)). The creditor must provide a maximum payment for  each payment level, where a payment schedule provides for more than one  payment level and more than one maximum payment amount is possible. For  an open-end credit plan, the maximum monthly payment must be based on  the following assumptions:</p><p class="depth0">i. The consumer borrows the full credit line at account opening with  no additional extensions of credit.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The consumer makes only minimum periodic payments during the  draw period and any repayment period.</p><p class="depth0">iii. If the annual percentage rate may increase during the plan, the  maximum annual percentage rate that is included in the contract, as  required by Sec. 1026.30, applies to the plan at account opening.</p><p class="depth0">32(c)(5) Amount Borrowed</p><p class="depth0">1. Optional insurance; debt-cancellation coverage. This disclosure  is required when the amount borrowed in a refinancing includes premiums  or other charges for credit life, accident, health, or loss-of-income  insurance, or debt-cancellation coverage (whether or not the debt- cancellation coverage is insurance under applicable law) that provides  for cancellation of all or part of the consumer's liability in the event  of the loss of life, health, or income or in the case of accident. See  comment 4(d)(3)-2 and comment app. G and H-2 regarding terminology for  debt-cancellation coverage.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(d) Limitations</p><p class="depth0">1. Additional prohibitions applicable under other sections. Section  1026.34 sets forth certain prohibitions in connection with high-cost  mortgages, in addition to the limitations in Sec. 1026.32(d). Further,  Sec. 1026.35(b) prohibits certain practices in connection with closed- end transactions that meet the coverage test in Sec. 1026.35(a).  Because the coverage test in Sec. 1026.35(a) is generally broader than  the coverage test in Sec. 1026.32(a), most closed-end high-cost  mortgages are also subject to the prohibitions set forth in Sec.  1026.35(b) (such as escrows), in addition to the limitations in Sec.  1026.32(d).</p><p class="depth0">32(d)(1)(i) Balloon Payment</p><p class="depth0">1. Regular periodic payments. The repayment schedule for a high-cost  mortgage must fully amortize the outstanding principal balance through  ``regular periodic payments.'' A payment is a ``regular periodic  payment'' if it is not more than two times the amount of other payments.  For purposes of open-end credit plans, the term ``regular periodic  payment'' or ``periodic payment'' means the required minimum periodic  payment.</p><p class="depth0">2. Repayment period. If the terms of an open-end credit plan provide  for a repayment period during which no further draws may be taken, the  limitations in Sec. 1026.32(d)(1)(i) apply to regular periodic payments  required by the credit plan during the draw period, but do not apply to  any adjustment in the regular periodic payment that results from the  transition from the credit plan's draw period to its repayment period.  Further, the limitation on balloon payments in Sec. 1026.32(d)(1)(i)  does not preclude increases in regular periodic payments that result  solely from the initial draw or additional draws on the credit line  during the draw period.</p><p class="depth0">3. No repayment period. If the terms of an open-end credit plan do  not provide for a repayment period, the repayment schedule must fully  amortize any outstanding principal balance in the draw period through  regular periodic payments. However, the limitation on balloon payments  in Sec. 1026.32(d)(1)(i) does not preclude increases in regular  periodic payments that result solely from the initial draw or additional  draws on the credit line during the draw period.</p><p class="depth0">32(d)(2) Negative Amortization</p><p class="depth0">1. Negative amortization. The prohibition against negative  amortization in a high-cost mortgage does not preclude reasonable  increases in the principal balance that result from events permitted by  the legal obligation unrelated to the payment schedule. For example,  when a consumer fails to obtain property insurance and the creditor  purchases insurance, the creditor may add a reasonable premium to the  consumer's principal balance, to the extent permitted by applicable law  and the consumer's legal obligation.</p><p class="depth0">32(d)(4) Increased Interest Rate</p><p class="depth0">1. Variable-rate transactions. The limitation on interest rate  increases does not apply to rate increases resulting from changes in  accordance with the legal obligation in a variable-rate transaction,  even if the increase occurs after default by the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">32(d)(5) Rebates</p><p class="depth0">1. Calculation of refunds. The limitation applies only to refunds of  precomputed (such as add-on) interest and not to any other charges that  are considered finance charges under Sec. 1026.4 (for example, points  and fees paid at closing). The calculation of the refund of interest  includes odd-days interest, whether paid at or after consummation.</p><p class="depth0">32(d)(8) Acceleration of debt.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(d)(8)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Fraud or material misrepresentation. A creditor may terminate a  loan or open-end credit agreement and accelerate the balance if there  has been fraud or material misrepresentation by the consumer in  connection with the loan or open-end credit agreement. What constitutes  fraud or misrepresentation is determined by applicable State law and may  include acts of omission as well as overt acts, as long as any necessary  intent on the part of the consumer exists.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(d)(8)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Failure to meet repayment terms. A creditor may terminate a loan  or open-end credit agreement and accelerate the balance when   the consumer fails to meet the repayment terms resulting in a default in  payment under the agreement; a creditor may do so, however, only if the  consumer actually fails to make payments resulting in a default in the  agreement. For example, a creditor may not terminate and accelerate if  the consumer, in error, sends a payment to the wrong location, such as a  branch rather than the main office of the creditor. If a consumer files  for or is placed in bankruptcy, the creditor may terminate and  accelerate under Sec. 1026.32(d)(8)(ii) if the consumer fails to meet  the repayment terms resulting in a default of the agreement. Section  1026.32(d)(8)(ii) does not override any State or other law that requires  a creditor to notify a consumer of a right to cure, or otherwise places  a duty on the creditor before it can terminate a loan or open-end credit  agreement and accelerate the balance.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 32(d)(8)(iii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Impairment of security. A creditor may terminate a loan or open- end credit agreement and accelerate the balance if the consumer's action  or inaction adversely affects the creditor's security for the loan, or  any right of the creditor in that security. Action or inaction by third  parties does not, in itself, permit the creditor to terminate and  accelerate.</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples. i. A creditor may terminate and accelerate, for  example, if:</p><p class="depth0">A. The consumer transfers title to the property or sells the  property without the permission of the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">B. The consumer fails to maintain required insurance on the  dwelling.</p><p class="depth0">C. The consumer fails to pay taxes on the property.</p><p class="depth0">D. The consumer permits the filing of a lien senior to that held by  the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">E. The sole consumer obligated on the credit dies.</p><p class="depth0">F. The property is taken through eminent domain.</p><p class="depth0">G. A prior lienholder forecloses.</p><p class="depth0">ii. By contrast, the filing of a judgment against the consumer would  be cause for termination and acceleration only if the amount of the  judgment and collateral subject to the judgment is such that the  creditor's security is adversely and materially affected in violation of  the loan or open-end credit agreement. If the consumer commits waste or  otherwise destructively uses or fails to maintain the property,  including demolishing or removing structures from the property, such  that the action adversely affects the security in a material way, the  loan or open-end credit agreement may be terminated and the balance  accelerated. Illegal use of the property by the consumer would permit  termination and acceleration if it subjects the property to seizure. If  one of two consumers obligated on a loan dies, the creditor may  terminate the loan and accelerate the balance if the security is  adversely affected. If the consumer moves out of the dwelling that  secures the loan and that action adversely affects the security in a  material way, the creditor may terminate a loan or open-end credit  agreement and accelerate the balance.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.33--Requirements for Reverse Mortgages</p><p class="depth0">33(a) Definition</p><p class="depth0">1. Nonrecourse transaction. A nonrecourse reverse mortgage  transaction limits the homeowner's liability to the proceeds of the sale  of the home (or any lesser amount specified in the credit obligation).  If a transaction structured as a closed-end reverse mortgage transaction  allows recourse against the consumer, and the annual percentage rate or  the points and fees exceed those specified under Sec. 1026.32(a)(1),  the transaction is subject to all the requirements of Sec. 1026.32,  including the limitations concerning balloon payments and negative  amortization.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 33(a)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Default. Default is not defined by the statute or regulation, but  rather by the legal obligation between the parties and state or other  law.</p><p class="depth0">2. Definite term or maturity date. To meet the definition of a  reverse mortgage transaction, a creditor cannot require any principal,  interest, or shared appreciation or equity to be due and payable (other  than in the case of default) until after the consumer's death, transfer  of the dwelling, or the consumer ceases to occupy the dwelling as a  principal dwelling. Some state laws require legal obligations secured by  a mortgage to specify a definite maturity date or term of repayment in  the instrument. An obligation may state a definite maturity date or term  of repayment and still meet the definition of a reverse-mortgage  transaction if the maturity date or term of repayment used would not  operate to cause maturity prior to the occurrence of any of the maturity  events recognized in the regulation. For example, some reverse mortgage  programs specify that the final maturity date is the borrower's 150th  birthday; other programs include a shorter term but provide that the  term is automatically extended for consecutive periods if none of the  other maturity events has yet occurred. These programs would be  permissible.</p><p class="depth0">33(c) Projected Total Cost of Credit</p><p class="depth0">33(c)(1) Costs to Consumer</p><p class="depth0">1. Costs and charges to consumer--relation to finance charge. All  costs and charges to the consumer that are incurred in a reverse  mortgage transaction are included in the   projected total cost of credit, and thus in the total annual loan cost  rates, whether or not the cost or charge is a finance charge under Sec.  1026.4.</p><p class="depth0">2. Annuity costs. As part of the credit transaction, some creditors  require or permit a consumer to purchase an annuity that immediately--or  at some future time--supplements or replaces the creditor's payments.  The amount paid by the consumer for the annuity is a cost to the  consumer under this section, regardless of whether the annuity is  purchased through the creditor or a third party, or whether the purchase  is mandatory or voluntary. For example, this includes the costs of an  annuity that a creditor offers, arranges, assists the consumer in  purchasing, or that the creditor is aware the consumer is purchasing as  a part of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">3. Disposition costs excluded. Disposition costs incurred in  connection with the sale or transfer of the property subject to the  reverse mortgage are not included in the costs to the consumer under  this paragraph. (However, see the definition of Valnin  appendix K to the regulation to determine the effect certain disposition  costs may have on the total annual loan cost rates.)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 33(c)(2) Payments to Consumer</p><p class="depth0">1. Payments upon a specified event. The projected total cost of  credit should not reflect contingent payments in which a credit to the  outstanding loan balance or a payment to the consumer's estate is made  upon the occurrence of an event (for example, a ``death benefit''  payable if the consumer's death occurs within a certain period of time).  Thus, the table of total annual loan cost rates required under Sec.  1026.33(b)(2) would not reflect such payments. At its option, however, a  creditor may put an asterisk, footnote, or similar type of notation in  the table next to the applicable total annual loan cost rate, and state  in the body of the note, apart from the table, the assumption upon which  the total annual loan cost is made and any different rate that would  apply if the contingent benefit were paid.</p><p class="depth0">33(c)(3) Additional Creditor Compensation</p><p class="depth0">1. Shared appreciation or equity. Any shared appreciation or equity  that the creditor is entitled to receive pursuant to the legal  obligation must be included in the total cost of a reverse mortgage  loan. For example, if a creditor agrees to a reduced interest rate on  the transaction in exchange for a portion of the appreciation or equity  that may be realized when the dwelling is sold, that portion is included  in the projected total cost of credit.</p><p class="depth0">33(c)(4) Limitations on Consumer Liability</p><p class="depth0">1. In general. Creditors must include any limitation on the  consumer's liability (such as a nonrecourse limit or an equity  conservation agreement) in the projected total cost of credit. These  limits and agreements protect a portion of the equity in the dwelling  for the consumer or the consumer's estate. For example, the following  are limitations on the consumer's liability that must be included in the  projected total cost of credit:</p><p class="depth0">i. A limit on the consumer's liability to a certain percentage of  the projected value of the home.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A limit on the consumer's liability to the net proceeds from the  sale of the property subject to the reverse mortgage.</p><p class="depth0">2. Uniform assumption for ``net proceeds'' recourse limitations. If  the legal obligation between the parties does not specify a percentage  for the ``net proceeds'' liability of the consumer, for purposes of the  disclosures required by Sec. 1026.33, a creditor must assume that the  costs associated with selling the property will equal 7 percent of the  projected sale price (see the definition of the Valn symbol  under appendix K(b)(6)).</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.34--Prohibited Acts or Practices in Connection With High-</p><p class="depth0">Cost Mortgages</p><p class="depth0">34(a) Prohibited Acts or Practices for High-Cost Mortgages</p><p class="depth0">34(a)(1) Home-Improvement Contracts</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 34(a)(1)(i)</p><p class="depth0">1. Joint payees. If a creditor pays a contractor with an instrument  jointly payable to the contractor and the consumer, the instrument must  name as payee each consumer who is primarily obligated on the note.</p><p class="depth0">34(a)(2) Notice to Assignee</p><p class="depth0">1. Subsequent sellers or assignors. Any person, whether or not the  original creditor, that sells or assigns a mortgage subject to Sec.  1026.32 must furnish the notice of potential liability to the purchaser  or assignee.</p><p class="depth0">2. Format. While the notice of potential liability need not be in  any particular format, the notice must be prominent. Placing it on the  face of the note, such as with a stamp, is one means of satisfying the  prominence requirement.</p><p class="depth0">3. Assignee liability. Pursuant to section 131(d) of the Act, the  Act's general holder-in-due course protections do not apply to  purchasers and assignees of loans covered by Sec. 1026.32. For such  loans, a purchaser's or other assignee's liability for all claims and  defenses that the consumer could assert against the creditor is not  limited to violations of the Act.</p><p class="depth0">34(a)(3) Refinancings Within One-Year Period</p><p class="depth0">1. In the borrower's interest. The determination of whether or not a  refinancing covered by Sec. 1026.34(a)(3) is in the borrower's interest   is based on the totality of the circumstances, at the time the credit is  extended. A written statement by the borrower that ``this loan is in my  interest'' alone does not meet this standard.</p><p class="depth0">i. A refinancing would be in the borrower's interest if needed to  meet the borrower's ``bona fide personal financial emergency'' (see  generally Sec. 1026.23(e) and Sec. 1026.31(c)(1)(iii)).</p><p class="depth0">ii. In connection with a refinancing that provides additional funds  to the borrower, in determining whether a loan is in the borrower's  interest consideration should be given to whether the loan fees and  charges are commensurate with the amount of new funds advanced, and  whether the real estate-related charges are bona fide and reasonable in  amount (see generally Sec. 1026.4(c)(7)).</p><p class="depth0">2. Application of the one-year refinancing prohibition to creditors  and assignees. The prohibition in Sec. 1026.34(a)(3) applies where an  extension of credit subject to Sec. 1026.32 is refinanced into another  loan subject to Sec. 1026.32. The prohibition is illustrated by the  following examples. Assume that Creditor A makes a loan subject to Sec.  1026.32 on January 15, 2003, secured by a first lien; this loan is  assigned to Creditor B on February 15, 2003:</p><p class="depth0">i. Creditor A is prohibited from refinancing the January 2003 loan  (or any other loan subject to Sec. 1026.32 to the same borrower) into a  loan subject to Sec. 1026.32, until January 15, 2004. Creditor B is  restricted until January 15, 2004, or such date prior to January 15,  2004 that Creditor B ceases to hold or service the loan. During the  prohibition period, Creditors A and B may make a subordinate lien loan  that does not refinance a loan subject to Sec. 1026.32. Assume that on  April 1, 2003, Creditor A makes but does not assign a second-lien loan  subject to Sec. 1026.32. In that case, Creditor A would be prohibited  from refinancing either the first-lien or second-lien loans (or any  other loans to that borrower subject to Sec. 1026.32) into another loan  subject to Sec. 1026.32 until April 1, 2004.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The loan made by Creditor A on January 15, 2003 (and assigned to  Creditor B) may be refinanced by Creditor C at any time. If Creditor C  refinances this loan on March 1, 2003 into a new loan subject to Sec.  1026.32, Creditor A is prohibited from refinancing the loan made by  Creditor C (or any other loan subject to Sec. 1026.32 to the same  borrower) into another loan subject to Sec. 1026.32 until January 15,  2004. Creditor C is similarly prohibited from refinancing any loan  subject to Sec. 1026.32 to that borrower into another until March 1,  2004. (The limitations of Sec. 1026.34(a)(3) no longer apply to  Creditor B after Creditor C refinanced the January 2003 loan and  Creditor B ceased to hold or service the loan.)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 34(a)(4) Repayment Ability for High-Cost Mortgages</p><p class="depth0">1. Application of repayment ability rule. The Sec. 1026.34(a)(4)  prohibition against making loans without regard to consumers' repayment  ability applies to open-end, high-cost mortgages. The Sec. 1026.43  repayment ability provisions apply to closed-end, high-cost mortgages.  Accordingly, in connection with a closed-end, high-cost mortgage, Sec.  1026.34(a)(4) requires a creditor to comply with the repayment ability  requirements set forth in Sec. 1026.43.</p><p class="depth0">2. General prohibition. Section 1026.34(a)(4) prohibits a creditor  from extending credit under a high-cost, open-end credit plan based on  the value of the consumer's collateral without regard to the consumer's  repayment ability as of account opening, including the consumer's  current and reasonably expected income, employment, assets other than  the collateral, current obligations, and property tax and insurance  obligations. A creditor may base its determination of repayment ability  on current or reasonably expected income from employment or other  sources, on assets other than the collateral, or both.</p><p class="depth0">3. Other dwelling-secured obligations. For purposes of Sec.  1026.34(a)(4), current obligations include another credit obligation of  which the creditor has knowledge undertaken prior to or at account  opening and secured by the same dwelling that secures the high-cost  mortgage transaction.</p><p class="depth0">4. Discounted introductory rates and non-amortizing payments. A  credit agreement may determine a consumer's initial payments using a  temporarily discounted interest rate or permit the consumer to make  initial payments that are non-amortizing. In such cases the creditor may  determine repayment ability using the assumptions provided in Sec.  1026.34(a)(4)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">5. Repayment ability as of account opening. Section 1026.34(a)(4)  prohibits a creditor from disregarding repayment ability based on the  facts and circumstances known to the creditor as of account opening. In  general, a creditor does not violate this provision if a consumer  defaults because of a significant reduction in income (for example, a  job loss) or a significant obligation (for example, an obligation  arising from a major medical expense) that occurs after account opening.  However, if a creditor has knowledge as of account opening of reductions  in income (for example, if a consumer's written application states that  the consumer plans to retire within twelve months without obtaining new  employment, or states that the consumer will transition from full-time  to part-time employment), the creditor must consider that information.</p><p class="depth0">6. Income, assets, and employment. Any current or reasonably  expected assets or income may be considered by the creditor, except   the collateral itself. For example, a creditor may use information about  current or expected salary, wages, bonus pay, tips, and commissions.  Employment may be full-time, part-time, seasonal, irregular, military,  or self-employment. Other sources of income could include interest or  dividends; retirement benefits; public assistance; and alimony, child  support, or separate maintenance payments. A creditor may also take into  account assets such as savings accounts or investments that the consumer  can or will be able to use.</p><p class="depth0">7. Interaction with Regulation B. Section 1026.34(a)(4) does not  require or permit the creditor to make inquiries or verifications that  would be prohibited by Regulation B, 12 CFR part 1002.</p><p class="depth0">34(a)(4)(i) Mortgage-Related Obligations</p><p class="depth0">1. Mortgage-related obligations. A creditor must include in its  repayment ability analysis the expected property taxes and premiums for  mortgage-related insurance required by the creditor as set forth in  Sec. 1026.35(b), as well as similar mortgage-related expenses. Similar  mortgage-related expenses include homeowners' association dues and  condominium or cooperative fees.</p><p class="depth0">34(a)(4)(ii) Verification of Repayment Ability</p><p class="depth0">1. Income and assets relied on. A creditor must verify the income  and assets the creditor relies on to evaluate the consumer's repayment  ability. For example, if a consumer earns a salary and also states that  he or she is paid an annual bonus, but the creditor only relies on the  applicant's salary to evaluate repayment ability, the creditor need only  verify the salary.</p><p class="depth0">2. Income and assets--co-applicant. If two persons jointly apply for  credit and both list income or assets on the application, the creditor  must verify repayment ability with respect to both applicants unless the  creditor relies only on the income or assets of one of the applicants in  determining repayment ability.</p><p class="depth0">3. Expected income. If a creditor relies on expected income, the  expectation must be reasonable and it must be verified with third-party  documents that provide reasonably reliable evidence of the consumer's  expected income. For example, if the creditor relies on an expectation  that a consumer will receive an annual bonus, the creditor may verify  the basis for that expectation with documents that show the consumer's  past annual bonuses and the expected bonus must bear a reasonable  relationship to past bonuses. Similarly, if the creditor relies on a  consumer's expected salary following the consumer's receipt of an  educational degree, the creditor may verify that expectation with a  written statement from an employer indicating that the consumer will be  employed upon graduation at a specified salary.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 34(a)(4)(ii)(A)</p><p class="depth0">1. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form W-2. A creditor may verify a  consumer's income using a consumer's IRS Form W-2 (or any subsequent  revisions or similar IRS Forms used for reporting wages and tax  withholding). The creditor may also use an electronic retrieval service  for obtaining the consumer's W-2 information.</p><p class="depth0">2. Tax returns. A creditor may verify a consumer's income or assets  using the consumer's tax return. A creditor may also use IRS Form 4506  ``Request for Copy of Tax Return,'' Form 4506-T ``Request for Transcript  of Tax Return,'' or Form 8821 ``Tax Information Authorization'' (or any  subsequent revisions or similar IRS Forms appropriate for obtaining tax  return information directly from the IRS) to verify the consumer's  income or assets. The creditor may also use an electronic retrieval  service for obtaining tax return information.</p><p class="depth0">3. Other third-party documents that provide reasonably reliable  evidence of consumer's income or assets. Creditors may verify income and  assets using documents produced by third parties. Creditors may not rely  on information provided orally by third parties, but may rely on  correspondence from the third party, such as by letter or email. The  creditor may rely on any third-party document that provides reasonably  reliable evidence of the consumer's income or assets. For example,  creditors may verify the consumer's income using receipts from a check- cashing or remittance service, or by obtaining a written statement from  the consumer's employer that states the consumer's income.</p><p class="depth0">4. Information specific to the consumer. Creditors must verify a  consumer's income or assets using information that is specific to the  individual consumer. Creditors may use third-party databases that  contain individual-specific data about a consumer's income or assets,  such as a third-party database service used by the consumer's employer  for the purpose of centralizing income verification requests, so long as  the information is reasonably current and accurate. Information about  average incomes for the consumer's occupation in the consumer's  geographic location or information about average incomes paid by the  consumer's employer, however, would not be specific to the individual  consumer.</p><p class="depth0">5. Duplicative collection of documentation. A creditor that has made  a loan to a consumer and is refinancing or extending new credit to the  same consumer need not collect from the consumer a document the creditor  previously obtained if the creditor has no information that would  reasonably lead the creditor to believe that document has changed since  it was initially collected. For example,   if the creditor has obtained the consumer's 2006 tax return to make a  home purchase loan in May 2007, the creditor may rely on the 2006 tax  return if the creditor makes a home equity loan to the same consumer in  August 2007. Similarly, if the creditor has obtained the consumer's bank  statement for May 2007 in making the first loan, the creditor may rely  on that bank statement for that month in making the subsequent loan in  August 2007.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 34(a)(4)(ii)(B)</p><p class="depth0">1. In general. A credit report may be used to verify current  obligations. A credit report, however, might not reflect an obligation  that a consumer has listed on an application. The creditor is  responsible for considering such an obligation, but the creditor is not  required to independently verify the obligation. Similarly, a creditor  is responsible for considering certain obligations undertaken just  before or at account opening and secured by the same dwelling that  secures the transaction (for example, a ``piggy back'' loan), of which  the creditor knows, even if not reflected on a credit report. See  comment 34(a)(4)-3.</p><p class="depth0">34(a)(4)(iii) Presumption of Compliance</p><p class="depth0">1. In general. A creditor is presumed to have complied with Sec.  1026.34(a)(4) if the creditor follows the three underwriting procedures  specified in paragraph 34(a)(4)(iii) for verifying repayment ability,  determining the payment obligation, and measuring the relationship of  obligations to income. The procedures for verifying repayment ability  are required under Sec. 1026.34(a)(4)(ii); the other procedures are not  required but, if followed along with the required procedures, create a  presumption that the creditor has complied with Sec. 1026.34(a)(4). The  consumer may rebut the presumption with evidence that the creditor  nonetheless disregarded repayment ability despite following these  procedures. For example, evidence of a very high debt-to-income ratio  and a very limited residual income could be sufficient to rebut the  presumption, depending on all of the facts and circumstances. If a  creditor fails to follow one of the non-required procedures set forth in  Sec. 1026.34(a)(4)(iii), then the creditor's compliance is determined  based on all of the facts and circumstances without there being a  presumption of either compliance or violation.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 34(a)(4)(iii)(B)</p><p class="depth0">1. Determination of payment schedule. To retain a presumption of  compliance under Sec. 1026.34(a)(4)(iii), a creditor must determine the  consumer's ability to pay the principal and interest obligation based on  the maximum scheduled payment. In general, a creditor should determine a  payment schedule for purposes of Sec. 1026.34(a)(4)(iii)(B) based on  the guidance in the commentary to Sec. 1026.32(c)(3).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 34(a)(4)(iii)(C)</p><p class="depth0">1. ``Income'' and ``debt''. To determine whether to classify  particular inflows or obligations as ``income'' or ``debt,'' creditors  may look to widely accepted governmental and non-governmental  underwriting standards, including, for example, those set forth in the  Federal Housing Administration's handbook on Mortgage Credit Analysis  for Mortgage Insurance.</p><p class="depth0">34(a)(4)(iv) Exclusions From Presumption of Compliance</p><p class="depth0">1. In general. The exclusions from the presumption of compliance  should be interpreted consistent with comments 32(d)(1)(i)-1 and  32(d)(2)-1.</p><p class="depth0">2. Renewable balloon loan. If a creditor is unconditionally  obligated to renew a balloon-payment loan at the consumer's option (or  is obligated to renew subject to conditions within the consumer's  control), the full term resulting from such renewal is the relevant term  for purposes of the exclusion of certain balloon-payment loans. See  comment 17(c)(1)-11 for a discussion of conditions within a consumer's  control in connection with renewable balloon-payment loans.</p><p class="depth0">34(a)(5) Pre-loan counseling.</p><p class="depth0">34(a)(5)(i) Certification of counseling required.</p><p class="depth0">1. HUD-approved counselor. For purposes of Sec. 1026.34(a)(5),  counselors approved by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing  and Urban Development are homeownership counselors certified pursuant to  section 106(e) of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12  U.S.C. 1701x(e)), or as otherwise determined by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0">2. State housing finance authority. For purposes of Sec.  1026.34(a)(5), a ``State housing finance authority'' has the same  meaning as ``State housing finance agency'' provided in 24 CFR 214.3.</p><p class="depth0">3. Processing applications. Prior to receiving certification of  counseling, a creditor may not extend a high-cost mortgage, but may  engage in other activities, such as processing an application that will  result in the extension of a high-cost mortgage (by, for example,  ordering an appraisal or title search).</p><p class="depth0">4. Form of certification. The written certification of counseling  required by Sec. 1026.34(a)(5)(i) may be received by mail, email,  facsimile, or any other method, so long as the certification is in a  retainable form.</p><p class="depth0">5. Purpose of certification. Certification of counseling indicates  that a consumer has received counseling as required by Sec.  1026.34(a)(5), but it does not indicate that a   counselor has made a judgment or determination as to the appropriateness  of the transaction for the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">34(a)(5)(ii) Timing of counseling.</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosures for open-end credit plans. Section 1026.34(a)(5)(ii)  permits receipt of either the disclosure required by section 5(c) of  RESPA or the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.40 to allow  counseling to occur. Pursuant to 12 CFR 1024.7(h), the disclosures  required by Sec. 1026.40 can be provided for open-end plans in lieu of  the usual disclosure required by section 5(c) of RESPA.</p><p class="depth0">2. Transactions not subject to RESPA or Sec. 1026.40. For closed- end mortgage transactions that are not subject to RESPA, the counseling  certification must include a statement that the consumer(s) received  counseling on the advisability of the high-cost mortgage based on the  terms provided in the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.32(c).  (Reference to counseling on advisability using the disclosures required  by Sec. 1026.32(c) is not required for transactions subject to RESPA or  Sec. 1026.40.) The disclosures required by Sec. 1026.32(c) must be  furnished to the consumer at least three business days prior to  consummation of the mortgage. The creditor may wish to furnish the  disclosures sooner, to provide sufficient time for counseling and  certification.</p><p class="depth0">3. Initial disclosure. Counseling may occur after receipt of either  an initial disclosure required by section 5(c) of RESPA, the disclosures  required by Sec. 1026.40, or the disclosures required by Sec.  1026.32(c), regardless of whether revised versions of such disclosures  are subsequently provided to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">34(a)(5)(iv) Content of certification.</p><p class="depth0">1. Statement of counseling on advisability. A statement that a  consumer has received counseling on the advisability of the high-cost  mortgage means that the consumer has received counseling about key terms  of the mortgage transaction, as set out in either the disclosure  required by section 5(c) of RESPA or the disclosures provided to the  consumer pursuant to Sec. 1026.40, or, for closed-end transactions not  subject to RESPA, the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.32(c); the  consumer's budget, including the consumer's income, assets, financial  obligations, and expenses; and the affordability of the mortgage  transaction for the consumer. Examples of such terms of the mortgage  transaction include the initial interest rate, the initial monthly  payment, whether the payment may increase, how the minimum periodic  payment will be determined, and fees imposed by the creditor, as may be  reflected in the applicable disclosure. A statement that a consumer has  received counseling on the advisability of the high-cost mortgage does  not require the counselor to have made a judgment or determination as to  the appropriateness of the mortgage transaction for the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">2. Statement of verification. A statement that a counselor has  verified that the consumer has received the disclosures required by  either Sec. 1026.32(c) or by RESPA for the high-cost mortgage means  that a counselor has confirmed, orally, in writing, or by some other  means, receipt of such disclosures with the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">34(a)(5)(v) Counseling fees.</p><p class="depth0">1. Financing. Section 1026.34(a)(5)(v) does not prohibit a creditor  from financing the counseling fee as part of the transaction for a high- cost mortgage, if the fee is a bona fide third-party charge as provided  by Sec. 1026.32(b)(5)(i).</p><p class="depth0">34(a)(5)(vi) Steering prohibited.</p><p class="depth0">1. An example of an action that constitutes steering would be when a  creditor repeatedly highlights or otherwise distinguishes the same  counselor in the notices the creditor provides to consumers pursuant to  Sec. 1026.34(a)(5)(vii).</p><p class="depth0">2. Section 1026.34(a)(5)(vi) does not prohibit a creditor from  providing a consumer with objective information related to counselors or  counseling organizations in response to a consumer's inquiry. An example  of an action that would not constitute steering would be when a consumer  asks the creditor for information about the fees charged by a counselor,  and the creditor responds by providing the consumer information about  fees charged by the counselor to other consumers that previously  obtained counseling pursuant to Sec. 1026.34(a)(5).</p><p class="depth0">34(a)(6) Recommended default.</p><p class="depth0">1. Facts and circumstances. Whether a creditor or mortgage broker  ``recommends or encourages'' default for purposes of Sec. 1026.34(a)(6)  depends on all of the relevant facts and circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples. i. A creditor or mortgage broker ``recommends or  encourages'' default when the creditor or mortgage broker advises the  consumer to stop making payments on an existing loan in a manner that is  likely to cause the consumer to default on the existing loan.</p><p class="depth0">ii. When delay of consummation of a high-cost mortgage occurs for  reasons outside the control of a creditor or mortgage broker, that  creditor or mortgage broker does not ``recommend or encourage'' default  because the creditor or mortgage broker informed a consumer that:</p><p class="depth0">A. The consumer's high-cost mortgage is scheduled to be consummated  prior to the due date for the next payment due on the consumer's  existing loan, which is intended to be paid by the proceeds of the new  high-cost mortgage; and</p><p class="depth0">B. Any delay of consummation of the new high-cost mortgage beyond  the payment due date of the existing loan will not relieve the consumer  of the obligation to make timely payment on that loan.</p><p class="depth0">34(a)(8) Late fees.</p><p class="depth0">34(a)(8)(i) General.</p><p class="depth0">1. For purposes of Sec. 1026.34(a)(8), in connection with an open- end credit plan, the amount of the payment past due is the required  minimum periodic payment as provided under the terms of the open-end  credit agreement.</p><p class="depth0">34(a)(8)(iii) Multiple late charges assessed on payment subsequently  paid.</p><p class="depth0">1. Section 1026.34(a)(8)(iii) prohibits the pyramiding of late fees  or charges in connection with a high-cost mortgage payment. For example,  assume that a consumer's regular periodic payment of $500 is due on the  1st of each month. On August 25, the consumer makes a $500 payment which  was due on August 1, and as a result, a $10 late charge is assessed. On  September 1, the consumer makes another $500 payment for the regular  periodic payment due on September 1, but does not pay the $10 late  charge assessed on the August payment. Under Sec. 1026.34(h)(2), it is  impermissible to allocate $10 of the consumer's September 1 payment to  cover the late charge, such that the September payment becomes  delinquent. In short, because the $500 payment made on September 1 is a  full payment for the applicable period and is paid by its due date or  within any applicable grace period, no late charge may be imposed on the  account in connection with the September payment.</p><p class="depth0">34(a)(8)(iv) Failure to make required payment.</p><p class="depth0">1. Under Sec. 1026.34(a)(8)(iv), if a consumer fails to make one or  more required payments and then resumes making payments but fails to  bring the account current, it is permissible, if permitted by the terms  of the loan contract or open-end credit agreement, to apply the  consumer's payments first to the past due payment(s) and to impose a  late charge on each subsequent required payment until the account is  brought current. To illustrate: Assume that a consumer's regular  periodic payment of $500 is due on the 1st of each month, or before the  expiration of a 15-day grace period. Also assume that the consumer fails  to make a timely installment payment by August 1 (or within the  applicable grace period), and a $10 late charge therefore is imposed.  The consumer resumes making monthly payments on September 1. Under Sec.  1026.34(a)(8)(iv), if permitted by the terms of the loan contract, the  creditor may apply the $500 payment made on September 1 to satisfy the  missed $500 payment that was due on August 1. If the consumer makes no  other payment prior to the end of the grace period for the payment that  was due on September 1, the creditor may also impose a $10 late fee for  the payment that was due on September 1.</p><p class="depth0">34(a)(10) Financing of points and fees.</p><p class="depth0">1. Points and fees. For purposes of Sec. 1026.34(a)(10), ``points  and fees'' means those items that are required to be included in the  calculation of points and fees under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1) and (2). Thus,  for example, in connection with the extension of credit under a high- cost mortgage, a creditor may finance a fee charged by a third-party  counselor in connection with the consumer's receipt of pre-loan  counseling under Sec. 1026.34(a)(5), because, pursuant to Sec.  1026.32(b)(1)(i)(D) and (b)(2)(i)(D), such a fee is excluded from the  calculation of points and fees as a bona fide third-party charge.</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples of financing points and fees. For purposes of Sec.  1026.34(a)(10), points and fees are financed if, for example, they are  added to the loan balance or financed through a separate note, if the  note is payable to the creditor or to an affiliate of the creditor. In  the case of an open-end credit plan, a creditor also finances points and  fees if the creditor advances funds from the credit line to cover the  fees.</p><p class="depth0">34(b) Prohibited acts or practices for dwelling-secured loans;  structuring loans to evade high-cost mortgage requirements.</p><p class="depth0">1. Examples. i. A creditor structures a transaction in violation of  Sec. 1026.34(b) if, for example, the creditor structures a loan that  would otherwise be a high-cost mortgage as two or more loans, whether  made consecutively or at the same time, for example, to divide the loan  fees to avoid the points and fees threshold for high-cost mortgages in  Sec. 1026.32(a)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">ii. A creditor does not structure a transaction in violation of  Sec. 1026.34(b) when a loan to finance the initial construction of a  dwelling may be permanently financed by the same creditor, such as a  ``construction-to-permanent'' loan, and the construction phase and the  permanent phase are treated as separate transactions. Section  1026.17(c)(6)(ii) permits the creditor to give either one combined  disclosure for both the construction financing and the permanent  financing, or a separate set of disclosures for each of the two phases  as though they were two separate transactions. See also comment  17(c)(6)-2.</p><p class="depth0">2. Amount of credit extended. Where a loan is documented as open-end  credit but the features and terms or other circumstances demonstrate  that it does not meet the definition of open-end credit, the loan is  subject to the rules for closed-end credit. Thus, in determining the  ``total loan amount'' for purposes of applying the triggers under Sec.  1026.32, the amount of credit that would have been extended if the loan  had been documented as a closed-end loan is a factual determination to  be made in each case. Factors to be considered include the amount of  money the consumer originally requested, the amount of the first advance  or the highest outstanding balance, or the amount of the credit line.  The full amount of the credit line is considered only to the extent that  it is reasonable to expect that the consumer might use the full amount  of credit.   34(b) Prohibited Acts or Practices for Dwelling-Secured Loans; Open-End</p><p class="depth0">Credit</p><p class="depth0">1. Amount of credit extended. Where a loan is documented as open-end  credit but the features and terms or other circumstances demonstrate  that it does not meet the definition of open-end credit, the loan is  subject to the rules for closed-end credit, including Sec. 1026.32 if  the rate or fee trigger is met. In applying the triggers under Sec.  1026.32, the ``amount financed,'' including the ``principal loan  amount'' must be determined. In making the determination, the amount of  credit that would have been extended if the loan had been documented as  a closed-end loan is a factual determination to be made in each case.  Factors to be considered include the amount of money the consumer  originally requested, the amount of the first advance or the highest  outstanding balance, or the amount of the credit line.

Comparable transaction. A higher-priced mortgage loan is a  consumer credit transaction secured by the consumer's principal dwelling  with an annual percentage rate that exceeds the average prime offer rate  for a comparable transaction as of the date the interest rate is set by  the specified margin. The table of average prime offer rates published  by the Bureau indicates how to identify the comparable transaction.</p><p class="depth0">2. Rate set. A transaction's annual percentage rate is compared to  the average prime offer rate as of the date the transaction's interest  rate is set (or ``locked'') before consummation. Sometimes a creditor  sets the interest rate initially and then re-sets it at a different  level before consummation. The creditor should use the last date the  interest rate is set before consummation.</p><p class="depth0">3. Threshold for ``jumbo'' loans. Section 1026.35(a)(1)(ii) provides  a separate threshold for determining whether a transaction is a higher- priced mortgage loan subject to Sec. 1026.35 when the principal balance  exceeds the limit in effect as of the date the transaction's rate is set  for the maximum principal obligation eligible for purchase by Freddie  Mac (a ``jumbo'' loan). The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)  establishes and adjusts the maximum principal obligation pursuant to  rules under 12 U.S.C. 1454(a)(2) and other provisions of federal law.  Adjustments to the maximum principal obligation made by FHFA apply in  determining whether a mortgage loan is a ``jumbo'' loan to which the  separate coverage threshold in Sec. 1026.35(a)(1)(ii) applies.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 35(a)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Average prime offer rate. Average prime offer rates are annual  percentage rates derived from average interest rates, points, and other  loan pricing terms currently offered to consumers by a representative  sample of creditors for mortgage transactions that have low-risk pricing  characteristics. Other pricing terms include commonly used indices,  margins, and initial fixed-rate periods for variable-rate transactions.  Relevant pricing characteristics include a consumer's credit history and  transaction characteristics such as the loan-to-value ratio, owner- occupant status, and purpose of the transaction. To obtain average prime  offer rates, the Bureau uses a survey of creditors that both meets the  criteria of Sec. 1026.35(a)(2) and provides pricing terms for at least  two types of variable-rate transactions and at least two types of non- variable-rate transactions. An example of such a survey is the Freddie  Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey[supreg].</p><p class="depth0">2. Bureau table. The Bureau publishes on the Internet, in table  form, average prime offer rates for a wide variety of transaction types.  The Bureau calculates an annual percentage rate, consistent with  Regulation Z (see Sec. 1026.22 and appendix J), for each transaction  type for which pricing terms are available from a survey. The Bureau  estimates annual percentage rates for other types of transactions for  which direct survey data are not available based on the loan pricing  terms available in the survey and other information. The Bureau  publishes on the Internet the methodology it uses to arrive at these  estimates.</p><p class="depth0">3. Additional guidance on determination of average prime offer  rates. The average prime offer rate has the same meaning in Sec.  1026.35 as in Regulation C, 12 CFR part 1003. See 12 CFR  1003.4(a)(12)(ii). Guidance on the average prime offer rate under Sec.  1026.35(a)(2), such as when a transaction's rate is set and  determination of the comparable transaction, is provided in the official  commentary under Regulation C, the publication entitled ``A Guide to  HMDA Reporting: Getting it Right!'', and the relevant ``Frequently Asked  Questions'' on Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) compliance posted on  the FFIEC's Web site at http://www.ffiec.gov/hmda.</p><p class="depth0">35(b) Escrow Accounts</p><p class="depth0">1. Principal dwelling. Section 1026.35(b)(1) applies to principal  dwellings, including structures that are classified as personal property  under State law. For example, an escrow account must be established on a  higher-priced mortgage loan secured by a first lien on a manufactured  home, boat, or   trailer used as the consumer's principal dwelling. See the commentary  under Sec. Sec. 1026.2(a)(19) and(24), 1026.15, and 1026.23. Section  1026.35(b)(1) also applies to a higher-priced mortgage loan secured by a  first lien on a condominium if it is in fact used as the consumer's  principal dwelling. But see Sec. 1026.35(b)(2) for exemptions from the  escrow requirement that may apply to such transactions.</p><p class="depth0">35(b)(1) Requirement to escrow for property taxes and insurance</p><p class="depth0">1. Administration of escrow accounts. Section 1026.35(b)(1) requires  creditors to establish an escrow account for payment of property taxes  and premiums for mortgage-related insurance required by the creditor  before the consummation of a higher-priced mortgage loan secured by a  first lien on a principal dwelling. Section 6 of RESPA, 12 U.S.C. 2605,  and Regulation X, 12 CFR 1024.17, address how escrow accounts must be  administered.</p><p class="depth0">2. Optional insurance items. Section 1026.35(b)(1) does not require  that an escrow account be established for premiums for mortgage-related  insurance that the creditor does not require in connection with the  credit transaction, such as earthquake insurance or credit life  insurance, even if the consumer voluntarily obtains such insurance.</p><p class="depth0">3. Transactions not subject to Sec. 1026.35(b)(1). Section  1026.35(b)(1) requires a creditor to establish an escrow account before  consummation of a first-lien higher-priced mortgage loan. This  requirement does not affect a creditor's ability, right, or obligation,  pursuant to the terms of the legal obligation or applicable law, to  offer or require an escrow account for a transaction that is not subject  to Sec. 1026.35(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0">35(b)(2) Exemptions</p><p class="depth0">35(b)(2) Exemptions.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 35(b)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Construction-permanent loans. Under Sec. 1026.35(b)(2)(ii)(B),  Sec. 1026.35 does not apply to a transaction to finance the initial  construction of a dwelling. Section 1026.35 may apply, however, to  permanent financing that replaces a construction loan, whether the  permanent financing is extended by the same or a different creditor.  When a construction loan may be permanently financed by the same  creditor, Sec. 1026.17(c)(6)(ii) permits the creditor to give either  one combined disclosure for both the construction financing and the  permanent financing, or a separate set of disclosures for each of the  two phases as though they were two separate transactions. See also  comment 17(c)(6)-2. Section 1026.17(c)(6)(ii) addresses only how a  creditor may elect to disclose a construction-permanent transaction.  Which disclosure option a creditor elects under Sec. 1026.17(c)(6)(ii)  does not affect the determination of whether the permanent phase of the  transaction is subject to Sec. 1026.35. When the creditor discloses the  two phases as separate transactions, the annual percentage rate for the  permanent phase must be compared to the average prime offer rate for a  transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine  whether the transaction is a higher-priced mortgage loan under Sec.  1026.35(a). When the creditor discloses the two phases as a single  transaction, a single annual percentage rate, reflecting the appropriate  charges from both phases, must be calculated for the transaction in  accordance with Sec. 1026.22(a)(1) and appendix D to part 1026. This  annual percentage rate must be compared to the average prime offer rate  for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to  determine the transaction is a higher-priced mortgage loan under Sec.  1026.35(a). If the transaction is determined to be a higher-priced  mortgage loan, only the permanent phase is subject to the requirement of  Sec. 1026.35(b)(1) to establish and maintain an escrow account, and the  period for which the escrow account must remain in place under Sec.  1026.35(b)(3) is measured from the time the conversion to the permanent  phase financing occurs.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 35(b)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Limited exemption. A creditor is required to escrow for payment  of property taxes for all first-lien higher-priced mortgage loans  secured by condominium, planned unit development, or similar dwellings  or units regardless of whether the creditor escrows for insurance  premiums for such dwellings or units.</p><p class="depth0">2. Planned unit developments. Planned unit developments (PUDs) are a  form of property ownership often used in retirement communities, golf  communities, and similar communities made up of homes located within a  defined geographical area. PUDs usually have a homeowners' association  or some other governing association, analogous to a condominium  association and with similar authority and obligations. Thus, as with  condominiums, PUDs often have master insurance policies that cover all  units in the PUD. Under Sec. 1026.35(b)(2)(ii), if a PUD's governing  association is obligated to maintain such a master insurance policy, an  escrow account required by Sec. 1026.35(b)(1) for a transaction secured  by a unit in the PUD need not include escrows for insurance. This  exemption applies not only to condominiums and PUDs but also to any  other type of property ownership arrangement that has a governing  association with an obligation to maintain a master insurance policy.</p><p class="depth0">3. More than one governing association associated with a dwelling.  The limited exemption provided pursuant to Sec. 1026.35(b)(2)(ii)  applies to each master insurance policy for properties with multiple  governing associations, to the extent each governing association has   an obligation to maintain a master insurance policy.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 35(b)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirements for exemption. Under Sec. 1026.35(b)(2)(iii),  except as provided in Sec. 1026.35(b)(2)(v), a creditor need not  establish an escrow account for taxes and insurance for a higher-priced  mortgage loan, provided the following four conditions are satisfied when  the higher-priced mortgage loan is consummated:</p><p class="depth0">i. During any of the three preceding calendar years, more than 50  percent of the creditor's total first-lien covered transactions, as  defined in Sec. 1026.43(b)(1), are secured by properties located in  counties that are either ``rural'' or ``underserved,'' as set forth in  Sec. 1026.35(b)(2)(iv). Pursuant to that section, a creditor may rely  as a safe harbor on a list of counties published by the Bureau to  determine whether counties in the United States are rural or underserved  for a particular calendar year. Thus, for example, if a creditor  originated 90 covered transactions, as defined by Sec. 1026.43(b)(1),  secured by a first lien, during 2011, 2012, or 2013, the creditor meets  this condition for an exemption in 2014 if at least 46 of those  transactions in one of those three calendar years are secured by first  liens on properties that are located in such counties.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The creditor and its affiliates together originated 500 or fewer  first-lien covered transactions, as defined in Sec. 1026.43(b)(1),  during the preceding calendar year.</p><p class="depth0">iii. As of the end of the preceding calendar year, the creditor had  total assets that are less than the asset threshold for the relevant  calendar year. For calendar year 2015, the asset threshold is  $2,060,000,000. Creditors that had total assets of less than  $2,060,000,000 on December 31, 2014, satisfy this criterion for purposes  of the exemption during 2015. This asset threshold shall adjust  automatically each year based on the year-to-year change in the average  of the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers,  not seasonally adjusted, for each 12-month period ending in November,  with rounding to the nearest million dollars. The Bureau will publish  notice of the asset threshold each year by amending this comment. For  historical purposes, the prior asset thresholds were:</p><p class="depth0">A. For calendar year 2013, the asset threshold was $2,000,000,000.  Creditors that had total assets of less than $2,000,000,000 on December  31, 2012, satisfied this criterion for purposes of the exemption during  2013.</p><p class="depth0">B. For calendar year 2014, the asset threshold was $2,028,000,000.  Creditors that had total assets of less than $2,028,000,000 on December  31, 2013, satisfied this criterion for purposes of the exemption during  2014.</p><p class="depth0">iv. The creditor and its affiliates do not maintain an escrow  account for any mortgage transaction being serviced by the creditor or  its affiliate at the time the transaction is consummated, except as  provided in Sec. 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(1) and (2). Thus, the exemption  applies, provided the other conditions of Sec. 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) are  satisfied, even if the creditor previously maintained escrow accounts  for mortgage loans, provided it no longer maintains any such accounts  except as provided in Sec. 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(1) and (2). Once a  creditor or its affiliate begins escrowing for loans currently serviced  other than those addressed in Sec. 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(1) and (2),  however, the creditor and its affiliate become ineligible for the  exemption in Sec. 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) on higher-priced mortgage loans  they make while such escrowing continues. Thus, as long as a creditor  (or its affiliate) services and maintains escrow accounts for any  mortgage loans, other than as provided in Sec. 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(1)  and (2), the creditor will not be eligible for the exemption for any  higher-priced mortgage loan it may make. For purposes of Sec.  1026.35(b)(2)(iii), a creditor or its affiliate ``maintains'' an escrow  account only if it services a mortgage loan for which an escrow account  has been established at least through the due date of the second  periodic payment under the terms of the legal obligation.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Exception for certain accounts. Escrow accounts established for  first-lien higher-priced mortgage loans on or after April 1, 2010, and  before June 1, 2013, are not counted for purposes of Sec.  1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D). On and after June 1, 2013, creditors, together  with their affiliates, that establish new escrow accounts, other than  those described in Sec. 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(2), do not qualify for  the exemption provided under Sec. 1026.35(b)(2)(iii). Creditors,  together with their affiliates, that continue to maintain escrow  accounts established between April 1, 2010, and June 1, 2013, still  qualify for the exemption provided under Sec. 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) so  long as they do not establish new escrow accounts for transactions  consummated on or after June 1, 2013, other than those described in  Sec. 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(2), and they otherwise qualify under Sec.  1026.35(b)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1.

A creditor, together with its affiliates,  that establishes escrow accounts after consummation as a regular  business practice, regardless of whether consumers are in distress, does  not qualify for   the exception described in Sec. 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 35(b)(2)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirements for ``rural'' or ``underserved'' status. A county is  considered to be ``rural'' or ``underserved'' for purposes of Sec.  1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A) if it satisfies either of the two tests in Sec.  1026.35(b)(2)(iv). The Bureau applies both tests to each county in the  United States. If a county satisfies either test, the Bureau will  include the county on a published list of ``rural'' or ``underserved''  counties for a particular calendar year. To facilitate compliance with  appraisal requirements in Sec. 1026.35(c), the Bureau will also create  a list of only those counties that are ``rural'' but excluding those  that are only ``underserved.'' The Bureau will post on its public Web  site the applicable lists for each calendar year by the end of that  year, thus permitting creditors to ascertain the availability to them of  the exemption during the following year. For 2012, however, the list  will be published before June 1, 2013. A creditor may rely as a safe  harbor, pursuant to section 130(f) of the Truth in Lending Act, on the  lists of counties published by the Bureau to determine whether a county  qualifies as ``rural'' or ``underserved'' for a particular calendar  year. A creditor's originations of covered transactions, as defined by  Sec. 1026.43(b)(1), secured by a first lien, in such counties during  that year are considered in determining whether the creditor satisfies  the condition in Sec. 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A) and therefore will be  eligible for the exemption during the following calendar year.</p><p class="depth0">i. Under Sec. 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A), a county is rural during a  calendar year if it is neither in a metropolitan statistical area nor in  a micropolitan statistical area that is adjacent to a metropolitan  statistical area. These areas are defined by the Office of Management  and Budget and applied under currently applicable Urban Influence Codes  (UICs), established by the United States Department of Agriculture's  Economic Research Service (USDA-ERS). Accordingly, for purposes of Sec.  1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A), ``adjacent'' has the meaning applied by the USDA- ERS in determining a county's UIC; as so applied, ``adjacent'' entails a  county not only being physically contiguous with a metropolitan  statistical area but also meeting certain minimum population commuting  patterns. Specifically, a county is ``rural'' if the USDA-ERS  categorizes the county under UIC 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12.  Descriptions of UICs are available on the USDA-ERS Web site at http:// www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/urban-influence-codes/documentation.aspx.  A county for which there is no currently applicable UIC (because the  county has been created since the USDA-ERS last categorized counties) is  rural only if all counties from which the new county's land was taken  are themselves rural under currently applicable UICs.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Under Sec. 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(B), a county is underserved during  a calendar year if, according to Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA)  data for the preceding calendar year, no more than two creditors  extended covered transactions, as defined in Sec. 1026.43(b)(1),  secured by a first lien, five or more times in the county. Specifically,  a county is ``underserved'' if, in the applicable calendar year's public  HMDA aggregate dataset, no more than two creditors have reported five or  more first-lien covered transactions with HMDA geocoding that places the  properties in that county. For purposes of this determination, because  only covered transactions are counted, all first-lien originations (and  only first-lien originations) reported in the HMDA data are counted  except those for which the owner-occupancy status is reported as ``Not  owner-occupied'' (HMDA code 2), the property type is reported as  ``Multifamily'' (HMDA code 3), the applicant's or co-applicant's race is  reported as ``Not applicable'' (HMDA code 7), or the applicant's or co- applicant's sex is reported as ``Not applicable'' (HMDA code 4). The  most recent HMDA data are available at http://www.ffiec.gov/hmda.</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples. i. A county is considered ``rural'' for a given  calendar year based on the most recent available UIC designations, which  are updated by the USDA-ERS once every ten years. As an example, assume  a creditor makes first-lien covered transactions in County X during  calendar year 2014, and the most recent UIC designations have been  published in the second quarter of 2013. To determine ``rural'' status  for County X during calendar year 2014, the creditor will use the 2013  UIC designations. However, to determine ``rural'' status for County X  during 2012 or 2013, the creditor would use the UIC designations last  published in 2003.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A county is considered ``underserved'' for a given calendar year  based on the most recent available HMDA data. For example, assume a  creditor makes first-lien covered transactions in County Y during  calendar year 2013, and the most recent HMDA data is for calendar year  2012, published in the third quarter of 2013. To determine  ``underserved'' status for County Y in calendar year 2013 for the  purposes of qualifying for the ``rural or underserved'' exemption in  calendar year 2014, the creditor will use the 2012 HMDA data.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 35(b)(2)(v).</p><p class="depth0">1. Forward commitments. A creditor may make a mortgage loan that  will be transferred or sold to a purchaser pursuant to an agreement that  has been entered into at or before the time the loan is consummated.  Such an agreement is sometimes known as a ``forward commitment.'' Even  if a creditor is otherwise eligible for the exemption in   Sec. 1026.35(b)(2)(iii), a first-lien higher-priced mortgage loan that  will be acquired by a purchaser pursuant to a forward commitment is  subject to the requirement to establish an escrow account under Sec.  1026.35(b)(1) unless the purchaser is also eligible for the exemption in  Sec. 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) or the transaction is otherwise exempt under  Sec. 1026.35(b)(2). The escrow requirement applies to any such  transaction, whether the forward commitment provides for the purchase  and sale of the specific transaction or for the purchase and sale of  mortgage obligations with certain prescribed criteria that the  transaction meets. For example, assume a creditor that qualifies for the  exemption in Sec. 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) makes a higher-priced mortgage  loan that meets the purchase criteria of an investor with which the  creditor has an agreement to sell such mortgage obligations after  consummation. If the investor is ineligible for the exemption in Sec.  1026.35(b)(2)(iii), an escrow account must be established for the  transaction before consummation in accordance with Sec. 1026.35(b)(1)  unless the transaction is otherwise exempt (such as a reverse mortgage  or home equity line of credit).</p><p class="depth0">35(b)(3) Cancellation.</p><p class="depth0">1. Termination of underlying debt obligation. Section  1026.35(b)(3)(i) provides that, in general, an escrow account required  by Sec. 1026.35(b)(1) may not be cancelled until the underlying debt  obligation is terminated or the consumer requests cancellation at least  five years after consummation. Methods by which an underlying debt  obligation may be terminated include, among other things, repayment,  refinancing, rescission, and foreclosure.</p><p class="depth0">2. Minimum durations. Section 1026.35(b)(3) establishes minimum  durations for which escrow accounts established pursuant to Sec.  1026.35(b)(1) must be maintained. This requirement does not affect a  creditor's right or obligation, pursuant to the terms of the legal  obligation or applicable law, to offer or require an escrow account  thereafter.</p><p class="depth0">3. Less than eighty percent unpaid principal balance. The term  ``original value'' in Sec. 1026.35(b)(3)(ii)(A) means the lesser of the  sales price reflected in the sales contract for the property, if any, or  the appraised value of the property at the time the transaction was  consummated. In determining whether the unpaid principal balance has  reached less than 80 percent of the original value of the property  securing the underlying debt, the creditor or servicer shall count any  subordinate lien of which it has reason to know. If the consumer  certifies in writing that the equity in the property securing the  underlying debt obligation is unencumbered by a subordinate lien, the  creditor or servicer may rely upon the certification in making its  determination unless it has actual knowledge to the contrary.</p><p class="depth0">35(c)--Appraisals</p><p class="depth0">35(c)(1) Definitions</p><p class="depth0">35(c)(1)(i) Certified or Licensed Appraiser</p><p class="depth0">1.

Paragraph (3) of FIRREA section 1110 (12  U.S.C. 3339(3)), which relates to the review of appraisals, is not  relevant for determining whether an appraiser is a certified or licensed  appraiser under Sec. 1026.35(c)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">35(c)(2) Exemptions</p><p class="depth0">1.

Section 1026.35(c)(2)  provides exemptions solely from the requirements of section  1026.35(c)(3) through (6). Institutions subject to the requirements of  FIRREA and its implementing regulations that make a loan qualifying for  an exemption under section 1026.35(c)(2) must still comply with  appraisal and evaluation requirements under FIRREA and its implementing  regulations.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 35(c)(2)(i)</p><p class="depth0">1. Qualified mortgage criteria. Under Sec. 1026.35(c)(2)(i), a loan  is exempt from the appraisal requirements of Sec. 1026.35(c) if either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1))</em> and (2) a qualified mortgage pursuant to the  Bureau's rules or, for loans insured, guaranteed, or administered by the  U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), U.S. Department  of Veterans Affairs (VA), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), or  Rural Housing Service (RHS), a qualified mortgage pursuant to applicable  rules prescribed by those agencies   (but only once such rules are in effect; otherwise, the Bureau's  definition of a qualified mortgage applies to those loans); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>.  Nonetheless, the transaction is eligible for an exemption from the  appraisal requirements of Sec. 1026.35(c) if it meets the qualified  mortgage criteria in HUD's rules.

Threshold amount. For purposes of Sec. 1026.35(c)(2)(ii), the  threshold amount in effect during a particular one-year period is the  amount stated below for that period. The threshold amount is adjusted  effective January 1 of every year by the percentage increase in the  Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W)  that was in effect on the preceding June 1. Every year, this comment  will be amended to provide the threshold amount for the upcoming one- year period after the annual percentage change in the CPI-W that was in  effect on June 1 becomes available. Any increase in the threshold amount  will be rounded to the nearest $100 increment. For example, if the  percentage increase in the CPI-W would result in a $950 increase in the  threshold amount, the threshold amount will be increased by $1,000.  However, if the percentage increase in the CPI-W would result in a $949  increase in the threshold amount, the threshold amount will be increased  by $900.</p><p class="depth0">i. From January 18, 2014, through December 31, 2014, the threshold  amount is $25,000.</p><p class="depth0">ii.

Qualifying for exemption--subsequent changes. A transaction does  not meet the condition for an exemption under Sec. 1026.35(c)(2)(ii)  merely because it is used to satisfy and replace an existing exempt  loan, unless the amount of the new extension of credit is equal to or  less than the applicable threshold amount. For example, assume a closed- end loan that qualified for a Sec. 1026.35(c)(2)(ii) exemption at  consummation in year one is refinanced in year ten and that the new loan  amount is greater than the threshold amount in effect in year ten. In  these circumstances, the creditor must comply with all of the applicable  requirements of Sec. 1026.35(c) with respect to the year ten  transaction if the original loan is satisfied and replaced by the new  loan, unless another exemption from the requirements of Sec. 1026.35(c)  applies.

For purposes of the exemption in Sec.  1026.35(c)(2)(iii), a mobile home does not include a manufactured home,  as defined in Sec. 1026.35(c)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 35(c)(2)(iv)</p><p class="depth0">1. Construction-to-permanent loans. Section 1026.35(c) does not  apply to a transaction to finance the initial construction of a  dwelling. This exclusion applies to a construction-only loan as well as  to the construction phase of a construction-to-permanent loan.   Section 1026.35(c) does apply, however, to permanent financing that  replaces a construction loan, whether the permanent financing is  extended by the same or a different creditor, unless the permanent  financing is otherwise exempt from the requirements of Sec. 1026.35(c).  See Sec. 1026.35(c)(2). When a construction loan may be permanently  financed by the same creditor, the general disclosure requirements for  closed-end credit (Sec. 1026.17) provide that the creditor may give  either one combined disclosure for both the construction financing and  the permanent financing, or a separate set of disclosures for each of  the two phases as though they were two separate transactions. See Sec.  1026.17(c)(6)(ii) and comment 17(c)(6)-2. Section 1026.17(c)(6)(ii)  addresses only how a creditor may elect to disclose a construction-to- permanent transaction. Which disclosure option a creditor elects under  Sec. 1026.17(c)(6)(ii) does not affect the determination of whether the  permanent phase of the transaction is subject to Sec. 1026.35(c). When  the creditor discloses the two phases as separate transactions, the  annual percentage rate for the permanent phase must be compared to the  average prime offer rate for a transaction that is comparable to the  permanent financing to determine coverage under Sec. 1026.35(c). When  the creditor discloses the two phases as a single transaction, a single  annual percentage rate, reflecting the appropriate charges from both  phases, must be calculated for the transaction in accordance with Sec.  1026.35 and appendix D to part 1026. The annual percentage rate must be  compared to the average prime offer rate for a transaction that is  comparable to the permanent financing to determine coverage under Sec.  1026.35(c). If the transaction is determined to be a higher-priced  mortgage loan not otherwise exempt under Sec. 1026.35(c)(2), only the  permanent phase is subject to the requirements of Sec. 1026.35(c).</p><p class="depth0">2. Financing initial construction. The exemption for construction  loans in Sec. 1026.35(c)(2)(iv) applies to temporary financing of the  construction of a dwelling that will be replaced by permanent financing  once construction is complete. The exemption does not apply, for  example, to loans to finance the purchase of manufactured homes that  have not been or are in the process of being built when the financing  obtained by the consumer at that time is permanent. See Sec.  1026.35(c)(2)(viii).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 35(c)(2)(vii)(A)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Same credit risk holder. The requirement that the holder of the  credit risk on the existing obligation and the refinancing be the same  applies to situations in which an entity bears the financial  responsibility for the default of a loan by either holding the loan in  its portfolio or guaranteeing payments of principal and any interest to  investors in a mortgage-backed security in which the loan is pooled. See  Sec. 1026.35(c)(1)(ii) (defining ``credit risk''). For example, a  credit risk holder could be a bank that bears the credit risk on the  existing obligation by holding the loan in the bank's portfolio. Another  example of a credit risk holder would be a government-sponsored  enterprise that bears the risk of default on a loan by guaranteeing the  payment of principal and any interest on a loan to investors in a  mortgage-backed security. The holder of credit risk under Sec.  1026.35(c)(2)(vii)(A)(1) does not mean individual investors in a  mortgage-backed security or providers of private mortgage insurance.</p><p class="depth0">2. Same credit risk holder--illustrations.</p><p class="depth0">Illustrations of the credit risk holder of the existing obligation  continuing to be the credit risk holder of the refinancing include, but  are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth0">i. The existing obligation is held in the portfolio of a bank, thus  the bank holds the credit risk. The bank arranges to refinance the loan  and also will hold the refinancing in its portfolio. If the refinancing  otherwise meets the requirements for an exemption under Sec.  1026.35(c)(2)(vii), the transaction will qualify for the exemption  because the credit risk holder is the same for the existing obligation  and the refinance transaction. In this case, the exemption would apply  regardless of whether the bank arranged to refinance the loan directly  or indirectly, such as through the servicer or subservicer on the  existing obligation.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The existing obligation is held in the portfolio of a  government-sponsored enterprise (GSE), thus the GSE holds the credit  risk. The existing obligation is then refinanced by the servicer of the  loan and immediately transferred to the GSE. The GSE pools the  refinancing in a mortgage-backed security guaranteed by the GSE, thus  the GSE holds the credit risk on the refinance loan. If the refinance  transaction otherwise meets the requirements for an exemption under  Sec. 1026.35(c)(2)(vii), the transaction will qualify for the exemption  because the credit risk holder is the same for the existing obligation  and the refinance transaction. In this case, the exemption would apply  regardless of whether the existing obligation was refinanced by the  servicer or subservicer on the existing obligation (acting as a  ``creditor'' under Sec. 1026.2(a)(17)) or by a different creditor.</p><p class="depth0">3. Forward commitments. A creditor may make a mortgage loan that  will be sold or otherwise transferred pursuant to an agreement that has  been entered into at or before the time the transaction is consummated.  Such an agreement is sometimes known as a ``forward commitment.'' A  refinance loan does not satisfy the requirement of   Sec. 1026.35(c)(2)(vii)(A)(1) if the loan will be acquired pursuant to  a forward commitment, such that the credit risk on the refinance loan  will transfer to a person who did not hold the credit risk on the  existing obligation.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 35(c)(2)(vii)(B)</p><p class="depth0">1. Regular periodic payments. Under Sec. 1026.35(c)(2)(vii)(B), the  regular periodic payments on the refinance loan must not: result in an  increase of the principal balance (negative amortization); allow the  consumer to defer repayment of principal (see comment 43(e)(2)(i)-2); or  result in a balloon payment. Thus, the terms of the legal obligation  must require the consumer to make payments of principal and interest on  a monthly or other periodic basis that will repay the loan amount over  the loan term. Except for payments resulting from any interest rate  changes after consummation in an adjustable-rate or step-rate mortgage,  the periodic payments must be substantially equal. For an explanation of  the term ``substantially equal,'' see comment 43(c)(5)(i)-4. In  addition, a single-payment transaction is not a refinancing meeting the  requirements of Sec. 1026.35(c)(2)(vii) because it does not require  ``regular periodic payments.''</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 35(c)(2)(vii)(C)</p><p class="depth0">1. Permissible use of proceeds. The exemption for a refinancing  under Sec. 1026.35(c)(2)(vii) is available only if the proceeds from  the refinancing are used exclusively for the existing obligation and  amounts attributed solely to the costs of the refinancing. The existing  obligation includes the unpaid principal balance of the existing first  lien loan, any earned unpaid finance charges, and any other lawful  charges related to the existing loan. For guidance on the meaning of  refinancing costs, see comment 23(f)-4. If the proceeds of a refinancing  are used for other purposes, such as to pay off other liens or to  provide additional cash to the consumer for discretionary spending, the  transaction does not qualify for the exemption for a refinancing under  Sec. 1026.35(c)(2)(vii) from the appraisal requirements in Sec.  1026.35(c).</p><p class="depth0">35(c)(3) Appraisals Required</p><p class="depth0">35(c)(3)(i) In General</p><p class="depth0">1.

For example, assume that the creditor determines that  date of the consumer's acquisition agreement is October 15, 2012, and  that the seller acquired the property on April 17, 2012. The first day  to be counted in the 180-day calculation would be April 18, 2012, and  the last day would be October 15, 2012. In this case, the number of days  from April 17 would be 181, so an additional appraisal is not required.</p><p class="depth0">3. Date seller acquired the property. For purposes of Sec.  1026.35(c)(4)(i)(A) and (B), the date on which the seller acquired the  property is the date on which the seller became the legal owner of the  property pursuant to applicable State law.</p><p class="depth0">4. Date of the consumer's agreement to acquire the property. For the  date of the consumer's agreement to acquire the property under Sec.  1026.35(c)(4)(i)(A) and (B), the creditor should use the date on which  the consumer and the seller signed the agreement provided to the  creditor by the consumer. The date on which the consumer and the seller  signed the agreement might not be the date on which   the consumer became contractually obligated under State law to acquire  the property. For purposes of Sec. 1026.35(c)(4)(i)(A) and (B), a  creditor is not obligated to determine whether and to what extent the  agreement is legally binding on both parties.

The price the consumer is obligated to pay to acquire the property is  the price indicated on the consumer's agreement with the seller to  acquire the property. The price the consumer is obligated to pay to  acquire the property from the seller does not include the cost of  financing the property. For purposes of Sec. 1026.35(c)(4)(i)(A) and  (B), a creditor is not obligated to determine whether and to what extent  the agreement is legally binding on both parties.

The requirements that a creditor obtain  two separate appraisals under Sec. 1026.35(c)(4)(i), and that each  appraisal be conducted by a different licensed or certified appraiser  under Sec. 1026.35(c)(4)(ii), indicate that the two appraisals must be  conducted independently of each other. If the two certified or licensed  appraisers are affiliated, such as by being employed by the same  appraisal firm, then whether they have conducted the appraisal  independently of each other must be determined based on the facts and  circumstances of the particular case known to the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">35(c)(4)(iii) Relationship to General Appraisal Requirements</p><p class="depth0">1.

The creditor complies with the  requirements of Sec. 1026.35(c)(3)(i) for the additional appraisal if  the creditor meets the safe harbor conditions in Sec. 1026.35(c)(3)(ii)  for that appraisal.</p><p class="depth0">35(c)(4)(iv) Required Analysis in the Additional Appraisal</p><p class="depth0">1.

Estimated sales price. If a written source document describes the  seller's acquisition price in a manner that indicates that the price  described is an estimated or assumed amount and not the actual price,  the creditor should look at an alternative document to satisfy the  reasonable diligence standard in determining the price at which the  seller acquired the property.</p><p class="depth0">2. Reasonable diligence--oral statements insufficient. Reliance on  oral statements of interested parties, such as the consumer, seller, or  mortgage broker, does not constitute reasonable diligence under Sec.  1026.35(c)(4)(vi)(A).</p><p class="depth0">3. Lack of information and conflicting information--two appraisals  required. If a creditor is unable to demonstrate that the requirement to  obtain two appraisals under Sec. 1026.35(c)(4)(i) does not apply, the  creditor must obtain two written appraisals before extending a higher- priced mortgage loan subject to the requirements of Sec. 1026.35(c).  See also comment 35(c)(4)(vi)(B)-1. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume a creditor orders and reviews the results of a title  search, which shows that a prior sale occurred between 91 and 180 days  ago, but not the price paid in that sale. Thus, based on the title  search, the creditor would not be able to determine whether the price  the consumer is obligated to pay under the consumer's acquisition  agreement is more than 20 percent higher than the seller's acquisition  price, pursuant to Sec. 1026.35(c)(4)(i)(B). Before extending a higher- priced mortgage loan subject to the appraisal requirements of Sec.  1026.35(c), the creditor must either: (1) Perform additional diligence  to ascertain the seller's acquisition   price and, based on this information, determine whether two written  appraisals are required; or (2) obtain two written appraisals in  compliance with Sec. 1026.35(c)(4). See also comment 35(c)(4)(vi)(B)-1.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume a creditor reviews the results of a title search  indicating that the last recorded purchase was more than 180 days before  the consumer's agreement to acquire the property. Assume also that the  creditor subsequently receives a written appraisal indicating that the  seller acquired the property between 91 and 180 days before the  consumer's agreement to acquire the property. In this case, unless one  of these sources is clearly wrong on its face, the creditor would not be  able to determine whether the seller acquired the property within 180  days of the date of the consumer's agreement to acquire the property  from the seller, pursuant to Sec. 1026.35(c)(4)(i)(B). Before extending  a higher-priced mortgage loan subject to the appraisal requirements of  Sec. 1026.35(c), the creditor must either: perform additional diligence  to ascertain the seller's acquisition date and, based on this  information, determine whether two written appraisals are required; or  obtain two written appraisals in compliance with Sec. 1026.35(c)(4).

Required analysis. In general, the additional appraisal required  under Sec. 1026.35(c)(4)(i) should include an analysis of the factors  listed in Sec. 1026.35(c)(4)(iv)(A) through (C). However, if, following  reasonable diligence, a creditor cannot determine whether the conditions  in Sec. 1026.35(c)(4)(i)(A) or (B) are present due to a lack of  information or conflicting information, the required additional  appraisal must include the analyses required under Sec.  1026.35(c)(4)(iv)(A) through (C) only to the extent that the information  necessary to perform the analyses is known. For example, assume that a  creditor is able, following reasonable diligence, to determine that the  date on which the seller acquired the property occurred between 91 and  180 days prior to the date of the consumer's agreement to acquire the  property. However, the creditor is unable, following reasonable  diligence, to determine the price at which the seller acquired the  property. In this case, the creditor is required to obtain an additional  written appraisal that includes an analysis under Sec.  1026.35(c)(4)(iv)(B) and (c)(4)(iv)(C) of the changes in market  conditions and any improvements made to the property between the date  the seller acquired the property and the date of the consumer's  agreement to acquire the property. However, the creditor is not required  to obtain an additional written appraisal that includes analysis under  Sec. 1026.35(c)(4)(iv)(A) of the difference between the price at which  the seller acquired the property and the price that the consumer is  obligated to pay to acquire the property.</p><p class="depth0">35(c)(4)(vii) Exemptions From the Additional Appraisal Requirement</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 35(c)(4)(vii)(C)</p><p class="depth0">1.

A property securing an HPML subject to Sec. 1026.35(c)  is in a rural county under Sec. 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(H) if the county in  which the property is located is on the table of rural counties most  recently published by the Bureau. For example, for a transaction  occurring in 2015, assume that the Bureau most recently published a  table of rural counties at the end of 2014. The property securing the  transaction would be located in a rural county for purposes of Sec.  1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(H) if the county is on the table of rural counties  published by the Bureau at the end of 2014.</p><p class="depth0">35(c)(5) Required Disclosure</p><p class="depth0">35(c)(5)(i) In General</p><p class="depth0">1.

For purposes of the requirement to provide a copy of  the appraisal within a specified time under Sec. 1026.35(c)(6)(ii),  ``provide'' means ``deliver.'' Delivery occurs three business days after  mailing or delivering the copies to the last-known address of the  applicant, or when evidence indicates actual receipt by the applicant  (which, in the case of electronic receipt, must be based upon consent  that complies with the E-Sign Act), whichever is earlier.</p><p class="depth0">2. No waiver. Regulation B, 12 CFR 1002.14(a)(1), allowing the  consumer to waive the requirement that the appraisal copy be provided  three business days before consummation, does not apply to higher-priced  mortgage loans subject to Sec. 1026.35(c). A consumer of a higher- priced mortgage loan subject to Sec. 1026.35(c) may not waive the  timing requirement to receive a copy of the appraisal under Sec.  1026.35(c)(6)(i).</p><p class="depth0">35(c)(6)(iv) No Charge for Copy Of Appraisal</p><p class="depth0">1.

Section  1026.35(e)(2)(ii)(C) lists as a condition that the amount of the  periodic payment of principal or interest or both may not change during  the four-year period following consummation. For examples showing  whether a prepayment penalty is permitted or prohibited in connection  with particular payment changes, see comment 32(d)(7)(iv)-1. Those  examples, however, include a condition that Sec. 1026.35(e)(2) does not  include: The condition that, at consummation, the consumer's total  monthly debt payments may not exceed 50 percent of the consumer's  monthly gross income.

Section 1026.32(d)(2) provides that a loan  described in Sec. 1026.32(a) may not have a payment schedule with  regular periodic payments that cause the principal balance to increase.  Therefore, the commentary to Sec. 1026.32(d)(7)(iv) does not include  examples of payment changes in connection with negative amortization.  The following examples show whether, under Sec. 1026.35(e)(2),  prepayment penalties are permitted or prohibited in connection with  particular payment changes, when a loan agreement permits negative  amortization:</p><p class="depth0">i.

A  prepayment penalty is permitted with this mortgage transaction provided  that the other Sec. 1026.35(e)(2) conditions are met, that is: Provided  that the prepayment penalty is permitted by other applicable law, the  penalty expires on or before December 31, 2011, and the penalty will not  apply if the source of the prepayment funds is a refinancing by the  creditor or its affiliate.</p><p class="depth0">ii.

Meaning of loan originator. i. General. A. Section 1026.36(a)  defines the set of activities or services any one of which, if done for  or in the expectation of compensation or gain, makes the person doing  such activities or performing such services a loan originator, unless  otherwise excluded. The scope of activities covered by the term loan  originator includes:</p><p class="depth0">1. Referring a consumer to any person who participates in the  origination process as a loan originator. Referring is an activity  included under each of the activities of offering, arranging, or  assisting a consumer in obtaining or applying to obtain an extension of  credit. Referring includes any oral or written action directed to a  consumer that can affirmatively influence the consumer to select a  particular loan originator or creditor to obtain an extension of credit  when the consumer will pay for such credit. See comment 36(a)-4 with  respect to certain activities that do not constitute referring.</p><p class="depth0">2. Arranging a credit transaction, including initially contacting  and orienting the consumer to a particular loan originator's or  creditor's origination process or particular credit terms that are or  may be available to that consumer selected based on the consumer's  financial characteristics, assisting the consumer to apply for credit,  taking an application, offering particular credit terms to the consumer  selected based on the consumer's financial characteristics, negotiating  credit terms, or otherwise obtaining or making an extension of credit.</p><p class="depth0">3. Assisting a consumer in obtaining or applying for consumer credit  by advising on particular credit terms that are or may be available to  that consumer based on the consumer's financial characteristics, filling  out an application form, preparing application packages (such as a  credit application or pre-approval application or supporting  documentation), or collecting application and supporting information on  behalf of the consumer to submit to a loan originator or creditor. A  person who, acting on behalf of a loan originator or creditor, collects  information or verifies information provided by the consumer, such as by  asking the consumer for documentation to support the information the  consumer provided or for the consumer's authorization to obtain  supporting documents from third parties, is not collecting information  on behalf of the consumer. See also comment 36(a)z4.i through iv with  respect to application-related administrative and clerical tasks and  comment 36(a)-1.v with respect to third-party advisors.</p><p class="depth0">4. Presenting particular credit terms for the consumer's  consideration that are selected based on the consumer's financial  characteristics, or communicating with a consumer for the purpose of  reaching a mutual understanding about prospective credit terms.</p><p class="depth0">5. Advertising or communicating to the public that one can or will  perform any loan origination services. Advertising the services of a  third party that engages or intends to engage in loan origination  activities does not make the advertiser a loan originator.</p><p class="depth0">B. The term ``loan originator'' includes employees, agents, and  contractors of a creditor as well as employees, agents, and contractors  of a mortgage broker that satisfy this definition.</p><p class="depth0">C. The term ``loan originator'' includes any creditor that satisfies  the definition of loan originator but makes use of ``table funding'' by  a third party. See comment 36(a)-1.ii discussing table funding. Solely  for purposes of Sec. 1026.36(f) and (g) concerning loan originator  qualifications, the term loan originator includes any creditor that  satisfies the definition of loan originator, even if the creditor does  not make use of table funding. Such a person is a creditor, not a loan  originator, for general purposes of this part, including the provisions  of Sec. 1026.36 other than Sec. 1026.36(f) and (g).</p><p class="depth0">D. A ``loan originator organization'' is a loan originator other  than a natural person. The term includes any legal person or  organization such as a sole proprietorship, trust, partnership, limited  liability partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company,  corporation, bank, thrift, finance company, or credit union. An  ``individual loan originator'' is limited to a natural person. (Under  Sec. 1026.2(a)(22), the term ``person'' means a natural person or an  organization.)</p><p class="depth0">E. The term ``loan originator'' does not include consumers who  obtain extensions of consumer credit on their own behalf.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Table funding. Table funding occurs when the creditor does not  provide the funds for the transaction at consummation out of the  creditor's own resources, including, for example, by drawing on a bona  fide warehouse line of credit or out of deposits held by the creditor.  Accordingly, a table-funded transaction is consummated with the debt  obligation initially payable by its terms to one person, but another  person provides the funds for the transaction at consummation and  receives an immediate assignment of the note, loan contract, or other  evidence of the debt obligation. Although Sec. 1026.2(a)(17)(i)(B)  provides that a person to whom a debt obligation is initially payable on  its face generally is a creditor, Sec. 1026.36(a)(1) provides that,  solely for the purposes of Sec. 1026.36, such a person is also  considered a loan originator. For example, if a person closes a  transaction in its own name but does not fund the transaction from its  own resources and assigns the transaction after consummation to the  person providing the funds, it is considered a creditor for purposes of  Regulation Z and also a loan originator for purposes of Sec. 1026.36.  However, if a person closes in its own name and finances a consumer  credit transaction from the person's own resources, including drawing on  a bona fide warehouse line of credit or out of deposits held by the  person, and does not assign the loan at closing, the person is a  creditor not making use of table funding but is included in the  definition of loan originator for the purposes of Sec. 1026.36(f) and  (g) concerning loan originator qualifications.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Servicing. A loan servicer or a loan servicer's employees,  agents, or contractors that otherwise meet the definition of ``loan  originator'' are excluded from the definition when modifying or offering  to modify an existing loan on behalf of the current owner or holder of  the loan (including an assignee or the servicer, if applicable). Other  than Sec. 1026.36(c), Sec. 1026.36 applies to extensions of consumer  credit. Thus, other than Sec. 1026.36(c), Sec. 1026.36 does not apply  if a person   renegotiates, modifies, replaces, or subordinates an existing obligation  or its terms, unless the transaction constitutes a refinancing under  Sec. 1026.20(a) or obligates a different consumer on the existing debt.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Real estate brokerage. The definition of ``loan originator''  does not include a person that performs only real estate brokerage  activities (e.g., does not perform mortgage broker or consumer credit  referral activities or extend consumer credit) if the person is licensed  or registered under applicable State law governing real estate  brokerage, unless such person is paid by a loan originator or a creditor  for a particular consumer credit transaction subject to Sec. 1026.36.  Such a person is not paid by a loan originator or a creditor if the  person is paid by a loan originator or creditor on behalf of a buyer or  seller solely for performing real estate brokerage activities. Such a  person is not paid for a particular consumer credit transaction subject  to Sec. 1026.36 if the person is paid compensation by a loan originator  or creditor, or affiliate of the loan originator or creditor, solely for  performing real estate brokerage activities in connection with a  property owned by that loan originator or creditor.</p><p class="depth0">v. Third-party advisors. The definition of ``loan originator'' does  not include bona fide third-party advisors such as accountants,  attorneys, registered financial advisors, housing counselors, or others  who do not receive compensation for engaging in loan origination  activities. Advisory activity not constituting loan originator activity  would include, for example, licensed accountants advising clients on tax  implications of credit terms, registered financial advisors advising  clients on potential effects of credit terms on client finances, HUD- approved housing counselors assisting consumers with understanding the  credit origination process and various credit terms or collecting and  organizing documents to support a credit application, or a licensed  attorney assisting clients with consummating a real property transaction  or with divorce, trust, or estate planning matters. Such a person,  however, who advises a consumer on credit terms offered by either the  person or the person's employer, or who receives compensation or other  monetary gain, directly or indirectly, from the loan originator or  creditor on whose credit offer the person advises a consumer, generally  would be a loan originator. A referral by such a person does not make  the person a loan originator, however, where the person neither receives  nor expects any compensation from a loan originator or creditor for  referring the consumer. HUD-approved housing counselors who simply  assist a consumer in obtaining or applying to obtain consumer credit  from a loan originator or creditor are not loan originators if the  compensation is not contingent on referrals or on engaging in additional  loan origination activities and either of two alternative conditions is  satisfied: The first alternative condition is that the compensation is  expressly permitted by applicable local, State, or Federal law that  requires counseling and the counseling performed complies with such law  (for example, Sec. 1026.34(a)(5) and Sec. 1026.36(k)). The second  alternative condition is that the compensation is a fixed sum received  from a creditor, loan originator, or the affiliate of a loan originator  or a creditor as a result of agreements between creditors or loan  originators and local, State, or Federal agencies. However, HUD-approved  housing counselors are loan originators if, for example, they receive  compensation that is contingent on referrals or on engaging in loan  originator activity other than assisting a consumer in obtaining or  applying to obtain consumer credit from a loan originator or creditor.</p><p class="depth0">2. Meaning of mortgage broker. For purposes of Sec. 1026.36, with  respect to a particular transaction, the term ``mortgage broker'' refers  to a loan originator who is not an employee of the creditor.  Accordingly, the term ``mortgage broker'' includes companies that engage  in the activities described in Sec. 1026.36(a) and also includes  employees of such companies that engage in these activities. Section  1026.36(d) prohibits certain payments to a loan originator. These  prohibitions apply to payments made to all loan originators, including  payments made to mortgage brokers, and payments made by a company acting  as a mortgage broker to its employees who are loan originators.</p><p class="depth0">3. Meaning of creditor. For purposes of Sec. 1026.36(d) and (e), a  creditor means a creditor that is not deemed to be a loan originator on  the transaction under this section. Thus, a person that closes a loan in  its own name (but another person provides the funds for the transaction  at consummation and receives an immediate assignment of the note, loan  contract, or other evidence of the debt obligation) is deemed a loan  originator, not a creditor, for purposes of Sec. 1026.36. However, that  person is still a creditor for all other purposes of Regulation Z.</p><p class="depth0">4. Managers, administrative and clerical staff. For purposes of  Sec. 1026.36, managers, administrative and clerical staff, and similar  individuals who are employed by (or contractor or agent of) a creditor  or loan originator organization and take an application, offer, arrange,  assist a consumer in obtaining or applying to obtain, negotiate, or  otherwise obtain or make a particular extension of credit for another  person are loan originators. The following examples describe activities  that, in the absence of any other activities, do not render a manager,  administrative or clerical staff member, or similar employee a loan  originator:</p><p class="depth0">i. Application-related administrative and clerical tasks. The  definition of loan originator   does not include a loan originator's or creditor's employee who provides  a credit application form from the entity for which the person works to  the consumer for the consumer to complete or, without assisting the  consumer in completing the credit application, processing or analyzing  the information, or discussing particular credit terms that are or may  be available from a creditor or loan originator to that consumer  selected based on the consumer's financial characteristics, delivers the  credit application from a consumer to a loan originator or creditor. A  person does not assist the consumer in completing the application if the  person explains to the consumer filling out the application the contents  of the application or where particular consumer information is to be  provided, or generally describes the credit application process to a  consumer without discussing particular credit terms that are or may be  available from a creditor or loan originator to that consumer selected  based on the consumer's financial characteristics.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Responding to consumer inquiries and providing general  information. The definition of loan originator does not include persons  who:</p><p class="depth0">A. Provide general explanations, information, or descriptions in  response to consumer queries, such as explaining credit terminology or  lending policies or who confirm written offer terms already transmitted  to the consumer;</p><p class="depth0">B. As employees of a creditor or loan originator, provide loan  originator or creditor contact information of the loan originator or  creditor entity for which he or she works, or of a person who works for  that the same entity to a consumer, provided that the person does not  discuss particular credit terms that are or may be available from a  creditor or loan originator to that consumer selected based on the  consumer's financial characteristics and does not direct the consumer,  based on his or her assessment of the consumer's financial  characteristics, to a particular loan originator or particular creditor  seeking to originate credit transactions to consumers with those  financial characteristics;</p><p class="depth0">C. Describe other product-related services (for example, persons who  describe optional monthly payment methods via telephone or via automatic  account withdrawals, the availability and features of online account  access, the availability of 24-hour customer support, or free mobile  applications to access account information); or</p><p class="depth0">D. Explain or describe the steps that a consumer would need to take  to obtain an offer of credit, including providing general guidance on  qualifications or criteria that would need to be met that is not  specific to that consumer's circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Loan processing. The definition of loan originator does not  include persons who, acting on behalf of a loan originator or a  creditor:</p><p class="depth0">A. Compile and assemble credit application packages and supporting  documentation;</p><p class="depth0">B. Verify information provided by the consumer in a credit  application such as by asking the consumer for supporting documentation  or the consumer's authorization for the person to obtain supporting  documentation from other persons;</p><p class="depth0">C. Coordinate consummation of the credit transaction or other  aspects of the credit transaction process, including by communicating  with a consumer about process deadlines and documents needed at  consummation, provided that any communication that includes a discussion  about credit terms available from a creditor to that consumer selected  based on the consumer's financial characteristics only confirms credit  terms already agreed to by the consumer;</p><p class="depth0">D. Provide a consumer with information unrelated to credit terms,  such as the best days of the month for scheduling consummation; or</p><p class="depth0">E. Communicate on behalf of a loan originator that a written credit  offer has been sent to a consumer without providing any details of that  offer.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Underwriting, credit approval, and credit pricing. The  definition of loan originator does not include persons who:</p><p class="depth0">A. Receive and evaluate a consumer's information to make  underwriting decisions on whether a consumer qualifies for an extension  of credit and communicate decisions to a loan originator or creditor,  provided that only a loan originator communicates such underwriting  decisions to the consumer;</p><p class="depth0">B. Approve particular credit terms or set particular credit terms  available from a creditor to that consumer selected based on the  consumer's financial characteristics in offer or counter-offer  situations, provided that only a loan originator communicates to or with  the consumer regarding these credit terms, an offer, or provides or  engages in negotiation, a counter-offer, or approval conditions; or</p><p class="depth0">C. Establish credit pricing that the creditor offers generally to  the public, via advertisements or other marketing or via other persons  that are loan originators.</p><p class="depth0">v. Producing managers. Managers that work for creditors or loan  originator organizations sometimes engage themselves in loan origination  activities, as set forth in the definition of loan originator in Sec.  1026.36(a)(1)(i) (such managers are sometimes referred to as ``producing  managers''). The definition of loan originator includes persons,  including managers, who are employed by a creditor or loan originator  organization and take an application, offer, arrange, assist a consumer   with obtaining or applying to obtain, negotiate, or otherwise obtain or  make a particular extension of credit for another person, even if such  persons are also employed by the creditor or loan originator  organization to perform duties that are not loan origination activities.  Thus, such producing managers are loan originators.</p><p class="depth0">5. Compensation. i. General. For purposes of Sec. 1026.36,  compensation is defined in Sec. 1026.36(a)(3) as salaries, commissions,  and any financial or similar incentive. For example, the term  ``compensation'' includes:</p><p class="depth0">A. An annual or other periodic bonus; or</p><p class="depth0">B. Awards of merchandise, services, trips, or similar prizes.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Name of fee. Compensation includes amounts the loan originator  retains and is not dependent on the label or name of any fee imposed in  connection with the transaction. For example, if a loan originator  imposes a ``processing fee'' in connection with the transaction and  retains such fee, it is compensation for purposes of Sec. 1026.36,  including Sec. 1026.36(d) and (e), whether the originator expends the  time to process the consumer's application or uses the fee for other  expenses, such as overhead.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Amounts for third-party charges. Compensation does not include  amounts the loan originator receives as payment for bona fide and  reasonable charges, such as credit reports, where those amounts are  passed on to a third party that is not the creditor, its affiliate, or  the affiliate of the loan originator. See comment 36(a)-5.v.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Amounts for charges for services that are not loan origination  activities.</p><p class="depth0">1. A payment received by a loan originator organization for bona  fide and reasonable charges for services it performs that are not loan  origination activities;</p><p class="depth0">2. A payment received by an affiliate of a loan originator  organization for bona fide and reasonable charges for services it  performs that are not loan origination activities; or</p><p class="depth0">3. A payment received by a loan originator organization for bona  fide and reasonable charges for services that are not loan origination  activities where those amounts are not retained by the loan originator  but are paid to the creditor, its affiliate, or the affiliate of the  loan originator organization. See comment 36(a)-5.v.</p><p class="depth0">B. Compensation includes any salaries, commissions, and any  financial or similar incentive to an individual loan originator,  regardless of whether it is labeled as payment for services that are not  loan origination activities.</p><p class="depth0">C. Loan origination activities for purposes of this comment means  activities described in Sec. 1026.36(a)(1)(i) (e.g., taking an  application, offering, arranging, negotiating, or otherwise obtaining an  extension of consumer credit for another person) that would make a  person performing those activities for compensation a loan originator as  defined in Sec. 1026.36(a)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">v. Amounts that exceed the actual charge for a service. In some  cases, amounts received by the loan originator organization for payment  for third-party charges described in comment 36(a)-5.iii or payment for  services to the creditor, its affiliates, or the affiliates of the loan  originator organization described in comment 36(a)-5.iv.A.3 may exceed  the actual charge because, for example, the loan originator organization  cannot determine with accuracy what the actual charge will be when it is  imposed and instead uses average charge pricing (in accordance with the  Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act). In such a case, the difference  retained by the loan originator organization is not compensation if the  charge imposed on the consumer or collected from a person other than the  consumer was bona fide and reasonable and also complies with State and  other applicable law. On the other hand, if the loan originator  organization marks up the charge (a practice known as ``upcharging''),  and the originator retains the difference between the actual charge and  the marked-up charge, the amount retained is compensation for purposes  of Sec. 1026.36, including Sec. 1026.36(d) and (e). For example:</p><p class="depth0">A. Assume a loan originator organization receives compensation  directly from either a consumer or a creditor. Further assume the loan  originator organization uses average charge pricing in accordance with  the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and, based on its past average  cost for credit reports, charges the consumer $25 for a credit report  provided by a third party. Under the loan originator organization's  agreement with the consumer reporting agency, the cost of the credit  report is to be paid in a month-end bill and will vary between $15 and  $35 depending on how many credit reports the originator obtains that  month. Assume the $25 for the credit report is paid by the consumer or  is paid by the creditor with proceeds from a rebate. At the end of the  month, the cost for the credit report is determined to be $15 for this  consumer's transaction, based on the loan originator organization's  credit report volume that month. In this case, the $10 difference  between the $25 credit report fee imposed on the consumer and the actual  $15 cost for the credit report is not compensation for purposes of Sec.  1026.36, even though the $10 is retained by the loan originator  organization.</p><p class="depth0">B. Using the same example as in comment 36(a)-5.v.A, the $10  difference would be compensation for purposes of Sec. 1026.36 if the  price for a credit report varies between $10 and $15.</p><p class="depth0">vi. Returns on equity interests and dividends on equity holdings.  The term ``compensation'' for purposes of Sec. 1026.36(d) and (e) also  includes, for example, awards of stock, stock   options and equity interests. Thus, the awarding of stock, stock  options, or equity interests to loan originators is subject to the  restrictions in Sec. 1026.36(d) and (e). For example, a person may not  award additional stock or a preferable type of equity interest to a loan  originator based on the terms of a consumer credit transaction subject  to Sec. 1026.36 originated by that loan originator. However, bona fide  returns or dividends paid on stock or other equity holdings, including  those paid to owners or shareholders of a loan originator organization  who own such stock or equity interests, are not compensation for  purposes of Sec. 1026.36(d) and (e). Bona fide returns or dividends are  those returns and dividends that are paid pursuant to documented  ownership or equity interests and that are not functionally equivalent  to compensation. Ownership and equity interests must be bona fide. Bona  fide ownership and equity interests are allocated according to a loan  originator's respective capital contribution where the allocation is not  a mere subterfuge for the payment of compensation based on terms of a  transaction. Ownership and equity interests also are not bona fide if  the formation or maintenance of the business from which returns or  dividends are paid is a mere subterfuge for the payment of compensation  based on the terms of a transaction. For example, assume that three  individual loan originators form a loan originator organization that is  a limited liability company (LLC). The three individual loan originators  are members of the LLC, and the LLC agreement governing the loan  originator organization's structure calls for regular distributions  based on the members' respective equity interests. If the members'  respective equity interests are allocated based on the members' terms of  transactions, rather than according to their respective capital  contributions, then distributions based on such equity interests are not  bona fide and, thus, are compensation for purposes of Sec. 1026.36(d)  and (e).</p><p class="depth0">36(a)(1)(i)(B) Employee of a retailer of manufactured homes.</p><p class="depth0">1. The definition of loan originator does not include an employee of  a manufactured home retailer that ``assists'' a consumer in obtaining or  applying for consumer credit as defined in comment 36(a)-1.i.A.3,  provided the employee does not advise the consumer on specific credit  terms, or otherwise engage in loan originator activity as defined in  Sec. 1026.36(a)(1). The following examples describe activities that, in  the absence of other activities, do not define a manufactured home  retailer employee as a loan originator:</p><p class="depth0">i. Generally describing the credit application process to a consumer  without advising on credit terms available from a creditor.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Preparing residential mortgage loan packages, which means  compiling and processing loan application materials and supporting  documentation, and providing general application instructions to  consumers so consumers can complete an application, without interacting  or communicating with the consumer regarding transaction terms, but not  filling out a consumer's application, inputting the information into an  online application or other automated system, or taking information from  the consumer over the phone to complete the application.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Collecting information on behalf of the consumer with regard to  a residential mortgage loan. Collecting information ``on behalf of the  consumer'' would include gathering information or supporting  documentation from third parties on behalf of the consumer to provide to  the consumer, for the consumer then to provide in the application or for  the consumer to submit to the loan originator or creditor.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Providing or making available general information about  creditors or loan originators that may offer financing for manufactured  homes in the consumer's general area, when doing so does not otherwise  amount to ``referring'' as defined in comment 36(a)-1.i.A.1. This  includes making available, in a neutral manner, general brochures or  information about the different creditors or loan originators that may  offer financing to a consumer, but does not include recommending a  particular creditor or loan originator or otherwise influencing the  consumer's decision.</p><p class="depth0">36(a)(4) Seller Financers; Three Properties</p><p class="depth0">1. Reasonable ability to repay safe harbors. A person in good faith  determines that the consumer to whom the person extends seller financing  has a reasonable ability to repay the obligation if the person complies  with Sec. 1026.43(c) of this part or complies with the alternative  criteria discussed in this comment. If the consumer intends to make  payments from income, the person considers evidence of the consumer's  current or reasonably expected income. If the consumer intends to make  payments with income from employment, the person considers the  consumer's earnings, which may be reflected in payroll statements or  earnings statements, IRS Form W-2s or similar IRS forms used for  reporting wages or tax withholding, or military Leave and Earnings  Statements. If the consumer intends to make payments from other income,  the person considers the consumer's income from sources such as a  Federal, State, or local government agency providing benefits and  entitlements. If the consumer intends to make payments from income  earned from assets, the person considers the relevant assets, such as  funds held in accounts with financial institutions, equity ownership  interests, or rental property.   However, the value of the dwelling that secures the financing does not  constitute evidence of the consumer's ability to repay. In considering  these and other potential sources of income to determine in good faith  that the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the obligation, the  person making that determination may rely on copies of tax returns the  consumer filed with the Internal Revenue Service or a State taxing  authority.</p><p class="depth0">2. Adjustable rate safe harbors. i. Annual rate increase. An annual  rate increase of two percentage points or less is reasonable.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Lifetime increase. A lifetime limitation of an increase of six  percentage points or less, subject to a minimum floor of the person's  choosing and maximum ceiling that does not exceed the usury limit  applicable to the transaction, is reasonable.</p><p class="depth0">36(a)(5) Seller Financers; One Property</p><p class="depth0">1. Adjustable rate safe harbors. For a discussion of reasonable  annual and lifetime interest rate increases, see comment 36(a)(4)-2.</p><p class="depth0">36(b) Scope.</p><p class="depth0">1. Scope of coverage. Section 1026.36(c)(1) and (c)(2) applies to  closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by a consumer's  principal dwelling. Section 1026.36(c)(3) applies to a consumer credit  transaction, including home equity lines of credit under Sec. 1026.40,  secured by a consumer's dwelling. Paragraphs (h) and (i) of Sec.  1026.36 apply to home equity lines of credit under Sec. 1026.40 secured  by a consumer's principal dwelling. Paragraphs (d), (e), (f), (g), (h),  and (i) of Sec. 1026.36 apply to closed-end consumer credit  transactions secured by a dwelling. Closed-end consumer credit  transactions include transactions secured by first or subordinate liens,  and reverse mortgages that are not home equity lines of credit under  Sec. 1026.40. See Sec. 1026.36(b) for additional restrictions on the  scope of Sec. 1026.36, and Sec. Sec. 1026.1(c) and 1026.3(a) and  corresponding commentary for further discussion of extensions of credit  subject to Regulation Z.</p><p class="depth0">36(c) Servicing Practices</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 36(c)(1)(i)</p><p class="depth0">1. Crediting of payments. Under Sec. 1026.36(c)(1)(i), a mortgage  servicer must credit a payment to a consumer's loan account as of the  date of receipt. This does not require that a mortgage servicer post the  payment to the consumer's loan account on a particular date; the  servicer is only required to credit the payment as of the date of  receipt. Accordingly, a servicer that receives a payment on or before  its due date (or within any grace period), and does not enter the  payment on its books or in its system until after the payment's due date  (or expiration of any grace period), does not violate this rule as long  as the entry does not result in the imposition of a late charge,  additional interest, or similar penalty to the consumer, or in the  reporting of negative information to a consumer reporting agency.</p><p class="depth0">2. Method of crediting periodic payments. The method by which  periodic payments shall be credited is based on the legal obligation  between the creditor and consumer, subject to applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">3. Date of receipt. The ``date of receipt'' is the date that the  payment instrument or other means of payment reaches the mortgage  servicer. For example, payment by check is received when the mortgage  servicer receives it, not when the funds are collected. If the consumer  elects to have payment made by a third-party payor such as a financial  institution, through a preauthorized payment or telephone bill-payment  arrangement, payment is received when the mortgage servicer receives the  third-party payor's check or other transfer medium, such as an  electronic fund transfer.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 36(c)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Handling of partial payments. If a servicer receives a partial  payment from a consumer, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law  or the legal obligation between the parties, the servicer may take any  of the following actions:</p><p class="depth0">i. Credit the partial payment upon receipt.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Return the partial payment to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Hold the payment in a suspense or unapplied funds account. If  the payment is held in a suspense or unapplied funds account, this fact  must be reflected on future periodic statements, in accordance with  Sec. 1026.41(d)(3). When sufficient funds accumulate to cover a  periodic payment, as defined in Sec. 1026.36(c)(1)(i), they must be  treated as a periodic payment received in accordance with Sec.  1026.36(c)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 36(c)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Payment requirements. The servicer may specify reasonable  requirements for making payments in writing, such as requiring that  payments be accompanied by the account number or payment coupon; setting  a cut-off hour for payment to be received, or setting different hours  for payment by mail and payments made in person; specifying that only  checks or money orders should be sent by mail; specifying that payment  is to be made in U.S. dollars; or specifying one particular address for  receiving payments, such as a post office box. The servicer may be  prohibited, however, from requiring payment solely by preauthorized  electronic fund transfer. See section 913 of the Electronic Fund  Transfer Act, 15 U.S.C. 1693k.</p><p class="depth0">2. Payment requirements--limitations. Requirements for making  payments must be reasonable; it should not be difficult for most  consumers to make conforming payments. For example, it would be  reasonable to require a cut-off time of 5 p.m. for receipt   of a mailed check at the location specified by the servicer for receipt  of such check.</p><p class="depth0">3. Implied guidelines for payments. In the absence of specified  requirements for making payments, payments may be made at any location  where the servicer conducts business; any time during the servicer's  normal business hours; and by cash, money order, draft, or other similar  instrument in properly negotiable form, or by electronic fund transfer  if the servicer and consumer have so agreed.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 36(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Pyramiding of late fees. The prohibition on pyramiding of late  fees in Sec. 1026.36(c)(2) should be construed consistently with the  ``credit practices rule'' of the Federal Trade Commission, 16 CFR 444.4.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 36(c)(3).</p><p class="depth0">1. Person acting on behalf of the consumer. For purposes of Sec.  1026.36(c)(3), a person acting on behalf of the consumer may include the  consumer's representative, such as an attorney representing the  individual, a non-profit consumer counseling or similar organization, or  a creditor with which the consumer is refinancing and which requires the  payoff statement to complete the refinancing. A creditor, assignee or  servicer may take reasonable measures to verify the identity of any  person acting on behalf of the consumer and to obtain the consumer's  authorization to release information to any such person before the  ``reasonable time'' period begins to run.</p><p class="depth0">2. Payment requirements. The creditor, assignee or servicer may  specify reasonable requirements for making payoff requests, such as  requiring requests to be directed to a mailing address, email address,  or fax number specified by the creditor, assignee or servicer or any  other reasonable requirement or method. If the consumer does not follow  these requirements, a longer timeframe for responding to the request  would be reasonable.</p><p class="depth0">3. Accuracy of payoff statements. Payoff statements must be accurate  when issued.</p><p class="depth0">36(d) Prohibited Payments to Loan Originators</p><p class="depth0">1. Persons covered. Section 1026.36(d) prohibits any person  (including a creditor) from paying compensation to a loan originator in  connection with a covered credit transaction, if the amount of the  payment is based on a term of a transaction. For example, a person that  purchases an extension of credit from the creditor after consummation  may not compensate the loan originator in a manner that violates Sec.  1026.36(d).</p><p class="depth0">2. Mortgage brokers. The payments made by a company acting as a  mortgage broker to its employees who are loan originators are subject to  the section's prohibitions. For example, a mortgage broker may not pay  its employee more for a transaction with a 7 percent interest rate than  for a transaction with a 6 percent interest rate.</p><p class="depth0">36(d)(1) Payments Based on a Term of a Transaction</p><p class="depth0">1. Compensation that is ``based on'' a term of a transaction. i.  Objective facts and circumstances. Whether compensation is ``based on''  a term of a transaction does not require a comparison of multiple  transactions or proof that any person subjectively intended that there  be a relationship between the amount of the compensation paid and a  transaction term. Instead, the determination is based on the objective  facts and circumstances indicating that compensation would have been  different if a transaction term had been different. Generally, when  there is a compensation policy in place and the objective facts and  circumstances indicate the policy was followed, the determination of  whether compensation would have been different if a transaction term had  been different is made by analysis of the policy. In the absence of a  compensation policy, or when a compensation policy is not followed, the  determination may be made based on a comparison of transactions  originated and the amounts of compensation paid.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Single or multiple transactions. The prohibition on payment and  receipt of compensation under Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(i) encompasses  compensation that directly or indirectly is based on the terms of a  single transaction of a single individual loan originator, the terms of  multiple transactions by that single individual loan originator, or the  terms of multiple transactions by multiple individual loan originators.  Compensation to an individual loan originator that is based upon profits  determined with reference to a mortgage-related business is considered  compensation that is based on the terms of multiple transactions by  multiple individual loan originators. For clarification about the  exceptions permitting compensation based upon profits determined with  reference to mortgage-related business pursuant to either a designated  tax-advantaged plan or a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan,  see comment 36(d)(1)-3. For clarification about ``mortgage-related  business,'' see comments 36(d)(1)-3.v.B and -3.v.E.</p><p class="depth0">A. Assume that a creditor pays a bonus to an individual loan  originator out of a bonus pool established with reference to the  creditor's profits and the profits are determined with reference to the  creditor's revenue from origination of closed-end consumer credit  transactions secured by a dwelling. In such instance, the bonus is  considered compensation that is based on the terms of multiple  transactions by multiple individual loan originators. Therefore, the  bonus is prohibited under Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(i), unless it is otherwise  permitted under Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">B. Assume that an individual loan originator's employment contract  with a creditor guarantees a quarterly bonus in a specified amount  conditioned upon the individual loan originator meeting certain  performance benchmarks (e.g., volume of originations monthly). A bonus  paid following the satisfaction of those contractual conditions is not  directly or indirectly based on the terms of a transaction by an  individual loan originator, the terms of multiple transactions by that  individual loan originator, or the terms of multiple transactions by  multiple individual loan originators under Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(i) as  clarified by this comment 36(d)(1)-1.ii, because the creditor is  obligated to pay the bonus, in the specified amount, regardless of the  terms of transactions of the individual loan originator or multiple  individual loan originators and the effect of those terms of multiple  transactions on the creditor's profits. Because this type of bonus is  not directly or indirectly based on the terms of multiple transactions  by multiple individual loan originators, as described in Sec.  1026.36(d)(1)(i) (as clarified by this comment 36(d)(1)-1.ii), it is not  subject to the 10-percent total compensation limit described in Sec.  1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Transaction term defined. A ``term of a transaction'' under  Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(ii) is any right or obligation of any of the parties  to a credit transaction. A ``credit transaction'' is the operative acts  (e.g., the consumer's purchase of certain goods or services essential to  the transaction) and written and oral agreements that, together, create  the consumer's right to defer payment of debt or to incur debt and defer  its payment. For the purposes of Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(ii), this  definition includes:</p><p class="depth0">A. The rights and obligations, or part of any rights or obligations,  memorialized in a promissory note or other credit contract, as well as  the security interest created by a mortgage, deed of trust, or other  security instrument, and in any document incorporated by reference in  the note, contract, or security instrument;</p><p class="depth0">B. The payment of any loan originator or creditor fees or charges  for the credit, or for a product or service provided by the loan  originator or creditor related to the extension of that credit, imposed  on the consumer, including any fees or charges financed through the  interest rate; and</p><p class="depth0">C. The payment of any fees or charges imposed on the consumer,  including any fees or charges financed through the interest rate, for  any product or service required to be obtained or performed as a  condition of the extension of credit.</p><p class="depth0">D. The fees and charges described above in paragraphs B and C can  only be a term of a transaction if the fees or charges are required to  be disclosed in the Good Faith Estimate, the HUD-1, or the HUD-1A (and  subsequently in any integrated disclosures promulgated by the Bureau  under TILA section 105(b) (15 U.S.C. 1604(b)) and RESPA section 4 (12  U.S.C. 2603) as amended by sections 1098 and 1100A of the Dodd-Frank  Act).</p><p class="depth0">2. Compensation that is or is not based on a term of a transaction  or a proxy for a term of a transaction. Section 1026.36(d)(1) does not  prohibit compensating a loan originator differently on different  transactions, provided the difference is not based on a term of a  transaction or a proxy for a term of a transaction. The rule prohibits  compensation to a loan originator for a transaction based on, among  other things, that transaction's interest rate, annual percentage rate,  collateral type (e.g., condominium, cooperative, detached home, or  manufactured housing), or the existence of a prepayment penalty. The  rule also prohibits compensation to a loan originator that is based on  any factor that is a proxy for a term of a transaction. Compensation  paid to a loan originator organization directly by a consumer in a  transaction is not prohibited by Sec. 1026.36(d)(1) simply because that  compensation itself is a term of the transaction. Nonetheless, that  compensation may not be based on any other term of the transaction or a  proxy for any other term of the transaction. In addition, in a  transaction where a loan originator organization is paid compensation  directly by a consumer, compensation paid by the loan originator  organization to individual loan originators is not prohibited by Sec.  1026.36(d)(1) simply because it is based on the amount of compensation  paid directly by the consumer to the loan originator organization but  the compensation to the individual loan originator may not be based on  any other term of the transaction or proxy for any other term of the  transaction.</p><p class="depth0">i. Permissible methods of compensation. Compensation based on the  following factors is not compensation based on a term of a transaction  or a proxy for a term of a transaction:</p><p class="depth0">A. The loan originator's overall dollar volume (i.e., total dollar  amount of credit extended or total number of transactions originated),  delivered to the creditor. See comment 36(d)(1)-9 discussing variations  of compensation based on the amount of credit extended.</p><p class="depth0">B. The long-term performance of the originator's loans.</p><p class="depth0">C. An hourly rate of pay to compensate the originator for the actual  number of hours worked.</p><p class="depth0">D. Whether the consumer is an existing customer of the creditor or a  new customer.</p><p class="depth0">E. A payment that is fixed in advance for every loan the originator  arranges for the creditor (e.g., $600 for every credit transaction  arranged for the creditor, or $1,000 for the first 1,000 credit  transactions arranged and $500 for each additional credit transaction  arranged).</p><p class="depth0">F. The percentage of applications submitted by the loan originator  to the creditor that results in consummated transactions.</p><p class="depth0">G. The quality of the loan originator's loan files (e.g., accuracy  and completeness of the loan documentation) submitted to the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Proxies for terms of a transaction. If the loan originator's  compensation is based in whole or in part on a factor that is a proxy  for a term of a transaction, then the loan originator's compensation is  based on a term of a transaction. A factor (that is not itself a term of  a transaction) is a proxy for a term of a transaction if the factor  consistently varies with a term or terms of the transaction over a  significant number of transactions, and the loan originator has the  ability, directly or indirectly, to add, drop, or change the factor when  originating the transaction. For example:</p><p class="depth0">A. Assume a creditor pays a loan originator a higher commission for  transactions to be held by the creditor in portfolio than for  transactions sold by the creditor into the secondary market. The  creditor holds in portfolio only extensions of credit that have a fixed  interest rate and a five-year term with a final balloon payment. The  creditor sells into the secondary market all other extensions of credit,  which typically have a higher fixed interest rate and a 30-year term.  Thus, whether an extension of credit is held in portfolio or sold into  the secondary market for this creditor consistently varies with the  interest rate and whether the credit has a five-year term or a 30-year  term (which are terms of the transaction) over a significant number of  transactions. Also, the loan originator has the ability to change the  factor by, for example, advising the consumer to choose an extension of  credit a five-year term. Therefore, under these circumstances, whether  or not an extension of credit will be held in portfolio is a proxy for a  term of a transaction.</p><p class="depth0">B. Assume a loan originator organization pays loan originators  higher commissions for transactions secured by property in State A than  in State B. For this loan originator organization, over a significant  number of transactions, transactions in State B have substantially lower  interest rates than transactions in State A. The loan originator,  however, does not have any ability to influence whether the transaction  is secured by property located in State A or State B. Under these  circumstances, the factor that affects compensation (the location of the  property) is not a proxy for a term of a transaction.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Pooled compensation. Section 1026.36(d)(1) prohibits the  sharing of pooled compensation among loan originators who originate  transactions with different terms and are compensated differently. For  example, assume that Loan Originator A receives a higher commission than  Loan Originator B and that loans originated by Loan Originator A  generally have higher interest rates than loans originated by Loan  Originator B. Under these circumstances, the two loan originators may  not share pooled compensation because each receives compensation based  on the terms of the transactions they collectively make.</p><p class="depth0">3. Interpretation of Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iii) and (iv). Subject to  certain restrictions, Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iii) and Sec.  1026.36(d)(1)(iv) permit contributions to or benefits under designated  tax-advantaged plans and compensation under a non-deferred profits-based  compensation plan even if the contributions, benefits, or compensation,  respectively, are based on the terms of multiple transactions by  multiple individual loan originators.</p><p class="depth0">i. Designated tax-advantaged plans. Section 1026.36(d)(1)(iii)  permits an individual loan originator to receive, and a person to pay,  compensation in the form of contributions to a defined contribution plan  or benefits under a defined benefit plan provided the plan is a  designated tax-advantaged plan (as defined in Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iii)),  even if contributions to or benefits under such plans are directly or  indirectly based on the terms of multiple transactions by multiple  individual loan originators. In the case of a designated tax-advantaged  plan that is a defined contribution plan, Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iii) does  not permit the contribution to be directly or indirectly based on the  terms of that individual loan originator's transactions. A defined  contribution plan has the meaning set forth in Internal Revenue Code  section 414(i), 26 U.S.C. 414(i). A defined benefit plan has the meaning  set forth in Internal Revenue Code section 414(j), 26 U.S.C. 414(j).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Non-deferred profits-based compensation plans. As used in Sec.  1026.36(d)(1)(iv), a ``non-deferred profits-based compensation plan'' is  any compensation arrangement where an individual loan originator may be  paid variable, additional compensation based in whole or in part on the  mortgage-related business profits of the person paying the compensation,  any affiliate, or a business unit within the organizational structure of  the person or the affiliate, as applicable (i.e., depending on the level  within the person's or affiliate's organization at which the non- deferred profits-based compensation plan is established). A non-deferred  profits-based compensation plan does not include a designated tax- advantaged plan or other forms of deferred compensation that are not  designated tax-advantaged plans, such as those created pursuant to  Internal Revenue Code section 409A, 26 U.S.C. 409A. Thus, if  contributions to or benefits under a designated tax-advantaged plan or  compensation under another form of deferred compensation plan are  determined   with reference to the mortgage-related business profits of the person  making the contribution, then the contribution, benefits, or other  compensation, as applicable, are not permitted by Sec.  1026.36(d)(1)(iv) (although, in the case of contributions to or benefits  under a designated tax-advantaged plan, the benefits or contributions  may be permitted by Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iii)). Under a non-deferred  profits-based compensation plan, the individual loan originator may, for  example, be paid directly in cash, stock, or other non-deferred  compensation, and the compensation under the non-deferred profits-based  compensation plan may be determined by a fixed formula or may be at the  discretion of the person (e.g., the person may elect not to pay  compensation under a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan in a  given year), provided the compensation is not directly or indirectly  based on the terms of the individual loan originator's transactions. As  used in Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) and this commentary, non-deferred  profits-based compensation plans include, without limitation, bonus  pools, profits pools, bonus plans, and profit-sharing plans.  Compensation under a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan could  include, without limitation, annual or periodic bonuses, or awards of  merchandise, services, trips, or similar prizes or incentives where the  bonuses, contributions, or awards are determined with reference to the  profits of the person, business unit, or affiliate, as applicable. As  used in Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) and this commentary, a business unit is  a division, department, or segment within the overall organizational  structure of the person or the person's affiliate that performs discrete  business functions and that the person or the affiliate treats  separately for accounting or other organizational purposes. For example,  a creditor that pays its individual loan originators bonuses at the end  of a calendar year based on the creditor's average net return on assets  for the calendar year is operating a non-deferred profits-based  compensation plan under Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iv). A bonus that is paid to  an individual loan originator from a source other than a non-deferred  profits-based compensation plan (or a deferred compensation plan where  the bonus is determined with reference to mortgage-related business  profits), such as a retention bonus budgeted for in advance or a  performance bonus paid out of a bonus pool set aside at the beginning of  the company's annual accounting period as part of the company's  operating budget, does not violate the prohibition on payment of  compensation based on the terms of multiple transactions by multiple  individual loan originators under Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(i), as clarified  by comment 36(d)(1)-1.ii; therefore, Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) does not  apply to such bonuses.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Compensation that is not directly or indirectly based on the  terms of multiple transactions by multiple individual loan originators.  The compensation arrangements addressed in Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iii) and  (iv) are permitted even if they are directly or indirectly based on the  terms of multiple transactions by multiple individual loan originators.  See comment 36(d)(1)-1 for additional interpretation. If a loan  originator organization's revenues are exclusively derived from  transactions subject to Sec. 1026.36(d) (whether paid by creditors,  consumers, or both) and that loan originator organization pays its  individual loan originators a bonus under a non-deferred profits-based  compensation plan, the bonus is not directly or indirectly based on the  terms of multiple transactions by multiple individual loan originators  if Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(i) is otherwise complied with.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Compensation based on terms of an individual loan originator's  transactions. Under both Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iii), with regard to  contributions made to a defined contribution plan that is a designated  tax-advantaged plan, and Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(A), with regard to  compensation under a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan, the  payment of compensation to an individual loan originator may not be  directly or indirectly based on the terms of that individual loan  originator's transaction or transactions. Consequently, for example,  where an individual loan originator makes loans that vary in their  interest rate spread, the compensation payment may not take into account  the average interest rate spread on the individual loan originator's  transactions during the relevant calendar year.</p><p class="depth0">v. Compensation under non-deferred profits-based compensation plans.  Assuming that the conditions in Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(A) are met,  Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1) permits certain compensation to an  individual loan originator under a non-deferred profits-based  compensation plan. Specifically, if the compensation is determined with  reference to the profits of the person from mortgage-related business,  compensation under a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan is  permitted provided the compensation does not, in the aggregate, exceed  10 percent of the individual loan originator's total compensation  corresponding to the time period for which compensation under the non- deferred profits-based compensation plan is paid. The compensation  restrictions under Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1) are sometimes referred  to in this commentary as the ``10-percent total compensation limit'' or  the ``10-percent limit.''</p><p class="depth0">A. Total compensation. For purposes of Sec.  1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1), the individual loan originator's total  compensation consists of the sum total of: (1) All wages and tips  reportable for Medicare tax purposes in box 5 on IRS form W-2 (or, if  the individual loan originator is an independent contractor, reportable  compensation on IRS form 1099-   MISC) that are actually paid during the relevant time period (regardless  of when the wages and tips are earned), except for any compensation  under a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan that is earned  during a different time period (see comment 36(d)(1)-3.v.C); (2) at the  election of the person paying the compensation, all contributions that  are actually made during the relevant time period by the creditor or  loan originator organization to the individual loan originator's  accounts in designated tax-advantaged plans that are defined  contribution plans (regardless of when the contributions are earned);  and (3) at the election of the person paying the compensation, all  compensation under a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan that  is earned during the relevant time period, regardless of whether the  compensation is actually paid during that time period (see comment  36(d)(1)-3.v.C). If an individual loan originator has some compensation  that is reportable on the W-2 and some that is reportable on the 1099- MISC, the total compensation is the sum total of what is reportable on  each of the two forms.</p><p class="depth0">B. Profits of the Person. Under Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iv), a plan is a  non-deferred profits-based compensation plan if compensation is paid,  based in whole or in part, on the profits of the person paying the  compensation. As used in Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iv), ``profits of the  person'' include, as applicable depending on where the non-deferred  profits-based compensation plan is set, the profits of the person, the  business unit to which the individual loan originators are assigned for  accounting or other organizational purposes, or any affiliate of the  person. Profits from mortgage-related business are profits determined  with reference to revenue generated from transactions subject to Sec.  1026.36(d). Pursuant to Sec. 1026.36(b) and comment 36(b)-1, Sec.  1026.36(d) applies to closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by  dwellings. This revenue includes, without limitation, and as applicable  based on the particular sources of revenue of the person, business unit,  or affiliate, origination fees and interest associated with dwelling- secured transactions for which individual loan originators working for  the person were loan originators, income from servicing of such  transactions, and proceeds of secondary market sales of such  transactions. If the amount of the individual loan originator's  compensation under non-deferred profits-based compensation plans paid  for a time period does not, in the aggregate, exceed 10 percent of the  individual loan originator's total compensation corresponding to the  same time period, compensation under non-deferred profits-based  compensation plans may be paid under Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1)  regardless of whether or not it was determined with reference to the  profits of the person from mortgage-related business.</p><p class="depth0">C. Time period for which the compensation under the non-deferred  profits-based compensation plan is paid and to which the total  compensation corresponds. Under Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1),  determination of whether payment of compensation under a non-deferred  profits-based compensation plan complies with the 10-percent limit  requires a calculation of the ratio of the compensation under the non- deferred profits-based compensation plan (i.e., the compensation subject  to the 10-percent limit) and the total compensation corresponding to the  relevant time period. For compensation subject to the 10-percent limit,  the relevant time period is the time period for which a person makes  reference to profits in determining the compensation (i.e., when the  compensation was earned). It does not matter whether the compensation is  actually paid during that particular time period. For total  compensation, the relevant time period is the same time period, but only  certain types of compensation may be included in the total compensation  amount for that time period (see comment 36(d)(1)-3.v.A). For example,  assume that during calendar year 2014 a creditor pays an individual loan  originator compensation in the following amounts: $80,000 in commissions  based on the individual loan originator's performance and volume of  loans generated during the calendar year; and $10,000 in an employer  contribution to a designated tax-advantaged defined contribution plan on  behalf of the individual loan originator. The creditor desires to pay  the individual loan originator a year-end bonus of $10,000 under a non- deferred profits-based compensation plan. The commissions are paid and  employer contributions to the designated tax-advantaged defined  contribution plan are made during calendar year 2014, but the year-end  bonus will be paid in January 2015. For purposes of the 10-percent  limit, the year-end bonus is counted toward the 10-percent limit for  calendar year 2014, even though it is not actually paid until 2015.  Therefore, for calendar year 2014 the individual loan originator's  compensation that is subject to the 10-percent limit would be $10,000  (i.e., the year-end bonus) and the total compensation would be $100,000  (i.e., the sum of the commissions, the designated tax-advantaged plan  contribution (assuming the creditor elects to include it in total  compensation for calendar year 2014), and the bonus (assuming the  creditor elects to include it in total compensation for calendar year  2014)); the bonus would be permissible under Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)  because it does not exceed 10 percent of total compensation. The  determination of total compensation corresponding to 2014 also would not  take into account any compensation subject to the 10-percent limit that  is actually paid in   2014 but is earned during a different calendar year (e.g., an annual  bonus determined with reference to mortgage-related business profits for  calendar year 2013 that is paid in January 2014). If the employer  contribution to the designated tax-advantaged plan is earned in 2014 but  actually made in 2015, however, it may not be included in total  compensation for 2014. A company, business unit, or affiliate, as  applicable, may pay compensation subject to the 10-percent limit during  different time periods falling within its annual accounting period for  keeping records and reporting income and expenses, which may be a  calendar year or a fiscal year depending on the annual accounting  period. In such instances, however, the 10-percent limit applies both as  to each time period and cumulatively as to the annual accounting period.  For example, assume that a creditor uses a calendar-year accounting  period. If the creditor pays an individual loan originator a bonus at  the end of each quarter under a non-deferred profits-based compensation  plan, the payment of each quarterly bonus is subject to the 10-percent  limit measured with respect to each quarter. The creditor can also pay  an annual bonus under the non-deferred profits-based compensation plan  that does not exceed the difference of 10 percent of the individual loan  originator's total compensation corresponding to the calendar year and  the aggregate amount of the quarterly bonuses.</p><p class="depth0">D. Awards of merchandise, services, trips, or similar prizes or  incentives. If any compensation paid to an individual loan originator  under Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) consists of an award of merchandise,  services, trips, or similar prize or incentive, the cash value of the  award is factored into the calculation of the 10-percent total  compensation limit. For example, during a given calendar year,  individual loan originator A and individual loan originator B are each  employed by a creditor and paid $40,000 in salary, and $45,000 in  commissions. The creditor also contributes $5,000 to a designated tax- advantaged defined contribution plan for each individual loan originator  during that calendar year, which the creditor elects to include in the  total compensation amount. Neither individual loan originator is paid  any other form of compensation by the creditor. In December of the  calendar year, the creditor rewards both individual loan originators for  their performance during the calendar year out of a bonus pool  established with reference to the profits of the mortgage origination  business unit. Individual loan originator A is paid a $10,000 cash  bonus, meaning that individual loan originator A's total compensation is  $100,000 (assuming the creditor elects to include the bonus in the total  compensation amount). Individual loan originator B is paid a $7,500 cash  bonus and awarded a vacation package with a cash value of $3,000,  meaning that individual loan originator B's total compensation is  $100,500 (assuming the creditor elects to include the reward in the  total compensation amount). Under Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1),  individual loan originator A's $10,000 bonus is permissible because the  bonus would not constitute more than 10 percent of individual loan  originator A's total compensation for the calendar year. The creditor  may not pay individual loan originator B the $7,500 bonus and award the  vacation package, however, because the total value of the bonus and the  vacation package would be $10,500, which is greater than 10 percent  (10.45 percent) of individual loan originator B's total compensation for  the calendar year. One way to comply with Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1)  would be if the amount of the bonus were reduced to $7,000 or less or  the vacation package were structured such that its cash value would be  $2,500 or less.</p><p class="depth0">E. Compensation determined only with reference to non-mortgage- related business profits. Compensation under a non-deferred profits- based compensation plan is not subject to the 10-percent total  compensation limit under Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1) if the non- deferred profits-based compensation plan is determined with reference  only to profits from business other than mortgage-related business, as  determined in accordance with reasonable accounting principles.  Reasonable accounting principles reflect an accurate allocation of  revenues, expenses, profits, and losses among the person, any affiliate  of the person, and any business units within the person or affiliates,  and are consistent with the accounting principles applied by the person,  the affiliate, or the business unit with respect to, as applicable, its  internal budgeting and auditing functions and external reporting  requirements. Examples of external reporting and filing requirements  that may be applicable to creditors and loan originator organizations  are Federal income tax filings, Federal securities law filings, or  quarterly reporting of income, expenses, loan origination activity, and  other information required by government-sponsored enterprises. As used  in Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1), profits means positive profits or  losses avoided or mitigated.</p><p class="depth0">F. Additional examples. 1. Assume that, during a given calendar  year, a loan originator organization pays an individual loan originator  employee $40,000 in salary and $125,000 in commissions, and makes a  contribution of $15,000 to the individual loan originator's 401(k) plan.  At the end of the year, the loan originator organization wishes to pay  the individual loan originator a bonus based on a formula involving a  number of performance metrics, to be paid out of a profit pool  established at the level of the company but that is determined in part  with reference to the profits of the company's mortgage origination  unit. Assume that the loan originator   organization derives revenues from sources other than transactions  covered by Sec. 1026.36(d). In this example, the performance bonus  would be directly or indirectly based on the terms of multiple  individual loan originators' transactions as described in Sec.  1026.36(d)(1)(i), because it is being determined with reference to  profits from mortgage-related business. Assume, furthermore, that the  loan originator organization elects to include the bonus in the total  compensation amount for the calendar year. Thus, the bonus is  permissible under Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1) if it does not exceed 10  percent of the loan originator's total compensation, which in this  example consists of the individual loan originator's salary and  commissions, the contribution to the 401(k) plan (if the loan originator  organization elects to include the contribution in the total  compensation amount), and the performance bonus. Therefore, if the loan  originator organization elects to include the 401(k) contribution in  total compensation for these purposes, the loan originator organization  may pay the individual loan originator a performance bonus of up to  $20,000 (i.e., 10 percent of $200,000 in total compensation). If the  loan originator organization does not include the 401(k) contribution in  calculating total compensation, or the 401(k) contribution is actually  made in January of the following calendar year (in which case it cannot  be included in total compensation for the initial calendar year), the  bonus may be up to $18,333.33. If the loan originator organization  includes neither the 401(k) contribution nor the performance bonus in  the total compensation amount, the bonus may not exceed $16,500.</p><p class="depth0">2. Assume that the compensation during a given calendar year of an  individual loan originator employed by a creditor consists of only  salary and commissions, and the individual loan originator does not  participate in a designated tax-advantaged defined contribution plan.  Assume further that the creditor uses a calendar-year accounting period.  At the end of the calendar year, the creditor pays the individual loan  originator two bonuses: A ``performance'' bonus based on the individual  loan originator's aggregate loan volume for a calendar year that is paid  out of a bonus pool determined with reference to the profits of the  mortgage origination business unit, and a year-end ``holiday'' bonus in  the same amount to all company employees that is paid out of a company- wide bonus pool. Because the performance bonus is paid out of a bonus  pool that is determined with reference to the profits of the mortgage  origination business unit, it is compensation that is determined with  reference to mortgage-related business profits, and the bonus is  therefore subject to the 10-percent total compensation limit. If the  company-wide bonus pool from which the ``holiday'' bonus is paid is  derived in part from profits of the creditor's mortgage origination  business unit, then the combination of the ``holiday'' bonus and the  performance bonus is subject to the 10-percent total compensation limit.  The ``holiday'' bonus is not subject to the 10-percent total  compensation limit if the bonus pool is determined with reference only  to the profits of business units other than the mortgage origination  business unit, as determined in accordance with reasonable accounting  principles. If the ``performance'' bonus and the ``holiday'' bonus in  the aggregate do not exceed 10 percent of the individual loan  originator's total compensation, the bonuses may be paid under Sec.  1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1) without the necessity of determining from which  bonus pool they were paid or whether they were determined with reference  to the profits of the creditor's mortgage origination business unit.</p><p class="depth0">G. Reasonable reliance by individual loan originator on accounting  or statement by person paying compensation. An individual loan  originator is deemed to comply with its obligations regarding receipt of  compensation under Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1) if the individual loan  originator relies in good faith on an accounting or a statement provided  by the person who determined the individual loan originator's  compensation under a non-deferred profits-based compensation plan  pursuant to Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1) and where the statement or  accounting is provided within a reasonable time period following the  person's determination.</p><p class="depth0">vi. Individual loan originators who originate ten or fewer  transactions. Assuming that the conditions in Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(A)  are met, Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(2) permits compensation to an  individual loan originator under a non-deferred profits-based  compensation plan even if the payment or contribution is directly or  indirectly based on the terms of multiple individual loan originators'  transactions if the individual is a loan originator (as defined in Sec.  1026.36(a)(1)(i)) for ten or fewer consummated transactions during the  12-month period preceding the compensation determination. For example,  assume a loan originator organization employs two individual loan  originators who originate transactions subject to Sec. 1026.36 during a  given calendar year. Both employees are individual loan originators as  defined in Sec. 1026.36(a)(1)(ii), but only one of them (individual  loan originator B) acts as a loan originator in the normal course of  business, while the other (individual loan originator A) is called upon  to do so only occasionally and regularly performs other duties (such as  serving as a manager). In January of the following calendar year, the  loan originator organization formally determines the financial  performance of its mortgage business for the prior calendar year. Based  on that determination, the loan originator organization   on February 1 decides to pay a bonus to the individual loan originators  out of a company bonus pool. Assume that, between February 1 of the  prior calendar year and January 31 of the current calendar year,  individual loan originator A was the loan originator for eight  consummated transactions, and individual loan originator B was the loan  originator for 15 consummated transactions. The loan originator  organization may award the bonus to individual loan originator A under  Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(2). The loan originator organization may not  award the bonus to individual loan originator B relying on the exception  under Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(2) because it would not apply, although  it could award a bonus pursuant to the 10-percent total compensation  limit under Sec. 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1) if the requirements of that  provision are complied with.</p><p class="depth0">4. Creditor's flexibility in setting loan terms. Section 1026.36(d)  also does not limit a creditor from offering or providing different loan  terms to the consumer based on the creditor's assessment of the credit  and other transactional risks involved. If a creditor pays compensation  to a loan originator in compliance with Sec. 1026.36(d), the creditor  may recover the costs of the loan originator's compensation and other  costs of the transaction by charging the consumer points or fees or a  higher interest rate or a combination of these. Thus, in these  transactions, a creditor may charge a higher interest rate to a consumer  who will pay fewer of the costs of the transaction at or before closing  or it may offer the consumer a lower rate if the consumer pays more of  the transaction costs at or before closing. For example, if the consumer  pays half of the transaction costs at or before closing, a creditor may  charge an interest rate of 6.0 percent but, if the consumer pays none of  the transaction costs at or before closing, the creditor may charge an  interest rate of 6.5 percent. In these transactions, a creditor also may  offer different consumers varying interest rates that include a  consistent interest rate premium to recoup the loan originator's  compensation through increased interest paid by the consumer (such as by  consistently adding 0.25 percentage points to the interest rate on each  transaction where the loan originator is compensated based on a  percentage of the amount of the credit extended).</p><p class="depth0">5. Effect of modification of transaction terms. Under Sec.  1026.36(d)(1), a loan originator's compensation may not be based on any  of the terms of a credit transaction. Thus, a creditor and a loan  originator may not agree to set the loan originator's compensation at a  certain level and then subsequently lower it in selective cases (such as  where the consumer is able to obtain a lower rate from another  creditor). When the creditor offers to extend credit with specified  terms and conditions (such as the rate and points), the amount of the  originator's compensation for that transaction is not subject to change  (increase or decrease) based on whether different credit terms are  negotiated. For example, if the creditor agrees to lower the rate that  was initially offered, the new offer may not be accompanied by a  reduction in the loan originator's compensation. Thus, while the  creditor may change credit terms or pricing to match a competitor, to  avoid triggering high-cost mortgage provisions, or for other reasons,  the loan originator's compensation on that transaction may not be  changed for those reasons. A loan originator therefore may not agree to  reduce its compensation or provide a credit to the consumer to pay a  portion of the consumer's closing costs, for example, to avoid high-cost  mortgage provisions. A loan originator organization may not reduce its  own compensation in a transaction where the loan originator organization  receives compensation directly from the consumer, with or without a  corresponding reduction in compensation paid to an individual loan  originator. See comment 36(d)(1)-7 for further interpretation.</p><p class="depth0">6. Periodic changes in loan originator compensation and terms of  transactions. Section 1026.36 does not limit a creditor or other person  from periodically revising the compensation it agrees to pay a loan  originator. However, the revised compensation arrangement must not  result in payments to the loan originator that are based on the terms of  a credit transaction. A creditor or other person might periodically  review factors such as loan performance, transaction volume, as well as  current market conditions for loan originator compensation, and  prospectively revise the compensation it agrees to pay to a loan  originator. For example, assume that during the first six months of the  year, a creditor pays $3,000 to a particular loan originator for each  loan delivered, regardless of the terms of the transaction. After  considering the volume of business produced by that loan originator, the  creditor could decide that as of July 1, it will pay $3,250 for each  loan delivered by that particular loan originator, regardless of the  terms of the transaction. No violation occurs even if the loans made by  the creditor after July 1 generally carry a higher interest rate than  loans made before that date, to reflect the higher compensation.</p><p class="depth0">7. Permitted decreases in loan originator compensation.  Notwithstanding comment 36(d)(1)-5, Sec. 1026.36(d)(1) does not  prohibit a loan originator from decreasing its compensation to defray  the cost, in whole or part, of an unforeseen increase in an actual  settlement cost over an estimated settlement cost disclosed to the  consumer pursuant to section 5(c) of RESPA or an unforeseen actual  settlement cost not disclosed to the consumer pursuant to section 5(c)  of   RESPA. For purposes of comment 36(d)(1)-7, an increase in an actual  settlement cost over an estimated settlement cost or a cost not  disclosed is unforeseen if the increase occurs even though the estimate  provided to the consumer is consistent with the best information  reasonably available to the disclosing person at the time of the  estimate. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that a consumer agrees to lock an interest rate with a  creditor in connection with the financing of a purchase-money  transaction. A title issue with the property being purchased delays  closing by one week, which in turn causes the rate lock to expire. The  consumer desires to re-lock the interest rate. Provided that the title  issue was unforeseen, the loan originator may decrease the loan  originator's compensation to pay for all or part of the rate-lock  extension fee.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume that when applying the tolerance requirements under the  regulations implementing RESPA sections 4 and 5(c), there is a tolerance  violation of $70 that must be cured. Provided the violation was  unforeseen, the rule is not violated if the individual loan originator's  compensation decreases to pay for all or part of the amount required to  cure the tolerance violation.</p><p class="depth0">8. Record retention. See comment 25(c)(2)-1 and -2 for commentary on  complying with the record retention requirements of Sec. 1026.25(c)(2)  as they apply to Sec. 1026.36(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0">9. Amount of credit extended. A loan originator's compensation may  be based on the amount of credit extended, subject to certain  conditions. Section 1026.36(d)(1) does not prohibit an arrangement under  which a loan originator is paid compensation based on a percentage of  the amount of credit extended, provided the percentage is fixed and does  not vary with the amount of credit extended. However, compensation that  is based on a fixed percentage of the amount of credit extended may be  subject to a minimum and/or maximum dollar amount, as long as the  minimum and maximum dollar amounts do not vary with each credit  transaction. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. A creditor may offer a loan originator 1 percent of the amount of  credit extended for all loans the originator arranges for the creditor,  but not less than $1,000 or greater than $5,000 for each loan.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A creditor may not offer a loan originator 1 percent of the  amount of credit extended for loans of $300,000 or more, 2 percent of  the amount of credit extended for loans between $200,000 and $300,000,  and 3 percent of the amount of credit extended for loans of $200,000 or  less.</p><p class="depth0">10. Amount of credit extended under a reverse mortgage. For closed- end reverse mortgage loans, the ``amount of credit extended'' for  purposes of Sec. 1026.36(d)(1) means either:</p><p class="depth0">i. The maximum proceeds available to the consumer under the loan; or</p><p class="depth0">ii. The maximum claim amount as defined in 24 CFR 206.3 if the  mortgage is subject to 24 CFR part 206, or the appraised value of the  property, as determined by the appraisal used in underwriting the loan,  if the mortgage is not subject to 24 CFR part 206.</p><p class="depth0">36(d)(2) Payments by Persons Other Than Consumer</p><p class="depth0">36(d)(2)(i) Dual Compensation</p><p class="depth0">1. Compensation in connection with a particular transaction. Under  Sec. 1026.36(d)(2)(i)(A), if any loan originator receives compensation  directly from a consumer in a transaction, no other person may provide  any compensation to any loan originator, directly or indirectly, in  connection with that particular credit transaction, whether before, at,  or after consummation. See comment 36(d)(2)(i)-2 discussing compensation  received directly from the consumer. The restrictions imposed under  Sec. 1026.36(d)(2)(i) relate only to payments, such as commissions,  that are specific to, and paid solely in connection with, the  transaction in which the consumer has paid compensation directly to a  loan originator. In a transaction where a loan originator receives  compensation directly from a consumer, a creditor still may provide  funds for the benefit of the consumer in that transaction, provided such  funds are applied solely toward costs of the transaction other than loan  originator compensation. Section 1026.36(d)(2)(i)(C) provides that, if a  loan originator organization receives compensation directly from a  consumer, the loan originator organization may provide compensation to  individual loan originators, and the individual loan originator may  receive compensation from the loan originator organization, subject to  the restriction in Sec. 1026.36(d)(1). (See comment 36(a)(1)-1.i for an  explanation of the use of the term ``loan originator organization'' and  ``individual loan originator'' for purposes of Sec.  1026.36(d)(2)(i)(C).) For example, payments by a mortgage broker to an  individual loan originator as compensation for originating a specific  credit transaction do not violate Sec. 1026.36(d)(2)(i)(A) even if the  consumer directly pays the mortgage broker a fee in connection with that  transaction. However, neither the mortgage broker nor the individual  loan originator can receive compensation from the creditor in connection  with that particular credit transaction.</p><p class="depth0">2. Compensation received directly from a consumer. i. Payments by a  consumer to a loan originator from loan proceeds are considered  compensation received directly from the consumer, while payments derived  from an increased interest rate are not considered compensation received  directly from the   consumer. However, payments by a consumer to the creditor are not  considered payments to the loan originator that are received directly  from the consumer whether they are paid directly by the consumer (for  example, in cash or by check) or out of the loan proceeds. See the  definition of ``compensation'' in Sec. 1026.36(a)(3) and related  commentary.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Funds from the creditor that will be applied to reduce the  consumer's settlement charges, including origination fees paid by a  creditor to the loan originator, that are characterized on the  disclosures made pursuant to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act  as a ``credit'' are nevertheless not considered to be received by the  loan originator directly from the consumer for purposes of Sec.  1026.36(d)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Section 1026.36(d)(2)(i)(B) provides that compensation received  directly from a consumer includes payments to a loan originator made  pursuant to an agreement between the consumer and a person other than  the creditor or its affiliates, under which such other person agrees to  provide funds toward the consumer's costs of the transaction (including  loan originator compensation). Compensation to a loan originator is  sometimes paid on the consumer's behalf by a person other than a  creditor or its affiliates, such as a non-creditor seller, home builder,  home improvement contractor or real estate broker or agent. Such  payments to a loan originator are considered compensation received  directly from the consumer for purposes of Sec. 1026.36(d)(2) if they  are made pursuant to an agreement between the consumer and the person  other than the creditor or its affiliates. State law determines whether  there is an agreement between the parties. See Sec. 1026.2(b)(3). The  parties do not have to agree specifically that the payments will be used  to pay for the loan originator's compensation, but just that the person  will make a payment to the loan originator toward the consumer's costs  of the transaction, or ``closing costs'' and the loan originator retains  such payment. For example, assume that a non-creditor seller (that is  not the creditor's affiliate) has an agreement with the consumer to pay  $1,000 of the consumer's closing costs on a transaction. Any of the  $1,000 that is paid by the non-creditor seller to the loan originator  and constitutes ``compensation'' as defined in Sec. 1026.36(a)(3) to  the loan originator is compensation received directly from the consumer,  even if the agreement does not specify that some or all of $1,000 must  be used to compensate the loan originator. Nonetheless, payments by the  consumer to the creditor are not payments to the loan originator that  are received directly from the consumer. See comment 36(d)(2)(i)-2.i.  Accordingly, payments in the transaction to the creditor on behalf of  the consumer by a person other than the creditor or its affiliates are  not payments to the loan originator that are received directly from the  consumer.</p><p class="depth0">36(d)(3) Affiliates</p><p class="depth0">1. For purposes of Sec. 1026.36(d), affiliates are treated as a  single ``person.'' The term ``affiliate'' is defined in Sec.  1026.32(b)(2). For example, assume a parent company has two mortgage  lending subsidiaries. Under Sec. 1026.36(d)(1), subsidiary ``A'' could  not pay a loan originator greater compensation for a loan with an  interest rate of 8 percent than it would pay for a loan with an interest  rate of 7 percent. If the loan originator may deliver loans to both  subsidiaries, they must compensate the loan originator in the same  manner. Accordingly, if the loan originator delivers the loan to  subsidiary ``B'' and the interest rate is 8 percent, the originator must  receive the same compensation that would have been paid by subsidiary A  for a loan with a rate of either 7 or 8 percent.</p><p class="depth0">36(e) Prohibition on Steering</p><p class="depth0">1. Compensation. See comment 36(d)(1)-1 for guidance on compensation  that is subject to Sec. 1026.36(e).</p><p class="depth0">36(e)(1) General</p><p class="depth0">1. Steering. For purposes of Sec. 1026.36(e), directing or  ``steering'' a consumer to consummate a particular credit transaction  means advising, counseling, or otherwise influencing a consumer to  accept that transaction. For such actions to constitute steering, the  consumer must actually consummate the transaction in question. Thus,  Sec. 1026.36(e)(1) does not address the actions of a loan originator if  the consumer does not actually obtain a loan through that loan  originator.</p><p class="depth0">2. Prohibited conduct. Under Sec. 1026.36(e)(1), a loan originator  may not direct or steer a consumer to consummate a transaction based on  the fact that the loan originator would increase the amount of  compensation that the loan originator would receive for that transaction  compared to other transactions, unless the consummated transaction is in  the consumer's interest.</p><p class="depth0">i. In determining whether a consummated transaction is in the  consumer's interest, that transaction must be compared to other possible  loan offers available through the originator, if any, and for which the  consumer was likely to qualify, at the time that transaction was offered  to the consumer. Possible loan offers are available through the loan  originator if they could be obtained from a creditor with which the loan  originator regularly does business. Section 1026.36(e)(1) does not  require a loan originator to establish a business relationship with any  creditor with which the loan originator does not already do business. To  be   considered a possible loan offer available through the loan originator,  an offer need not be extended by the creditor; it need only be an offer  that the creditor likely would extend upon receiving an application from  the applicant, based on the creditor's current credit standards and its  current rate sheets or other similar means of communicating its current  credit terms to the loan originator. An originator need not inform the  consumer about a potential transaction if the originator makes a good  faith determination that the consumer is not likely to qualify for it.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Section 1026.36(e)(1) does not require a loan originator to  direct a consumer to the transaction that will result in a creditor  paying the least amount of compensation to the originator. However, if  the loan originator reviews possible loan offers available from a  significant number of the creditors with which the originator regularly  does business, and the originator directs the consumer to the  transaction that will result in the least amount of creditor-paid  compensation for the loan originator, the requirements of Sec.  1026.36(e)(1) are deemed to be satisfied. In the case where a loan  originator directs the consumer to the transaction that will result in a  greater amount of creditor-paid compensation for the loan originator,  Sec. 1026.36(e)(1) is not violated if the terms and conditions on that  transaction compared to the other possible loan offers available through  the originator, and for which the consumer likely qualifies, are the  same. A loan originator who is an employee of the creditor on a  transaction may not obtain compensation that is based on the  transaction's terms or conditions pursuant to Sec. 1026.36(d)(1), and  compliance with that provision by such a loan originator also satisfies  the requirements of Sec. 1026.36(e)(1) for that transaction with the  creditor. However, if a creditor's employee acts as a broker by  forwarding a consumer's application to a creditor other than the loan  originator's employer, such as when the employer does not offer any loan  products for which the consumer would qualify, the loan originator is  not an employee of the creditor in that transaction and is subject to  Sec. 1026.36(e)(1) if the originator is compensated for arranging the  loan with the other creditor.</p><p class="depth0">iii. See the commentary under Sec. 1026.36(e)(3) for additional  guidance on what constitutes a ``significant number of creditors with  which a loan originator regularly does business'' and guidance on the  determination about transactions for which ``the consumer likely  qualifies.''</p><p class="depth0">3. Examples. Assume a loan originator determines that a consumer  likely qualifies for a loan from Creditor A that has a fixed interest  rate of 7 percent, but the loan originator directs the consumer to a  loan from Creditor B having a rate of 7.5 percent. If the loan  originator receives more in compensation from Creditor B than the amount  that would have been paid by Creditor A, the prohibition in Sec.  1026.36(e) is violated unless the higher-rate loan is in the consumer's  interest. For example, a higher-rate loan might be in the consumer's  interest if the lower-rate loan has a prepayment penalty, or if the  lower-rate loan requires the consumer to pay more in up-front charges  that the consumer is unable or unwilling to pay or finance as part of  the loan amount.</p><p class="depth0">36(e)(2) Permissible Transactions</p><p class="depth0">1. Safe harbors. A loan originator that satisfies Sec.  1026.36(e)(2) is deemed to comply with Sec. 1026.36(e)(1). A loan  originator that does not satisfy Sec. 1026.36(e)(2) is not subject to  any presumption regarding the originator's compliance or noncompliance  with Sec. 1026.36(e)(1).</p><p class="depth0">2. Minimum number of loan options. To obtain the safe harbor, Sec.  1026.36(e)(2) requires that the loan originator present loan options  that meet the criteria in Sec. 1026.36(e)(3)(i) for each type of  transaction in which the consumer expressed an interest. As required by  Sec. 1026.36(e)(3)(ii), the loan originator must have a good faith  belief that the options presented are loans for which the consumer  likely qualifies. If the loan originator is not able to form such a good  faith belief for loan options that meet the criteria in Sec.  1026.36(e)(3)(i) for a given type of transaction, the loan originator  may satisfy Sec. 1026.36(e)(2) by presenting all loans for which the  consumer likely qualifies and that meet the other requirements in Sec.  1026.36(e)(3) for that given type of transaction. A loan originator may  present to the consumer any number of loan options, but presenting a  consumer more than four loan options for each type of transaction in  which the consumer expressed an interest and for which the consumer  likely qualifies would not likely help the consumer make a meaningful  choice.</p><p class="depth0">36(e)(3) Loan Options Presented</p><p class="depth0">1. Significant number of creditors. A significant number of the  creditors with which a loan originator regularly does business is three  or more of those creditors. If the loan originator regularly does  business with fewer than three creditors, the originator is deemed to  comply by obtaining loan options from all the creditors with which it  regularly does business. Under Sec. 1026.36(e)(3)(i), the loan  originator must obtain loan options from a significant number of  creditors with which the loan originator regularly does business, but  the loan originator need not present loan options from all such  creditors to the consumer. For example, if three loans available from  one of the creditors with which the loan originator regularly does  business satisfy the criteria in   Sec. 1026.36(e)(3)(i), presenting those and no options from any other  creditor satisfies that section.</p><p class="depth0">2. Creditors with which loan originator regularly does business. To  qualify for the safe harbor in Sec. 1026.36(e)(2), the loan originator  must obtain and review loan options from a significant number of the  creditors with which the loan originator regularly does business. For  this purpose, a loan originator regularly does business with a creditor  if:</p><p class="depth0">i. There is a written agreement between the originator and the  creditor governing the originator's submission of mortgage loan  applications to the creditor;</p><p class="depth0">ii. The creditor has extended credit secured by a dwelling to one or  more consumers during the current or previous calendar month based on an  application submitted by the loan originator; or</p><p class="depth0">iii. The creditor has extended credit secured by a dwelling twenty- five or more times during the previous twelve calendar months based on  applications submitted by the loan originator. For this purpose, the  previous twelve calendar months begin with the calendar month that  precedes the month in which the loan originator accepted the consumer's  application.</p><p class="depth0">3. Lowest interest rate. To qualify under the safe harbor in Sec.  1026.36(e)(2), for each type of transaction in which the consumer has  expressed an interest, the loan originator must present the consumer  with loan options that meet the criteria in Sec. 1026.36(e)(3)(i) for  which the loan originator has a good faith belief that the consumer is  likely to qualify. The criteria are: the loan with the lowest interest  rate; the loan with the lowest total dollar amount of discount points,  origination points or origination fees; and a loan with the lowest  interest rate without negative amortization, a prepayment penalty, a  balloon payment in the first seven years of the loan term, shared  equity, or shared appreciation, or, in the case of a reverse mortgage, a  loan without a prepayment penalty, shared equity, or shared  appreciation. The loan with the lowest interest rate for which the  consumer likely qualifies is the loan with the lowest rate the consumer  can likely obtain, regardless of how many discount points, origination  points or origination fees the consumer must pay to obtain it. To  identify the loan with the lowest interest rate, for any loan that has  an initial rate that is fixed for at least five years, the loan  originator uses the initial rate that would be in effect at  consummation. For a loan with an initial rate that is not fixed for at  least five years:</p><p class="depth0">i. If the interest rate varies based on changes to an index, the  originator uses the fully-indexed rate that would be in effect at  consummation without regard to any initial discount or premium.</p><p class="depth0">ii. For a step-rate loan, the originator uses the highest rate that  would apply during the first five years.</p><p class="depth0">4. Transactions for which the consumer likely qualifies. To qualify  under the safe harbor in Sec. 1026.36(e)(2), the loan originator must  have a good faith belief that the loan options presented to the consumer  pursuant to Sec. 1026.36(e)(3) are transactions for which the consumer  likely qualifies. The loan originator's belief that the consumer likely  qualifies should be based on information reasonably available to the  loan originator at the time the loan options are presented. In making  this determination, the loan originator may rely on information provided  by the consumer, even if it subsequently is determined to be inaccurate.  For purposes of Sec. 1026.36(e)(3), a loan originator is not expected  to know all aspects of each creditor's underwriting criteria. But  pricing or other information that is routinely communicated by creditors  to loan originators is considered to be reasonably available to the loan  originator, for example, rate sheets showing creditors' current pricing  and the required minimum credit score or other eligibility criteria.</p><p class="depth0">36(f) Loan Originator Qualification Requirements</p><p class="depth0">1. Scope. Section 1026.36(f) sets forth qualification requirements  that a loan originator must meet. As provided in Sec. 1026.36(a)(1) and  accompanying commentary, the term ``loan originator'' includes natural  persons and organizations and does not exclude creditors for purposes of  the qualification requirements in Sec. 1026.36(f).</p><p class="depth0">2. Licensing and registration requirements. Section 1026.36(f)  requires loan originators to comply with applicable State and Federal  licensing and registration requirements, including any such requirements  imposed by the SAFE Act and its implementing regulations and State laws.  SAFE Act licensing and registration requirements apply to individual  loan originators, but many State licensing and registration requirements  apply to loan originator organizations as well.</p><p class="depth0">3. No effect on licensing and registration requirements. Section  1026.36(f) does not affect which loan originators must comply with State  and Federal licensing and registration requirements. For example, the  fact that the definition of loan originator in Sec. 1026.36(a)(1)  differs somewhat from that in the SAFE Act does not affect who must  comply with the SAFE Act. To illustrate, assume an individual is an  employee of an organization that a State has determined to be a bona  fide nonprofit organization and the State has not subjected the employee  to that State's SAFE Act loan originator licensing. If that same  individual meets the definition of loan originator in Sec.  1026.36(a)(1), the individual is subject to the requirements of Sec.  1026.36, but the   State may continue not to subject the employee to that State's SAFE Act  licensing requirements. Similarly, the qualification requirements  imposed under Sec. 1026.36(f) do not add to or affect the criteria that  States must consider in determining whether a loan originator  organization is a bona fide nonprofit organization under the SAFE Act.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 36(f)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Legal existence and foreign qualification. Section 1026.36(f)(1)  requires a loan originator organization to comply with applicable State  law requirements governing the legal existence and foreign qualification  of the loan originator organization. Covered State law requirements  include those that must be complied with to bring the loan originator  organization into legal existence, to maintain its legal existence, to  be permitted to transact business in another State, or to facilitate  service of process. For example, covered State law requirements include  those for incorporation or other type of legal formation and for  designating and maintaining a registered agent for service of process.  State law requirements to pay taxes and other requirements that do not  relate to legal accountability of the loan originator organization to  consumers are outside the scope of Sec. 1026.36(f)(1).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 36(f)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. License or registration. Section 1026.36(f)(2) requires the loan  originator organization to ensure that individual loan originators who  work for it are licensed or registered in compliance with the SAFE Act  and other applicable law. The individual loan originators who work for a  loan originator organization include individual loan originators who are  its employees or who operate under a brokerage agreement with the loan  originator organization. Thus, for example, a brokerage is responsible  for verifying that the loan originator individuals who work directly for  it are licensed and registered in accordance with applicable law,  whether the individual loan originators are its employees or independent  contractors who operate pursuant to a brokerage agreement. A loan  originator organization can meet this duty by confirming the  registration or license status of an individual at  www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 36(f)(3)</p><p class="depth0">1. Unlicensed individual loan originators. Section 1026.36(f)(3)  sets forth actions that a loan originator organization must take for any  of its individual loan originator employees who are not required to be  licensed and are not licensed as a loan originator pursuant to the SAFE  Act. Individual loan originators who are not subject to SAFE Act  licensing generally include employees of depository institutions and  their Federally regulated subsidiaries and employees of bona fide  nonprofit organizations that a State has exempted from licensing under  the criteria in 12 CFR 1008.103(e)(7).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 36(f)(3)(i)</p><p class="depth0">1. Criminal and credit histories. Section 1026.36(f)(3)(i) requires  the loan originator organization to obtain, for any of its individual  loan originator employees who is not required to be licensed and is not  licensed as a loan originator pursuant to the SAFE Act, a criminal  background check, a credit report, and information related to any  administrative, civil, or criminal determinations by any government  jurisdiction. The requirement applies to individual loan originator  employees who were hired on or after January 1, 2014 (or whom the loan  originator organization hired before this date but for whom there were  no applicable statutory or regulatory background standards in effect at  the time of hire or before January 1, 2014, used to screen the  individual). A credit report may be obtained directly from a consumer  reporting agency or through a commercial service. A loan originator  organization with access to the NMLSR can meet the requirement for the  criminal background check by reviewing any criminal background check it  receives upon compliance with the requirement in 12 CFR 1007.103(d)(1)  and can meet the requirement to obtain information related to any  administrative, civil, or criminal determinations by any government  jurisdiction by obtaining the information through the NMLSR. Loan  originator organizations that do not have access to these items through  the NMLSR may obtain them by other means. For example, a criminal  background check may be obtained from a law enforcement agency or  commercial service. Information on any past administrative, civil, or  criminal findings (such as from disciplinary or enforcement actions) may  be obtained from the individual loan originator.</p><p class="depth0">2. Retroactive obtaining of information not required. Section  1026.36(f)(3)(i) does not require the loan originator organization to  obtain the covered information for an individual whom the loan  originator organization hired as a loan originator before January 1,  2014, and screened under applicable statutory or regulatory background  standards in effect at the time of hire. However, if the individual  subsequently ceases to be employed as a loan originator by that loan  originator organization, and later resumes employment as a loan  originator by that loan originator organization (or any other loan  originator organization), the loan originator organization is subject to  the requirements of Sec. 1026.36(f)(3)(i).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 36(f)(3)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 36(f)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Scope of review. Section 1026.36(f)(3)(ii) requires the loan  originator organization to review the information that it obtains under  Sec. 1026.36(f)(3)(i) and other reasonably available information to  determine whether the individual loan originator meets the standards in  Sec. 1026.36(f)(3)(ii). Other reasonably available information includes  any information the loan originator organization has obtained or would  obtain as part of a reasonably prudent hiring process, including  information obtained from application forms, candidate interviews, other  reliable information and evidence provided by a candidate, and reference  checks. The requirement applies to individual loan originator employees  who were hired on or after January 1, 2014 (or whom the loan originator  organization hired before this date but for whom there were no  applicable statutory or regulatory background standards in effect at the  time of hire or before January 1, 2014, used to screen the individual).</p><p class="depth0">2. Retroactive determinations not required. Section  1026.36(f)(3)(ii) does not require the loan originator organization to  review the covered information and make the required determinations for  an individual whom the loan originator organization hired as a loan  originator on or before January 1, 2014 and screened under applicable  statutory or regulatory background standards in effect at the time of  hire. However, if the individual subsequently ceases to be employed as a  loan originator by that loan originator organization, and later resumes  employment as a loan originator by that loan originator organization (or  any other loan originator organization), the loan originator  organization employing the individual is subject to the requirements of  Sec. 1026.36(f)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">3. Subsequent determinations. The loan originator organization must  make the required determinations for an individual before the individual  acts as a loan originator. Subsequent reviews and assessments are  required only if the loan originator organization knows of reliable  information indicating that the individual loan originator likely no  longer meets the required standards in Sec. 1026.36(f)(3). For example,  if the loan originator organization has knowledge of criminal conduct of  its individual loan originator through a newspaper article, a previously  obtained criminal background report, or the NMLSR, the loan originator  organization must determine whether any resulting conviction, or any  other information, causes the individual to fail to meet the standards  in Sec. 1026.36(f)(3)(ii), regardless of when the loan originator was  hired or previously screened.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 36(f)(3)(ii)(B)</p><p class="depth0">1. Financial responsibility, character, and general fitness. The  determination of financial responsibility, character, and general  fitness required under Sec. 1026.36(f)(3)(ii)(B) requires an assessment  of all information obtained pursuant to paragraph (f)(3)(i) and any  other reasonably available information, including information that is  known to the loan originator organization or would become known to the  loan originator organization as part of a reasonably prudent hiring  process. The absence of any significant adverse information is  sufficient to support an affirmative determination that the individual  meets the standards. A review and assessment of financial responsibility  is sufficient if it considers, as relevant factors, the existence of  current outstanding judgments, tax liens, other government liens,  nonpayment of child support, or a pattern of bankruptcies, foreclosures,  or delinquent accounts. A review and assessment of financial  responsibility is not required to consider debts arising from medical  expenses. A review and assessment of character and general fitness is  sufficient if it considers, as relevant factors, acts of unfairness or  dishonesty, including dishonesty by the individual in the course of  seeking employment or in connection with determinations pursuant to the  qualification requirements of Sec. 1026.36(f), and any disciplinary  actions by regulatory or professional licensing agencies. No single  factor necessarily requires a determination that the individual does not  meet the standards for financial responsibility, character, or general  fitness, provided that the loan originator organization considers all  relevant factors and reasonably determines that, on balance, the  individual meets the standards.</p><p class="depth0">2. Written procedures for making determinations. A loan originator  organization that establishes written procedures for determining whether  individuals meet the financial responsibility, character, and general  fitness standards under Sec. 1026.36(f)(3)(ii)(B) and comment  36(f)(3)(ii)(B)-1 and follows those written procedures for an individual  and complies with the requirement for that individual. Such procedures  may provide that bankruptcies and foreclosures are considered under the  financial responsibility standard only if they occurred within a recent  timeframe established in the procedures. Such procedures are not  required to include review of a credit score.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 36(f)(3)(iii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Training. The periodic training required in Sec.  1026.36(f)(3)(iii) must be sufficient in frequency, timing, duration,  and content to ensure that the individual loan originator has the  knowledge of State and Federal legal requirements that apply to the  individual loan   originator's loan origination activities. The training must take into  consideration the particular responsibilities of the individual loan  originator and the nature and complexity of the mortgage loans with  which the individual loan originator works. An individual loan  originator is not required to receive training on requirements and  standards that apply to types of mortgage loans that the individual loan  originator does not originate, or on subjects in which the individual  loan originator already has the necessary knowledge and skill. Training  may be delivered by the loan originator organization or any other person  and may utilize workstation, internet, teleconferencing, or other  interactive technologies and delivery methods. Training that a  government agency or housing finance agency has established for an  individual to originate mortgage loans under a program sponsored or  regulated by a Federal, State, or other government agency or housing  finance agency satisfies the requirement in Sec. 1026.36(f)(3)(iii), to  the extent that the training covers the types of loans the individual  loan originator originates and applicable Federal and State laws and  regulations. Training that the NMLSR has approved to meet the licensed  loan originator continuing education requirement at Sec. 1008.107(a)(2)  of this chapter satisfies the requirement of Sec. 1026.36(f)(3)(iii),  to the extent that the training covers the types of loans the individual  loan originator originates and applicable Federal and State laws and  regulations. The training requirements under Sec. 1026.36(f)(3)(iii)  apply to individual loan originators regardless of when they were hired.</p><p class="depth0">36(g) Name and NMLSR ID on Loan Documents</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 36(g)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. NMLSR ID. Section 1026.36(g) requires a loan originator  organization to include its name and NMLSR ID and the name and NMLSR ID  of the individual loan originator on certain loan documents. As provided  in Sec. 1026.36(a)(1), the term ``loan originator'' includes creditors  that engage in loan originator activities for purposes of this  requirement. Thus, for example, if an individual loan originator  employed by a bank originates a loan, the names and NMLSR IDs of the  individual and the bank must be included on covered loan documents. The  NMLSR ID is a number generally assigned by the NMLSR to individuals  registered or licensed through NMLSR to provide loan origination  services. For more information, see the SAFE Act sections 1503(3) and  (12) and 1504 (12 U.S.C. 5102(3) and (12) and 5103), and its  implementing regulations (12 CFR 1007.103(a) and 1008.103(a)(2)). A loan  originator organization may also have an NMLSR unique identifier.</p><p class="depth0">2. Loan originators without NMLSR IDs. An NMLSR ID is not required  by Sec. 1026.36(g) to be included on loan documents if the loan  originator is not required to obtain and has not been issued an NMLSR  ID. For example, certain loan originator organizations and individual  loan originators who are employees of bona fide nonprofit organizations  may not be required to obtain a unique identifier under State law.  However, some loan originators may have obtained NMLSR IDs, even if they  are not required to have one for their current jobs. If a loan  originator organization or an individual loan originator has been  provided a unique identifier by the NMLSR, it must be included on the  covered loan documents, regardless of whether the loan originator  organization or individual loan originator is required to obtain an  NMLSR unique identifier. In any event, the name of the loan originator  is required by Sec. 1026.36(g) to be included on the covered loan  documents.</p><p class="depth0">3. Inclusion of name and NMLSR ID. Section 1026.36(g)(1) requires  the inclusion of loan originator names and NMLSR IDs on each loan  document. Those items need not be included more than once on each loan  document on which loan originator names and NMLSR IDs are required, such  as by including them on every page of a document.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 36(g)(1)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Multiple individual loan originators. If more than one individual  meets the definition of a loan originator for a transaction, the name  and NMLSR ID of the individual loan originator with primary  responsibility for the transaction at the time the loan document is  issued must be included. A loan originator organization that establishes  and follows a reasonable, written policy for determining which  individual loan originator has primary responsibility for the  transaction at the time the document is issued complies with the  requirement. If the individual loan originator with primary  responsibility for a transaction at the time a document is issued is not  the same individual loan originator who had primary responsibility for  the transaction at the time that a previously issued document was  issued, the previously issued document is not required to be reissued  merely to change a loan originator name and NMLSR ID.</p><p class="depth0">36(i) Prohibition on financing credit insurance.</p><p class="depth0">1. Financing credit insurance premiums or fees. In the case of  single-premium credit insurance, a creditor violates Sec. 1026.36(i) by  adding the credit insurance premium or fee to the amount owed by the  consumer at closing. In the case of monthly-pay credit insurance, a  creditor violates Sec. 1026.36(i) if, upon the close of the monthly  period in which the premium or fee is due, the creditor includes   the premium or fee in the amount owed by the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">36(k) Negative amortization counseling.</p><p class="depth0">36(k)(1) Counseling required.</p><p class="depth0">1. HUD-certified or -approved counselor or counseling organization.  For purposes of Sec. 1026.36(k), organizations or counselors certified  or approved by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development  (HUD) to provide the homeownership counseling required by Sec.  1026.36(k) include counselors and counseling organizations that are  certified or approved pursuant to section 106(e) of the Housing and  Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701x(e)) or 24 CFR part 214,  unless HUD determines otherwise.</p><p class="depth0">2. Homeownership counseling. The counseling required under Sec.  1026.36(k) must include information regarding the risks and consequences  of negative amortization.</p><p class="depth0">3. Documentation. Examples of documentation that demonstrate a  consumer has received the counseling required under Sec. 1026.36(k)  include a certificate of counseling, letter, or email from a HUD- certified or -approved counselor or counseling organization indicating  that the consumer has received homeownership counseling.</p><p class="depth0">4. Processing applications. Prior to receiving documentation that a  consumer has received the counseling required under Sec. 1026.36(k), a  creditor may not extend credit to a first-time borrower in connection  with a closed-end transaction secured by a dwelling that may result in  negative amortization, but may engage in other activities, such as  processing an application for such a transaction (by, for example,  ordering an appraisal or title search).</p><p class="depth0">36(k)(3) Steering prohibited.</p><p class="depth0">1. See comments 34(a)(5)(vi)-1 and -2 for guidance concerning  steering.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.39--Mortgage Transfer Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">39(a) Scope</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 39(a)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Covered persons. The disclosure requirements of this section  apply to any ``covered person'' that becomes the legal owner of an  existing mortgage loan, whether through a purchase, or other transfer or  assignment, regardless of whether the person also meets the definition  of a ``creditor'' in Regulation Z. The fact that a person purchases or  acquires mortgage loans and provides the disclosures under this section  does not by itself make that person a ``creditor'' as defined in the  regulation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Acquisition of legal title. To become a ``covered person''  subject to this section, a person must become the owner of an existing  mortgage loan by acquiring legal title to the debt obligation.</p><p class="depth0">i. Partial interest. A person may become a covered person by  acquiring a partial interest in the mortgage loan. If the original  creditor transfers a partial interest in the loan to one or more  persons, all such transferees are covered persons under this section.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Joint acquisitions. All persons that jointly acquire legal title  to the loan are covered persons under this section, and under Sec.  1026.39(b)(5), a single disclosure must be provided on behalf of all  such covered persons. Multiple persons are deemed to jointly acquire  legal title to the loan if each acquires a partial interest in the loan  pursuant to the same agreement or by otherwise acting in concert. See  comments 39(b)(5)-1 and 39(d)(1)(ii)-1 regarding the disclosure  requirements for multiple persons that jointly acquire a loan.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Affiliates. An acquiring party that is a separate legal entity  from the transferor must provide the disclosures required by this  section even if the parties are affiliated entities.</p><p class="depth0">3. Exclusions. i. Beneficial interest. Section 1026.39 does not  apply to a party that acquires only a beneficial interest or a security  interest in the loan, or to a party that assumes the credit risk without  acquiring legal title to the loan. For example, an investor that  acquires mortgage-backed securities, pass-through certificates, or  participation interests and does not acquire legal title in the  underlying mortgage loans is not covered by this section.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Loan servicers. Pursuant to TILA Section 131(f)(2), the servicer  of a mortgage loan is not the owner of the obligation for purposes of  this section if the servicer holds title to the loan as a result of the  assignment of the obligation to the servicer solely for the  administrative convenience of the servicer in servicing the obligation.</p><p class="depth0">4. Mergers, corporate acquisitions, or reorganizations. Disclosures  are required under this section when, as a result of a merger, corporate  acquisition, or reorganization, the ownership of a mortgage loan is  transferred to a different legal entity.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 39(a)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Mortgage transactions covered. Section 1026.39 applies to closed- end or open-end consumer credit transactions secured by the principal  dwelling of a consumer.</p><p class="depth0">39(b) Disclosure Required</p><p class="depth0">1. Generally. A covered person must mail or deliver the disclosures  required by this section on or before the 30th calendar day following  the date of transfer, unless an exception in Sec. 1026.39(c) applies.  For example, if a covered person acquires a mortgage loan on March 15,  the disclosure must be mailed or delivered on or before April 14.</p><p class="depth0">39(b)(1) Form of Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Combining disclosures. The disclosures under this section can be  combined with other materials or disclosures, including the transfer of  servicing notices required by the Real Estate Settlement Procedure Act  (12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.) so long as the combined disclosure satisfies  the timing and other requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0">39(b)(4) Multiple Transfers</p><p class="depth0">1. Single disclosure for multiple transfers. A mortgage loan might  be acquired by a covered person and subsequently transferred to another  entity that is also a covered person required to provide the disclosures  under this section. In such cases, a single disclosure may be provided  on behalf of both covered persons instead of providing two separate  disclosures if the disclosure satisfies the timing and content  requirements applicable to each covered person. For example, if a  covered person acquires a loan on March 15 with the intent to assign the  loan to another entity on April 30, the covered person could mail the  disclosure on or before April 14 to provide the required information for  both entities and indicate when the subsequent transfer is expected to  occur.</p><p class="depth0">2. Estimating the date. When a covered person provides the  disclosure required by this section that also describes a subsequent  transfer, the date of the subsequent transfer may be estimated when the  exact date is unknown at the time the disclosure is made. Information is  unknown if it is not reasonably available to the covered person at the  time the disclosure is made. The ``reasonably available'' standard  requires that the covered person, acting in good faith, exercise due  diligence in obtaining information. The covered person normally may rely  on the representations of other parties in obtaining information. The  covered person might make the disclosure using an estimated date even  though the covered person knows that more precise information will be  available in the future. For example, a covered person may provide a  disclosure on March 31 stating that it acquired the loan on March 15 and  that a transfer to another entity is expected to occur ``on or around''  April 30, even if more precise information will be available by April  14.</p><p class="depth0">3. Duty to comply. Even though one covered person provides the  disclosures for another covered person, each has a duty to ensure that  disclosures related to its acquisition are accurate and provided in a  timely manner unless an exception in Sec. 1026.39(c) applies.</p><p class="depth0">39(b)(5) Multiple Covered Person</p><p class="depth0">1. Single disclosure required. If multiple covered persons jointly  acquire the loan, a single disclosure must be provided on behalf of all  covered persons instead of providing separate disclosures. See comment  39(a)(1)-2.ii regarding a joint acquisition of legal title, and comment  39(d)(1)(ii)-1 regarding the disclosure requirements for multiple  persons that jointly acquire a loan. If multiple covered persons jointly  acquire the loan and complete the acquisition on separate dates, a  single disclosure must be provided on behalf of all persons on or before  the 30th day following the earliest acquisition date. For examples, if  covered persons A and B enter into an agreement with the original  creditor to jointly acquire the loan, and complete the acquisition on  March 15 and March 25, respectively, a single disclosure must be  provided on behalf of both persons on or before April 14. If the two  acquisition dates are more than 30 days apart, a single disclosure must  be provided on behalf of both persons on or before the 30th day  following the earlier acquisition date, even though one person has not  completed its acquisition. See comment 39(b)(4)-2 regarding use of an  estimated date of transfer.</p><p class="depth0">2. Single disclosure not required. If multiple covered persons each  acquire a partial interest in the loan pursuant to separate and  unrelated agreements and not jointly, each covered person has a duty to  ensure that disclosures related to its acquisition are accurate and  provided in a timely manner unless an exception in Sec. 1026.39(c)  applies. The parties may, but are not required to, provide a single  disclosure that satisfies the timing and content requirements applicable  to each covered person.</p><p class="depth0">3. Timing requirements. A single disclosure provided on behalf of  multiple covered persons must satisfy the timing and content  requirements applicable to each covered person unless an exception in  Sec. 1026.39(c) applies.</p><p class="depth0">4. Duty to comply. Even though one covered person provides the  disclosures for another covered person, each has a duty to ensure that  disclosures related to its acquisition are accurate and provided in a  timely manner unless an exception in Sec. 1026.39(c) applies. See  comments 39(c)(1)-2, 39(c)(3)-1 and 39(c)(3)-2 regarding transfers of a  partial interest in the mortgage loan.</p><p class="depth0">39(c) Exceptions</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 39(c)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Transfer of all interest. A covered person is not required to  provide the disclosures required by this section if it sells, assigns or  otherwise transfers all of its interest in the mortgage loan on or  before the 30th calendar day following the date that it acquired the  loan. For example, if covered person A acquires the loan on March 15 and  subsequently transfers all of its interest in the loan to covered person  B on April 1, person A is not required to provide the disclosures  required by this section. Person B, however, must provide the  disclosures required by this   section unless an exception in Sec. 1026.39(c) applies.</p><p class="depth0">2. Transfer of partial interests. A covered person that subsequently  transfers a partial interest in the loan is required to provide the  disclosures required by this section if the covered person retains a  partial interest in the loan on the 30th calendar day after it acquired  the loan, unless an exception in Sec. 1026.39(c) applies. For example,  if covered person A acquires the loan on March 15 and subsequently  transfers fifty percent of its interest in the loan to covered person B  on April 1, person A is required to provide the disclosures under this  section if it retains a partial interest in the loan on April 14. Person  B in this example must also provide the disclosures required under this  section unless an exception in Sec. 1026.39(c) applies. Either person A  or person B could provide the disclosure on behalf of both of them if  the disclosure satisfies the timing and content requirements applicable  to each of them. In this example, a single disclosure for both covered  persons would have to be provided on or before April 14 to satisfy the  timing requirements for person A's acquisition of the loan on March 15.  See comment 39(b)(4)-1 regarding a single disclosure for multiple  transfers.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 39(c)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Repurchase agreements. The original creditor or owner of the  mortgage loan might sell, assign or otherwise transfer legal title to  the loan to secure temporary business financing under an agreement that  obligates the original creditor or owner to repurchase the loan. The  covered person that acquires the loan in connection with such a  repurchase agreement is not required to provide disclosures under this  section. However, if the transferor does not repurchase the mortgage  loan, the acquiring party must provide the disclosures required by this  section within 30 days after the date that the transaction is recognized  as an acquisition on its books and records.</p><p class="depth0">2. Intermediary parties. The exception in Sec. 1026.39(c)(2)  applies regardless of whether the repurchase arrangement involves an  intermediary party. For example, legal title to the loan may transfer  from the original creditor to party A through party B as an  intermediary. If the original creditor is obligated to repurchase the  loan, neither party A nor party B is required to provide the disclosures  under this section. However, if the original creditor does not  repurchase the loan, party A must provide the disclosures required by  this section within 30 days after the date that the transaction is  recognized as an acquisition on its books and records unless another  exception in Sec. 1026.39(c) applies.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 39(c)(3)</p><p class="depth0">1. Acquisition of partial interests. This exception applies if the  covered person acquires only a partial interest in the loan, and there  is no change in the agent or person authorized to receive notice of the  right to rescind and resolve issues concerning the consumer's payments.  If, as a result of the transfer of a partial interest in the loan, a  different agent or party is authorized to receive notice of the right to  rescind and resolve issues concerning the consumer's payments, the  disclosures under this section must be provided.</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples. i. A covered person is not required to provide the  disclosures under this section if it acquires a partial interest in the  loan from the original creditor who remains authorized to receive the  notice of the right to rescind and resolve issues concerning the  consumer's payments after the transfer.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The original creditor transfers fifty percent of its interest in  the loan to covered person A. Person A does not provide the disclosures  under this section because the exception in Sec. 1026.39(c)(3) applies.  The creditor then transfers the remaining fifty percent of its interest  in the loan to covered person B and does not retain any interest in the  loan. Person B must provide the disclosures under this section.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The original creditor transfers fifty percent of its interest  in the loan to covered person A and also authorizes party X as its agent  to receive notice of the right to rescind and resolve issues concerning  the consumer's payments on the loan. Since there is a change in an agent  or party authorized to receive notice of the right to rescind and  resolve issues concerning the consumer's payments, person A is required  to provide the disclosures under this section. Person A then transfers  all of its interest in the loan to covered person B. Person B is not  required to provide the disclosures under this section if the original  creditor retains a partial interest in the loan and party X retains the  same authority.</p><p class="depth0">iv. The original creditor transfers all of its interest in the loan  to covered person A. Person A provides the disclosures under this  section and notifies the consumer that party X is authorized to receive  notice of the right to rescind and resolve issues concerning the  consumer's payments on the loan. Person A then transfers fifty percent  of its interest in the loan to covered person B. Person B is not  required to provide the disclosures under this section if person A  retains a partial interest in the loan and party X retains the same  authority.</p><p class="depth0">39(d) Content of Required Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Identifying the loan. The disclosures required by this section  must identify the loan that was acquired or transferred. The covered  person has flexibility in determining   what information to provide for this purpose and may use any information  that would reasonably inform a consumer which loan was acquired or  transferred. For example, the covered person may identify the loan by  stating:</p><p class="depth0">i. The address of the mortgaged property along with the account  number or loan number previously disclosed to the consumer, which may  appear in a truncated format;</p><p class="depth0">ii. The account number alone, or other identifying number, if that  number has been previously provided to the consumer, such as on a  statement that the consumer receives monthly; or</p><p class="depth0">iii. The date on which the credit was extended and the original  amount of the loan or credit line.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 39(d)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. Identification of covered person. Section 1026.39(d)(1) requires  a covered person to provide its name, address, and telephone number. The  party identified must be the covered person who owns the mortgage loan,  regardless of whether another party services the loan or is the covered  person's agent. In addition to providing its name, address and telephone  number, the covered person may, at its option, provide an address for  receiving electronic mail or an Internet Web site address, but is not  required to do so.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 39(d)(1)(i)</p><p class="depth0">1. Multiple transfers, single disclosure. If a mortgage loan is  acquired by a covered person and subsequently transferred to another  covered person, a single disclosure may be provided on behalf of both  covered persons instead of providing two separate disclosures as long as  the disclosure satisfies the timing and content requirements applicable  to each covered person. See comment 39(b)(4)-1 regarding multiple  transfers. A single disclosure for multiple transfers must state the  name, address, and telephone number of each covered person unless Sec.  1026.39(d)(1)(ii) applies.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 39(d)(1)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Multiple covered persons, single disclosure. If multiple covered  persons jointly acquire the loan, a single disclosure must be provided  on behalf of all covered persons instead of providing separate  disclosures. The single disclosure must provide the name, address, and  telephone number of each covered person unless Sec. 1026.39(d)(1)(ii)  applies and one of the covered persons has been authorized in accordance  with Sec. 1026.39(d)(3) of this section to receive the consumer's  notice of the right to rescind and resolve issues concerning the  consumer's payments on the loan. In such cases, the information required  by Sec. 1026.39(d)(1) may be provided only for that covered person.</p><p class="depth0">2. Multiple covered persons, multiple disclosures. If multiple  covered persons each acquire a partial interest in the loan in separate  transactions and not jointly, each covered person must comply with the  disclosure requirements of this section unless an exception in Sec.  1026.39(c) applies. See comment 39(a)(1)-2.ii regarding a joint  acquisition of legal title, and comment 39(b)(5)-2 regarding the  disclosure requirements for multiple covered persons.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 39(d)(3)</p><p class="depth0">1. Identifying agents. Under Sec. 1026.39(d)(3), the covered person  must provide the name, address and telephone number for the agent or  other party having authority to receive the notice of the right to  rescind and resolve issues concerning the consumer's payments on the  loan. If multiple persons are identified under this paragraph, the  disclosure shall provide the name, address and telephone number for each  and indicate the extent to which the authority of each person differs.  Section 1026.39(d)(3) does not require that a covered person designate  an agent or other party, but if the consumer cannot contact the covered  person for these purposes, the disclosure must provide the name, address  and telephone number for an agent or other party that can address these  matters. If an agent or other party is authorized to receive the notice  of the right to rescind and resolve issues concerning the consumer's  payments on the loan, the disclosure can state that the consumer may  contact that agent regarding any questions concerning the consumer's  account without specifically mentioning rescission or payment issues.  However, if multiple agents are listed on the disclosure, the disclosure  shall state the extent to which the authority of each agent differs by  indicating if only one of the agents is authorized to receive notice of  the right to rescind, or only one of the agents is authorized to resolve  issues concerning payments.</p><p class="depth0">2. Other contact information. The covered person may also provide an  agent's electronic mail address or Internet Web site address, but is not  required to do so.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 39(d)(4)</p><p class="depth0">1. Where recorded. Section 1026.39(d)(4) requires the covered person  to disclose where transfer of ownership of the debt to the covered  person is recorded if it has been recorded in public records.  Alternatively, the disclosure can state that the transfer of ownership  of the debt has not been recorded in public records at the time the  disclosure is provided, if that is the case, or the disclosure can state  where the transfer may later be recorded. An exact address is not  required and it would be sufficient, for example, to state that the  transfer of ownership is recorded in   the office of public land records or the recorder of deeds office for  the county or local jurisdiction where the property is located.</p><p class="depth0">39(e) Optional Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Generally. Section 1026.39(e) provides that covered persons may,  at their option, include additional information about the mortgage  transaction that they consider relevant or helpful to consumers. For  example, the covered person may choose to inform consumers that the  location where they should send mortgage payments has not changed. See  comment 39(b)(1)-1 regarding combined disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.40--Requirements for Home-Equity Plans</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. This section applies to all open-end credit plans  secured by the consumer's dwelling, as defined in Sec. 1026.2(a)(19),  and is not limited to plans secured by the consumer's principal  dwelling. (See the commentary to Sec. 1026.3(a), which discusses  whether transactions are consumer or business-purpose credit, for  guidance on whether a home equity plan is subject to Regulation Z.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Changes to home equity plans entered into on or after November 7,  1989. Section 1026.9(c) applies if, by written agreement under Sec.  1026.40(f)(3)(iii), a creditor changes the terms of a home equity plan-- entered into on or after November 7, 1989--at or before its scheduled  expiration, for example, by renewing a plan on different terms. A new  plan results, however, if the plan is renewed (with or without changes  to the terms) after the scheduled expiration. The new plan is subject to  all open-end credit rules, including Sec. Sec. 1026.6, 1026.15, and  1026.40.</p><p class="depth0">3. Transition rules and renewals of preexisting plans. The  requirements of this section do not apply to home equity plans entered  into before November 7, 1989. The requirements of this section also do  not apply if the original consumer, on or after November 7, 1989, renews  a plan entered into prior to that date (with or without changes to the  terms). If, on or after November 7, 1989, a security interest in the  consumer's dwelling is added to a line of credit entered into before  that date, the substantive restrictions of this section apply for the  remainder of the plan, but no new disclosures are required under this  section.</p><p class="depth0">4. Disclosure of repayment phase--applicability of requirements.  Some plans provide in the initial agreement for a period during which no  further draws may be taken and repayment of the amount borrowed is made.  All of the applicable disclosures in this section must be given for the  repayment phase. Thus, for example, a creditor must provide payment  information about the repayment phase as well as about the draw period,  as required by Sec. 1026.40(d)(5). If the rate that will apply during  the repayment phase is fixed at a known amount, the creditor must  provide an annual percentage rate under Sec. 1026.40(d)(6) for that  phase. If, however, a creditor uses an index to determine the rate that  will apply at the time of conversion to the repayment phase--even if the  rate will thereafter be fixed--the creditor must provide the information  in Sec. 1026.40(d)(12), as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">5. Payment terms--applicability of closed-end provisions and  substantive rules. All payment terms that are provided for in the  initial agreement are subject to the requirements of subpart B and not  subpart C of the regulation. Payment terms that are subsequently added  to the agreement may be subject to subpart B or to subpart C, depending  on the circumstances. The following examples apply these general rules  to different situations:</p><p class="depth0">i. If the initial agreement provides for a repayment phase or for  other payment terms such as options permitting conversion of part or all  of the balance to a fixed rate during the draw period, these terms must  be disclosed pursuant to Sec. Sec. 1026.6 and 1026.40, and not under  subpart C. Furthermore, the creditor must continue to provide periodic  statements under Sec. 1026.7 and comply with other provisions of  subpart B (such as the substantive requirements of Sec. 1026.40(f))  throughout the plan, including the repayment phase.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the consumer and the creditor enter into an agreement during  the draw period to repay all or part of the principal balance on  different terms (for example, with a fixed rate of interest) and the  amount of available credit will be replenished as the principal balance  is repaid, the creditor must continue to comply with subpart B. For  example, the creditor must continue to provide periodic statements and  comply with the substantive requirements of Sec. 1026.40(f) throughout  the plan.</p><p class="depth0">iii. If the consumer and creditor enter into an agreement during the  draw period to repay all or part of the principal balance and the amount  of available credit will not be replenished as the principal balance is  repaid, the creditor must give closed-end credit disclosures pursuant to  subpart C for that new agreement. In such cases, subpart B, including  the substantive rules, does not apply to the closed-end credit  transaction, although it will continue to apply to any remaining open- end credit available under the plan.</p><p class="depth0">6. Spreader clause. When a creditor holds a mortgage or deed of  trust on the consumer's dwelling and that mortgage or deed of trust  contains a spreader clause (also known as a dragnet or cross- collateralization clause), subsequent occurrences such as the opening of  an open-end plan are subject to the rules applicable to home equity  plans to the same degree as if a security interest were taken directly  to secure the plan, unless the creditor effectively waives its security  interest   under the spreader clause with respect to the subsequent open-end credit  extensions.</p><p class="depth0">7. Appraisals and other valuations. For consumer credit transactions  subject to Sec. 1026.40 and secured by the consumer's principal  dwelling, creditors and other persons must comply with the requirements  for appraisals and other valuations under Sec. 1026.42.</p><p class="depth0">40(a) Form of Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">40(a)(1) General</p><p class="depth0">1. Written disclosures. The disclosures required under this section  must be clear and conspicuous and in writing, but need not be in a form  the consumer can keep. (See the commentary to Sec. 1026.6(a)(3) for  special rules when disclosures required under Sec. 1026.40(d) are given  in a retainable form.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Disclosure of annual percentage rate--more conspicuous  requirement. As provided in Sec. 1026.5(a)(2), when the term annual  percentage rate is required to be disclosed with a number, it must be  more conspicuous than other required disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">3. Segregation of disclosures. i. While most of the disclosures must  be grouped together and segregated from all unrelated information, the  creditor is permitted to include information that explains or expands on  the required disclosures, including, for example:</p><p class="depth0">A. Any prepayment penalty.</p><p class="depth0">B. How a substitute index may be chosen.</p><p class="depth0">C. Actions the creditor may take short of terminating and  accelerating an outstanding balance.</p><p class="depth0">D. Renewal terms.</p><p class="depth0">E. Rebate of fees.</p><p class="depth0">ii. An example of information that does not explain or expand on the  required disclosures and thus cannot be included is the creditor's  underwriting criteria, although the creditor could provide such  information separately from the required disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">4. Method of providing disclosures. A creditor may provide a single  disclosure form for all of its home equity plans, as long as the  disclosure describes all aspects of the plans. For example, if the  creditor offers several payment options, all such options must be  disclosed. (See, however, the commentary to Sec. 1026.40(d)(5)(iii) and  (d)(12) (x) and (xi) for disclosure requirements relating to these  provisions.) If any aspects of a plan are linked together, the creditor  must disclose clearly the relationship of the terms to each other. For  example, if the consumer can only obtain a particular payment option in  conjunction with a certain variable-rate feature, this fact must be  disclosed. A creditor has the option of providing separate disclosure  forms for multiple options or variations in features. For example, a  creditor that offers different payment options for the draw period may  prepare separate disclosure forms for the two payment options. A  creditor using this alternative, however, must include a statement on  each disclosure form that the consumer should ask about the creditor's  other home equity programs. (This disclosure is required only for those  programs available generally to the public. Thus, if the only other  programs available are employee preferred-rate plans, for example, the  creditor would not have to provide this statement.) A creditor that  receives a request for information about other available programs must  provide the additional disclosures as soon as reasonably possible.</p><p class="depth0">5. Form of electronic disclosures provided on or with electronic  applications. Creditors must provide the disclosures required by this  section (including the brochure) on or with a blank application that is  made available to the consumer in electronic form, such as on a  creditor's Internet Web site. Creditors have flexibility in satisfying  this requirement. Methods creditors could use to satisfy the requirement  include, but are not limited to, the following examples (whatever method  is used, a creditor need not confirm that the consumer has read the  disclosures):</p><p class="depth0">i. The disclosures could automatically appear on the screen when the  application appears;</p><p class="depth0">ii. The disclosures could be located on the same Web page as the  application (whether or not they appear on the initial screen), if the  application contains a clear and conspicuous reference to the location  of the disclosures and indicates that the disclosures contain rate, fee,  and other cost information, as applicable;</p><p class="depth0">iii. Creditors could provide a link to the electronic disclosures on  or with the application as long as consumers cannot bypass the  disclosures before submitting the application. The link would take the  consumer to the disclosures, but the consumer need not be required to  scroll completely through the disclosures; or</p><p class="depth0">iv. The disclosures could be located on the same Web page as the  application without necessarily appearing on the initial screen,  immediately preceding the button that the consumer will click to submit  the application.</p><p class="depth0">40(a)(2) Precedence of Certain Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Precedence rule. The list of conditions provided at the  creditor's option under Sec. 1026.40(d)(4)(iii) need not precede the  other disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 40(a)(3)</p><p class="depth0">1. Form of disclosures. Whether disclosures must be in electronic  form depends upon the following:</p><p class="depth0">i. If a consumer accesses a home equity credit line application  electronically (other than as described under ii. below), such as online  at a home computer, the creditor must provide the disclosures in  electronic   form (such as with the application form on its Web site) in order to  meet the requirement to provide disclosures in a timely manner on or  with the application. If the creditor instead mailed paper disclosures  to the consumer, this requirement would not be met.</p><p class="depth0">ii. In contrast, if a consumer is physically present in the  creditor's office, and accesses a home equity credit line application  electronically, such as via a terminal or kiosk (or if the consumer uses  a terminal or kiosk located on the premises of an affiliate or third  party that has arranged with the creditor to provide applications to  consumers), the creditor may provide disclosures in either electronic or  paper form, provided the creditor complies with the timing, delivery,  and retainability requirements of the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">40(b) Time of Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Mail and telephone applications. If the creditor sends  applications through the mail, the disclosures and a brochure must  accompany the application. If an application is taken over the  telephone, the disclosures and brochure may be delivered or mailed  within three business days of taking the application. If an application  is mailed to the consumer following a telephone request, however, the  creditor also must send the disclosures and a brochure along with the  application.</p><p class="depth0">2. General purpose applications. The disclosures and a brochure need  not be provided when a general purpose application is given to a  consumer unless (1) the application or materials accompanying it  indicate that it can be used to apply for a home equity plan or (2) the  application is provided in response to a consumer's specific inquiry  about a home equity plan. On the other hand, if a general purpose  application is provided in response to a consumer's specific inquiry  only about credit other than a home equity plan, the disclosures and  brochure need not be provided even if the application indicates it can  be used for a home equity plan, unless it is accompanied by promotional  information about home equity plans.</p><p class="depth0">3. Publicly-available applications. Some creditors make applications  for home equity plans, such as take-ones, available without the need for  a consumer to request them. These applications must be accompanied by  the disclosures and a brochure, such as by attaching the disclosures and  brochure to the application form.</p><p class="depth0">4. Response cards. A creditor may solicit consumers for its home  equity plan by mailing a response card which the consumer returns to the  creditor to indicate interest in the plan. If the only action taken by  the creditor upon receipt of the response card is to send the consumer  an application form or to telephone the consumer to discuss the plan,  the creditor need not send the disclosures and brochure with the  response card.</p><p class="depth0">5. Denial or withdrawal of application. In situations where Sec.  1026.40(b) permits the creditor a three-day delay in providing  disclosures and the brochure, if the creditor determines within that  period that an application will not be approved, the creditor need not  provide the consumer with the disclosures or brochure. Similarly, if the  consumer withdraws the application within this three-day period, the  creditor need not provide the disclosures or brochure.</p><p class="depth0">6. Intermediary agent or broker. In determining whether or not an  application involves an intermediary agent or broker as discussed in  Sec. 1026.40(b), creditors should consult the provisions in comment  19(b)-3.</p><p class="depth0">40(c) Duties of Third Parties</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure requirements. Although third parties who give  applications to consumers for home equity plans must provide the  brochure required under Sec. 1026.40(e) in all cases, such persons need  provide the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.40(d) only in certain  instances. A third party has no duty to obtain disclosures about a  creditor's home equity plan or to create a set of disclosures based on  what it knows about a creditor's plan. If, however, a creditor provides  the third party with disclosures along with its application form, the  third party must give the disclosures to the consumer with the  application form. The duties under this section are those of the third  party; the creditor is not responsible for ensuring that a third party  complies with those obligations. If an intermediary agent or broker  takes an application over the telephone or receives an application  contained in a magazine or other publication, Sec. 1026.40(c) permits  that person to mail the disclosures and brochure within three business  days of receipt of the application. (See the commentary to Sec.  1026.40(h) about imposition of nonrefundable fees.)</p><p class="depth0">40(d) Content of Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosures given as applicable. The disclosures required under  this section need be made only as applicable. Thus, for example, if  negative amortization cannot occur in a home equity plan, a reference to  it need not be made.</p><p class="depth0">2. Duty to respond to requests for information. If the consumer,  prior to the opening of a plan, requests information as suggested in the  disclosures (such as the current index value or margin), the creditor  must provide this information as soon as reasonably possible after the  request.</p><p class="depth0">40(d)(1) Retention of Information</p><p class="depth0">1. When disclosure not required. The creditor need not disclose that  the consumer should   make or otherwise retain a copy of the disclosures if they are  retainable--for example, if the disclosures are not part of an  application that must be returned to the creditor to apply for the plan.</p><p class="depth0">40(d)(2) Conditions for Disclosed Terms</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 40(d)(2)(i)</p><p class="depth0">1. Guaranteed terms. The requirement that the creditor disclose the  time by which an application must be submitted to obtain the disclosed  terms does not require the creditor to guarantee any terms. If a  creditor chooses not to guarantee any terms, it must disclose that all  of the terms are subject to change prior to opening the plan. The  creditor also is permitted to guarantee some terms and not others, but  must indicate which terms are subject to change.</p><p class="depth0">2. Date for obtaining disclosed terms. The creditor may disclose  either a specific date or a time period for obtaining the disclosed  terms. If the creditor discloses a time period, the consumer must be  able to determine from the disclosure the specific date by which an  application must be submitted to obtain any guaranteed terms. For  example, the disclosure might read, ``To obtain the following terms, you  must submit your application within 60 days after the date appearing on  this disclosure,'' provided the disclosure form also shows the date.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 40(d)(2)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Relation to other provisions. Creditors should consult the rules  in Sec. 1026.40(g) regarding refund of fees.</p><p class="depth0">40(d)(4) Possible Actions by Creditor</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 40(d)(4)(i)</p><p class="depth0">1. Fees imposed upon termination. This disclosure applies only to  fees (such as penalty or prepayment fees) that the creditor imposes if  it terminates the plan prior to normal expiration. The disclosure does  not apply to fees that are imposed either when the plan expires in  accordance with the agreement or if the consumer terminates the plan  prior to its scheduled maturity. In addition, the disclosure does not  apply to fees associated with collection of the debt, such as attorneys  fees and court costs, or to increases in the annual percentage rate  linked to the consumer's failure to make payments. The actual amount of  the fee need not be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">2. Changes specified in the initial agreement. If changes may occur  pursuant to Sec. 1026.40(f)(3)(i), a creditor must state that certain  changes will be implemented as specified in the initial agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 40(d)(4)(iii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure of conditions. In making this disclosure, the creditor  may provide a highlighted copy of the document that contains such  information, such as the contract or security agreement. The relevant  items must be distinguished from the other information contained in the  document. For example, the creditor may provide a cover sheet that  specifically points out which contract provisions contain the  information, or may mark the relevant items on the document itself. As  an alternative to disclosing the conditions in this manner, the creditor  may simply describe the conditions using the language in Sec. Sec.  1026.40(f)(2)(i)-(iii), 1026.40(f)(3)(i) (regarding freezing the line  when the maximum annual percentage rate is reached), and  1026.40(f)(3)(vi) or language that is substantially similar. The  condition contained in Sec. 1026.40(f)(2)(iv) need not be stated. In  describing specified changes that may be implemented during the plan,  the creditor may provide a disclosure such as ``Our agreement permits us  to make certain changes to the terms of the line at specified times or  upon the occurrence of specified events.''</p><p class="depth0">2. Form of disclosure. The list of conditions under Sec.  1026.40(d)(4)(iii) may appear with the segregated disclosures or apart  from them. If the creditor elects to provide the list of conditions with  the segregated disclosures, the list need not comply with the precedence  rule in Sec. 1026.40(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0">40(d)(5) Payment Terms</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 40(d)(5)(i)</p><p class="depth0">1. Length of the plan. The combined length of the draw period and  any repayment period need not be stated. If the length of the repayment  phase cannot be determined because, for example, it depends on the  balance outstanding at the beginning of the repayment period, the  creditor must state that the length is determined by the size of the  balance. If the length of the plan is indefinite (for example, because  there is no time limit on the period during which the consumer can take  advances), the creditor must state that fact.</p><p class="depth0">2. Renewal provisions. If, under the credit agreement, a creditor  retains the right to review a line at the end of the specified draw  period and determine whether to renew or extend the draw period of the  plan, the possibility of renewal or extension--regardless of its  likelihood--should be ignored for purposes of the disclosures. For  example, if an agreement provides that the draw period is five years and  that the creditor may renew the draw period for an additional five  years, the possibility of renewal should be ignored and the draw period  should be considered five years. (See the commentary accompanying   Sec. 1026.9(c)(1) dealing with change in terms requirements.)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 40(d)(5)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Determination of the minimum periodic payment. This disclosure  must reflect how the minimum periodic payment is determined, but need  only describe the principal and interest components of the payment.  Other charges that may be part of the payment (as well as the balance  computation method) may, but need not, be described under this  provision.</p><p class="depth0">2. Fixed rate and term payment options during draw period. If the  home equity plan permits the consumer to repay all or part of the  balance during the draw period at a fixed rate (rather than a variable  rate) and over a specified time period, this feature must be disclosed.  To illustrate, a variable-rate plan may permit a consumer to elect  during a ten-year draw period to repay all or a portion of the balance  over a three-year period at a fixed rate. The creditor must disclose the  rules relating to this feature including the period during which the  option can be selected, the length of time over which repayment can  occur, any fees imposed for such a feature, and the specific rate or a  description of the index and margin that will apply upon exercise of  this choice. For example, the index and margin disclosure might state:  ``If you choose to convert any portion of your balance to a fixed rate,  the rate will be the highest prime rate published in the `Wall Street  Journal' that is in effect at the date of conversion plus a margin.'' If  the fixed rate is to be determined according to an index, it must be one  that is outside the creditor's control and is publicly available in  accordance with Sec. 1026.40(f)(1). The effect of exercising the option  should not be reflected elsewhere in the disclosures, such as in the  historical example required in Sec. 1026.40(d)(12)(xi).</p><p class="depth0">3. Balloon payments. In programs where the occurrence of a balloon  payment is possible, the creditor must disclose the possibility of a  balloon payment even if such a payment is uncertain or unlikely. In such  cases, the disclosure might read, ``Your minimum payments may not be  sufficient to fully repay the principal that is outstanding on your  line. If they are not, you will be required to pay the entire  outstanding balance in a single payment.'' In programs where a balloon  payment will occur, such as programs with interest-only payments during  the draw period and no repayment period, the disclosures must state that  fact. For example, the disclosure might read, ``Your minimum payments  will not repay the principal that is outstanding on your line. You will  be required to pay the entire outstanding balance in a single payment.''  In making this disclosure, the creditor is not required to use the term  ``balloon payment.'' The creditor also is not required to disclose the  amount of the balloon payment. (See, however, the requirement under  Sec. 1026.40(d)(5)(iii).) The balloon payment disclosure does not apply  in cases where repayment of the entire outstanding balance would occur  only as a result of termination and acceleration. The creditor also need  not make a disclosure about balloon payments if the final payment could  not be more than twice the amount of other minimum payments under the  plan.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 40(d)(5)(iii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Minimum periodic payment example. In disclosing the payment  example, the creditor may assume that the credit limit as well as the  outstanding balance is $10,000 if such an assumption is relevant to  calculating payments. (If the creditor only offers lines of credit for  less than $10,000, the creditor may assume an outstanding balance of  $5,000 instead of $10,000 in making this disclosure.) The example should  reflect the payment comprised only of principal and interest. Creditors  may provide an additional example reflecting other charges that may be  included in the payment, such as credit insurance premiums. Creditors  may assume that all months have an equal number of days, that payments  are collected in whole cents, and that payments will fall on a business  day even though they may be due on a non-business day. For variable-rate  plans, the example must be based on the last rate in the historical  example required in Sec. 1026.40(d)(12)(xi), or a more recent rate. In  cases where the last rate shown in the historical example is different  from the index value and margin (for example, due to a rate cap),  creditors should calculate the rate by using the index value and margin.  A discounted rate may not be considered a more recent rate in  calculating this payment example for either variable- or fixed-rate  plans.</p><p class="depth0">2. Representative examples. i. In plans with multiple payment  options within the draw period or within any repayment period, the  creditor may provide representative examples as an alternative to  providing examples for each payment option. The creditor may elect to  provide representative payment examples based on three categories of  payment options. The first category consists of plans that permit  minimum payment of only accrued finance charges (interest only plans).  The second category includes plans in which a fixed percentage or a  fixed fraction of the outstanding balance or credit limit (for example,  2% of the balance or 1/180th of the balance) is used to determine the  minimum payment. The third category includes all other types of minimum  payment options, such as a specified dollar amount plus any accrued  finance charges. Creditors may classify their minimum payment  arrangements   within one of these three categories even if other features exist, such  as varying lengths of a draw or repayment period, required payment of  past due amounts, late charges, and minimum dollar amounts. The creditor  may use a single example within each category to represent the payment  options in that category. For example, if a creditor permits minimum  payments of 1%, 2%, 3% or 4% of the outstanding balance, it may pick one  of these four options and provide the example required under Sec.  1026.40(d)(5)(iii) for that option alone.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The example used to represent a category must be an option  commonly chosen by consumers, or a typical or representative example.  (See the commentary to Sec. 1026.40(d)(12)(x) and (xi) for a discussion  of the use of representative examples for making those disclosures.  Creditors using a representative example within each category must use  the same example for purposes of the disclosures under Sec.  1026.40(d)(5)(iii) and (d)(12)(x) and (xi).) Creditors may use  representative examples under Sec. 1026.40(d)(5) only with respect to  the payment example required under paragraph (d)(5)(iii). Creditors must  provide a full narrative description of all payment options under Sec.  1026.40(d)(5)(i) and (ii).</p><p class="depth0">3. Examples for draw and repayment periods. Separate examples must  be given for the draw and repayment periods unless the payments are  determined the same way during both periods. In setting forth payment  examples for any repayment period under this section (and the historical  example under Sec. 1026.40(d)(12)(xi)), creditors should assume a  $10,000 advance is taken at the beginning of the draw period and is  reduced according to the terms of the plan. Creditors should not assume  an additional advance is taken at any time, including at the beginning  of any repayment period.</p><p class="depth0">4. Reverse mortgages. Reverse mortgages, also known as reverse  annuity or home equity conversion mortgages, in addition to permitting  the consumer to obtain advances, may involve the disbursement of monthly  advances to the consumer for a fixed period or until the occurrence of  an event such as the consumer's death. Repayment of the reverse mortgage  (generally a single payment of principal and accrued interest) may be  required to be made at the end of the disbursements or, for example,  upon the death of the consumer. In disclosing these plans, creditors  must apply the following rules, as applicable:</p><p class="depth0">i. If the reverse mortgage has a specified period for advances and  disbursements but repayment is due only upon occurrence of a future  event such as the death of the consumer, the creditor must assume that  disbursements will be made until they are scheduled to end. The creditor  must assume repayment will occur when disbursements end (or within a  period following the final disbursement which is not longer than the  regular interval between disbursements). This assumption should be used  even though repayment may occur before or after the disbursements are  scheduled to end. In such cases, the creditor may include a statement  such as ``The disclosures assume that you will repay the line at the  time the draw period and our payments to you end. As provided in your  agreement, your repayment may be required at a different time.'' The  single payment should be considered the ``minimum periodic payment'' and  consequently would not be treated as a balloon payment. The example of  the minimum payment under Sec. 1026.40(d)(5)(iii) should assume a  single $10,000 draw.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the reverse mortgage has neither a specified period for  advances or disbursements nor a specified repayment date and these terms  will be determined solely by reference to future events, including the  consumer's death, the creditor may assume that the draws and  disbursements will end upon the consumer's death (estimated by using  actuarial tables, for example) and that repayment will be required at  the same time (or within a period following the date of the final  disbursement which is not longer than the regular interval for  disbursements). Alternatively, the creditor may base the disclosures  upon another future event it estimates will be most likely to occur  first. (If terms will be determined by reference to future events which  do not include the consumer's death, the creditor must base the  disclosures upon the occurrence of the event estimated to be most likely  to occur first.)</p><p class="depth0">iii. In making the disclosures, the creditor must assume that all  draws and disbursements and accrued interest will be paid by the  consumer. For example, if the note has a non-recourse provision  providing that the consumer is not obligated for an amount greater than  the value of the house, the creditor must nonetheless assume that the  full amount to be drawn or disbursed will be repaid. In this case,  however, the creditor may include a statement such as ``The disclosures  assume full repayment of the amount advanced plus accrued interest,  although the amount you may be required to pay is limited by your  agreement.''</p><p class="depth0">iv. Some reverse mortgages provide that some or all of the  appreciation in the value of the property will be shared between the  consumer and the creditor. The creditor must disclose the appreciation  feature, including describing how the creditor's share will be  determined, any limitations, and when the feature may be exercised.</p><p class="depth0">40(d)(6) Annual Percentage Rate</p><p class="depth0">1. Preferred-rate plans. If a creditor offers a preferential fixed- rate plan in which the rate   will increase a specified amount upon the occurrence of a specified  event, the creditor must disclose the specific amount the rate will  increase.</p><p class="depth0">40(d)(7) Fees Imposed by Creditor</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicability. The fees referred to in Sec. 1026.40(d)(7)  include items such as application fees, points, annual fees, transaction  fees, fees to obtain checks to access the plan, and fees imposed for  converting to a repayment phase that is provided for in the original  agreement. This disclosure includes any fees that are imposed by the  creditor to use or maintain the plan, whether the fees are kept by the  creditor or a third party. For example, if a creditor requires an annual  credit report on the consumer and requires the consumer to pay this fee  to the creditor or directly to the third party, the fee must be  specifically stated. Third party fees to open the plan that are  initially paid by the consumer to the creditor may be included in this  disclosure or in the disclosure under Sec. 1026.40(d)(8).</p><p class="depth0">2. Manner of describing fees. Charges may be stated as an estimated  dollar amount for each fee, or as a percentage of a typical or  representative amount of credit. The creditor may provide a stepped fee  schedule in which a fee will increase a specified amount at a specified  date. (See the discussion contained in the commentary to Sec.  1026.40(f)(3)(i).)</p><p class="depth0">3. Fees not required to be disclosed. Fees that are not imposed to  open, use, or maintain a plan, such as fees for researching an account,  photocopying, paying late, stopping payment, having a check returned,  exceeding the credit limit, or closing out an account do not have to be  disclosed under this section. Credit report and appraisal fees imposed  to investigate whether a condition permitting a freeze continues to  exist--as discussed in the commentary to Sec. 1026.40(f)(3)(vi)--are  not required to be disclosed under this section or Sec. 1026.40(d)(8).</p><p class="depth0">4. Rebates of closing costs. If closing costs are imposed they must  be disclosed, regardless of whether such costs may be rebated later (for  example, rebated to the extent of any interest paid during the first  year of the plan).</p><p class="depth0">5. Terms used in disclosure. Creditors need not use the terms  finance charge or other charge in describing the fees imposed by the  creditor under this section or those imposed by third parties under  Sec. 1026.40(d)(8).</p><p class="depth0">40(d)(8) Fees Imposed by Third Parties to Open a Plan</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicability. Section 1026.40(d)(8) applies only to fees imposed  by third parties to open the plan. Thus, for example, this section does  not require disclosure of a fee imposed by a government agency at the  end of a plan to release a security interest. Fees to be disclosed  include appraisal, credit report, government agency, and attorneys fees.  In cases where property insurance is required by the creditor, the  creditor either may disclose the amount of the premium or may state that  property insurance is required. For example, the disclosure might state,  ``You must carry insurance on the property that secures this plan.''</p><p class="depth0">2. Itemization of third-party fees. In all cases creditors must  state the total of third-party fees as a single dollar amount or a range  except that the total need not include costs for property insurance if  the creditor discloses that such insurance is required. A creditor has  two options with regard to providing the more detailed information about  third party fees. Creditors may provide a statement that the consumer  may request more specific cost information about third party fees from  the creditor. As an alternative to including this statement, creditors  may provide an itemization of such fees (by type and amount) with the  early disclosures. Any itemization provided upon the consumer's request  need not include a disclosure about property insurance.</p><p class="depth0">3. Manner of describing fees. A good faith estimate of the amount of  fees must be provided. Creditors may provide, based on a typical or  representative amount of credit, a range for such fees or state the  dollar amount of such fees. Fees may be expressed on a unit cost basis,  for example, $5 per $1,000 of credit.</p><p class="depth0">4. Rebates of third party fees. Even if fees imposed by third  parties may be rebated, they must be disclosed. (See the commentary to  Sec. 1026.40(d)(7).)</p><p class="depth0">40(d)(9) Negative Amortization</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure required. In transactions where the minimum payment  will not or may not be sufficient to cover the interest that accrues on  the outstanding balance, the creditor must disclose that negative  amortization will or may occur. This disclosure is required whether or  not the unpaid interest is added to the outstanding balance upon which  interest is computed. A disclosure is not required merely because a loan  calls for non-amortizing or partially amortizing payments.</p><p class="depth0">40(d)(10) Transaction Requirements</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicability. A limitation on automated teller machine usage  need not be disclosed under this paragraph unless that is the only means  by which the consumer can obtain funds.</p><p class="depth0">40(d)(12) Disclosures for Variable-Rate Plans</p><p class="depth0">1. Variable-rate provisions. Sample forms in appendix G-14 provide  illustrative guidance on the variable-rate rules.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 40(d)(12)(iv)</p><p class="depth0">1. Determination of annual percentage rate. If the creditor adjusts  its index through the addition of a margin, the disclosure might read,  ``Your annual percentage rate is based on the index plus a margin.'' The  creditor is not required to disclose a specific value for the margin.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 40(d)(12)(viii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Preferred-rate provisions. This paragraph requires disclosure of  preferred-rate provisions, where the rate will increase upon the  occurrence of some event, such as the borrower-employee leaving the  creditor's employ or the consumer closing an existing deposit account  with the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">2. Provisions on conversion to fixed rates. The commentary to Sec.  1026.40(d)(5)(ii) discusses the disclosure requirements for options  permitting the consumer to convert from a variable rate to a fixed rate.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 40(d)(12)(ix)</p><p class="depth0">1. Periodic limitations on increases in rates. The creditor must  disclose any annual limitations on increases in the annual percentage  rate. If the creditor bases its rate limitation on 12 monthly billing  cycles, such a limitation should be treated as an annual cap. Rate  limitations imposed on less than an annual basis must be stated in terms  of a specific amount of time. For example, if the creditor imposes rate  limitations on only a semiannual basis, this must be expressed as a rate  limitation for a six-month time period. If the creditor does not impose  periodic limitations (annual or shorter) on rate increases, the fact  that there are no annual rate limitations must be stated.</p><p class="depth0">2. Maximum limitations on increases in rates. The maximum annual  percentage rate that may be imposed under each payment option over the  term of the plan (including the draw period and any repayment period  provided for in the initial agreement) must be provided. The creditor  may disclose this rate as a specific number (for example, 18%) or as a  specific amount above the initial rate. For example, this disclosure  might read, ``The maximum annual percentage rate that can apply to your  line will be 5 percentage points above your initial rate.'' If the  creditor states the maximum rate as a specific amount above the initial  rate, the creditor must include a statement that the consumer should  inquire about the rate limitations that are currently available. If an  initial discount is not taken into account in applying maximum rate  limitations, that fact must be disclosed. If separate overall  limitations apply to rate increases resulting from events such as the  exercise of a fixed-rate conversion option or leaving the creditor's  employ, those limitations also must be stated. Limitations do not  include legal limits in the nature of usury or rate ceilings under state  or Federal statutes or regulations.</p><p class="depth0">3. Form of disclosures. The creditor need not disclose each periodic  or maximum rate limitation that is currently available. Instead, the  creditor may disclose the range of the lowest and highest periodic and  maximum rate limitations that may be applicable to the creditor's home  equity plans. Creditors using this alternative must include a statement  that the consumer should inquire about the rate limitations that are  currently available.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 40(d)(12)(x)</p><p class="depth0">1. Maximum rate payment example. In calculating the payment  creditors should assume the maximum rate is in effect. Any discounted or  premium initial rates or periodic rate limitations should be ignored for  purposes of this disclosure. If a range is used to disclose the maximum  cap under Sec. 1026.40(d)(12)(ix), the highest rate in the range must  be used for the disclosure under this paragraph. As an alternative to  making disclosures based on each payment option, the creditor may choose  a representative example within the three categories of payment options  upon which to base this disclosure. (See the commentary to Sec.  1026.40(d)(5).) However, separate examples must be provided for the draw  period and for any repayment period unless the payment is determined the  same way in both periods. Creditors should calculate the example for the  repayment period based on an assumed $10,000 balance. (See the  commentary to Sec. 1026.40(d)(5) for a discussion of the circumstances  in which a creditor may use a lower outstanding balance.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Time the maximum rate could be reached. In stating the date or  time when the maximum rate could be reached, creditors should assume the  rate increases as rapidly as possible under the plan. In calculating the  date or time, creditors should factor in any discounted or premium  initial rates and periodic rate limitations. This disclosure must be  provided for the draw phase and any repayment phase. Creditors should  assume the index and margin shown in the last year of the historical  example (or a more recent rate) is in effect at the beginning of each  phase.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 40(d)(12)(xi)</p><p class="depth0">1. Index movement. Index values and annual percentage rates must be  shown for the entire 15 years of the historical example and must be  based on the most recent 15 years. The example must be updated annually  to reflect the most recent 15 years of index values as soon as  reasonably possible after the new index value becomes available. If the  values for an index have not been available for 15 years, a creditor  need only go back as far as   the values have been available and may start the historical example at  the year for which values are first available.</p><p class="depth0">2. Selection of index values. The historical example must reflect  the method of choosing index values for the plan. For example, if an  average of index values is used in the plan, averages must be used in  the example, but if an index value as of a particular date is used, a  single index value must be shown. The creditor is required to assume one  date (or one period, if an average is used) within a year on which to  base the history of index values. The creditor may choose to use index  values as of any date or period as long as the index value as of this  date or period is used for each year in the example. Only one index  value per year need be shown, even if the plan provides for adjustments  to the annual percentage rate or payment more than once in a year. In  such cases, the creditor can assume that the index rate remained  constant for the full year for the purpose of calculating the annual  percentage rate and payment.</p><p class="depth0">3. Selection of margin. A value for the margin must be assumed in  order to prepare the example. A creditor may select a representative  margin that it has used with the index during the six months preceding  preparation of the disclosures and state that the margin is one that it  has used recently. The margin selected may be used until the creditor  annually updates the disclosure form to reflect the most recent 15 years  of index values.</p><p class="depth0">4. Amount of discount or premium. In reflecting any discounted or  premium initial rate, the creditor may select a discount or premium that  it has used during the six months preceding preparation of the  disclosures, and should disclose that the discount or premium is one  that the creditor has used recently. The discount or premium should be  reflected in the example for as long as it is in effect. The creditor  may assume that a discount or premium that would have been in effect for  any part of a year was in effect for the full year for purposes of  reflecting it in the historical example.</p><p class="depth0">5. Rate limitations. Limitations on both periodic and maximum rates  must be reflected in the historical example. If ranges of rate  limitations are provided under Sec. 1026.40(d)(12)(ix), the highest  rates provided in those ranges must be used in the example. Rate  limitations that may apply more often than annually should be treated as  if they were annual limitations. For example, if a creditor imposes a 1%  cap every six months, this should be reflected in the example as if it  were a 2% annual cap.</p><p class="depth0">6. Assumed advances. The creditor should assume that the $10,000  balance is an advance taken at the beginning of the first billing cycle  and is reduced according to the terms of the plan, and that the consumer  takes no subsequent draws. As discussed in the commentary to Sec.  1026.40(d)(5), creditors should not assume an additional advance is  taken at the beginning of any repayment period. If applicable, the  creditor may assume the $10,000 is both the advance and the credit  limit. (See the commentary to Sec. 1026.40(d)(5) for a discussion of  the circumstances in which a creditor may use a lower outstanding  balance.)</p><p class="depth0">7. Representative payment options. The creditor need not provide an  historical example for all of its various payment options, but may  select a representative payment option within each of the three  categories of payments upon which to base its disclosure. (See the  commentary to Sec. 1026.40(d)(5).)</p><p class="depth0">8. Payment information. i. The payment figures in the historical  example must reflect all significant program terms. For example,  features such as rate and payment caps, a discounted initial rate,  negative amortization, and rate carryover must be taken into account in  calculating the payment figures if these would have applied to the plan.  The historical example should include payments for as much of the length  of the plan as would occur during a 15-year period. For example:</p><p class="depth0">A. If the draw period is 10 years and the repayment period is 15  years, the example should illustrate the entire 10-year draw period and  the first 5 years of the repayment period.</p><p class="depth0">B. If the length of the draw period is 15 years and there is a 15- year repayment phase, the historical example must reflect the payments  for the 15-year draw period and would not show any of the repayment  period. No additional historical example would be required to reflect  payments for the repayment period.</p><p class="depth0">C. If the length of the plan is less than 15 years, payments in the  historical example need only be shown for the number of years in the  term. In such cases, however, the creditor must show the index values,  margin and annual percentage rates and continue to reflect all  significant plan terms such as rate limitations for the entire 15 years.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A creditor need show only a single payment per year in the  example, even though payments may vary during a year. The calculations  should be based on the actual payment computation formula, although the  creditor may assume that all months have an equal number of days. The  creditor may assume that payments are made on the last day of the  billing cycle, the billing date or the payment due date, but must be  consistent in the manner in which the period used to illustrate payment  information is selected. Information about balloon payments and  remaining balance may, but need not, be reflected in the example.</p><p class="depth0">9. Disclosures for repayment period. The historical example must  reflect all features of   the repayment period, including the appropriate index values, margin,  rate limitations, length of the repayment period, and payments. For  example, if different indices are used during the draw and repayment  periods, the index values for that portion of the 15 years that reflect  the repayment period must be the values for the appropriate index.</p><p class="depth0">10. Reverse mortgages. The historical example for reverse mortgages  should reflect 15 years of index values and annual percentage rates, but  the payment column should be blank until the year that the single  payment will be made, assuming that payment is estimated to occur within  15 years. (See the commentary to Sec. 1026.40(d)(5) for a discussion of  reverse mortgages.)</p><p class="depth0">40(e) Brochure</p><p class="depth0">1. Substitutes. A brochure is a suitable substitute for the home  equity brochure, ``What You Should Know About Home Equity Lines of  Credit,'' (available on the Bureau's Web site) if it is, at a minimum,  comparable to that brochure in substance and comprehensiveness.  Creditors are permitted to provide more detailed information than is  contained in that brochure.</p><p class="depth0">2. Effect of third party delivery of brochure. If a creditor  determines that a third party has provided a consumer with the required  brochure pursuant to Sec. 1026.40(c), the creditor need not give the  consumer a second brochure.</p><p class="depth0">40(f) Limitations on Home Equity Plans</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. Section 1026.40(f) limits both actions that may be  taken and language that may be included in contracts, and applies to any  assignee or holder as well as to the original creditor. The limitations  apply to the draw period and any repayment period, and to any renewal or  modification of the original agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 40(f)(1)</p><p class="depth0">1. External index. A creditor may change the annual percentage rate  for a plan only if the change is based on an index outside the  creditor's control. Thus, a creditor may not make rate changes based on  its own prime rate or cost of funds and may not reserve a contractual  right to change rates at its discretion. A creditor is permitted,  however, to use a published prime rate, such as that in the Wall Street  Journal, even if the bank's own prime rate is one of several rates used  to establish the published rate.</p><p class="depth0">2. Publicly available. The index must be available to the public. A  publicly available index need not be published in a newspaper, but it  must be one the consumer can independently obtain (by telephone, for  example) and use to verify rates imposed under the plan.</p><p class="depth0">3. Provisions not prohibited. This paragraph does not prohibit rate  changes that are specifically set forth in the agreement. For example,  stepped-rate plans, in which specified rates are imposed for specified  periods, are permissible. In addition, preferred-rate provisions, in  which the rate increases by a specified amount upon the occurrence of a  specified event, also are permissible.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 40(f)(2)</p><p class="depth0">1. Limitations on termination and acceleration. In general,  creditors are prohibited from terminating and accelerating payment of  the outstanding balance before the scheduled expiration of a plan.  However, creditors may take these actions in the four circumstances  specified in Sec. 1026.40(f)(2). Creditors are not permitted to specify  in their contracts any other events that allow termination and  acceleration beyond those permitted by the regulation. Thus, for  example, an agreement may not provide that the balance is payable on  demand nor may it provide that the account will be terminated and the  balance accelerated if the rate cap is reached.</p><p class="depth0">2. Other actions permitted. If an event permitting termination and  acceleration occurs, a creditor may instead take actions short of  terminating and accelerating. For example, a creditor could temporarily  or permanently suspend further advances, reduce the credit limit, change  the payment terms, or require the consumer to pay a fee. A creditor also  may provide in its agreement that a higher rate or higher fees will  apply in circumstances under which it would otherwise be permitted to  terminate the plan and accelerate the balance. A creditor that does not  immediately terminate an account and accelerate payment or take another  permitted action may take such action at a later time, provided one of  the conditions permitting termination and acceleration exists at that  time.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 40(f)(2)(i)</p><p class="depth0">1. Fraud or material misrepresentation. A creditor may terminate a  plan and accelerate the balance if there has been fraud or material  misrepresentation by the consumer in connection with the plan. This  exception includes fraud or misrepresentation at any time, either during  the application process or during the draw period and any repayment  period. What constitutes fraud or misrepresentation is determined by  applicable state law and may include acts of omission as well as overt  acts, as long as any necessary intent on the part of the consumer  exists.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 40(f)(2)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Failure to meet repayment terms. A creditor may terminate a plan  and accelerate the   balance when the consumer fails to meet the repayment terms provided for  in the agreement. However, a creditor may terminate and accelerate under  this provision only if the consumer actually fails to make payments. For  example, a creditor may not terminate and accelerate if the consumer, in  error, sends a payment to the wrong location, such as a branch rather  than the main office of the creditor. If a consumer files for or is  placed in bankruptcy, the creditor may terminate and accelerate under  this provision if the consumer fails to meet the repayment terms of the  agreement. This section does not override any state or other law that  requires a right-to-cure notice, or otherwise places a duty on the  creditor before it can terminate a plan and accelerate the balance.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 40(f)(2)(iii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Impairment of security. A creditor may terminate a plan and  accelerate the balance if the consumer's action or inaction adversely  affects the creditor's security for the plan, or any right of the  creditor in that security. Action or inaction by third parties does not,  in itself, permit the creditor to terminate and accelerate.</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples. i. A creditor may terminate and accelerate, for  example, if:</p><p class="depth0">A. The consumer transfers title to the property or sells the  property without the permission of the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">B. The consumer fails to maintain required insurance on the  dwelling.</p><p class="depth0">C. The consumer fails to pay taxes on the property.</p><p class="depth0">D. The consumer permits the filing of a lien senior to that held by  the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">E. The sole consumer obligated on the plan dies.</p><p class="depth0">F. The property is taken through eminent domain.</p><p class="depth0">G. A prior lienholder forecloses.</p><p class="depth0">ii. By contrast, the filing of a judgment against the consumer would  permit termination and acceleration only if the amount of the judgment  and collateral subject to the judgment is such that the creditor's  security is adversely affected. If the consumer commits waste or  otherwise destructively uses or fails to maintain the property such that  the action adversely affects the security, the plan may be terminated  and the balance accelerated. Illegal use of the property by the consumer  would permit termination and acceleration if it subjects the property to  seizure. If one of two consumers obligated on a plan dies the creditor  may terminate the plan and accelerate the balance if the security is  adversely affected. If the consumer moves out of the dwelling that  secures the plan and that action adversely affects the security, the  creditor may terminate a plan and accelerate the balance.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 40(f)(3)</p><p class="depth0">1. Scope of provision. In general, a creditor may not change the  terms of a plan after it is opened. For example, a creditor may not  increase any fee or impose a new fee once the plan has been opened, even  if the fee is charged by a third party, such as a credit reporting  agency, for a service. The change of terms prohibition applies to all  features of a plan, not only those required to be disclosed under this  section. For example, this provision applies to charges imposed for late  payment, although this fee is not required to be disclosed under Sec.  1026.40(d)(7).</p><p class="depth0">2. Charges not covered. There are three charges not covered by this  provision. A creditor may pass on increases in taxes since such charges  are imposed by a governmental body and are beyond the control of the  creditor. In addition, a creditor may pass on increases in premiums for  property insurance that are excluded from the finance charge under Sec.  1026.4(d)(2), since such insurance provides a benefit to the consumer  independent of the use of the line and is often maintained  notwithstanding the line. A creditor also may pass on increases in  premiums for credit insurance that are excluded from the finance charge  under Sec. 1026.4(d)(1), since the insurance is voluntary and provides  a benefit to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 40(f)(3)(i)</p><p class="depth0">1. Changes provided for in agreement. A creditor may provide in the  initial agreement that further advances will be prohibited or the credit  line reduced during any period in which the maximum annual percentage  rate is reached. A creditor also may provide for other specific changes  to take place upon the occurrence of specific events. Both the  triggering event and the resulting modification must be stated with  specificity. For example, in home equity plans for employees, the  agreement could provide that a specified higher rate or margin will  apply if the borrower's employment with the creditor ends. A contract  could contain a stepped-rate or stepped-fee schedule providing for  specified changes in the rate or the fees on certain dates or after a  specified period of time. A creditor also may provide in the initial  agreement that it will be entitled to a share of the appreciation in the  value of the property as long as the specific appreciation share and the  specific circumstances which require the payment of it are set forth. A  contract may permit a consumer to switch among minimum payment options  during the plan.</p><p class="depth0">2. Prohibited provisions. A creditor may not include a general  provision in its agreement permitting changes to any or all of the terms  of the plan. For example, creditors may not include ``boilerplate''  language in the agreement stating that they reserve the right to   change the fees imposed under the plan. In addition, a creditor may not  include any ``triggering events'' or responses that the regulation  expressly addresses in a manner different from that provided in the  regulation. For example, an agreement may not provide that the margin in  a variable-rate plan will increase if there is a material change in the  consumer's financial circumstances, because the regulation specifies  that temporarily freezing the line or lowering the credit limit is the  permissible response to a material change in the consumer's financial  circumstances. Similarly a contract cannot contain a provision allowing  the creditor to freeze a line due to an insignificant decline in  property value since the regulation allows that response only for a  significant decline.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 40(f)(3)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Substitution of index. A creditor may change the index and margin  used under the plan if the original index becomes unavailable, as long  as historical fluctuations in the original and replacement indices were  substantially similar, and as long as the replacement index and margin  will produce a rate similar to the rate that was in effect at the time  the original index became unavailable. If the replacement index is newly  established and therefore does not have any rate history, it may be used  if it produces a rate substantially similar to the rate in effect when  the original index became unavailable.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 40(f)(3)(iii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Changes by written agreement. A creditor may change the terms of  a plan if the consumer expressly agrees in writing to the change at the  time it is made. For example, a consumer and a creditor could agree in  writing to change the repayment terms from interest-only payments to  payments that reduce the principal balance. The provisions of any such  agreement are governed by the limitations in Sec. 1026.40(f). For  example, a mutual agreement could not provide for future annual  percentage rate changes based on the movement of an index controlled by  the creditor or for termination and acceleration under circumstances  other than those specified in the regulation. By contrast, a consumer  could agree to a new credit limit for the plan, although the agreement  could not permit the creditor to later change the credit limit except by  a subsequent written agreement or in the circumstances described in  Sec. 1026.40(f)(3)(vi).</p><p class="depth0">2. Written agreement. The change must be agreed to in writing by the  consumer. Creditors are not permitted to assume consent because the  consumer uses an account, even if use of an account would otherwise  constitute acceptance of a proposed change under state law.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 40(f)(3)(iv)</p><p class="depth0">1. Beneficial changes. After a plan is opened, a creditor may make  changes that unequivocally benefit the consumer. Under this provision, a  creditor may offer more options to consumers, as long as existing  options remain. For example, a creditor may offer the consumer the  option of making lower monthly payments or could increase the credit  limit. Similarly, a creditor wishing to extend the length of the plan on  the same terms may do so. Creditors are permitted to temporarily reduce  the rate or fees charged during the plan (though a change in terms  notice may be required under Sec. 1026.9(c) when the rate or fees are  returned to their original level). Creditors also may offer an  additional means of access to the line, even if fees are associated with  using the device, provided the consumer retains the ability to use prior  access devices on the original terms.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 40(f)(3)(v)</p><p class="depth0">1. Insignificant changes. A creditor is permitted to make  insignificant changes after a plan is opened. This rule accommodates  operational and similar problems, such as changing the address of the  creditor for purposes of sending payments. It does not permit a creditor  to change a term such as a fee charged for late payments.</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples of insignificant changes. Creditors may make minor  changes to features such as the billing cycle date, the payment due date  (as long as the consumer does not have a diminished grace period if one  is provided), and the day of the month on which index values are  measured to determine changes to the rate for variable-rate plans. A  creditor also may change its rounding practice in accordance with the  tolerance rules set forth in Sec. 1026.14 (for example, stating an  exact APR of 14.3333 percent as 14.3 percent, even if it had previously  been stated as 14.33 percent). A creditor may change the balance  computation method it uses only if the change produces an insignificant  difference in the finance charge paid by the consumer. For example, a  creditor may switch from using the average daily balance method  (including new transactions) to the daily balance method (including new  transactions).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 40(f)(3)(vi)</p><p class="depth0">1. Suspension of credit privileges or reduction of credit limit. A  creditor may prohibit additional extensions of credit or reduce the  credit limit in the circumstances specified in this section of the  regulation. In addition, as discussed under Sec. 1026.40(f)(3)(i), a  creditor may contractually reserve the right to take such actions when  the maximum annual percentage rate is reached. A creditor may not   take these actions under other circumstances, unless the creditor would  be permitted to terminate the line and accelerate the balance as  described in Sec. 1026.40(f)(2). The creditor's right to reduce the  credit limit does not permit reducing the limit below the amount of the  outstanding balance if this would require the consumer to make a higher  payment.</p><p class="depth0">2. Temporary nature of suspension or reduction. Creditors are  permitted to prohibit additional extensions of credit or reduce the  credit limit only while one of the designated circumstances exists. When  the circumstance justifying the creditor's action ceases to exist,  credit privileges must be reinstated, assuming that no other  circumstance permitting such action exists at that time.</p><p class="depth0">3. Imposition of fees. If not prohibited by state law, a creditor  may collect only bona fide and reasonable appraisal and credit report  fees if such fees are actually incurred in investigating whether the  condition permitting the freeze continues to exist. A creditor may not,  in any circumstances, impose a fee to reinstate a credit line once the  condition has been determined not to exist.</p><p class="depth0">4. Reinstatement of credit privileges. Creditors are responsible for  ensuring that credit privileges are restored as soon as reasonably  possible after the condition that permitted the creditor's action ceases  to exist. One way a creditor can meet this responsibility is to monitor  the line on an ongoing basis to determine when the condition ceases to  exist. The creditor must investigate the condition frequently enough to  assure itself that the condition permitting the freeze continues to  exist. The frequency with which the creditor must investigate to  determine whether a condition continues to exist depends upon the  specific condition permitting the freeze. As an alternative to such  monitoring, the creditor may shift the duty to the consumer to request  reinstatement of credit privileges by providing a notice in accordance  with Sec. 1026.9(c)(1)(iii). A creditor may require a reinstatement  request to be in writing if it notifies the consumer of this requirement  on the notice provided under Sec. 1026.9(c)(1)(iii). Once the consumer  requests reinstatement, the creditor must promptly investigate to  determine whether the condition allowing the freeze continues to exist.  Under this alternative, the creditor has a duty to investigate only upon  the consumer's request.</p><p class="depth0">5. Suspension of credit privileges following request by consumer. A  creditor may honor a specific request by a consumer to suspend credit  privileges. If the consumer later requests that the creditor reinstate  credit privileges, the creditor must do so provided no other  circumstance justifying a suspension exists at that time. If two or more  consumers are obligated under a plan and each has the ability to take  advances, the agreement may permit any of the consumers to direct the  creditor not to make further advances. A creditor may require that all  persons obligated under a plan request reinstatement.</p><p class="depth0">6. Significant decline defined. What constitutes a significant  decline for purposes of Sec. 1026.40(f)(3)(vi)(A) will vary according  to individual circumstances. In any event, if the value of the dwelling  declines such that the initial difference between the credit limit and  the available equity (based on the property's appraised value for  purposes of the plan) is reduced by fifty percent, this constitutes a  significant decline in the value of the dwelling for purposes of Sec.  1026.40(f)(3)(vi)(A). For example, assume that a house with a first  mortgage of $50,000 is appraised at $100,000 and the credit limit is  $30,000. The difference between the credit limit and the available  equity is $20,000, half of which is $10,000. The creditor could prohibit  further advances or reduce the credit limit if the value of the property  declines from $100,000 to $90,000. This provision does not require a  creditor to obtain an appraisal before suspending credit privileges  although a significant decline must occur before suspension can occur.</p><p class="depth0">7. Material change in financial circumstances. Two conditions must  be met for Sec. 1026.40(f)(3)(vi)(B) to apply. First, there must be a  ``material change'' in the consumer's financial circumstances, such as a  significant decrease in the consumer's income. Second, as a result of  this change, the creditor must have a reasonable belief that the  consumer will be unable to fulfill the payment obligations of the plan.  A creditor may, but does not have to, rely on specific evidence (such as  the failure to pay other debts) in concluding that the second part of  the test has been met. A creditor may prohibit further advances or  reduce the credit limit under this section if a consumer files for or is  placed in bankruptcy.</p><p class="depth0">8. Default of a material obligation. Creditors may specify events  that would qualify as a default of a material obligation under Sec.  1026.40(f)(3)(vi)(C). For example, a creditor may provide that default  of a material obligation will exist if the consumer moves out of the  dwelling or permits an intervening lien to be filed that would take  priority over future advances made by the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">9. Government limits on the annual percentage rate. Under Sec.  1026.40(f)(3)(vi)(D), a creditor may prohibit further advances or reduce  the credit limit if, for example, a state usury law is enacted which  prohibits a creditor from imposing the agreed-upon annual percentage  rate.</p><p class="depth0">40(g) Refund of Fees</p><p class="depth0">1. Refund of fees required. If any disclosed term, including any  term provided upon request pursuant to Sec. 1026.40(d), changes between  the time the early disclosures are provided to the consumer and the time  the plan is opened, and the consumer as a result decides to not enter  into the plan, a creditor must refund all fees paid by the consumer in  connection with the application. All fees, including credit report fees  and appraisal fees, must be refunded whether such fees are paid to the  creditor or directly to third parties. A consumer is entitled to a  refund of fees under these circumstances whether or not terms are  guaranteed by the creditor under Sec. 1026.40(d)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0">2. Variable-rate plans. The right to a refund of fees does not apply  to changes in the annual percentage rate resulting from fluctuations in  the index value in a variable-rate plan. Also, if the maximum annual  percentage rate is expressed as an amount over the initial rate, the  right to refund of fees would not apply to changes in the cap resulting  from fluctuations in the index value.</p><p class="depth0">3. Changes in terms. If a term, such as the maximum rate, is stated  as a range in the early disclosures, and the term ultimately applicable  to the plan falls within that range, a change does not occur for  purposes of this section. If, however, no range is used and the term is  changed (for example, a rate cap of 6 rather than 5 percentage points  over the initial rate), the change would permit the consumer to obtain a  refund of fees. If a fee imposed by the creditor is stated in the early  disclosures as an estimate and the fee changes, the consumer could elect  to not enter into the agreement and would be entitled to a refund of  fees. On the other hand, if fees imposed by third parties are disclosed  as estimates and those fees change, the consumer is not entitled to a  refund of fees paid in connection with the application. Creditors must,  however, use the best information reasonably available in providing  disclosures about such fees.</p><p class="depth0">4. Timing of refunds and relation to other provisions. The refund of  fees must be made as soon as reasonably possible after the creditor is  notified that the consumer is not entering into the plan because of the  changed term, or that the consumer wants a refund of fees. The fact that  an application fee may be refunded to some applicants under this  provision does not render such fees finance charges under Sec.  1026.4(c)(1) of the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">40(h) Imposition of Nonrefundable Fees</p><p class="depth0">1. Collection of fees after consumer receives disclosures. A fee may  be collected after the consumer receives the disclosures and brochure  and before the expiration of three days, although the fee must be  refunded if, within three days of receiving the required information,  the consumer decides to not enter into the agreement. In such a case,  the consumer must be notified that the fee is refundable for three days.  The notice must be clear and conspicuous and in writing, and may be  included with the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.40(d) or as an  attachment to them. If disclosures and brochure are mailed to the  consumer, Sec. 1026.40(h) provides that a nonrefundable fee may not be  imposed until six business days after the mailing.</p><p class="depth0">2. Collection of fees before consumer receives disclosures. An  application fee may be collected before the consumer receives the  disclosures and brochure (for example, when an application contained in  a magazine is mailed in with an application fee) provided that it  remains refundable until three business days after the consumer receives  the Sec. 1026.40 disclosures. No other fees except a refundable  membership fee may be collected until after the consumer receives the  disclosures required under Sec. 1026.40.</p><p class="depth0">3. Relation to other provisions. A fee collected before disclosures  are provided may become nonrefundable except that, under Sec.  1026.40(g), it must be refunded if the consumer elects to not enter into  the plan because of a change in terms. (Of course, all fees must be  refunded if the consumer later rescinds under Sec. 1026.15.)</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.41--Periodic Statements for Residential Mortgage Loans</p><p class="depth0">41(a) In general.</p><p class="depth0">1. Recipient of periodic statement. When two consumers are joint  obligors with primary liability on a closed-end consumer credit  transaction secured by a dwelling, subject to Sec. 1026.41, the  periodic statement may be sent to either one of them. For example, if a  husband and wife jointly own a home, the servicer need not send  statements to both the husband and the wife; a single statement may be  sent.</p><p class="depth0">2. Billing cycles shorter than a 31-day period. If a loan has a  billing cycle shorter than a period of 31 days (for example, a bi-weekly  billing cycle), a periodic statement covering an entire month may be  used. Such statement would separately list the upcoming payment due  dates and amounts due, as required by Sec. 1026.20(d)(1), and list all  transaction activity that occurred during the related time period, as  required by paragraph (d)(4). Such statement may aggregate the  information for the explanation of amount due, as required by paragraph  (d)(2), and past payment breakdown, as required by paragraph (d)(3).</p><p class="depth0">3. One statement per billing cycle. The periodic statement  requirement in Sec. 1026.41 applies to the ``creditor, assignee, or  servicer as applicable.'' The creditor, assignee, and servicer are all  subject to this requirement   (but see comment 41(a)-4), but only one statement must be sent to the  consumer each billing cycle. When two or more parties are subject to  this requirement, they may decide among themselves which of them will  send the statement.</p><p class="depth0">4. Opting out. A consumer may not opt out of receiving periodic  statements altogether. However, consumers who have demonstrated the  ability to access statements online may opt out of receiving  notifications that statements are available. Such an ability may be  demonstrated, for example, by the consumer receiving notification that  the statements is available, going to the Web site where the information  is available, viewing the information about their account and selecting  a link or option there to indicate they no longer would like to receive  notifications when new statements are available.</p><p class="depth0">41(b) Timing of the periodic statement.</p><p class="depth0">1. Reasonably prompt time. Section 1026.41(b) requires that the  periodic statement be delivered or placed in the mail no later than a  reasonably prompt time after the payment due date or the end of any  courtesy period. Delivering, emailing or placing the periodic statement  in the mail within four days of the close of the courtesy period of the  previous billing cycle generally would be considered reasonably prompt.</p><p class="depth0">2. Courtesy period. The meaning of ``courtesy period'' is explained  in comment 7(b)(11)-1.</p><p class="depth0">41(c) Form of the periodic statement.</p><p class="depth0">1. Clear and conspicuous standard. The ``clear and conspicuous''  standard generally requires that disclosures be in a reasonably  understandable form. Except where otherwise provided, the standard does  not prohibit adding to the required disclosures, as long as the  additional information does not overwhelm or obscure the required  disclosures. For example, while certain information about the escrow  account (such as the account balance) is not required on the periodic  statement, this information may be included.</p><p class="depth0">2. Additional information; disclosures required by other laws.  Nothing in Sec. 1026.41 prohibits a servicer from including additional  information or combining disclosures required by other laws with the  disclosures required by this subpart, unless such prohibition is  expressly set forth in this subpart, or other applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">3. Electronic distribution. The periodic statement may be provided  electronically if the consumer agrees. The consumer must give  affirmative consent to receive statements electronically. If statements  are provided electronically, the creditor, assignee, or servicer may  send a notification that a consumer's statement is available, with a  link to where the statement can be accessed, in place of the statement  itself.</p><p class="depth0">4. Presumed consent. Any consumer who is currently receiving  disclosures for any account (for example, a mortgage or checking  account) electronically from their servicer shall be deemed to have  consented to receiving e-statements in place of paper statements.</p><p class="depth0">41(d) Content and layout of the periodic statement.</p><p class="depth0">1. Close proximity. Paragraph (d) requires several disclosures to be  provided in close proximity to one another. To meet this requirement,  the items to be provided in close proximity must be grouped together,  and set off from the other groupings of items. This could be  accomplished in a variety of ways, for example, by presenting the  information in boxes, or by arranging the items on the document and  including spacing between the groupings. Items in close proximity may  not have any intervening text between them.</p><p class="depth0">2. Not applicable. If an item required by paragraph (d) or (e) of  this section is not applicable to the loan, it may be omitted from the  periodic statement or coupon book. For example, if there is no  prepayment penalty associated with a loan, the prepayment penalty  disclosures need not be provided on the periodic statement.</p><p class="depth0">3. Terminology. A servicer may use terminology other than that found  on the sample periodic statements in appendix H-30, so long as the new  terminology is commonly understood. For example, servicers may take into  consideration regional differences in terminology and refer to the  account for the collection of taxes and insurance, referred to in Sec.  1026.41(d) as the ``escrow account,'' as an ``impound account.''</p><p class="depth0">41(d)(3) Past payment breakdown.</p><p class="depth0">1. Partial payments. The disclosure of any partial payments received  since the previous statement that were sent to a suspense or unapplied  funds account as required by Sec. 1026.41(d)(3)(i) should reflect any  funds that were received in the time period covered by the current  statement and that were placed in such account. The disclosure of any  portion of payments since the beginning of the calendar year that was  sent to a partial payment or suspense account as required by Sec.  1026.41(d)(3)(ii) should reflect all funds that are currently held in a  suspense or unapplied funds account. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Suppose a payment of $1,000 is due, but the consumer sends in  only $600 on January 1, which is held in a suspense account. Further  assume there are no fees charged on this account. Assuming there are no  other funds in the suspense account, the January statement should  reflect: Unapplied funds since last statement--$600. Unapplied funds  YTD--$600.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume the same facts as in the preceding paragraph, except that  during February the consumer sends in $300 and this too   is held in the suspense account. The statement should reflect: Unapplied  funds since last statement--$300. Unapplied funds YTD--$900.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Assume the same facts as in the preceding paragraph, except  that during March the consumer sends in $400. Of this payment, $100  completes a full periodic payment when added to the $900 in funds  already held in the suspense account. This $1,000 is applied to the  January payment, and the remaining $300 remains in the suspense account.  The statement should reflect: Unapplied funds since last statement-- $300. Unapplied Funds YTD--$300.</p><p class="depth0">41(d)(4) Transaction Activity.</p><p class="depth0">1. Meaning. Transaction activity includes any transaction that  credits or debits the amount currently due. This is the same amount that  is required to be disclosed under Sec. 1026.41(d)(1)(iii). Examples of  such transactions include, without limitation:</p><p class="depth0">i. Payments received and applied;</p><p class="depth0">ii. Payments received and held in a suspense account;</p><p class="depth0">iii. The imposition of any fees (for example late fees); and</p><p class="depth0">iv. The imposition of any charges (for example, private mortgage  insurance).</p><p class="depth0">2. Description of late fees. The description of any late fee charges  includes the date of the late fee, the amount of the late fee, and the  fact that a late fee was imposed.</p><p class="depth0">3. Partial payments. If a partial payment is sent to a suspense or  unapplied funds account, this fact must be in the transaction  description along with the date and amount of the payment.</p><p class="depth0">41(e)(3) Coupon book exemption.</p><p class="depth0">1. Fixed rate. For guidance on the meaning of ``fixed rate'' for  purposes of Sec. 1026.41(e)(3), see Sec. 1026.18(s)(7)(iii) and its  commentary.</p><p class="depth0">2. Coupon book. A coupon book is a booklet provided to the consumer  with a page for each billing cycle during a set period of time (often  covering one year). These pages are designed to be torn off and returned  to the servicer with a payment for each billing cycle. Additional  information about the loan is often included on or inside the front or  back cover, or on filler pages in the coupon book.</p><p class="depth0">3. Information location. The information required by paragraph  (e)(3)(ii) need not be provided on each coupon, but should be provided  somewhere in the coupon book. Such information could be located, e.g.,  on or inside the front or back cover, or on filler pages in the coupon  book.</p><p class="depth0">4. Outstanding principal balance. Paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) requires  the information listed in paragraph (d)(7) to be included in the coupon  book. Paragraph (d)(7)(i) requires the disclosure of the outstanding  principal balance. If the servicer makes use of a coupon book and the  exemption in Sec. 1026.41(e)(3), the servicer need only disclose the  principal balance at the beginning of the time period covered by the  coupon book.</p><p class="depth0">41(e)(4) Small servicers.</p><p class="depth0">41(e)(4)(ii) Small servicer defined.</p><p class="depth0">1. Mortgage loans considered. Pursuant to Sec. 1026.41(a)(1), the  mortgage loans considered in determining status as a small servicer are  closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by a dwelling, subject  to the exclusions in Sec. 1026.41(e)(4)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">2. Services, together with affiliates, 5,000 or fewer mortgage  loans. To qualify as a small servicer, under Sec. 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(A),  a servicer must service, together with any affiliates, 5,000 or fewer  mortgage loans, for all of which the servicer (or an affiliate) is the  creditor or assignee. There are two elements to satisfying Sec.  1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(A). First, a servicer, together with any affiliates,  must service 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans. Second, a servicer must  service only mortgage loans for which the servicer (or an affiliate) is  the creditor or assignee. To be the creditor or assignee of a mortgage  loan, the servicer (or an affiliate) must either currently own the  mortgage loan or must have been the entity to which the mortgage loan  obligation was initially payable (that is, the originator of the  mortgage loan). A servicer is not a small servicer under Sec.  1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(A) if it services any mortgage loans for which the  servicer or an affiliate is not the creditor or assignee (that is, for  which the servicer or an affiliate is not the owner or was not the  originator). The following two examples demonstrate circumstances in  which a servicer would not qualify as a small servicer under Sec.  1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(A) because it did not meet both requirements under  Sec. 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(A) for determining a servicer's status as a  small servicer:</p><p class="depth0">i. A servicer services 3,000 mortgage loans, all of which it or an  affiliate owns or originated. An affiliate of the servicer services  4,000 other mortgage loans, all of which it or an affiliate owns or  originated. Because the number of mortgage loans serviced by a servicer  is determined by counting the mortgage loans serviced by a servicer  together with any affiliates, both of these servicers are considered to  be servicing 7,000 mortgage loans and neither servicer is a small  servicer.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A service services 3,100 mortgage loans--3,000 mortgage loans it  owns or originated and 100 mortgage loans it neither owns nor  originated, but for which it owns the mortgage servicing rights. The  servicer is not a small servicer because it services mortgage loans for  which the servicer (or an affiliate) is not the creditor or assignee,  notwithstanding that the servicer services fewer than 5,000 mortgage  loans.</p><p class="depth0">3. Master servicing and subservicing. A servicer that qualifies as a  small servicer does not lose its small servicer status if it retains a  subservicer, as that term is defined   in 12 CFR 1024.31, to service any of its mortgage loans. A subservicer  can gain the benefit of the small servicer exemption only if (1) the  master servicer, as that term is defined in 12 CFR 1024.31, is a small  servicer and (2) the subservicer is a small servicer. A subservicer  generally will not qualify as a small servicer because it does not own  or did not originate the mortgage loans it subservices--unless it is an  affiliate of a master servicer that qualifies as a small servicer. The  following examples demonstrate the application of the small servicer  exemption for different forms of servicing relationships:</p><p class="depth0">i. A credit union services 4,000 mortgage loans, all of which it  originated or owns. The credit union retains a credit union service  organization, that is not an affiliate, to subservice 1,000 of the  mortgage loans. The credit union is a small servicer and, thus, can gain  the benefit of the small servicer exemption for the 3,000 mortgage loans  the credit union services itself. The credit union service organization  is not a small servicer because it services mortgage loans it does not  own or did not originate. Accordingly, the credit union service  organization does not gain the benefit of the small servicer exemption  and, thus, must comply with any applicable mortgage servicing  requirements for the 1,000 mortgage loans it subservices.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A bank holding company, through a lender subsidiary, owns or  originated 4,000 mortgage loans. All mortgage servicing rights for the  4,000 mortgage loans are owned by a wholly owned master servicer  subsidiary. Servicing for the 4,000 mortgage loans is conducted by a  wholly owned subservicer subsidiary. The bank holding company controls  all of these subsidiaries and, thus, they are affiliates of the bank  holding company pursuant 12 CFR 1026.32(b)(2). Because the master  servicer and subservicer service 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans, and  because all the mortgage loans are owned or originated by an affiliate,  the master servicer and the subservicer both qualify for the small  servicer exemption for all 4,000 mortgage loans.</p><p class="depth0">iii. A nonbank servicer services 4,000 mortgage loans, all of which  it originated or owns. The servicer retains a ``component servicer'' to  assist it with servicing functions. The component servicer is not  engaged in ``servicing'' as defined in 12 CFR 1024.2; that is, the  component servicer does not receive any scheduled periodic payments from  a borrower pursuant to the terms of any mortgage loan, including amounts  for escrow accounts, and does not make the payments to the owner of the  loan or other third parties of principal and interest and such other  payments with respect to the amounts received from the borrower as may  be required pursuant to the terms of the mortgage servicing loan  documents or servicing contract. The component servicer is not a  subservicer pursuant to 12 CFR 1024.31 because it is not engaged in  servicing, as that term is defined in 12 CFR 1024.2. The nonbank  servicer is a small servicer and, thus, can gain the benefit of the  small servicer exemption with regard to all 4,000 mortgage loans it  services.</p><p class="depth0">4. Nonprofit entity that services 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans. To  qualify as a small servicer under Sec. 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C), a servicer  must be a nonprofit entity that services 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans,  including any mortgage loans serviced on behalf of associated nonprofit  entities, for all of which the servicer or an associated nonprofit  entity is the creditor. There are two elements to satisfying Sec.  1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C). First, a nonprofit entity must service 5,000 or  fewer mortgage loans, including any mortgage loans serviced on behalf of  associated nonprofit entities. For each associated nonprofit entity, the  small servicer determination is made separately, without consideration  of the number of loans serviced by another associated nonprofit entity.  Second, a nonprofit entity must service only mortgage loans for which  the servicer (or an associated nonprofit entity) is the creditor. To be  the creditor, the servicer (or an associated nonprofit entity) must have  been the entity to which the mortgage loan obligation was initially  payable (that is, the originator of the mortgage loan). A nonprofit  entity is not a small servicer under Sec. 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C) if it  services any mortgage loans for which the servicer (or an associated  nonprofit entity) is not the creditor (that is, for which the servicer  or an associated nonprofit entity was not the originator). The first of  the following two examples demonstrates circumstances in which a  nonprofit entity would qualify as a small servicer under Sec.  1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C) because it meets both requirements for determining  a nonprofit entity's status as a small servicer under Sec.  1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C). The second example demonstrates circumstances in  which a nonprofit entity would not qualify as a small servicer under  Sec. 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C) because it does not meet both requirements  under Sec. 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C).</p><p class="depth0">i. Nonprofit entity A services 3,000 of its own mortgage loans, and  1,500 mortgage loans on behalf of associated nonprofit entity B. All  4,500 mortgage loans were originated by A or B. Associated nonprofit  entity C services 2,500 mortgage loans, all of which it originated.  Because the number of mortgage loans serviced by a nonprofit entity is  determined by counting the number of mortgage loans serviced by the  nonprofit entity (including mortgage loans serviced on behalf of  associated nonprofit entities) but not counting any mortgage loans  serviced by an associated nonprofit entity, A and C are both small  servicers.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A nonprofit entity services 4,500 mortgage loans--3,000 mortgage  loans it originated, 1,000 mortgage loans originated by associated  nonprofit entities, and 500 mortgage loans neither it nor an associated  nonprofit entity originated. The nonprofit entity is not a small  servicer because it services mortgage loans for which neither it nor an  associated nonprofit entity is the creditor, notwithstanding that it  services fewer than 5,000 mortgage loans.</p><p class="depth0">41(e)(4)(iii) Small servicer determination.</p><p class="depth0">1. Loans obtained by merger or acquisition. Any mortgage loans  obtained by a servicer or an affiliate as part of a merger or  acquisition, or as part of the acquisition of all of the assets or  liabilities of a branch office of a creditor, should be considered  mortgage loans for which the servicer or an affiliate is the creditor to  which the mortgage loan is initially payable. A branch office means  either an office of a depository institution that is approved as a  branch by a Federal or State supervisory agency or an office of a for- profit mortgage lending institution (other than a depository  institution) that takes applications from the public for mortgage loans.</p><p class="depth0">2. Timing for small servicer exemption. The following examples  demonstrate when a servicer either is considered or is no longer  considered a small servicer under Sec. 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(A) and (C):</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume a servicer (that as of January 1 of the current year  qualifies as a small servicer) begins servicing more than 5,000 mortgage  loans on October 1, and services more than 5,000 mortgage loans as of  January 1 of the following year. The servicer would no longer be  considered a small servicer on January 1 of the following year and would  have to comply with any requirements from which it is no longer exempt  as a small servicer on April 1 of the following year.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume a servicer (that as of January 1 of the current year  qualifies as a small servicer) begins servicing more than 5,000 mortgage  loans on February 1, and services more than 5,000 mortgage loans as of  January 1 of the following year. The servicer would no longer be  considered a small servicer on January 1 of the following year and would  have to comply with any requirements from which it is no longer exempt  as a small servicer on that same January 1.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Assume a servicer (that as of January 1 of the current year  qualifies as a small servicer) begins servicing more than 5,000 mortgage  loans on February 1, but services fewer than 5,000 mortgage loans as of  January 1 of the following year. The servicer is considered a small  servicer for the following year.</p><p class="depth0">3. Mortgage loans not considered in determining whether a servicer  is a small servicer. Mortgage loans that are not considered pursuant to  Sec. 1026.41(e)(4)(iii) in applying Sec. 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(A) are not  considered either for determining whether a servicer (together with any  affiliates) services 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans or whether a servicer  is servicing only mortgage loans that it (or an affiliate) owns or  originated. For example, assume a servicer services 5,400 mortgage  loans. Of these mortgage loans, the servicer owns or originated 4,800  mortgage loans, voluntarily services 300 mortgage loans that neither it  (nor an affiliate) owns or originated and for which the servicer does  not receive any compensation or fees, and services 300 reverse mortgage  transactions. The voluntarily serviced mortgage loans and reverse  mortgage loans are not considered in determining whether the servicer  qualifies as a small servicer pursuant to Sec. 1026.41(e)(4)(iii)(A).  Thus, because only the 4,800 mortgage loans owned or originated by the  servicer are considered in determining whether the servicer qualifies as  a small servicer, the servicer satisfies Sec. 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(A) with  regard to all 5,400 mortgage loans it services.</p><p class="depth0">4. Mortgage loans not considered in determining whether a nonprofit  entity is a small servicer. Mortgage loans that are not considered  pursuant to Sec. 1026.41(e)(4)(iii) in applying Sec.  1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C) are not considered either for determining whether a  nonprofit entity services 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans, including any  mortgage loans serviced on behalf of associated nonprofit entities, or  whether a nonprofit entity is servicing only mortgage loans that it or  an associated nonprofit entity originated. For example, assume a  servicer that is a nonprofit entity services 5,400 mortgage loans. Of  these mortgage loans, the nonprofit entity originated 2,800 mortgage  loans and associated nonprofit entities originated 2,000 mortgage loans.  The nonprofit entity receives compensation for servicing the loans  originated by associated nonprofits. The nonprofit entity also  voluntarily services 600 mortgage loans that were originated by an  entity that is not an associated nonprofit entity, and receives no  compensation or fees for servicing these loans. The voluntarily serviced  mortgage loans are not considered in determining whether the servicer  qualifies as a small servicer. Thus, because only the 4,800 mortgage  loans originated by the nonprofit entity or associated nonprofit  entities are considered in determining whether the servicer qualifies as  a small servicer, the servicer satisfies Sec. 1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(C) with  regard to all 5,400 mortgage loans it services.</p><p class="depth0">5. Limited role of voluntarily serviced mortgage loans. Reverse  mortgages and mortgage loans secured by consumers' interests in  timeshare plans, in addition to not being considered in determining  small servicer qualification, are also exempt from the requirements of  Sec. 1026.41. In contrast, although   voluntarily serviced mortgage loans, as defined by Sec.  1026.41(e)(4)(iii)(A), are likewise not considered in determining small  servicer status, they are not exempt from the requirements of Sec.  1026.41. Thus, a servicer that does not qualify as a small servicer  would not have to provide periodic statements for reverse mortgages and  timeshare plans because they are exempt from the rule, but would have to  provide periodic statements for mortgage loans it voluntarily services.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.42--Valuation Independence</p><p class="depth0">42(a) Scope</p><p class="depth0">1.

A covered person does not violate Sec. 1026.42(c)(1) if  the person does not engage in an act or practice set forth in Sec.  1026.42(c)(1) for the purpose of causing the value assigned to the  consumer's principal dwelling to be based on a factor other than the  independent judgment of a person that prepares valuations. For example,  requesting that a person that prepares a valuation take certain actions,  such as consider additional, appropriate property information, does not  violate Sec. 1026.42(c), because such request does not supplant the  independent judgment of the person that prepares a valuation. See Sec.  1026.42(c)(3)(i). A covered person also may provide incentives, such as  additional compensation, to a person that prepares valuations or  performs valuation management functions under Sec. 1026.42(c)(1), as  long as the covered person does not cause or attempt to cause the value  assigned to the consumer's principal dwelling to be based on a factor  other than the independent judgment of the person that prepares  valuations.</p><p class="depth0">3. Person that prepares valuations. For purposes of Sec. 1026.42,  the term ``valuation'' includes an estimate of value regardless of  whether it is an appraisal prepared by a state-certified or -licensed  appraiser. See comment 42(b)(3)-1. A person that prepares valuations may  or may not be a state-licensed or state-certified appraiser. Thus a  person violates Sec. 1026.42(c)(1) by engaging in prohibited acts or  practices directed towards any person that prepares or may prepare a  valuation of the consumer's principal dwelling for a covered  transaction. For example, a person violates Sec. 1026.42(c)(1) by  seeking to coerce a real estate agent to assign a value to the  consumer's principal dwelling based   on a factor other than the independent judgment of the real estate  agent, in connection with a covered transaction.</p><p class="depth0">4. Indirect acts or practices. Section 1026.42(c)(1) prohibits both  direct and indirect attempts to cause the value assigned to the  consumer's principal dwelling to be based on a factor other than the  independent judgment of the person that prepares the valuation, through  coercion and certain other acts and practices. For example, a creditor  violates Sec. 1026.42(c)(1) if the creditor attempts to cause the value  an appraiser engaged by an appraisal management company assigns to the  consumer's principal dwelling to be based on a factor other than the  appraiser's independent judgment, by threatening to withhold future  business from a title company affiliated with the appraisal management  company unless the appraiser assigns a value to the dwelling that meets  or exceeds a minimum threshold.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 42(c)(1)(i)</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicability of examples. Section 1026.42(c)(1)(i) provides  examples of coercion of a person that prepares valuations. However,  Sec. 1026.42(c)(1)(i) also applies to coercion of a person that  performs valuation management functions or its affiliate. See Sec.  1026.42(c)(1); comment 42(c)(1) 4.</p><p class="depth0">2. Specific value or predetermined threshold. As used in the  examples of actions prohibited under Sec. 1026.42(c)(1), a ``specific  value'' and a ``predetermined threshold'' include a predetermined  minimum, maximum, or range of values. Further, although the examples  assume a covered person's prohibited actions are designed to cause the  value assigned to the consumer's principal dwelling to equal or exceed a  certain amount, the rule applies equally to cases where a covered  person's prohibited actions are designed to cause the value assigned to  the dwelling to be below a certain amount.</p><p class="depth0">42(c)(2) Mischaracterization of Value</p><p class="depth0">42(c)(2)(i) Misrepresentation</p><p class="depth0">1. Opinion of value. Section 1026.42(c)(2)(i) prohibits a person  that performs valuations from misrepresenting the value of the  consumer's principal dwelling in a valuation. Such person misrepresents  the value of the consumer's principal dwelling by assigning a value to  such dwelling that does not reflect the person's opinion of the value of  such dwelling. For example, an appraiser misrepresents the value of the  consumer's principal dwelling if the appraiser estimates that the value  of such dwelling is $250,000 applying the standards required by the  Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Standards but assigns a  value of $300,000 to such dwelling in a Uniform Residential Appraisal  Report.</p><p class="depth0">42(c)(2)(iii) Inducement of Mischaracterization</p><p class="depth0">1. Inducement. A covered person may not induce a person to  materially misrepresent the value of the consumer's principal dwelling  in a valuation or to falsify or alter a valuation. For example, a loan  originator may not coerce a loan underwriter to alter an appraisal  report to increase the value assigned to the consumer's principal  dwelling.</p><p class="depth0">42(d) Prohibition on Conflicts of Interest</p><p class="depth0">42(d)(1)(i) In General</p><p class="depth0">1. Prohibited interest in the property. A person preparing a  valuation or performing valuation management functions for a covered  transaction has a prohibited interest in the property under paragraph  (d)(1)(i) if the person has any ownership or reasonably foreseeable  ownership interest in the property. For example, a person who seeks a  mortgage to purchase a home has a reasonably foreseeable ownership  interest in the property securing the mortgage, and therefore is not  permitted to prepare the valuation or perform valuation management  functions for that mortgage transaction under paragraph (d)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">2. Prohibited interest in the transaction. A person preparing a  valuation or performing valuation management functions has a prohibited  interest in the transaction under paragraph (d)(1)(i) if that person or  an affiliate of that person also serves as a loan officer of the  creditor, mortgage broker, real estate broker, or other settlement  service provider for the transaction and the conditions under paragraph  (d)(4) are not satisfied. A person also has a prohibited interest in the  transaction if the person is compensated or otherwise receives financial  or other benefits based on whether the transaction is consummated. Under  these circumstances, the person is not permitted to prepare the  valuation or perform valuation management functions for that transaction  under paragraph (d)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">42(d)(1)(ii) Employees and Affiliates of Creditors; Providers of</p><p class="depth0">Multiple Settlement Services</p><p class="depth0">1. Employees and affiliates of creditors. In general, a creditor may  use employees or affiliates to prepare a valuation or perform valuation  management functions without violating paragraph (d)(1)(i). However,  whether an employee or affiliate has a direct or indirect interest in  the property or transaction that creates a prohibited conflict of  interest under paragraph (d)(1)(i) depends on the facts and  circumstances of a particular case, including the structure of the  employment or affiliate relationship.</p><p class="depth0">2. Providers of multiple settlement services. In general, a person  who prepares a valuation   or perform valuation management functions for a covered transaction may  perform another settlement service for the same transaction, or the  person's affiliate may perform another settlement service, without  violating paragraph (d)(1)(i). However, whether the person has a direct  or indirect interest in the property or transaction that creates a  prohibited conflict of interest under paragraph (d)(1)(i) depends on the  facts and circumstances of a particular case.  42(d)(2) Employees and Affiliates of Creditors with Assets of More than</p><p class="depth0">$250 Million for Both of the Past two Calendar Years</p><p class="depth0">1. Safe harbor. A person who a prepares valuation or performs  valuation management functions for a covered transaction and is an  employee or affiliate of the creditor will not be deemed to have an  interest prohibited under paragraph (d)(1)(i) on the basis of the  employment or affiliate relationship with the creditor if the conditions  in paragraph (d)(2) are satisfied. Even if the conditions in paragraph  (d)(2) are satisfied, however, the person may have a prohibited conflict  of interest on other grounds, such as if the person performs a valuation  for a purchase-money mortgage transaction in which the person is the  buyer or seller of the subject property. Thus, in general, in any  covered transaction in which the creditor had assets of more than $250  million for both of the past two years, the creditor may use its own  employee or affiliate to prepare a valuation or perform valuation  management functions for a particular transaction, as long as the  conditions described in paragraph (d)(2) are satisfied. If the  conditions in paragraph (d)(2) are not satisfied, whether a person  preparing a valuation or performing valuation management functions has  violated paragraph (d)(1)(i) depends on all of the facts and  circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 42(d)(2)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Prohibition on reporting to a person who is part of the  creditor's loan production function. To qualify for the safe harbor  under paragraph (d)(2), the person preparing a valuation or performing  valuation management functions may not report to a person who is part of  the creditor's loan production function (as defined in paragraph  (d)(5)(i) and comment 42(d)(5)(i)-1). For example, if a person preparing  a valuation is directly supervised or managed by a loan officer or other  person in the creditor's loan production function, or by a person who is  directly supervised or managed by a loan officer, the condition under  paragraph (d)(2)(ii) is not met.</p><p class="depth0">2. Prohibition on reporting to a person whose compensation is based  on the transaction closing. To qualify for the safe harbor under  paragraph (d)(2), the person preparing a valuation or performing  valuation management functions may not report to a person whose  compensation is based on the closing of the transaction to which the  valuation relates. For example, assume an appraisal management company  performs valuation management functions for a transaction in which the  creditor is an affiliate of the appraisal management company. If the  employee of the appraisal management company who is in charge of  valuation management functions for that transaction is supervised by a  person who earns a commission or bonus based on the percentage of closed  transactions for which the appraisal management company provides  valuation management functions, the condition under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)  is not met.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 42(d)(2)(iii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Direct or indirect involvement in selection of person who  prepares a valuation.

For example, if the person who  selects the person to prepare the valuation for a covered transaction is  supervised by an employee of the creditor who also supervises loan  officers, the condition in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) is not met.</p><p class="depth0">42(d)(3) Employees and Affiliates of Creditors With Assets of $250</p><p class="depth0">Million or Less for Either of the Past Two Calendar Years</p><p class="depth0">1.

For example, assume an appraisal management  company performs both valuation management functions and title services,  including providing title insurance, for the same covered transaction.  If the appraisal management company employee in charge of valuation  management functions for the transaction is supervised by the title  insurance agent in the transaction, whose compensation depends in whole  or in part on whether title insurance is sold at the loan closing, the  condition in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) is not met.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 42(d)(4)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1.

Loan production function. One condition of the safe harbors under  paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(4)(i), involving transactions in which the  creditor had assets of more than $250 million for both of the past two  calendar years, is that the person who prepares a valuation or performs  valuation management functions must report to a person who is not part  of the creditor's ``loan production function.'' A creditor's ``loan  production function'' includes retail sales staff, loan officers, and  any other employee of the creditor with responsibility for taking a loan  application, offering or negotiating loan terms or whose compensation is  based on loan processing volume. A person is not considered part of a  creditor's loan production function solely because part of the person's  compensation includes a general bonus not tied to specific transactions  or a specific percentage of transactions closing, or a profit sharing  plan that benefits all employees. A person solely responsible for credit  administration or risk management is also not considered part of a  creditor's loan production function. Credit administration and risk  management includes, for example, loan underwriting, loan   closing functions (e.g., loan documentation), disbursing funds,  collecting mortgage payments and otherwise servicing the loan (e.g.,  escrow management and payment of taxes), monitoring loan performance,  and foreclosure processing.</p><p class="depth0">42(e) When Extension of Credit Prohibited</p><p class="depth0">1. Reasonable diligence. A creditor will be deemed to have acted  with reasonable diligence under Sec. 1026.42(e) if the creditor extends  credit based on a valuation other than the valuation subject to the  restriction in Sec. 1026.42(e). A creditor need not obtain a second  valuation to document that the creditor has acted with reasonable  diligence to determine that the valuation does not materially misstate  or misrepresent the value of the consumer's principal dwelling, however.  For example, assume an appraiser notifies a creditor before consummation  that a loan originator attempted to cause the value assigned to the  consumer's principal dwelling to be based on a factor other than the  appraiser's independent judgment, through coercion. If the creditor  reasonably determines and documents that the appraisal does not  materially misstate or misrepresent the value of the consumer's  principal dwelling, for purposes of Sec. 1026.42(e), the creditor may  extend credit based on the appraisal.</p><p class="depth0">42(f) Customary and Reasonable Compensation  42(f)(1) Requirement to Provide Customary and Reasonable Compensation to</p><p class="depth0">Fee Appraisers</p><p class="depth0">1. Agents of the creditor. Whether a person is an agent of the  creditor is determined by applicable law; however, a ``fee appraiser''  as defined in paragraph (f)(4)(i) is not an agent of the creditor for  purposes of paragraph (f), and therefore is not required to pay other  fee appraisers customary and reasonable compensation under paragraph  (f).</p><p class="depth0">2. Geographic market. For purposes of paragraph (f), the  ``geographic market of the property being appraised'' means the  geographic market relevant to compensation levels for appraisal  services. Depending on the facts and circumstances, the relevant  geographic market may be a state, metropolitan statistical area (MSA),  metropolitan division, area outside of an MSA, county, or other  geographic area. For example, assume that fee appraisers who normally  work only in County A generally accept $400 to appraise an attached  single-family property in County A. Assume also that very few or no fee  appraisers who work only in contiguous County B will accept a rate  comparable to $400 to appraise an attached single-family property in  County A. The relevant geographic market for an attached single-family  property in County A may reasonably be defined as County A. On the other  hand, assume that fee appraisers who normally work only in County A  generally accept $400 to appraise an attached single-family property in  County A. Assume also that many fee appraisers who normally work only in  contiguous County B will accept a rate comparable to $400 to appraise an  attached single-family property in County A. The relevant geographic  market for an attached single-family property in County A may reasonably  be defined to include both County A and County B.</p><p class="depth0">3. Failure to perform contractual obligations. Paragraph (f)(1) does  not prohibit a creditor or its agent from withholding compensation from  a fee appraiser for failing to meet contractual obligations, such as  failing to provide the appraisal report or violating state or Federal  appraisal laws in performing the appraisal.</p><p class="depth0">4. Agreement that fee is ``customary and reasonable.'' A document  signed by a fee appraiser indicating that the appraiser agrees that the  fee paid to the appraiser is ``customary and reasonable'' does not by  itself create a presumption of compliance with Sec. 1026.42(f) or  otherwise satisfy the requirement to pay a fee appraiser at a customary  and reasonable rate.</p><p class="depth0">5. Volume-based discounts. Section 1026.42(f)(1) does not prohibit a  fee appraiser and a creditor (or its agent) from agreeing to  compensation based on transaction volume, so long as the compensation is  customary and reasonable. For example, assume that a fee appraiser  typically receives $300 for appraisals from creditors with whom it does  business; the fee appraiser, however, agrees to reduce the fee to $280  for a particular creditor, in exchange for a minimum number of  assignments from the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">42(f)(2) Presumption of Compliance</p><p class="depth0">1. In general. A creditor and its agent are presumed to comply with  paragraph (f)(1) if the creditor or its agent meets the conditions  specified in paragraph (f)(2) in determining the compensation paid to a  fee appraiser. These conditions are not requirements for compliance but,  if met, create a presumption that the creditor or its agent has complied  with Sec. 1026.42(f)(1). A person may rebut this presumption with  evidence that the amount of compensation paid to a fee appraiser was not  customary and reasonable for reasons unrelated to the conditions in  paragraph (f)(2)(i) or (f)(2)(ii). If a creditor or its agent does not  meet one of the non-required conditions set forth in paragraph (f)(2),  the creditor's and its agent's compliance with paragraph (f)(1) is  determined based on all of the facts and circumstances without a  presumption of either compliance or violation.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 42(f)(2)(i)</p><p class="depth0">1. Two-step process for determining customary and reasonable rates.  Paragraph (f)(2)(i) sets forth a two-step process for a creditor or its  agent to determine the amount of compensation that is customary and  reasonable in a given transaction. First, the creditor or its agent must  identify recent rates paid for comparable appraisal services in the  relevant geographic market. Second, once recent rates have been  identified, the creditor or its agent must review the factors listed in  paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A)-(F) and make any appropriate adjustments to the  rates to ensure that the amount of compensation is reasonable.</p><p class="depth0">2. Identifying recent rates. Whether rates may reasonably be  considered ``recent'' depends on the facts and circumstances. Generally,  ``recent'' rates would include rates charged within one year of the  creditor's or its agent's reliance on this information to qualify for  the presumption of compliance under paragraph (f)(2). For purposes of  the presumption of compliance under paragraph (f)(2), a creditor or its  agent may gather information about recent rates by using a reasonable  method that provides information about rates for appraisal services in  the geographic market of the relevant property; a creditor or its agent  may, but is not required to, use or perform a fee survey.</p><p class="depth0">3. Accounting for factors. Once recent rates in the relevant  geographic market have been identified, the creditor or its agent must  review the factors listed in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A)-(F) to determine the  appropriate rate for the current transaction. For example, if the recent  rates identified by the creditor or its agent were solely for appraisal  assignments in which the scope of work required consideration of two  comparable properties, but the current transaction required an appraisal  that considered three comparable properties, the creditor or its agent  might reasonably adjust the rate by an amount that accounts for the  increased scope of work, in addition to making any other appropriate  adjustments based on the remaining factors.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 42(f)(2)(i)(A)</p><p class="depth0">1. Type of property. The type of property may include, for example,  detached or attached single-family property, condominium or cooperative  unit, or manufactured home.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 42(f)(2)(i)(B)</p><p class="depth0">1. Scope of work. The scope of work may include, for example, the  type of inspection (such as exterior only or both interior and exterior)  or number of comparables required for the appraisal.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 42(f)(2)(i)(D)</p><p class="depth0">1. Fee appraiser qualifications. The fee appraiser qualifications  may include, for example, a state license or certification in accordance  with the minimum criteria issued by the Appraisal Qualifications Board  of the Appraisal Foundation, or completion of continuing education  courses on effective appraisal methods and related topics.</p><p class="depth0">2. Membership in professional appraisal organization. Paragraph  42(f)(2)(i)(D) does not override state or Federal laws prohibiting the  exclusion of an appraiser from consideration for an assignment solely by  virtue of membership or lack of membership in any particular appraisal  organization. See, e.g., 12 CFR 225.66(a).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 42(f)(2)(i)(E)</p><p class="depth0">1. Fee appraiser experience and professional record. The fee  appraiser's level of experience may include, for example, the fee  appraiser's years of service as a state-licensed or state-certified  appraiser, or years of service appraising properties in a particular  geographical area or of a particular type. The fee appraiser's  professional record may include, for example, whether the fee appraiser  has a past record of suspensions, disqualifications, debarments, or  judgments for waste, fraud, abuse or breach of legal or professional  standards.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 42(f)(2)(i)(F)</p><p class="depth0">1. Fee appraiser work quality. The fee appraiser's work quality may  include, for example, the past quality of appraisals performed by the  appraiser based on the written performance and review criteria of the  creditor or agent of the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 42(f)(2)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Restraining trade. Under Sec. 1026.42(f)(2)(ii)(A), creditor or  its agent would not qualify for the presumption of compliance under  paragraph (f)(2) if it engaged in any acts to restrain trade such as  entering into a price fixing or market allocation agreement that affect  the compensation of fee appraisers. For example, if appraisal management  company A and appraisal management company B agreed to compensate fee  appraisers at no more than a specific rate or range of rates, neither  appraisal management company would qualify for the presumption of  compliance. Likewise, if appraisal management company A and appraisal  management company B agreed that appraisal management company A would  limit its business to a certain portion of the relevant geographic  market and appraisal management company B would limit its business to a  different portion of the relevant geographic market, and as a result  each appraisal management company unilaterally set the fees paid to fee  appraisers in   their respective portions of the market, neither appraisal management  company would qualify for the presumption of compliance under paragraph  (f)(2).</p><p class="depth0">2. Acts of monopolization. Under Sec. 1026.42(f)(2)(ii)(B), a  creditor or its agent would not qualify for the presumption of  compliance under paragraph (f)(2) if it engaged in any act of  monopolization such as restricting entry into the relevant geographic  market or causing any person to leave the relevant geographic market,  resulting in anticompetitive effects that affect the compensation paid  to fee appraisers. For example, if only one appraisal management company  exists or is predominant in a particular market area, that appraisal  management company might not qualify for the presumption of compliance  if it entered into exclusivity agreements with all creditors in the  market or all fee appraisers in the market, such that other appraisal  management companies had to leave or could not enter the market. Whether  this behavior would be considered an anticompetitive act that affects  the compensation paid to fee appraisers depends on all of the facts and  circumstances, including applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">42(f)(3) Alternative Presumption of Compliance</p><p class="depth0">1. In general. A creditor and its agent are presumed to comply with  paragraph (f)(1) if the creditor or its agent determine the compensation  paid to a fee appraiser based on information about customary and  reasonable rates that satisfies the conditions in paragraph (f)(3) for  that information. Reliance on information satisfying the conditions in  paragraph (f)(3) is not a requirement for compliance with paragraph  (f)(1), but creates a presumption that the creditor or its agent has  complied. A person may rebut this presumption with evidence that the  rate of compensation paid to a fee appraiser by the creditor or its  agent is not customary and reasonable based on facts or information  other than third-party information satisfying the conditions of this  paragraph (f)(3). If a creditor or its agent does not rely on  information that meets the conditions in paragraph (f)(3), the  creditor's and its agent's compliance with paragraph (f)(1) is  determined based on all of the facts and circumstances without a  presumption of either compliance or violation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Geographic market. The meaning of ``geographic market'' for  purposes of paragraph (f) is explained in comment (f)(1)-1.</p><p class="depth0">3. Recent rates. Whether rates may reasonably be considered  ``recent'' depends on the facts and circumstances. Generally, ``recent''  rates would include rates charged within one year of the creditor's or  its agent's reliance on this information to qualify for the presumption  of compliance under paragraph (f)(3).</p><p class="depth0">42(f)(4) Definitions</p><p class="depth0">42(f)(4)(i) Fee Appraiser</p><p class="depth0">1.

Material failure to comply. For purposes of Sec. 1026.42(g)(1),  a material failure to comply is one that is likely to affect the value  assigned to the consumer's principal dwelling. The following are  examples of a material failure to comply with USPAP or ethical or  professional requirements:</p><p class="depth0">i.

Consumer credit. In general, Sec. 1026.43 applies to consumer  credit transactions secured by a dwelling, but certain dwelling-secured  consumer credit transactions are exempt or partially exempt from  coverage under Sec. 1026.43(a)(1) through (3). (See Sec. 1026.2(a)(12)  for the definition of ``consumer credit.'') Section 1026.43 does not  apply to an extension of credit primarily for a business, commercial, or  agricultural purpose, even if it is secured by a dwelling. See Sec.  1026.3 and associated commentary for guidance in determining the primary  purpose of an extension of credit. In addition, Sec. 1026.43 does not  apply to any change to an existing loan that is not treated as a  refinancing under Sec. 1026.20(a).</p><p class="depth0">2. Real property. ``Dwelling'' means a residential structure that  contains one to four units, whether or not the structure is attached to  real property. See Sec. 1026.2(a)(19). For purposes of Sec. 1026.43,  the term ``dwelling'' includes any real property to which the  residential structure is attached that also secures the covered  transaction. For example, for purposes of Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(i), the  value of the dwelling that secures the covered transaction includes the  value of any real property to which the residential structure is  attached that also secures the covered transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0">1. Renewable temporary or ``bridge'' loan. Under Sec.  1026.43(a)(3)(ii), a temporary or ``bridge'' loan with a term of 12  months or less is exempt from Sec. 1026.43(c) through (f). Examples of  such a loan are a loan to finance the purchase of a new dwelling where  the consumer plans to sell a current dwelling within 12 months and a  loan to finance the initial construction of a dwelling. Where a  temporary or ``bridge loan'' is renewable, the loan term does not  include any additional period of time that could result from a renewal  provision provided that any renewal possible under the loan contract is  for one year or less. For example, if a construction loan has an initial  loan term of 12 months but is renewable for another 12-month loan term,  the loan is exempt from Sec. 1026.43(c) through (f) because the initial  loan term is 12 months.</p><p class="depth0">2. Construction phase of a construction-to-permanent loan. Under  Sec. 1026.43(a)(3)(iii), a construction phase of 12 months or less of a  construction-to-permanent loan is exempt from Sec. 1026.43(c) through  (f). A construction-to-permanent loan is a potentially multiple-advance  loan to finance the construction, rehabilitation, or improvement of a  dwelling that may be permanently financed by the same creditor. For such  a loan, the construction phase and the permanent phase may be treated as  separate transactions for the purpose of compliance with Sec.  1026.43(c) through (f), and the construction phase of the loan is exempt  from Sec. 1026.43(c) through (f), provided the initial term is 12  months or less. See Sec. 1026.17(c)(6)(ii), allowing similar treatment  for disclosures. Where the construction phase of a construction-to- permanent loan is renewable for a period of one year or less, the term  of that construction phase does not include any additional period of  time that could result from a renewal provision. For example, if the  construction phase of a construction-to-permanent loan has an initial  term of 12 months but is renewable for another 12-month term before  permanent financing begins, the construction phase is exempt from Sec.  1026.43(c) through (f) because the initial term is 12 months. Any  renewal of one year or less also qualifies for the exemption. The  permanent phase of the loan is treated as a separate transaction and is  not exempt under Sec. 1026.43(a)(3)(iii). It may be a qualified  mortgage if it satisfies the appropriate requirements.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(a)(3)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">1. General. The requirements of Sec. 1026.43(c) through (f) do not  apply to an extension of credit made pursuant to a program administered  by a Housing Finance Agency, as defined under 24 CFR 266.5. Under the  exemption, the requirements of Sec. 1026.43(c) through (f) do not apply  to extensions of credit made by housing finance agencies and extensions  of credit made by intermediaries (e.g., private creditors) pursuant to a  program administered by a housing finance agency. For example, if a  creditor is extending credit, including a subordinate-lien covered  transaction, that will be made pursuant to a program administered by a  housing finance   agency, the creditor is exempt from the requirements of Sec. 1026.43(c)  through (f). Similarly, the creditor is exempt from the requirements of  Sec. 1026.43(c) through (f) regardless of whether the program  administered by a housing finance agency is funded by Federal, State, or  other sources.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(a)(3)(v)(D).</p><p class="depth0">1. General. An extension of credit is exempt from the requirements  of Sec. 1026.43(c) through (f) if the credit is extended by a creditor  described in Sec. 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D), provided the conditions  specified in that section are satisfied. The conditions specified in  Sec. 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(1) and (2) are determined according to  activity that occurred in the calendar year preceding the calendar year  in which the consumer's application was received. Section  1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(2) provides that, during the preceding calendar  year, the creditor must have extended credit only to consumers with  income that did not exceed the limit then in effect for low- and  moderate-income households, as specified in regulations prescribed by  the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to 24 CFR  570.3. For example, a creditor has satisfied the requirement in Sec.  1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(2) if the creditor extended credit only to consumers  with incomes that did not exceed the limit in effect on the dates the  creditor received each consumer's individual application. The condition  specified in Sec. 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(3), which relates to the current  extension of credit, provides that the extension of credit must be to a  consumer with income that does not exceed the limit specified in Sec.  1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(2) in effect on the date the creditor received the  consumer's application. For example, assume that a creditor with a tax  exemption ruling under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of  1986 has satisfied the conditions identified in Sec.  1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(1) and (2). If, on May 21, 2014, the creditor in  this example extends credit secured by a dwelling to a consumer whose  application reflected income in excess of the limit identified in Sec.  1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(2) in effect on the date the creditor received that  consumer's application, the creditor has not satisfied the condition in  Sec. 1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(3) and this extension of credit is not exempt  from the requirements of Sec. 1026.43(c) through (f).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(a)(3)(vi).</p><p class="depth0">1. General. The requirements of Sec. 1026.43(c) through (f) do not  apply to a mortgage loan modification made in connection with a program  authorized by sections 101 and 109 of the Emergency Economic  Stabilization Act of 2008. If a creditor is underwriting an extension of  credit that is a refinancing, as defined by Sec. 1026.20(a), that will  be made pursuant to a program authorized by sections 101 and 109 of the  Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, the creditor also need not  comply with Sec. 1026.43(c) through (f). A creditor need not determine  whether the mortgage loan modification is considered a refinancing under  Sec. 1026.20(a) for purposes of determining applicability of Sec.  1026.43; if the transaction is made in connection with these programs,  the requirements of Sec. 1026.43(c) through (f) do not apply. In  addition, if a creditor underwrites a new extension of credit, such as a  subordinate-lien mortgage loan, that will be made pursuant to a program  authorized by sections 101 and 109 of the Emergency Economic  Stabilization Act of 2008, the creditor need not comply with the  requirements of Sec. 1026.43(c) through (f).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(a)(3)(vii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirements of exclusion. Section 1026.43(a)(3)(vii) excludes  certain transactions from the credit extension limit set forth in Sec.  1026.43(a)(3)(v)(D)(1), provided a transaction meets several conditions.  The terms of the credit contract must satisfy the conditions that the  transaction not require the payment of interest under Sec.  1026.43(a)(3)(vii)(C) and that repayment of the amount of credit  extended be forgiven or deferred in accordance with Sec.  1026.43(a)(3)(vii)(D). The other requirements of Sec.  1026.43(a)(3)(vii) need not be reflected in the credit contract, but the  creditor must retain evidence of compliance with those provisions, as  required by Sec. 1026.25(a). In particular, the creditor must have  information reflecting that the total of closing costs imposed in  connection with the transaction is less than 1 percent of the amount of  credit extended and include no charges other than recordation,  application, and housing counseling fees, in accordance with Sec.  1026.43(a)(3)(vii)(E). Unless an itemization of the amount financed  sufficiently details this requirement, the creditor must establish  compliance with Sec. 1026.43(a)(3)(vii)(E) by some other written  document and retain it in accordance with Sec. 1026.25(a).</p><p class="depth0">43(b) Definitions.</p><p class="depth0">43(b)(1) Covered transaction.</p><p class="depth0">1. The definition of covered transaction restates the scope of the  rule as described at Sec. 1026.43(a).</p><p class="depth0">43(b)(3) Fully indexed rate.</p><p class="depth0">1. Discounted and premium adjustable-rate transactions. In some  adjustable-rate transactions, creditors may set an initial interest rate  that is not determined by the index or formula used to make later  interest rate adjustments. In some cases, the initial rate charged to  consumers is lower than the rate would be if it were calculated using  the index or formula that will apply after recast, as determined at  consummation (i.e., a ``discounted rate''). In other cases, the initial  rate may be higher (i.e., a ``premium rate''). For purposes of  determining the fully indexed rate where the initial interest rate is  not determined using the index or formula for subsequent interest rate  adjustments, the creditor must use the interest rate that   would have applied had the creditor used such index or formula plus  margin at the time of consummation. That is, in determining the fully  indexed rate, the creditor must not take into account any discounted or  premium rate. To illustrate, assume an adjustable-rate transaction where  the initial interest rate is not based on an index or formula, or is  based on an index or formula that will not apply after recast, and is  set at 5 percent for the first five years. The loan agreement provides  that future interest rate adjustments will be calculated based on a  specific index plus a 3 percent margin. If the value of the index at  consummation is 5 percent, the interest rate that would have been  applied at consummation had the creditor based the initial rate on this  index is 8 percent (5 percent plus 3 percent margin). For purposes of  Sec. 1026.43(b)(3), the fully indexed rate is 8 percent. For discussion  of payment calculations based on the greater of the fully indexed rate  or premium rate for purposes of the repayment ability determination  under Sec. 1026.43(c), see Sec. 1026.43(c)(5)(i) and comment  43(c)(5)(i)-2.</p><p class="depth0">2. Index or formula value at consummation. The value at consummation  of the index or formula need not be used if the contract provides for a  delay in the implementation of changes in an index value or formula. For  example, if the contract specifies that rate changes are based on the  index value in effect 45 days before the change date, the creditor may  use any index value in effect during the 45 days before consummation in  calculating the fully indexed rate.</p><p class="depth0">3. Interest rate adjustment caps. If the terms of the legal  obligation contain a periodic interest rate adjustment cap that would  prevent the initial rate, at the time of the first adjustment, from  changing to the rate determined using the index or formula value at  consummation (i.e., the fully indexed rate), the creditor must not give  any effect to that rate cap when determining the fully indexed rate.  That is, a creditor must determine the fully indexed rate without taking  into account any periodic interest rate adjustment cap that may limit  how quickly the fully indexed rate may be reached at any time during the  loan term under the terms of the legal obligation. To illustrate, assume  an adjustable-rate mortgage has an initial fixed rate of 5 percent for  the first three years of the loan, after which the rate will adjust  annually to a specified index plus a margin of 3 percent. The loan  agreement provides for a 2 percent annual interest rate adjustment cap,  and a lifetime maximum interest rate of 10 percent. The index value in  effect at consummation is 4.5 percent; the fully indexed rate is 7.5  percent (4.5 percent plus 3 percent), regardless of the 2 percent annual  interest rate adjustment cap that would limit when the fully indexed  rate would take effect under the terms of the legal obligation.</p><p class="depth0">4. Lifetime maximum interest rate. A creditor may choose, in its  sole discretion, to take into account the lifetime maximum interest rate  provided under the terms of the legal obligation when determining the  fully indexed rate. To illustrate, assume an adjustable-rate mortgage  has an initial fixed rate of 5 percent for the first three years of the  loan, after which the rate will adjust annually to a specified index  plus a margin of 3 percent. The loan agreement provides for a 2 percent  annual interest rate adjustment cap and a lifetime maximum interest rate  of 7 percent. The index value in effect at consummation is 4.5 percent;  under the generally applicable rule, the fully indexed rate is 7.5  percent (4.5 percent plus 3 percent). Nevertheless, the creditor may  choose to use the lifetime maximum interest rate of 7 percent as the  fully indexed rate, rather than 7.5 percent, for purposes of Sec.  1026.43(b)(3). Furthermore, if the creditor chooses to use the lifetime  maximum interest rate and the loan agreement provides a range for the  maximum interest rate, then the creditor complies by using the highest  rate in that range as the maximum interest rate for purposes of Sec.  1026.43(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0">5. Step-rate and fixed-rate mortgages. Where the interest rate  offered under the terms of the legal obligation is not based on, and  does not vary with, an index or formula (i.e., there is no fully indexed  rate), the creditor must use the maximum interest rate that may apply at  any time during the loan term. To illustrate:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume a step-rate mortgage with an interest rate fixed at 6.5  percent for the first two years of the loan, 7 percent for the next  three years, and 7.5 percent thereafter for the remainder of loan term.  For purposes of this section, the creditor must use 7.5 percent, which  is the maximum rate that may apply during the loan term. ``Step-rate  mortgage'' is defined in Sec. 1026.18(s)(7)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume a fixed-rate mortgage with an interest rate at  consummation of 7 percent that is fixed for the 30-year loan term. For  purposes of this section, the maximum interest rate that may apply  during the loan term is 7 percent, which is the interest rate that is  fixed at consummation. ``Fixed-rate mortgage'' is defined in Sec.  1026.18(s)(7)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">43(b)(4) Higher-priced covered transaction.</p><p class="depth0">1. Average prime offer rate. The average prime offer rate is defined  in Sec. 1026.35(a)(2). For further explanation of the meaning of  ``average prime offer rate,'' and additional guidance on determining the  average prime offer rate, see comments 35(a)(2)-1 through -4.</p><p class="depth0">2. Comparable transaction. A higher-priced covered transaction is a  consumer credit transaction that is secured by the consumer's dwelling  with an annual percentage rate that exceeds by the specified amount   the average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction as of the date  the interest rate is set. The published tables of average prime offer  rates indicate how to identify a comparable transaction. See comment  35(a)(2)-2.</p><p class="depth0">3. Rate set. A transaction's annual percentage rate is compared to  the average prime offer rate as of the date the transaction's interest  rate is set (or ``locked'') before consummation. Sometimes a creditor  sets the interest rate initially and then re-sets it at a different  level before consummation. The creditor should use the last date the  interest rate is set before consummation.</p><p class="depth0">43(b)(5) Loan amount.</p><p class="depth0">1. Disbursement of the loan amount. The definition of ``loan  amount'' requires the creditor to use the entire loan amount as  reflected in the loan contract or promissory note, even though the loan  amount may not be fully disbursed at consummation. For example, assume  the consumer enters into a loan agreement where the consumer is  obligated to repay the creditor $200,000 over 15 years, but only  $100,000 is disbursed at consummation and the remaining $100,000 will be  disbursed during the year following consummation in a series of advances  ($25,000 each quarter). For purposes of this section, the creditor must  use the loan amount of $200,000, even though the loan agreement provides  that only $100,000 will be disbursed to the consumer at consummation.  Generally, creditors should rely on Sec. 1026.17(c)(6) and associated  commentary regarding treatment of multiple-advance and construction-to- permanent loans as single or multiple transactions. See also comment  43(a)(3)-2.</p><p class="depth0">43(b)(6) Loan term.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. The loan term is the period of time it takes to repay  the loan amount in full. For example, a loan with an initial discounted  rate that is fixed for the first two years, and that adjusts  periodically for the next 28 years has a loan term of 30 years, which is  the amortization period on which the periodic amortizing payments are  based.</p><p class="depth0">43(b)(7) Maximum loan amount.</p><p class="depth0">1. Calculation of maximum loan amount. For purposes of Sec.  1026.43(c)(2)(iii) and (c)(5)(ii)(C), a creditor must determine the  maximum loan amount for a negative amortization loan by using the loan  amount plus any increase in principal balance that can result from  negative amortization based on the terms of the legal obligation. In  determining the maximum loan amount, a creditor must assume that the  consumer makes the minimum periodic payment permitted under the loan  agreement for as long as possible, until the consumer must begin making  fully amortizing payments; and that the interest rate rises as quickly  as possible after consummation under the terms of the legal obligation.  Thus, creditors must assume that the consumer makes the minimum periodic  payment until any negative amortization cap is reached or until the  period permitting minimum periodic payments expires, whichever occurs  first. ``Loan amount'' is defined in Sec. 1026.43(b)(5); ``negative  amortization loan'' is defined in Sec. 1026.18(s)(7)(v).</p><p class="depth0">2. Assumed interest rate. In calculating the maximum loan amount for  an adjustable-rate mortgage that is a negative amortization loan, the  creditor must assume that the interest rate will increase as rapidly as  possible after consummation, taking into account any periodic interest  rate adjustment caps provided in the loan agreement. For an adjustable- rate mortgage with a lifetime maximum interest rate but no periodic  interest rate adjustment cap, the creditor must assume that the interest  rate increases to the maximum lifetime interest rate at the first  adjustment.</p><p class="depth0">3. Examples. The following are examples of how to determine the  maximum loan amount for a negative amortization loan (all amounts shown  are rounded, and all amounts are calculated using non-rounded values):</p><p class="depth0">i. Adjustable-rate mortgage with negative amortization. A. Assume an  adjustable-rate mortgage in the amount of $200,000 with a 30-year loan  term. The loan agreement provides that the consumer can make minimum  monthly payments that cover only part of the interest accrued each month  until the principal balance reaches 115 percent of its original balance  (i.e., a negative amortization cap of 115 percent) or for the first five  years of the loan (60 monthly payments), whichever occurs first. The  introductory interest rate at consummation is 1.5 percent. One month  after the first day of the first full calendar month following  consummation, the interest rate adjusts and will adjust monthly  thereafter based on the specified index plus a margin of 3.5 percent.  The maximum lifetime interest rate is 10.5 percent; there are no other  periodic interest rate adjustment caps that limit how quickly the  maximum lifetime rate may be reached. The minimum monthly payment for  the first year is based on the initial interest rate of 1.5 percent.  After that, the minimum monthly payment adjusts annually, but may  increase by no more than 7.5 percent over the previous year's payment.  The minimum monthly payment is $690 in the first year, $742 in the  second year, and $797 in the first part of the third year.</p><p class="depth0">B. To determine the maximum loan amount, assume that the initial  interest rate increases to the maximum lifetime interest rate of 10.5  percent at the first adjustment (i.e., the due date of the first  periodic monthly payment) and accrues at that rate until the loan is  recast. Assume the consumer makes the minimum monthly payments as  scheduled, which are capped at 7.5 percent from year-to-year. As a  result, the consumer's minimum monthly payments are   less than the interest accrued each month, resulting in negative  amortization (i.e., the accrued but unpaid interest is added to the  principal balance). Thus, assuming that the consumer makes the minimum  monthly payments for as long as possible and that the maximum interest  rate of 10.5 percent is reached at the first rate adjustment (i.e., the  due date of the first periodic monthly payment), the negative  amortization cap of 115 percent is reached on the due date of the 27th  monthly payment and the loan is recast. The maximum loan amount as of  the due date of the 27th monthly payment is $229,251.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Fixed-rate, graduated payment mortgage with negative  amortization. A loan in the amount of $200,000 has a 30-year loan term.  The loan agreement provides for a fixed interest rate of 7.5 percent,  and requires the consumer to make minimum monthly payments during the  first year, with payments increasing 12.5 percent over the previous year  every year for four years. The payment schedule provides for payments of  $943 in the first year, $1,061 in the second year, $1,193 in the third  year, $1,343 in the fourth year, and $1,511 for the remaining term of  the loan. During the first three years of the loan, the payments are  less than the interest accrued each month, resulting in negative  amortization. Assuming that the consumer makes the minimum periodic  payments for as long as possible, the maximum loan amount is $207,662,  which is reached at the end of the third year of the loan (on the due  date of the 36th monthly payment). See comment 43(c)(5)(ii)(C)-3  providing examples of how to determine the consumer's repayment ability  for a negative amortization loan.</p><p class="depth0">43(b)(8) Mortgage-related obligations.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Section 1026.43(b)(8) defines mortgage-related  obligations, which must be considered in determining a consumer's  ability to repay pursuant to Sec. 1026.43(c). Section 1026.43(b)(8)  includes, in the evaluation of mortgage-related obligations, fees and  special assessments owed to a condominium, cooperative, or homeowners  association. Section 1026.43(b)(8) includes ground rent and leasehold  payments in the definition of mortgage-related obligations. See  commentary to Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(v) regarding the requirement to take  into account any mortgage-related obligations for purposes of  determining a consumer's ability to repay.</p><p class="depth0">2. Property taxes. Section 1026.43(b)(8) includes property taxes in  the evaluation of mortgage-related obligations. Obligations that are  related to the ownership or use of real property and paid to a taxing  authority, whether on a monthly, quarterly, annual, or other basis, are  property taxes for purposes of Sec. 1026.43(b)(8). Section  1026.43(b)(8) includes obligations that are equivalent to property  taxes, even if such obligations are not denominated as ``taxes.'' For  example, governments may establish or allow independent districts with  the authority to impose levies on properties within the district to fund  a special purpose, such as a local development bond district, water  district, or other public purpose. These levies may be referred to as  taxes, assessments, surcharges, or by some other name. For purposes of  Sec. 1026.43(b)(8), these are property taxes and are included in the  determination of mortgage-related obligations.</p><p class="depth0">3. Insurance premiums and similar charges. Section 1026.43(b)(8)  includes in the evaluation of mortgage-related obligations premiums and  similar charges identified in Sec. 1026.4(b)(5), (7), (8), or (10) that  are required by the creditor. This includes all premiums or charges  related to coverage protecting the creditor against a consumer's  default, credit loss, collateral loss, or similar loss, if the consumer  is required to pay the premium or charge. For example, if Federal law  requires flood insurance to be obtained in connection with the mortgage  loan, the flood insurance premium is a mortgage-related obligation for  purposes of Sec. 1026.43(b)(8). Section 1026.43(b)(8) does not include  premiums or similar charges identified in Sec. 1026.4(b)(5), (7), (8),  or (10) that are not required by the creditor and that the consumer  purchases voluntarily. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. If a creditor does not require earthquake insurance to be  obtained in connection with the mortgage loan, but the consumer  voluntarily chooses to purchase such insurance, the earthquake insurance  premium is not a mortgage-related obligation for purposes of Sec.  1026.43(b)(8).</p><p class="depth0">ii. If a creditor requires a minimum amount of coverage for  homeowners' insurance and the consumer voluntarily chooses to purchase a  more comprehensive amount of coverage, the portion of the premium  allocated to the required minimum coverage is a mortgage-related  obligation for purposes of Sec. 1026.43(b)(8), while the portion of the  premium allocated to the more comprehensive coverage voluntarily  purchased by the consumer is not a mortgage-related obligation for  purposes of Sec. 1026.43(b)(8).</p><p class="depth0">iii. If the consumer purchases insurance or similar coverage not  required by the creditor at consummation without having requested the  specific non-required insurance or similar coverage and without having  agreed to the premium or charge for the specific non-required insurance  or similar coverage prior to consummation, the premium or charge is not  voluntary for purposes of Sec. 1026.43(b)(8) and is a mortgage-related  obligation.</p><p class="depth0">4. Mortgage insurance, guarantee, or similar charges. Section  1026.43(b)(8) includes in the evaluation of mortgage-related obligations  premiums or charges protecting the creditor against the consumer's  default or other credit loss. This includes all premiums or similar  charges, whether denominated as mortgage   insurance, guarantee, or otherwise, as determined according to  applicable State or Federal law. For example, monthly ``private mortgage  insurance'' payments paid to a non-governmental entity, annual  ``guarantee fee'' payments required by a Federal housing program, and a  quarterly ``mortgage insurance'' payment paid to a State agency  administering a housing program are all mortgage-related obligations for  purposes of Sec. 1026.43(b)(8). Section 1026.43(b)(8) includes these  charges in the definition of mortgage-related obligations if the  creditor requires the consumer to pay them, even if the consumer is not  legally obligated to pay the charges under the terms of the insurance  program. For example, if a mortgage insurance program obligates the  creditor to make recurring mortgage insurance payments, and the creditor  requires the consumer to reimburse the creditor for such recurring  payments, the consumer's payments are mortgage-related obligations for  purposes of Sec. 1026.43(b)(8). However, if a mortgage insurance  program obligates the creditor to make recurring mortgage insurance  payments, and the creditor does not require the consumer to reimburse  the creditor for the cost of the mortgage insurance payments, the  recurring mortgage insurance payments are not mortgage-related  obligations for purposes of Sec. 1026.43(b)(8).</p><p class="depth0">5. Relation to the finance charge. Section 1026.43(b)(8) includes in  the evaluation of mortgage-related obligations premiums and similar  charges identified in Sec. 1026.4(b)(5), (7), (8), or (10) that are  required by the creditor. These premiums and similar charges are  mortgage-related obligations regardless of whether the premium or  similar charge is excluded from the finance charge pursuant to Sec.  1026.4(d). For example, a premium for insurance against loss or damage  to the property written in connection with the credit transaction is a  premium identified in Sec. 1026.4(b)(8). If this premium is required by  the creditor, the premium is a mortgage-related obligation pursuant to  Sec. 1026.43(b)(8), regardless of whether the premium is excluded from  the finance charge pursuant to Sec. 1026.4(d)(2).</p><p class="depth0">43(b)(11) Recast.</p><p class="depth0">1. Date of the recast. The term ``recast'' means, for an adjustable- rate mortgage, the expiration of the period during which payments based  on the introductory fixed rate are permitted; for an interest-only loan,  the expiration of the period during which the interest-only payments are  permitted; and, for a negative amortization loan, the expiration of the  period during which negatively amortizing payments are permitted. For  adjustable-rate mortgages, interest-only loans, and negative  amortization loans, the date on which the recast is considered to occur  is the due date of the last monthly payment based on the introductory  fixed rate, the interest-only payment, or the negatively amortizing  payment, respectively. To illustrate: A loan in an amount of $200,000  has a 30-year loan term. The loan agreement provides for a fixed  interest rate and permits interest-only payments for the first five  years of the loan (60 months). The loan is recast on the due date of the  60th monthly payment. Thus, the term of the loan remaining as of the  date the loan is recast is 25 years (300 months).</p><p class="depth0">43(b)(12) Simultaneous loan.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Section 1026.43(b)(12) defines a simultaneous loan as  another covered transaction or a home equity line of credit (HELOC)  subject to Sec. 1026.40 that will be secured by the same dwelling and  made to the same consumer at or before consummation of the covered  transaction, whether it is made by the same creditor or a third-party  creditor. (As with all of Sec. 1026.43, the term ``dwelling'' includes  any real property attached to a dwelling.) For example, assume a  consumer will enter into a legal obligation that is a covered  transaction with Creditor A. Immediately prior to consummation of the  covered transaction with Creditor A, the consumer opens a HELOC that is  secured by the same dwelling with Creditor B. For purposes of this  section, the loan extended by Creditor B is a simultaneous loan. See  commentary to Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(iv) and (c)(6), discussing the  requirement to consider the consumer's payment obligation on any  simultaneous loan for purposes of determining the consumer's ability to  repay the covered transaction subject to this section.</p><p class="depth0">2. Same consumer. For purposes of the definition of ``simultaneous  loan,'' the term ``same consumer'' includes any consumer, as that term  is defined in Sec. 1026.2(a)(11), that enters into a loan that is a  covered transaction and also enters into another loan (e.g., second-lien  covered transaction or HELOC) secured by the same dwelling. Where two or  more consumers enter into a legal obligation that is a covered  transaction, but only one of them enters into another loan secured by  the same dwelling, the ``same consumer'' includes the person that has  entered into both legal obligations. For example, assume Consumer A and  Consumer B will both enter into a legal obligation that is a covered  transaction with a creditor. Immediately prior to consummation of the  covered transaction, Consumer B opens a HELOC that is secured by the  same dwelling with the same creditor; Consumer A is not a signatory to  the HELOC. For purposes of this definition, Consumer B is the same  consumer and the creditor must include the HELOC as a simultaneous loan.</p><p class="depth0">43(b)(13) Third-party record.</p><p class="depth0">1. Electronic records. Third-party records include records  transmitted electronically. For example, to verify a consumer's credit  history using third-party records as required by Sec.  1026.43(c)(2)(viii) and 1026.43(c)(3), a creditor   may use a credit report prepared by a consumer reporting agency that is  transmitted electronically.</p><p class="depth0">2. Forms. A record prepared by a third party includes a form a  creditor gives to a third party to provide information, even if the  creditor completes parts of the form unrelated to the information  sought. For example, if a creditor gives a consumer's employer a form  for verifying the consumer's employment status and income, the creditor  may fill in the creditor's name and other portions of the form unrelated  to the consumer's employment status or income.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(b)(13)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Reviewed record. Under Sec. 1026.43(b)(13)(i), a third-party  record includes a document or other record prepared by the consumer, the  creditor, the mortgage broker, or the creditor's or mortgage broker's  agent, if the record is reviewed by an appropriate third party. For  example, a profit-and-loss statement prepared by a self-employed  consumer and reviewed by a third-party accountant is a third-party  record under Sec. 1026.43(b)(13)(i). In contrast, a profit-and-loss  statement prepared by a self-employed consumer and reviewed by the  consumer's non-accountant spouse is not a third-party record under Sec.  1026.43(b)(13)(i).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(b)(13)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Creditor's records. Section 1026.43(b)(13)(iii) provides that a  third-party record includes a record the creditor maintains for an  account of the consumer held by the creditor. Examples of such accounts  include checking accounts, savings accounts, and retirement accounts.  Examples of such accounts also include accounts related to a consumer's  outstanding obligations to a creditor. For example, a third-party record  includes the creditor's records for a first-lien mortgage to a consumer  who applies for a subordinate-lien home equity loan.</p><p class="depth0">43(c) Repayment ability.</p><p class="depth0">43(c)(1) General requirement.</p><p class="depth0">1. Reasonable and good faith determination. i. General. Creditors  generally are required by Sec. 1026.43(c)(1) to make reasonable and  good faith determinations of consumers' ability to repay. Section  1026.43(c) and the accompanying commentary describe certain requirements  for making this ability-to-repay determination, but do not provide  comprehensive underwriting standards to which creditors must adhere. For  example, the rule and commentary do not specify how much income is  needed to support a particular level of debt or how credit history  should be weighed against other factors. So long as creditors consider  the factors set forth in Sec. 1026.43(c)(2) according to the  requirements of Sec. 1026.43(c), creditors are permitted to develop  their own underwriting standards and make changes to those standards  over time in response to empirical information and changing economic and  other conditions. Whether a particular ability-to-repay determination is  reasonable and in good faith will depend not only on the underwriting  standards adopted by the creditor, but on the facts and circumstances of  an individual extension of credit and how a creditor's underwriting  standards were applied to those facts and circumstances. A consumer's  statement or attestation that the consumer has the ability to repay the  loan is not indicative of whether the creditor's determination was  reasonable and in good faith.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Considerations. A. The following may be evidence that a  creditor's ability-to-repay determination was reasonable and in good  faith:</p><p class="depth0">1. The consumer demonstrated actual ability to repay the loan by  making timely payments, without modification or accommodation, for a  significant period of time after consummation or, for an adjustable- rate, interest-only, or negative-amortization mortgage, for a  significant period of time after recast;</p><p class="depth0">2. The creditor used underwriting standards that have historically  resulted in comparatively low rates of delinquency and default during  adverse economic conditions; or</p><p class="depth0">3. The creditor used underwriting standards based on empirically  derived, demonstrably and statistically sound models.</p><p class="depth0">B. In contrast, the following may be evidence that a creditor's  ability-to-repay determination was not reasonable or in good faith:</p><p class="depth0">1. The consumer defaulted on the loan a short time after  consummation or, for an adjustable-rate, interest-only, or negative- amortization mortgage, a short time after recast;</p><p class="depth0">2. The creditor used underwriting standards that have historically  resulted in comparatively high levels of delinquency and default during  adverse economic conditions;</p><p class="depth0">3. The creditor applied underwriting standards inconsistently or  used underwriting standards different from those used for similar loans  without reasonable justification;</p><p class="depth0">4. The creditor disregarded evidence that the underwriting standards  it used are not effective at determining consumers' repayment ability;</p><p class="depth0">5. The creditor disregarded evidence that the consumer may have  insufficient residual income to cover other recurring obligations and  expenses, taking into account the consumer's assets other than the  property securing the loan, after paying his or her monthly payments for  the covered transaction, any simultaneous loans, mortgage-related  obligations, and any current debt obligations; or</p><p class="depth0">6. The creditor disregarded evidence that the consumer would have  the ability to repay only if the consumer subsequently refinanced the  loan or sold the property securing the loan.</p><p class="depth0">C. All of the considerations listed in paragraphs (A) and (B) above  may be relevant to whether a creditor's ability-to-repay determination  was reasonable and in good faith. However, these considerations are not  requirements or prohibitions with which creditors must comply, nor are  they elements of a claim that a consumer must prove to establish a  violation of the ability-to-repay requirements. For example, creditors  are not required to validate their underwriting criteria using  mathematical models. These considerations also are not absolute in their  application; instead they exist on a continuum and may apply to varying  degrees. For example, the longer a consumer successfully makes timely  payments after consummation or recast the less likely it is that the  creditor's determination of ability to repay was unreasonable or not in  good faith. Finally, each of these considerations must be viewed in the  context of all facts and circumstances relevant to a particular  extension of credit. For example, in some cases inconsistent application  of underwriting standards may indicate that a creditor is manipulating  those standards to approve a loan despite a consumer's inability to  repay. The creditor's ability-to-repay determination therefore may be  unreasonable or in bad faith. However, in other cases inconsistently  applied underwriting standards may be the result of, for example,  inadequate training and may nonetheless yield a reasonable and good  faith ability-to-repay determination in a particular case. Similarly,  although an early payment default on a mortgage will often be persuasive  evidence that the creditor did not have a reasonable and good faith  belief in the consumer's ability to repay (and such evidence may even be  sufficient to establish a prima facie case of an ability-to-repay  violation), a particular ability-to-repay determination may be  reasonable and in good faith even though the consumer defaulted shortly  after consummation if, for example, the consumer experienced a sudden  and unexpected loss of income. In contrast, an ability-to-repay  determination may be unreasonable or not in good faith even though the  consumer made timely payments for a significant period of time if, for  example, the consumer was able to make those payments only by foregoing  necessities such as food and heat.</p><p class="depth0">2. Repayment ability at consummation. Section 1026.43(c)(1) requires  the creditor to determine, at or before the time the loan is  consummated, that a consumer will have a reasonable ability to repay the  loan. A change in the consumer's circumstances after consummation (for  example, a significant reduction in income due to a job loss or a  significant obligation arising from a major medical expense) that cannot  be reasonably anticipated from the consumer's application or the records  used to determine repayment ability is not relevant to determining a  creditor's compliance with the rule. However, if the application or  records considered at or before consummation indicate there will be a  change in a consumer's repayment ability after consummation (for  example, if a consumer's application states that the consumer plans to  retire within 12 months without obtaining new employment or that the  consumer will transition from full-time to part-time employment), the  creditor must consider that information under the rule.</p><p class="depth0">3. Interaction with Regulation B. Section 1026.43(c)(1) does not  require or permit the creditor to make inquiries or verifications  prohibited by Regulation B, 12 CFR part 1002.</p><p class="depth0">43(c)(2) Basis for determination.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Section 1026.43(c)(2) sets forth factors creditors must  consider when making the ability-to-repay determination required under  Sec. 1026.43(c)(1) and the accompanying commentary provides guidance  regarding these factors. Creditors must conform to these requirements  and may rely on guidance provided in the commentary. However, Sec.  1026.43(c) and the accompanying commentary do not provide comprehensive  guidance on definitions and other technical underwriting criteria  necessary for evaluating these factors in practice. So long as a  creditor complies with the provisions of Sec. 1026.43(c), the creditor  is permitted to use its own definitions and other technical underwriting  criteria. A creditor may, but is not required to, look to guidance  issued by entities such as the Federal Housing Administration, the U.S.  Department of Veterans Affairs, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or  Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac while operating under the conservatorship of  the Federal Housing Finance Agency. For example, a creditor may refer to  such guidance to classify particular inflows, obligations, or property  as ``income,'' ``debt,'' or ``assets.'' Similarly, a creditor may refer  to such guidance to determine what information to use when evaluating  the income of a self-employed or seasonally employed consumer or what  information to use when evaluating the credit history of a consumer who  has obtained few or no extensions of traditional ``credit'' as defined  in Sec. 1026.2(a)(14). These examples are illustrative, and creditors  are not required to conform to guidance issued by these or other such  entities. However, as required by Sec. 1026.43(c)(1), a creditor must  ensure that its underwriting criteria, as applied to the facts and  circumstances of a particular extension of credit, result in a  reasonable, good faith determination of a consumer's ability to repay.  For example, a definition used in underwriting that is reasonable in  isolation may lead to ability-to-repay determinations that are  unreasonable or not in good faith when considered in the context of a  creditor's underwriting standards or   when adopted or applied in bad faith. Similarly, an ability-to-repay  determination is not unreasonable or in bad faith merely because the  underwriting criteria used included a definition that was by itself  unreasonable.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(c)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Income or assets generally. A creditor may base its determination  of repayment ability on current or reasonably expected income from  employment or other sources, assets other than the dwelling that secures  the covered transaction, or both. The creditor may consider any type of  current or reasonably expected income, including, for example, the  following: salary; wages; self-employment income; military or reserve  duty income; bonus pay; tips; commissions; interest payments; dividends;  retirement benefits or entitlements; rental income; royalty payments;  trust income; public assistance payments; and alimony, child support,  and separate maintenance payments. The creditor may consider any of the  consumer's assets, other than the value of the dwelling that secures the  covered transaction, including, for example, the following: funds in a  savings or checking account, amounts vested in a retirement account,  stocks, bonds, certificates of deposit, and amounts available to the  consumer from a trust fund. (As stated in Sec. 1026.43(a), the value of  the dwelling includes the value of the real property to which the  residential structure is attached, if the real property also secures the  covered transaction.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Income or assets relied on. A creditor need consider only the  income or assets necessary to support a determination that the consumer  can repay the covered transaction. For example, if a consumer's loan  application states that the consumer earns an annual salary from both a  full-time job and a part-time job and the creditor reasonably determines  that the consumer's income from the full-time job is sufficient to repay  the loan, the creditor need not consider the consumer's income from the  part-time job. Further, a creditor need verify only the income (or  assets) relied on to determine the consumer's repayment ability. See  comment 43(c)(4)-1.</p><p class="depth0">3. Reasonably expected income. If a creditor relies on expected  income in excess of the consumer's income, either in addition to or  instead of current income, the expectation that the income will be  available for repayment must be reasonable and verified with third-party  records that provide reasonably reliable evidence of the consumer's  expected income. For example, if the creditor relies on an expectation  that a consumer will receive an annual bonus, the creditor may verify  the basis for that expectation with records that show the consumer's  past annual bonuses, and the expected bonus must bear a reasonable  relationship to the past bonuses. Similarly, if the creditor relies on a  consumer's expected salary from a job the consumer has accepted and will  begin after receiving an educational degree, the creditor may verify  that expectation with a written statement from an employer indicating  that the consumer will be employed upon graduation at a specified  salary.</p><p class="depth0">4. Seasonal or irregular income. A creditor reasonably may determine  that a consumer can make periodic loan payments even if the consumer's  income, such as self-employment income, is seasonal or irregular. For  example, assume a consumer receives seasonal income from the sale of  crops or from agricultural employment. Each year, the consumer's income  arrives during only a few months. If the creditor determines that the  consumer's annual income divided equally across 12 months is sufficient  for the consumer to make monthly loan payments, the creditor reasonably  may determine that the consumer can repay the loan, even though the  consumer may not receive income during certain months.</p><p class="depth0">5. Multiple applicants. When two or more consumers apply for an  extension of credit as joint obligors with primary liability on an  obligation, Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(i) does not require the creditor to  consider income or assets that are not needed to support the creditor's  repayment ability determination. If the income or assets of one  applicant are sufficient to support the creditor's repayment ability  determination, the creditor is not required to consider the income or  assets of the other applicant. For example, if a husband and wife  jointly apply for a loan and the creditor reasonably determines that the  wife's income is sufficient to repay the loan, the creditor is not  required to consider the husband's income.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(c)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Employment status and income. Employment status need not be full- time, and employment need not occur at regular intervals. If, in  determining the consumer's repayment ability, the creditor relies on  income from the consumer's employment, then that employment may be, for  example, full-time, part-time, seasonal, irregular, military, or self- employment, so long as the creditor considers those characteristics of  the employment. Under Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(ii), a creditor must verify a  consumer's current employment status only if the creditor relies on the  consumer's employment income in determining the consumer's repayment  ability. For example, if a creditor relies wholly on a consumer's  investment income to determine repayment ability, the creditor need not  verify or document employment status. See comments 43(c)(2)(i)-5 and  43(c)(4)-2 for guidance on which income to consider when multiple  consumers apply jointly for a loan.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(c)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">1. General. For purposes of the repayment ability determination  required under Sec. 1026.43(c)(2), a creditor must consider the  consumer's monthly payment on a covered transaction that is calculated  as required under Sec. 1026.43(c)(5).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(c)(2)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">1. Home equity lines of credit. For purposes of Sec.  1026.43(c)(2)(iv), a simultaneous loan includes any covered transaction  or home equity line of credit (HELOC) subject to Sec. 1026.40 that will  be made to the same consumer at or before consummation of the covered  transaction and secured by the same dwelling that secures the covered  transaction. A HELOC that is a simultaneous loan that the creditor knows  or has reason to know about must be considered as a mortgage obligation  in determining a consumer's ability to repay the covered transaction  even though the HELOC is not a covered transaction subject to Sec.  1026.43. See Sec. 1026.43(a) discussing the scope of this section.  ``Simultaneous loan'' is defined in Sec. 1026.43(b)(12). For further  explanation of ``same consumer,'' see comment 43(b)(12)-2.</p><p class="depth0">2. Knows or has reason to know. In determining a consumer's  repayment ability for a covered transaction under Sec. 1026.43(c)(2), a  creditor must consider the consumer's payment obligation on any  simultaneous loan that the creditor knows or has reason to know will be  or has been made at or before consummation of the covered transaction.  For example, where a covered transaction is a home purchase loan, the  creditor must consider the consumer's periodic payment obligation for  any ``piggyback'' second-lien loan that the creditor knows or has reason  to know will be used to finance part of the consumer's down payment. The  creditor complies with this requirement where, for example, the creditor  follows policies and procedures that are designed to determine whether  at or before consummation the same consumer has applied for another  credit transaction secured by the same dwelling. To illustrate, assume a  creditor receives an application for a home purchase loan where the  requested loan amount is less than the home purchase price. The  creditor's policies and procedures must require the consumer to state  the source of the down payment and provide verification. If the creditor  determines the source of the down payment is another extension of credit  that will be made to the same consumer at or before consummation and  secured by the same dwelling, the creditor knows or has reason to know  of the simultaneous loan and must consider the simultaneous loan.  Alternatively, if the creditor has information that suggests the down  payment source is the consumer's existing assets, the creditor would be  under no further obligation to determine whether a simultaneous loan  will be extended at or before consummation of the covered transaction.  The creditor is not obligated to investigate beyond reasonable  underwriting policies and procedures to determine whether a simultaneous  loan will be extended at or before consummation of the covered  transaction.</p><p class="depth0">3. Scope of timing. For purposes of Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(iv), a  simultaneous loan includes a loan that comes into existence concurrently  with the covered transaction subject to Sec. 1026.43(c). A simultaneous  loan does not include a credit transaction that occurs after  consummation of the covered transaction that is subject to this section.  However, any simultaneous loan that specifically covers closing costs of  the covered transaction, but is scheduled to be extended after  consummation must be considered for the purposes of Sec.  1026.43(c)(2)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(c)(2)(v).</p><p class="depth0">1. General. A creditor must include in its repayment ability  assessment the consumer's monthly payment for mortgage-related  obligations, such as the expected property taxes and premiums or similar  charges identified in Sec. 1026.4(b)(5), (7), (8), or (10) that are  required by the creditor. See Sec. 1026.43(b)(8) defining the term  ``mortgage-related obligations.'' Mortgage-related obligations must be  included in the creditor's determination of repayment ability regardless  of whether the amounts are included in the monthly payment or whether  there is an escrow account established. Section 1026.43(c)(2)(v)  includes only payments that occur on an ongoing or recurring basis in  the evaluation of the consumer's monthly payment for mortgage-related  obligations. One-time charges, or obligations satisfied at or before  consummation, are not ongoing or recurring, and are therefore not part  of the consumer's monthly payment for purposes of Sec.  1026.43(c)(2)(v). For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that a consumer will be required to pay property taxes, as  described in comment 43(b)(8)-2, on a quarterly, annual, or other basis  after consummation. Section 1026.43(c)(2)(v) includes these recurring  property taxes in the evaluation of the consumer's monthly payment for  mortgage-related obligations. However, if the consumer will incur a one- time charge to satisfy property taxes that are past due, Sec.  1026.43(c)(2)(v) does not include this one-time charge in the evaluation  of the consumer's monthly payment for mortgage-related obligations.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume that a consumer will be required to pay mortgage  insurance premiums, as described in comment 43(b)(8)-2, on a monthly,  annual, or other basis after consummation. Section 1026.43(c)(2)(v)  includes these recurring mortgage insurance payments in the evaluation  of the consumer's monthly payment for mortgage-related obligations.  However, if the consumer will incur a one-time fee or charge for  mortgage insurance or similar purposes, such as an up-front   mortgage insurance premium imposed at consummation, Sec.  1026.43(c)(2)(v) does not include this up-front mortgage insurance  premium in the evaluation of the consumer's monthly payment for  mortgage-related obligations.</p><p class="depth0">2. Obligations to an association, other than special assessments.  Section 1026.43(b)(8) defines mortgage-related obligations to include  obligations owed to a condominium, cooperative, or homeowners  association. However, Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(v) does not require a creditor  to include in the evaluation of the consumer's monthly payment for  mortgage-related obligations payments to such associations imposed in  connection with the extension of credit, or imposed as an incident to  the transfer of ownership, if such obligations are fully satisfied at or  before consummation. For example, if a homeowners association imposes a  one-time transfer fee on the transaction, and the consumer will pay the  fee at or before consummation, Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(v) does not require  the creditor to include this one-time transfer fee in the evaluation of  the consumer's monthly payment for mortgage-related obligations. Section  1026.43(c)(2)(v) also does not require the creditor to include this fee  in the evaluation of the consumer's monthly payment for mortgage-related  obligations if the consumer finances the fee in the loan amount.  However, if the consumer incurs the obligation and will satisfy the  obligation with recurring payments after consummation, regardless of  whether the obligation is escrowed, Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(v) requires the  creditor to include the transfer fee in the evaluation of the consumer's  monthly payment for mortgage-related obligations.</p><p class="depth0">3. Special assessments imposed by an association. Section  1026.43(b)(8) defines mortgage-related obligations to include special  assessments imposed by a condominium, cooperative, or homeowners  association. Section 1026.43(c)(2)(v) does not require a creditor to  include special assessments in the evaluation of the consumer's monthly  payment for mortgage-related obligations if the special assessments are  fully satisfied at or before consummation. For example, if a homeowners  association imposes a special assessment that the consumer will have to  pay in full at or before consummation, Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(v) does not  include the special assessment in the evaluation of the consumer's  monthly payment for mortgage-related obligations. Section  1026.43(c)(2)(v) does not require a creditor to include special  assessments in the evaluation of the consumer's monthly payment for  mortgage-related obligations if the special assessments are imposed as a  one-time charge. For example, if a homeowners association imposes a  special assessment that the consumer will have to satisfy in one  payment, Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(v) does not include this one-time special  assessment in the evaluation of the consumer's monthly payment for  mortgage-related obligations. However, if the consumer will pay the  special assessment on a recurring basis after consummation, regardless  of whether the consumer's payments for the special assessment are  escrowed, Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(v) requires the creditor to include this  recurring special assessment in the evaluation of the consumer's monthly  payment for mortgage-related obligations.</p><p class="depth0">4. Pro rata amount. For purposes of Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(v), the  creditor may divide the recurring payments for mortgage-related  obligations into monthly, pro rata amounts. In considering a mortgage- related obligation that is not paid monthly, if the mortgage loan is  originated pursuant to a government program the creditor may determine  the pro rata monthly amount of the mortgage-related obligation in  accordance with the specific requirements of that program. If the  mortgage loan is originated pursuant to a government program that does  not contain specific standards for determining the pro rata monthly  amount of the mortgage-related obligation, or if the mortgage loan is  not originated pursuant to a government program, the creditor complies  with Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(v) by dividing the total amount of a particular  non-monthly mortgage-related obligation by no more than the number of  months from the month that the non-monthly mortgage-related obligation  was due prior to consummation until the month that the non-monthly  mortgage-related obligation will be due after consummation. When  determining the pro rata monthly payment amount, the creditor may also  consider comment 43(c)(2)(v)-5, which explains that the creditor need  not project potential changes. The following examples further illustrate  how a creditor may determine the pro rata monthly amount of mortgage- related obligations, pursuant to Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(v):</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that a consumer applies for a mortgage loan on February  1st. Assume further that the subject property is located in a  jurisdiction where property taxes are paid in arrears on the first day  of October. The creditor complies with Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(v) by  determining the annual property tax amount owed in the prior October,  dividing the amount by 12, and using the resulting amount as the pro  rata monthly property tax payment amount for the determination of the  consumer's monthly payment for mortgage-related obligations. The  creditor complies even if the consumer will likely owe more in the next  year than the amount owed the prior October because the jurisdiction  normally increases the property tax rate annually, provided that the  creditor does not have knowledge of an increase in the property tax rate  at the time of underwriting.   See also comment 43(c)(2)(v)-5 regarding estimates of mortgage-related  obligations.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume that a subject property is located in a special water  district, the assessments for which are billed separately from local  property taxes. The creditor complies with Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(v) by  dividing the full amount that will be owed by the number of months in  the assessment period, and including the resulting amount in the  calculation of monthly mortgage-related obligations. However, Sec.  1026.43(c)(2)(v) does not require a creditor to adjust the monthly  amount to account for potential deviations from the average monthly  amount. For example, assume in this example that the special water  assessment is billed every eight months, that the consumer will have to  pay the first water district bill four months after consummation, and  that the seller will not provide the consumer with any funds to pay for  the seller's obligation (i.e., the four months prior to consummation).  Although the consumer will be required to budget twice the average  monthly amount to pay the first water district bill, Sec.  1026.43(c)(2)(v) does not require the creditor to use the increased  amount; the creditor complies with Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(v) by using the  average monthly amount.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Assume that the subject property is located in an area where  flood insurance is required by Federal law, and assume further that the  flood insurance policy premium is paid every three years following  consummation. The creditor complies with Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(v) by  dividing the three-year premium by 36 months and including the resulting  amount in the determination of the consumer's monthly payment for  mortgage-related obligations. The creditor complies even if the consumer  will not establish a monthly escrow for flood insurance.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Assume that the subject property is part of a homeowners  association that has imposed upon the seller a special assessment of  $1,200. Assume further that this special assessment will become the  consumer's obligation upon consummation of the transaction, that the  consumer is permitted to pay the special assessment in twelve $100  installments after consummation, and that the mortgage loan will not be  originated pursuant to a government program that contains specific  requirements for prorating special assessments. The creditor complies  with Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(v) by dividing the $1,200 special assessment by  12 months and including the resulting $100 monthly amount in the  determination of the consumer's monthly payment for mortgage-related  obligations. The creditor complies by using this calculation even if the  consumer intends to pay the special assessment in a manner other than  that used by the creditor in determining the monthly pro rata amount,  such as where the consumer intends to pay six $200 installments.</p><p class="depth0">5. Estimates. Estimates of mortgage-related obligations should be  based upon information that is known to the creditor at the time the  creditor underwrites the mortgage obligation. Information is known if it  is reasonably available to the creditor at the time of underwriting the  loan. Creditors may rely on guidance provided under comment 17(c)(2)(i)- 1 in determining if information is reasonably available. For purposes of  this section, the creditor need not project potential changes, such as  by estimating possible increases in taxes and insurance. See comment  43(c)(2)(v)-4 for additional examples discussing the projection of  potential changes. The following examples further illustrate the  requirements of Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(v):</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that the property is subject to a community governance  association, such as a homeowners association. The creditor complies  with Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(v) by relying on an estimate of mortgage- related obligations prepared by the homeowners association. In  accordance with the guidance provided under comment 17(c)(2)(i)-1, the  creditor need only exercise due diligence in determining mortgage- related obligations, and complies with Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(v) by relying  on the representations of other reliable parties in preparing estimates.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume that the homeowners association has imposed a special  assessment on the seller, but the seller does not inform the creditor of  the special assessment, the homeowners association does not include the  special assessment in the estimate of expenses prepared for the  creditor, and the creditor is unaware of the special assessment. The  creditor complies with Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(v) if it does not include the  special assessment in the determination of mortgage-related obligations.  The creditor may rely on the representations of other reliable parties,  in accordance with the guidance provided under comment 17(c)(2)(i)-1.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Assume that the homeowners association imposes a special  assessment after the creditor has completed underwriting, but prior to  consummation. The creditor does not violate Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(v) if  the creditor does not include the special assessment in the  determination of the consumer's monthly payment for mortgage-related  obligations, provided the homeowners association does not inform the  creditor about the special assessment during underwriting. Section  1026.43(c)(2)(v) does not require the creditor to re-underwrite the  loan. The creditor has complied with Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(v) by including  the obligations known to the creditor at the time the loan is  underwritten, even if the creditor learns of new mortgage-related  obligations before the transaction is consummated.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(c)(2)(vi).</p><p class="depth0">1. Consideration of current debt obligations. Section  1026.43(c)(2)(vi) requires creditors to   consider a consumer's current debt obligations and any alimony or child  support the consumer is required to pay. Examples of current debt  obligations include student loans, automobile loans, revolving debt, and  existing mortgages that will not be paid off at or before consummation.  Creditors have significant flexibility to consider current debt  obligations in light of attendant facts and circumstances, including  that an obligation is likely to be paid off soon after consummation. For  example, a creditor may take into account that an existing mortgage is  likely to be paid off soon after consummation because there is an  existing contract for sale of the property that secures that mortgage.  Similarly, creditors should consider whether debt obligations in  forbearance or deferral at the time of underwriting are likely to affect  the consumer's ability to repay based on the payment for which the  consumer will be liable upon expiration of the forbearance or deferral  period and other relevant facts and circumstances, such as when the  forbearance or deferral period will expire.</p><p class="depth0">2. Multiple applicants. When two or more consumers apply for an  extension of credit as joint obligors with primary liability on an  obligation, Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(vi) requires a creditor to consider the  debt obligations of all such joint applicants. For example, if a co- applicant is repaying a student loan at the time of underwriting, the  creditor complies with Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(vi) by considering the co- applicant's student loan obligation. If one consumer is merely a surety  or guarantor, Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(vi) does not require a creditor to  consider the debt obligations of such surety or guarantor. The  requirements of Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(vi) do not affect the disclosure  requirements of this part, such as, for example, Sec. Sec. 1026.17(d),  1026.23(b), 1026.31(e), 1026.39(b)(3), and 1026.46(f).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(c)(2)(vii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Monthly debt-to-income ratio and residual income. See Sec.  1026.43(c)(7) and its associated commentary regarding the definitions  and calculations for the monthly debt-to-income ratio and residual  income.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(c)(2)(viii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Consideration of credit history. ``Credit history'' may include  factors such as the number and age of credit lines, payment history, and  any judgments, collections, or bankruptcies. Section 1026.43(c)(2)(viii)  does not require creditors to obtain or consider a consolidated credit  score or prescribe a minimum credit score that creditors must apply. The  rule also does not specify which aspects of credit history a creditor  must consider or how various aspects of credit history should be weighed  against each other or against other underwriting factors. Some aspects  of a consumer's credit history, whether positive or negative, may not be  directly indicative of the consumer's ability to repay. A creditor  therefore may give various aspects of a consumer's credit history as  much or as little weight as is appropriate to reach a reasonable, good  faith determination of ability to repay. Where a consumer has obtained  few or no extensions of traditional ``credit,'' as defined in Sec.  1026.2(a)(14), a creditor may, but is not required to, look to  nontraditional credit references, such as rental payment history or  utility payments.</p><p class="depth0">2. Multiple applicants. When two or more consumers apply for an  extension of credit as joint obligors with primary liability on an  obligation, Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(viii) requires a creditor to consider  the credit history of all such joint applicants. If a consumer is merely  a surety or guarantor, Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(viii) does not require a  creditor to consider the credit history of such surety or guarantor. The  requirements of Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(viii) do not affect the disclosure  requirements of this part, such as, for example, Sec. Sec. 1026.17(d),  1026.23(b), 1026.31(e), 1026.39(b)(3), and 1026.46(f).</p><p class="depth0">43(c)(3) Verification using third-party records.</p><p class="depth0">1. Records specific to the individual consumer. Records a creditor  uses for verification under Sec. 1026.43(c)(3) and (4) must be specific  to the individual consumer. Records regarding average incomes in the  consumer's geographic location or average wages paid by the consumer's  employer, for example, are not specific to the individual consumer and  are not sufficient for verification.</p><p class="depth0">2. Obtaining records. To conduct verification under Sec.  1026.43(c)(3) and (4), a creditor may obtain records from a third-party  service provider, such as a party the consumer's employer uses to  respond to income verification requests, as long as the records are  reasonably reliable and specific to the individual consumer. A creditor  also may obtain third-party records directly from the consumer, likewise  as long as the records are reasonably reliable and specific to the  individual consumer. For example, a creditor using payroll statements to  verify the consumer's income, as allowed under Sec. 1026.43(c)(4)(iii),  may obtain the payroll statements from the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">3. Credit report as a reasonably reliable third-party record. A  credit report generally is considered a reasonably reliable third-party  record under Sec. 1026.43(c)(3) for purposes of verifying items  customarily found on a credit report, such as the consumer's current  debt obligations, monthly debts, and credit history. Section  1026.43(c)(3) generally does not require creditors to obtain additional  reasonably reliable third-party records to verify information contained  in a credit report. For example, if a credit report states the existence  and amount of a consumer's debt obligation, the creditor is not required   to obtain additional verification of the existence or amount of that  obligation. In contrast, a credit report does not serve as a reasonably  reliably third-party record for purposes of verifying items that do not  appear on the credit report. For example, certain monthly debt  obligations, such as legal obligations like alimony or child support,  may not be reflected on a credit report. Thus, a credit report that does  not list a consumer's monthly alimony obligation does not serve as a  reasonably reliable third-party record for purposes of verifying that  obligation. If a credit report reflects a current debt obligation that a  consumer has not listed on the application, the creditor complies with  Sec. 1026.43(c)(3) if the creditor considers the existence and amount  of the debt obligation as it is reflected in the credit report. However,  in some cases a creditor may know or have reason to know that a credit  report may be inaccurate in whole or in part. For example, a creditor  may have information indicating that a credit report is subject to a  fraud alert, extended alert, active duty alert, or similar alert  identified in 15 U.S.C. 1681c-1 or that a debt obligation listed on a  credit report is subject to a statement of dispute pursuant to 15 U.S.C.  1681i(b). A creditor may also have other reasonably reliable third-party  records or other information or evidence that the creditor reasonably  finds to be reliable that contradict the credit report or otherwise  indicate that the credit report is inaccurate. If a creditor knows or  has reason to know that a credit report may be inaccurate in whole or in  part, the creditor complies with Sec. 1026.43(c)(3) by disregarding an  inaccurate or disputed item, items, or credit report, but does not have  to obtain additional third-party records. The creditor may also, but is  not required, to obtain other reasonably reliable third-party records to  verify information with respect to which the credit report, or item  therein, may be inaccurate. For example, the creditor might obtain  statements or bank records regarding a particular debt obligation  subject to a statement of dispute. See also comment 43(c)(3)-6, which  describes a situation in which a consumer reports a debt obligation that  is not listed on a credit report.</p><p class="depth0">4. Verification of simultaneous loans. Although a credit report may  be used to verify current obligations, it will not reflect a  simultaneous loan that has not yet been consummated and may not reflect  a loan that has just recently been consummated. If the creditor knows or  has reason to know that there will be a simultaneous loan extended at or  before consummation, the creditor may verify the simultaneous loan by  obtaining third-party verification from the third-party creditor of the  simultaneous loan. For example, the creditor may obtain a copy of the  promissory note or other written verification from the third-party  creditor. For further guidance, see comments 43(c)(3)-1 and -2  discussing verification using third-party records.</p><p class="depth0">5. Verification of mortgage-related obligations. Creditors must make  the repayment ability determination required under Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)  based on information verified from reasonably reliable records. For  general guidance regarding verification see comments 43(c)(3)-1 and -2,  which discuss verification using third-party records. With respect to  the verification of mortgage-related obligations that are property taxes  required to be considered under Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(v), a record is  reasonably reliable if the information in the record was provided by a  governmental organization, such as a taxing authority or local  government. The creditor complies with Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(v) by relying  on property taxes referenced in the title report if the source of the  property tax information was a local taxing authority. With respect to  other information in a record provided by an entity assessing charges,  such as a homeowners association, the creditor complies with Sec.  1026.43(c)(2)(v) if it relies on homeowners association billing  statements provided by the seller. Records are also reasonably reliable  if the information in the record was obtained from a valid and legally  executed contract. For example, the creditor complies with Sec.  1026.43(c)(2)(v) by relying on the amount of monthly ground rent  referenced in the ground rent agreement currently in effect and  applicable to the subject property. Records, other than those discussed  above, may be reasonably reliable for purposes of Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(v)  if the source provided the information objectively.</p><p class="depth0">6. Verification of current debt obligations. Section 1026.43(c)(3)  does not require creditors to obtain additional records to verify the  existence or amount of obligations shown on a consumer's credit report  or listed on the consumer's application, absent circumstances described  in comment 43(c)(3)-3. Under Sec. 1026.43(c)(3)(iii), if a creditor  relies on a consumer's credit report to verify a consumer's current debt  obligations and the consumer's application lists a debt obligation not  shown on the credit report, the creditor may consider the existence and  amount of the obligation as it is stated on the consumer's application.  The creditor is not required to further verify the existence or amount  of the obligation, absent circumstances described in comment 43(c)(3)-3.</p><p class="depth0">7. Verification of credit history. To verify credit history, a  creditor may, for example, look to credit reports from credit bureaus or  to reasonably reliable third-party records that evidence nontraditional  credit references, such as evidence of rental payment history or public  utility payments.</p><p class="depth0">8. Verification of military employment. A creditor may verify the  employment status of military personnel by using a military   Leave and Earnings Statement or by using the electronic database  maintained by the Department of Defense to facilitate identification of  consumers covered by credit protections provided pursuant to 10 U.S.C.  987.</p><p class="depth0">43(c)(4) Verification of income or assets.</p><p class="depth0">1. Income or assets relied on. A creditor need consider, and  therefore need verify, only the income or assets the creditor relies on  to evaluate the consumer's repayment ability. See comment 43(c)(2)(i)-2.  For example, if a consumer's application states that the consumer earns  a salary and is paid an annual bonus and the creditor relies on only the  consumer's salary to evaluate the consumer's repayment ability, the  creditor need verify only the salary. See also comments 43(c)(3)-1 and - 2.</p><p class="depth0">2. Multiple applicants. If multiple consumers jointly apply for a  loan and each lists income or assets on the application, the creditor  need verify only the income or assets the creditor relies on in  determining repayment ability. See comment 43(c)(2)(i)-5.</p><p class="depth0">3. Tax-return transcript. Under Sec. 1026.43(c)(4), a creditor may  verify a consumer's income using an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax- return transcript, which summarizes the information in a consumer's  filed tax return, another record that provides reasonably reliable  evidence of the consumer's income, or both. A creditor may obtain a copy  of a tax-return transcript or a filed tax return directly from the  consumer or from a service provider. A creditor need not obtain the copy  directly from the IRS or other taxing authority. See comment 43(c)(3)-2.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(c)(4)(vi).</p><p class="depth0">1. Government benefits. In verifying a consumer's income, a creditor  may use a written or electronic record from a government agency of the  amount of any benefit payments or awards, such as a ``proof of income  letter'' issued by the Social Security Administration (also known as a  ``budget letter,'' ``benefits letter,'' or ``proof of award letter'').</p><p class="depth0">43(c)(5) Payment calculation.</p><p class="depth0">43(c)(5)(i) General rule.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. For purposes of Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(iii), a creditor  must determine the consumer's ability to repay the covered transaction  using the payment calculation methods set forth in Sec. 1026.43(c)(5).  The payment calculation methods differ depending on the type of credit  extended. The payment calculation method set forth in Sec.  1026.43(c)(5)(i) applies to any covered transaction that does not have a  balloon payment, or that is not an interest-only or negative  amortization loan, whether such covered transaction is a fixed-rate,  adjustable-rate or step-rate mortgage. The terms ``fixed-rate  mortgage,'' ``adjustable-rate mortgage,'' ``step-rate mortgage,''  ``interest-only loan'' and ``negative amortization loan'' are defined in  Sec. 1026.18(s)(7)(iii), (i), (ii), (iv) and (v), respectively. For the  meaning of the term ``balloon payment,'' see Sec. 1026.18(s)(5)(i). The  payment calculation methods set forth in Sec. 1026.43(c)(5)(ii) apply  to any covered transaction that is a loan with a balloon payment,  interest-only loan, or negative amortization loan. See comment  43(c)(5)(i)-5 and the commentary to Sec. 1026.43(c)(5)(ii), which  provide examples for calculating the monthly payment for purposes of the  repayment ability determination required under Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">2. Greater of the fully indexed rate or introductory rate; premium  adjustable-rate transactions. A creditor must determine a consumer's  repayment ability for the covered transaction using substantially equal,  monthly, fully amortizing payments that are based on the greater of the  fully indexed rate or any introductory interest rate. In some  adjustable-rate transactions, creditors may set an initial interest rate  that is not determined by the index or formula used to make later  interest rate adjustments. Sometimes, this initial rate charged to  consumers is lower than the rate would be if it were determined by using  the index plus margin, or formula (i.e., fully indexed rate). However,  an initial rate that is a premium rate is higher than the rate based on  the index or formula. In such cases, creditors must calculate the fully  amortizing payment based on the initial ``premium'' rate. ``Fully  indexed rate'' is defined in Sec. 1026.43(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0">3. Monthly, fully amortizing payments. Section 1026.43(c)(5)(i) does  not prescribe the terms or loan features that a creditor may choose to  offer or extend to a consumer, but establishes the calculation method a  creditor must use to determine the consumer's repayment ability for a  covered transaction. For example, the terms of the loan agreement may  require that the consumer repay the loan in quarterly or bi-weekly  scheduled payments, but for purposes of the repayment ability  determination, the creditor must convert these scheduled payments to  monthly payments in accordance with Sec. 1026.43(c)(5)(i)(B).  Similarly, the loan agreement may not require the consumer to make fully  amortizing payments, but for purposes of the repayment ability  determination under Sec. 1026.43(c)(5)(i), the creditor must convert  any non-amortizing payments to fully amortizing payments.</p><p class="depth0">4. Substantially equal. In determining whether monthly, fully  amortizing payments are substantially equal, creditors should disregard  minor variations due to payment-schedule irregularities and odd periods,  such as a long or short first or last payment period. That is, monthly  payments of principal and interest that repay the loan amount over the  loan term need not be equal, but the monthly payments should be  substantially the same without significant variation in the monthly  combined payments of both principal and interest. For example, where no   two monthly payments vary from each other by more than 1 percent  (excluding odd periods, such as a long or short first or last payment  period), such monthly payments would be considered substantially equal  for purposes of this section. In general, creditors should determine  whether the monthly, fully amortizing payments are substantially equal  based on guidance provided in Sec. 1026.17(c)(3) (discussing minor  variations), and Sec. 1026.17(c)(4)(i) through (iii) (discussing  payment-schedule irregularities and measuring odd periods due to a long  or short first period) and associated commentary.</p><p class="depth0">5. Examples. The following are examples of how to determine the  consumer's repayment ability based on substantially equal, monthly,  fully amortizing payments as required under Sec. 1026.43(c)(5)(i) (all  amounts shown are rounded, and all amounts are calculated using non- rounded values):</p><p class="depth0">i. Fixed-rate mortgage. A loan in an amount of $200,000 has a 30- year loan term and a fixed interest rate of 7 percent. For purposes of  Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(iii), the creditor must determine the consumer's  ability to repay the loan based on a payment of $1,331, which is the  substantially equal, monthly, fully amortizing payment that will repay  $200,000 over 30 years using the fixed interest rate of 7 percent.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Adjustable-rate mortgage with discount for five years. A loan in  an amount of $200,000 has a 30-year loan term. The loan agreement  provides for a discounted interest rate of 6 percent that is fixed for  an initial period of five years, after which the interest rate will  adjust annually based on a specified index plus a margin of 3 percent,  subject to a 2 percent annual periodic interest rate adjustment cap. The  index value in effect at consummation is 4.5 percent; the fully indexed  rate is 7.5 percent (4.5 percent plus 3 percent). Even though the  scheduled monthly payment required for the first five years is $1199,  for purposes of Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(iii) the creditor must determine the  consumer's ability to repay the loan based on a payment of $1,398, which  is the substantially equal, monthly, fully amortizing payment that will  repay $200,000 over 30 years using the fully indexed rate of 7.5  percent.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Step-rate mortgage. A loan in an amount of $200,000 has a 30- year loan term. The loan agreement provides that the interest rate will  be 6.5 percent for the first two years of the loan, 7 percent for the  next three years of the loan, and 7.5 percent thereafter. Accordingly,  the scheduled payment amounts are $1,264 for the first two years, $1,328  for the next three years, and $1,388 thereafter for the remainder of the  term. For purposes of Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(iii), the creditor must  determine the consumer's ability to repay the loan based on a payment of  $1,398, which is the substantially equal, monthly, fully amortizing  payment that would repay $200,000 over 30 years using the fully indexed  rate of 7.5 percent.</p><p class="depth0">43(c)(5)(ii) Special rules for loans with a balloon payment,  interest-only loans, and negative amortization loans.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(c)(5)(ii)(A).</p><p class="depth0">1. General. For loans with a balloon payment, the rules differ  depending on whether the loan is a higher-priced covered transaction, as  defined under Sec. 1026.43(b)(4), or is not a higher-priced covered  transaction because the annual percentage rate does not exceed the  applicable threshold calculated using the applicable average prime offer  rate (APOR) for a comparable transaction. ``Average prime offer rate''  is defined in Sec. 1026.35(a)(2); ``higher-priced covered transaction''  is defined in Sec. 1026.43(b)(4). For higher-priced covered  transactions with a balloon payment, the creditor must consider the  consumer's ability to repay the loan based on the payment schedule under  the terms of the legal obligation, including any required balloon  payment. For loans with a balloon payment that are not higher-priced  covered transactions, the creditor should use the maximum payment  scheduled during the first five years of the loan following the date on  which the first regular periodic payment will be due. ``Balloon  payment'' is defined in Sec. 1026.18(s)(5)(i).</p><p class="depth0">2. First five years after the date on which the first regular  periodic payment will be due. Under Sec. 1026.43(c)(5)(ii)(A)(1), the  creditor must determine a consumer's ability to repay a loan with a  balloon payment that is not a higher-priced covered transaction using  the maximum payment scheduled during the first five years (60 months)  after the date on which the first regular periodic payment will be due.  To illustrate:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume a loan that provides for regular monthly payments and a  balloon payment due at the end of a six-year loan term. The loan is  consummated on August 15, 2014, and the first monthly payment is due on  October 1, 2014. The first five years after the first monthly payment  end on October 1, 2019. The balloon payment must be made on the due date  of the 72nd monthly payment, which is September 1, 2020. For purposes of  determining the consumer's ability to repay the loan under Sec.  1026.43(c)(2)(iii), the creditor need not consider the balloon payment  that is due on September 1, 2020.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume a loan that provides for regular monthly payments and a  balloon payment due at the end of a five-year loan term. The loan is  consummated on August 15, 2014, and the first monthly payment is due on  October 1, 2014. The first five years after the first monthly payment  end on October 1, 2019. The balloon payment must be made on the due date  of the 60th monthly payment, which is September 1, 2019. For purposes of  determining the consumer's ability to repay the loan under Sec.  1026.43(c)(2)(iii), the creditor   must consider the balloon payment that is due on September 1, 2019.</p><p class="depth0">3. Renewable balloon-payment mortgage; loan term. A balloon-payment  mortgage that is not a higher-priced covered transaction could provide  that a creditor is unconditionally obligated to renew a balloon-payment  mortgage at the consumer's option (or is obligated to renew subject to  conditions within the consumer's control). See comment 17(c)(1)-11  discussing renewable balloon-payment mortgages. For purposes of this  section, the loan term does not include any period of time that could  result from a renewal provision. To illustrate, assume a three-year  balloon-payment mortgage that is not a higher-priced covered transaction  contains an unconditional obligation to renew for another three years at  the consumer's option. In this example, the loan term for the balloon- payment mortgage is three years, and not the potential six years that  could result if the consumer chooses to renew the loan. Accordingly, the  creditor must underwrite the loan using the maximum payment scheduled in  the first five years after consummation, which includes the balloon  payment due at the end of the three-year loan term.

A loan agreement provides for a fixed interest rate of 6  percent, which is below the APOR-calculated threshold for a comparable  transaction; thus the loan is not a higher-priced covered transaction.  The loan amount is $200,000, and the loan has a three-year loan term but  is amortized over 30 years. The monthly payment scheduled for the first  three years following consummation is $1,199, with a balloon payment of  $193,367 due at the end of the third year.

In  determining the maximum payment scheduled during the first five years  after the date on which the first regular periodic payment will be due,  the creditor must use a loan term of three years.

Balloon-payment mortgage with a six-year loan term; fixed  interest rate. A loan provides for a fixed interest rate of 6 percent,  which is below the APOR threshold for a comparable transaction, and  thus, the loan is not a higher-priced covered transaction. The loan  amount is $200,000, and the loan has a six-year loan term but is  amortized over 30 years. The loan is consummated on March 15, 2014, and  the monthly payment scheduled for the first six years following  consummation is $1,199, with the first monthly payment due on May 1,  2014. The first five years after the date on which the first regular  periodic payment will be due end on May 1, 2019. The balloon payment of  $183,995 is required on the due date of the 72nd monthly payment, which  is April 1, 2020 (more than five years after the date on which the first  regular periodic payment will be due). For purposes of Sec.  1026.43(c)(2)(iii), the creditor may determine the consumer's ability to  repay the loan based on the monthly payment of $1,199, and need not  consider the balloon payment of $183,995 due on April 1, 2020.</p><p class="depth0">5. Higher-priced covered transaction with a balloon payment. Where a  loan with a balloon payment is a higher-priced covered transaction, the  creditor must determine the consumer's repayment ability based on the  loan's payment schedule, including any balloon payment. For example (all  amounts are rounded): Assume a higher-priced covered transaction with a  fixed interest rate of 7 percent. The loan amount is $200,000 and the  loan has a ten year loan term, but is amortized over 30 years. The  monthly payment scheduled for the first ten years is $1,331, with a  balloon payment of $172,955. For purposes of Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(iii),  the creditor must consider the consumer's ability to repay the loan  based on the payment schedule that fully repays the loan amount,  including the balloon payment of $172,955.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(c)(5)(ii)(B).</p><p class="depth0">1.

For loans that permit interest-only payments, the  creditor must use the fully indexed rate or introductory rate, whichever  is greater, to calculate the substantially equal, monthly payment of  principal and interest that will repay the loan amount over the term of  the loan remaining as of the date the loan is recast. For discussion  regarding the fully indexed rate, and the meaning of ``substantially  equal,'' see comments 43(b)(3)-1 through -5 and 43(c)(5)(i)-4,  respectively.

Fixed-rate mortgage with interest-only payments for five years. A  loan in an amount of $200,000 has a 30-year loan term. The loan  agreement provides for a fixed interest rate of 7 percent, and permits  interest-only payments for the first five years. The monthly payment of  $1,167 scheduled for the first five years would cover only the interest  due. The loan is recast on the due date of the 60th monthly payment,  after which the scheduled monthly payments increase to $1,414, a monthly  payment that repays the loan amount of $200,000 over the 25 years  remaining as of the date the loan is recast (300 months). For purposes  of Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(iii), the creditor must determine the consumer's  ability to repay the loan based on a payment of $1,414, which is the  substantially equal, monthly, fully amortizing payment that would repay  $200,000 over the 25 years remaining as of the date the loan is recast  using the fixed interest rate of 7 percent.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Adjustable-rate mortgage with discount for three years and  interest-only payments for five years. A loan in an amount of $200,000  has a 30-year loan term, but provides for interest-only payments for the  first five years. The loan agreement provides for a discounted interest  rate of 5 percent that is fixed for an initial period of three years,  after which the interest rate will adjust each year based on a specified  index plus a margin of 3 percent, subject to an annual interest rate  adjustment cap of 2 percent. The index value in effect at consummation  is 4.5 percent; the fully indexed rate is 7.5 percent (4.5 percent plus  3 percent). The monthly payments for the first three years are $833. For  the fourth year, the payments are $1,167, based on an interest rate of 7  percent, calculated by adding the 2 percent annual adjustment cap to the  initial rate of 5 percent. For the fifth year, the payments are $1,250,  applying the fully indexed rate of 7.5 percent. These first five years  of payments will cover only the interest due. The loan is recast on the  due date of the 60th monthly payment, after which the scheduled monthly  payments increase to $1,478, a monthly payment that will repay the loan  amount of $200,000 over the remaining 25 years of the loan (300 months).  For purposes of Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(iii), the creditor must determine  the consumer's ability to repay the loan based on a monthly payment of  $1,478, which is the substantially equal, monthly payment of principal  and interest that would repay $200,000 over the 25 years remaining as of  the date the loan is recast using the fully indexed rate of 7.5 percent.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(c)(5)(ii)(C).</p><p class="depth0">1. General. For purposes of determining the consumer's ability to  repay a negative amortization loan, the creditor must use substantially  equal, monthly payments of principal and interest based on the fully  indexed rate or the introductory rate, whichever is greater, that will  repay the maximum loan amount over the term of the loan that remains as  of the date the loan is recast. Accordingly, before determining the  substantially equal, monthly payments the creditor must first determine  the maximum loan amount and the period of time that remains in the loan  term after the loan is recast. ``Recast'' is defined in Sec.  1026.43(b)(11). Second, the creditor must use the fully indexed rate or  introductory rate, whichever is greater, to calculate the substantially  equal, monthly payment amount that will repay the maximum loan amount  over the term of the loan remaining as of the date the loan is recast.  For discussion regarding the fully indexed rate and the meaning of  ``substantially equal,'' see comments 43(b)(3)-1 through -5 and  43(c)(5)(i)-4, respectively.

Term of loan. Under Sec. 1026.43(c)(5)(ii)(C), the relevant term  of the loan is the period of time that remains as of the date the terms  of the legal obligation recast. That is, the creditor must determine  substantially equal, monthly payments of principal and interest that  will repay the maximum loan amount based on the period of time that  remains after any negative amortization cap is triggered or any period  permitting minimum periodic payments expires, whichever occurs first.</p><p class="depth0">3. Examples. The following are examples of how to determine the  consumer's repayment ability based on substantially equal, monthly  payments of principal and interest as required under Sec.  1026.43(c)(5)(ii)(C) (all amounts shown are rounded, and all amounts are  calculated using non-rounded values):</p><p class="depth0">i. Adjustable-rate mortgage with negative amortization. A. Assume an  adjustable-rate mortgage in the amount of $200,000 with a 30-year loan  term. The loan agreement provides that the consumer can make minimum  monthly payments that cover only part of the interest accrued each month  until the   date on which the principal balance reaches 115 percent of its original  balance (i.e., a negative amortization cap of 115 percent) or for the  first five years of the loan (60 monthly payments), whichever occurs  first. The introductory interest rate at consummation is 1.5 percent.  One month after consummation, the interest rate adjusts and will adjust  monthly thereafter based on the specified index plus a margin of 3.5  percent. The index value in effect at consummation is 4.5 percent; the  fully indexed rate is 8 percent (4.5 percent plus 3.5 percent). The  maximum lifetime interest rate is 10.5 percent; there are no other  periodic interest rate adjustment caps that limit how quickly the  maximum lifetime rate may be reached. The minimum monthly payment for  the first year is based on the initial interest rate of 1.5 percent.  After that, the minimum monthly payment adjusts annually, but may  increase by no more than 7.5 percent over the previous year's payment.  The minimum monthly payment is $690 in the first year, $742 in the  second year, and $797 in the first part of the third year.</p><p class="depth0">B. To determine the maximum loan amount, assume that the interest  rate increases to the maximum lifetime interest rate of 10.5 percent at  the first adjustment (i.e., the due date of the first periodic monthly  payment), and interest accrues at that rate until the loan is recast.  Assume that the consumer makes the minimum monthly payments scheduled,  which are capped at 7.5 percent from year-to-year, for the maximum  possible time. Because the consumer's minimum monthly payments are less  than the interest accrued each month, negative amortization occurs  (i.e., the accrued but unpaid interest is added to the principal  balance). Thus, assuming that the consumer makes the minimum monthly  payments for as long as possible and that the maximum interest rate of  10.5 percent is reached at the first rate adjustment (i.e., the due date  of the first periodic monthly payment), the negative amortization cap of  115 percent is reached on the due date of the 27th monthly payment and  the loan is recast as of that date. The maximum loan amount as of the  due date of the 27th monthly payment is $229,251, and the remaining term  of the loan is 27 years and nine months (333 months).</p><p class="depth0">C. For purposes of Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(iii), the creditor must  determine the consumer's ability to repay the loan based on a monthly  payment of $1,716, which is the substantially equal, monthly payment of  principal and interest that will repay the maximum loan amount of  $229,251 over the remaining loan term of 333 months using the fully  indexed rate of 8 percent. See comments 43(b)(7)-1 and -2 discussing the  calculation of the maximum loan amount, and Sec. 1026.43(b)(11) for the  meaning of the term ``recast.''</p><p class="depth0">ii. Fixed-rate, graduated payment mortgage. A loan in the amount of  $200,000 has a 30-year loan term. The loan agreement provides for a  fixed interest rate of 7.5 percent, and requires the consumer to make  minimum monthly payments during the first year, with payments increasing  12.5 percent over the previous year every year for four years (the  annual payment cap). The payment schedule provides for payments of $943  in the first year, $1,061 in the second year, $1,193 in the third year,  $1,343 in the fourth year, and then requires $1,511 for the remaining  term of the loan. During the first three years of the loan, the payments  are less than the interest accrued each month, resulting in negative  amortization. Assuming the minimum payments increase year-to-year up to  the 12.5 percent payment cap, the consumer will begin making payments  that cover at least all of the interest accrued at the end of the third  year. Thus, the loan is recast on the due date of the 36th monthly  payment. The maximum loan amount on that date is $207,662, and the  remaining loan term is 27 years (324 months). For purposes of Sec.  1026.43(c)(2)(iii), the creditor must determine the consumer's ability  to repay the loan based on a monthly payment of $1,497, which is the  substantially equal, monthly payment of principal and interest that will  repay the maximum loan amount of $207,662 over the remaining loan term  of 27 years using the fixed interest rate of 7.5 percent.</p><p class="depth0">43(c)(6) Payment calculation for simultaneous loans.</p><p class="depth0">1. Scope. In determining the consumer's repayment ability for a  covered transaction under Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(iii), a creditor must  include consideration of any simultaneous loan which it knows, or has  reason to know, will be made at or before consummation of the covered  transaction. For a discussion of the standard ``knows or has reason to  know,'' see comment 43(c)(2)(iv)-2. For the meaning of the term  ``simultaneous loan,'' see Sec. 1026.43(b)(12).</p><p class="depth0">2. Payment calculation--covered transaction. For a simultaneous loan  that is a covered transaction, as that term is defined under Sec.  1026.43(b)(1), a creditor must determine a consumer's ability to repay  the monthly payment obligation for a simultaneous loan as set forth in  Sec. 1026.43(c)(5), taking into account any mortgage-related  obligations required to be considered under Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(v). For  the meaning of the term ``mortgage-related obligations,'' see Sec.  1026.43(b)(8).</p><p class="depth0">3. Payment calculation--home equity line of credit. For a  simultaneous loan that is a home equity line of credit subject to Sec.  1026.40, the creditor must consider the periodic payment required under  the terms of the plan when assessing the consumer's ability to repay the  covered transaction secured by the same dwelling as the simultaneous  loan. Under Sec. 1026.43(c)(6)(ii), a creditor must determine the  periodic payment required under   the terms of the plan by considering the actual amount of credit to be  drawn by the consumer at consummation of the covered transaction. The  amount to be drawn is the amount requested by the consumer; when the  amount requested will be disbursed, or actual receipt of funds, is not  determinative. Any additional draw against the line of credit that the  creditor of the covered transaction does not know or have reason to know  about before or during underwriting need not be considered in relation  to ability to repay. For example, where the creditor's policies and  procedures require the source of down payment to be verified, and the  creditor verifies that a simultaneous loan that is a HELOC will provide  the source of down payment for the first-lien covered transaction, the  creditor must consider the periodic payment on the HELOC by assuming the  amount drawn is at least the down payment amount. In general, a creditor  should determine the periodic payment based on guidance in the  commentary to Sec. 1026.40(d)(5) (discussing payment terms).</p><p class="depth0">43(c)(7) Monthly debt-to-income ratio or residual income.</p><p class="depth0">1. Monthly debt-to-income ratio or monthly residual income. Under  Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(vii), the creditor must consider the consumer's  monthly debt-to-income ratio, or the consumer's monthly residual income,  in accordance with the requirements in Sec. 1026.43(c)(7). In contrast  to the qualified mortgage provisions in Sec. 1026.43(e), Sec.  1026.43(c) does not prescribe a specific monthly debt-to-income ratio  with which creditors must comply. Instead, an appropriate threshold for  a consumer's monthly debt-to-income ratio or monthly residual income is  for the creditor to determine in making a reasonable and good faith  determination of a consumer's ability to repay.</p><p class="depth0">2. Use of both monthly debt-to-income ratio and monthly residual  income. If a creditor considers the consumer's monthly debt-to-income  ratio, the creditor may also consider the consumer's residual income as  further validation of the assessment made using the consumer's monthly  debt-to-income ratio.</p><p class="depth0">3. Compensating factors. The creditor may consider factors in  addition to the monthly debt-to-income ratio or residual income in  assessing a consumer's repayment ability. For example, the creditor may  reasonably and in good faith determine that a consumer has the ability  to repay despite a higher debt-to-income ratio or lower residual income  in light of the consumer's assets other than the dwelling, including any  real property attached to the dwelling, securing the covered  transaction, such as a savings account. The creditor may also reasonably  and in good faith determine that a consumer has the ability to repay  despite a higher debt-to-income ratio in light of the consumer's  residual income.</p><p class="depth0">43(d) Refinancing of non-standard mortgages.</p><p class="depth0">43(d)(1) Definitions.</p><p class="depth0">43(d)(1)(i) Non-standard mortgage.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(d)(1)(i)(A).</p><p class="depth0">1. Adjustable-rate mortgage with an introductory fixed rate. Under  Sec. 1026.43(d)(1)(i)(A), an adjustable-rate mortgage with an  introductory fixed interest rate for one year or longer is considered a  ``non-standard mortgage.'' For example, a covered transaction that has a  fixed introductory rate for the first two, three, or five years and then  converts to a variable rate for the remaining 28, 27, or 25 years,  respectively, is a ``non-standard mortgage.'' A covered transaction with  an introductory rate for six months that then converts to a variable  rate for the remaining 29 and one-half years is not a ``non-standard  mortgage.''</p><p class="depth0">43(d)(1)(ii) Standard mortgage.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(d)(1)(ii)(A).</p><p class="depth0">1. Regular periodic payments. Under Sec. 1026.43(d)(1)(ii)(A), a  ``standard mortgage'' must provide for regular periodic payments that do  not result in an increase of the principal balance (negative  amortization), allow the consumer to defer repayment of principal (see  comment 43(e)(2)(i)-2), or result in a balloon payment. Thus, the terms  of the legal obligation must require the consumer to make payments of  principal and interest on a monthly or other periodic basis that will  repay the loan amount over the loan term. Except for payments resulting  from any interest rate changes after consummation in an adjustable-rate  or step-rate mortgage, the periodic payments must be substantially  equal. For an explanation of the term ``substantially equal,'' see  comment 43(c)(5)(i)-4. In addition, a single-payment transaction is not  a ``standard mortgage'' because it does not require ``regular periodic  payments.'' See also comment 43(e)(2)(i)-1.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(d)(1)(ii)(D).</p><p class="depth0">1. First five years after consummation. A ``standard mortgage'' must  have an interest rate that is fixed for at least the first five years  (60 months) after consummation. For example, assume an adjustable-rate  mortgage that applies the same fixed interest rate to determine the  first 60 payments of principal and interest due. The loan is consummated  on August 15, 2013, and the first monthly payment is due on October 1,  2013. The date that is five years after consummation is August 15, 2018.  The first interest rate adjustment occurs on September 1, 2018. This  loan meets the criterion for a ``standard mortgage'' under Sec.  1026.43(d)(1)(ii)(D) because the interest rate is fixed until September  1, 2018, which is more than five years after consummation. For guidance  regarding step-rate mortgages, see comment 43(e)(2)(iv)-3.iii.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(d)(1)(ii)(E).</p><p class="depth0">1. Permissible use of proceeds. To qualify as a ``standard  mortgage,'' the loan's proceeds   may be used for only two purposes: paying off the non-standard mortgage  and paying for closing costs, including paying escrow amounts required  at or before closing. If the proceeds of a covered transaction are used  for other purposes, such as to pay off other liens or to provide  additional cash to the consumer for discretionary spending, the  transaction does not meet the definition of a ``standard mortgage.''</p><p class="depth0">43(d)(2) Scope.</p><p class="depth0">1. Written application. For an explanation of the requirements for a  ``written application'' in Sec. 1026.43(d)(2)(iii), (d)(2)(iv), and  (d)(2)(v), see comment 19(a)(1)(i)-3.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(d)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Materially lower. The exemptions afforded under Sec.  1026.43(d)(3) apply to a refinancing only if the monthly payment for the  new loan is ``materially lower'' than the monthly payment for an  existing non-standard mortgage. The payments to be compared must be  calculated based on the requirements under Sec. 1026.43(d)(5). Whether  the new loan payment is ``materially lower'' than the non-standard  mortgage payment depends on the facts and circumstances. In all cases, a  payment reduction of 10 percent or more meets the ``materially lower''  standard.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(d)(2)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">1. Late payment--12 months prior to application. Under Sec.  1026.43(d)(2)(iv), the exemptions in Sec. 1026.43(d)(3) apply to a  covered transaction only if, during the 12 months immediately preceding  the creditor's receipt of the consumer's written application for a  refinancing, the consumer has made no more than one payment on the non- standard mortgage more than 30 days late. (For an explanation of  ``written application,'' see comment 43(d)(2)-1.) For example, assume a  consumer applies for a refinancing on May 1, 2014. Assume also that the  consumer made a non-standard mortgage payment on August 15, 2013, that  was 45 days late. The consumer made no other late payments on the non- standard mortgage between May 1, 2013, and May 1, 2014. In this example,  the requirement under Sec. 1026.43(d)(2)(iv) is met because the  consumer made only one payment that was over 30 days late within the 12  months prior to applying for the refinancing (i.e., eight and one-half  months prior to application).</p><p class="depth0">2. Payment due date. Whether a payment is more than 30 days late is  measured in relation to the contractual due date not accounting for any  grace period. For example, if the contractual due date for a non- standard mortgage payment is the first day of every month, but no late  fee will be charged as long as the payment is received by the 16th of  the month, the payment due date for purposes of Sec. 1026.43(d)(2)(iv)  and (v) is the first day of the month, not the 16th day of the month.  Thus, a payment due under the contract on October 1st that is paid on  November 1st is made more than 30 days after the payment due date.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(d)(2)(v).</p><p class="depth0">1. Late payment--six months prior to application. Under Sec.  1026.43(d)(2)(v), the exemptions in Sec. 1026.43(d)(3) apply to a  covered transaction only if, during the six months immediately preceding  the creditor's receipt of the consumer's written application for a  refinancing, the consumer has made no payments on the non-standard  mortgage more than 30 days late. (For an explanation of ``written  application'' and how to determine the payment due date, see comments  43(d)(2)-1 and 43(d)(2)(iv)-2.) For example, assume a consumer with a  non-standard mortgage applies for a refinancing on May 1, 2014. If the  consumer made a payment on March 15, 2014, that was 45 days late, the  requirement under Sec. 1026.43(d)(2)(v) is not met because the consumer  made a payment more than 30 days late one and one-half months prior to  application. If the number of months between consummation of the non- standard mortgage and the consumer's application for the standard  mortgage is six or fewer, the consumer may not have made any payment  more than 30 days late on the non-standard mortgage.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(d)(2)(vi).</p><p class="depth0">1. Non-standard mortgage loan made in accordance with ability-to- repay or qualified mortgage requirements. For non-standard mortgages  that are consummated on or after January 10, 2014, Sec.  1026.43(d)(2)(vi) provides that the refinancing provisions set forth in  Sec. 1026.43(d) apply only if the non-standard mortgage was made in  accordance with the requirements of Sec. 1026.43(c) or (e), as  applicable. For example, if a creditor originated a non-standard  mortgage on or after January 10, 2014 that did not comply with the  requirements of Sec. 1026.43(c) and was not a qualified mortgage  pursuant to Sec. 1026.43(e), Sec. 1026.43(d) would not apply to the  refinancing of the non-standard mortgage loan into a standard mortgage  loan. However, Sec. 1026.43(d) applies to the refinancing of a non- standard mortgage loan into a standard mortgage loan, regardless of  whether the non-standard mortgage loan was made in compliance with Sec.  1026.43(c) or (e), if the non-standard mortgage loan was consummated  prior to January 10, 2014.</p><p class="depth0">43(d)(3) Exemption from repayment ability requirements.</p><p class="depth0">1. Two-part determination. To qualify for the exemptions in Sec.  1026.43(d)(3), a creditor must have considered, first, whether the  consumer is likely to default on the existing mortgage once that loan is  recast and, second, whether the new mortgage likely would prevent the  consumer's default.</p><p class="depth0">43(d)(4) Offer of rate discounts and other favorable terms.</p><p class="depth0">1. Documented underwriting practices. In connection with a  refinancing made pursuant to Sec. 1026.43(d), Sec. 1026.43(d)(4)  requires a creditor offering a consumer rate discounts and terms that  are the same as, or better than, the rate discounts and terms offered to  new consumers to make such an offer consistent with the creditor's  documented underwriting practices. Section 1026.43(d)(4) does not  require a creditor making a refinancing pursuant to Sec. 1026.43(d) to  comply with the underwriting requirements of Sec. 1026.43(c). Rather,  Sec. 1026.43(d)(4) requires creditors providing such discounts to do so  consistent with documented policies related to loan pricing, loan term  qualifications, or other similar underwriting practices. For example,  assume that a creditor is providing a consumer with a refinancing made  pursuant to Sec. 1026.43(d) and that this creditor has a documented  practice of offering rate discounts to consumers with credit scores  above a certain threshold. Assume further that the consumer receiving  the refinancing has a credit score below this threshold, and therefore  would not normally qualify for the rate discount available to consumers  with high credit scores. This creditor complies with Sec. 1026.43(d)(4)  by offering the consumer the discounted rate in connection with the  refinancing made pursuant to Sec. 1026.43(d), even if the consumer  would not normally qualify for that discounted rate, provided that the  offer of the discounted rate is not prohibited by applicable State or  Federal law. However, Sec. 1026.43(d)(4) does not require a creditor to  offer a consumer such a discounted rate.</p><p class="depth0">43(d)(5) Payment calculations.</p><p class="depth0">43(d)(5)(i) Non-Standard mortgage.</p><p class="depth0">1. Payment calculation for a non-standard mortgage. In determining  whether the monthly periodic payment for a standard mortgage is  materially lower than the monthly periodic payment for the non-standard  mortgage under Sec. 1026.43(d)(2)(ii), the creditor must consider the  monthly payment for the non-standard mortgage that will result after the  loan is ``recast,'' assuming substantially equal payments of principal  and interest that amortize the remaining loan amount over the remaining  term as of the date the mortgage is recast. For guidance regarding the  meaning of ``substantially equal,'' see comment 43(c)(5)(i)-4. For the  meaning of ``recast,'' see Sec. 1026.43(b)(11) and associated  commentary.</p><p class="depth0">2. Fully indexed rate. The term ``fully indexed rate'' in Sec.  1026.43(d)(5)(i)(A) for calculating the payment for a non-standard  mortgage is generally defined in Sec. 1026.43(b)(3) and associated  commentary. Under Sec. 1026.43(b)(3) the fully indexed rate is  calculated at the time of consummation. For purposes of Sec.  1026.43(d)(5)(i), however, the fully indexed rate is calculated within a  reasonable period of time before or after the date the creditor receives  the consumer's written application for the standard mortgage. Thirty  days is generally considered ``a reasonable period of time.''</p><p class="depth0">3. Written application.

Payment calculation for an adjustable-rate mortgage with an  introductory fixed rate. Under Sec. 1026.43(d)(5)(i), the monthly  periodic payment for an adjustable-rate mortgage with an introductory  fixed interest rate for a period of one or more years must be calculated  based on several assumptions.</p><p class="depth0">i. First, the payment must be based on the outstanding principal  balance as of the date on which the mortgage is recast, assuming all  scheduled payments have been made up to that date and the last payment  due under those terms is made and credited on that date. For example,  assume an adjustable-rate mortgage with a 30-year loan term. The loan  agreement provides that the payments for the first 24 months are based  on a fixed rate, after which the interest rate will adjust annually  based on a specified index and margin. The loan is recast on the due  date of the 24th payment. If the 24th payment is due on September 1,  2014, the creditor must calculate the outstanding principal balance as  of September 1, 2014, assuming that all 24 payments under the fixed rate  terms have been made and credited timely.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Second, the payment calculation must be based on substantially  equal monthly payments of principal and interest that will fully repay  the outstanding principal balance over the term of the loan remaining as  of the date the loan is recast. Thus, in the example above, the creditor  must assume a loan term of 28 years (336 monthly payments).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Third, the payment must be based on the fully indexed rate, as  described in Sec. 1026.43(d)(5)(i)(A).</p><p class="depth0">5. Example of payment calculation for an adjustable-rate mortgage  with an introductory fixed rate. The following example illustrates the  rule described in comment 43(d)(5)(i)-4:</p><p class="depth0">i. A loan in an amount of $200,000 has a 30-year loan term. The loan  agreement provides for a discounted introductory interest rate of 5  percent that is fixed for an initial period of two years, after which  the interest rate will adjust annually based on a specified index plus a  margin of 3 percentage points.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The non-standard mortgage is consummated on February 15, 2014,  and the first monthly payment is due on April 1, 2014. The loan is  recast on the due date of the 24th monthly payment, which is March 1,  2016.</p><p class="depth0">iii. On March 15, 2015, the creditor receives the consumer's written  application for a refinancing after the consumer has made 12 monthly on- time payments. On this date, the index value is 4.5 percent.</p><p class="depth0">iv. To calculate the non-standard mortgage payment that must be  compared to the   standard mortgage payment under Sec. 1026.43(d)(2)(ii), the creditor  must use:</p><p class="depth0">A. The outstanding principal balance as of March 1, 2016, assuming  all scheduled payments have been made up to March 1, 2016, and the last  payment due under the fixed rate terms is made and credited on March 1,  2016. In this example, the outstanding principal balance is $193,948.</p><p class="depth0">B. The fully indexed rate of 7.5 percent, which is the index value  of 4.5 percent as of March 15, 2015 (the date on which the application  for a refinancing is received) plus the margin of 3 percent.</p><p class="depth0">C. The remaining loan term as of March 1, 2016, the date of the  recast, which is 28 years (336 monthly payments).</p><p class="depth0">v.

This is the  substantially equal, monthly payment of principal and interest required  to repay the outstanding principal balance at the fully indexed rate  over the remaining term.</p><p class="depth0">6. Payment calculation for an interest-only loan. Under Sec.  1026.43(d)(5)(i), the monthly periodic payment for an interest-only loan  must be calculated based on several assumptions:</p><p class="depth0">i. First, the payment must be based on the outstanding principal  balance as of the date of the recast, assuming all scheduled payments  are made under the terms of the legal obligation in effect before the  mortgage is recast. For a loan on which only interest and no principal  has been paid, the outstanding principal balance at the time of recast  will be the loan amount, as defined in Sec. 1026.43(b)(5), assuming all  scheduled payments are made under the terms of the legal obligation in  effect before the mortgage is recast. For example, assume that a  mortgage has a 30-year loan term, and provides that the first 24 months  of payments are interest-only. If the 24th payment is due on September  1, 2015, the creditor must calculate the outstanding principal balance  as of September 1, 2015, assuming that all 24 payments under the  interest-only payment terms have been made and credited timely and that  no payments of principal have been made.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Second, the payment calculation must be based on substantially  equal monthly payments of principal and interest that will fully repay  the loan amount over the term of the loan remaining as of the date the  loan is recast. Thus, in the example above, the creditor must assume a  loan term of 28 years (336 monthly payments).</p><p class="depth0">iii.

The loan  agreement provides for a fixed interest rate of 7 percent, and permits  interest-only payments for the first two years (the first 24 payments),  after which time amortizing payments of principal and interest are  required.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The non-standard mortgage is consummated on February 15, 2014,  and the first monthly payment is due on April 1, 2014. The loan is  recast on the due date of the 24th monthly payment, which is March 1,  2016.</p><p class="depth0">iii. On March 15, 2015, the creditor receives the consumer's written  application for a refinancing, after the consumer has made 12 monthly  on-time payments. The consumer has made no additional payments of  principal.</p><p class="depth0">iv. To calculate the non-standard mortgage payment that must be  compared to the standard mortgage payment under Sec. 1026.43(d)(2)(ii),  the creditor must use:</p><p class="depth0">A. The loan amount, which is the outstanding principal balance as of  March 1, 2016, assuming all scheduled interest-only payments have been  made and credited up to that date.

Based on these assumptions, the monthly payment for the non- standard mortgage for purposes of determining whether the standard  mortgage monthly payment is lower than the non-standard mortgage monthly  payment (see Sec. 1026.43(d)(2)(ii)) is $1,359. This is the  substantially equal, monthly payment of principal and interest required  to repay the loan amount at the fully indexed rate over the remaining  term.</p><p class="depth0">8. Payment calculation for a negative amortization loan. Under Sec.  1026.43(d)(5)(i), the monthly periodic payment for a negative  amortization loan must be calculated based on several assumptions:</p><p class="depth0">i. First, the calculation must be based on the maximum loan amount,  determined after adjusting for the outstanding principal balance. If the  consumer makes only the minimum periodic payments for the maximum  possible time, until the consumer must begin making fully amortizing  payments, the outstanding principal balance will be the maximum loan  amount, as defined in Sec. 1026.43(b)(7). In this event, the creditor  complies with Sec. 1026.43(d)(5)(i)(C)(3) by relying on the examples of  how to calculate the maximum loan amount, see comment 43(b)(7)-3.   If the consumer makes payments above the minimum periodic payments for  the maximum possible time, the creditor must calculate the maximum loan  amount based on the outstanding principal balance. In this event, the  creditor complies with Sec. 1026.43(d)(5)(i)(C)(3) by relying on the  examples of how to calculate the maximum loan amount in comment  43(d)(5)(i)-10.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Second, the calculation must be based on substantially equal  monthly payments of principal and interest that will fully repay the  maximum loan amount over the term of the loan remaining as of the date  the loan is recast. For example, if the loan term is 30 years and the  loan is recast on the due date of the 60th monthly payment, the creditor  must assume a remaining loan term of 25 years (300 monthly payments).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Third, the payment must be based on the fully indexed rate as  of the date of the written application for the standard mortgage.</p><p class="depth0">9. Example of payment calculation for a negative amortization loan  if only minimum payments made. The following example illustrates the  rule described in comment 43(d)(5)(i)-8:</p><p class="depth0">i. A loan in an amount of $200,000 has a 30-year loan term. The loan  agreement provides that the consumer can make minimum monthly payments  that cover only part of the interest accrued each month until the date  on which the principal balance increases to the negative amortization  cap of 115 percent of the loan amount, or for the first five years of  monthly payments (60 payments), whichever occurs first. The loan is an  adjustable-rate mortgage that adjusts monthly according to a specified  index plus a margin of 3.5 percent.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The non-standard mortgage is consummated on February 15, 2014,  and the first monthly payment is due on April 1, 2014. Assume that the  consumer has made only the minimum periodic payments. Assume further  that, based on the calculation of the maximum loan amount required under  Sec. 1026.43(b)(7) and associated commentary, the negative amortization  cap of 115 percent would be reached on June 1, 2016, the due date of the  27th monthly payment.</p><p class="depth0">iii. On March 15, 2015, the creditor receives the consumer's written  application for a refinancing, after the consumer has made 12 monthly  on-time payments.

The fully indexed rate of 8 percent, which is the index value of  4.5 percent as of March 15, 2015 (the date on which the creditor  receives the application for a refinancing) plus the margin of 3.5  percent; and</p><p class="depth0">C.

The following example illustrates  the rule described in comment 43(d)(5)(i)-8:</p><p class="depth0">i. A loan in an amount of $200,000 has a 30-year loan term. The loan  agreement provides that the consumer can make minimum monthly payments  that cover only part of the interest accrued each month until the date  on which the principal balance increases to the negative amortization  cap of 115 percent of the loan amount, or for the first five years of  monthly payments (60 payments), whichever occurs first. The loan is an  adjustable-rate mortgage that adjusts monthly according to a specified  index plus a margin of 3.5 percent. The introductory interest rate at  consummation is 1.5 percent. One month after consummation, the interest  rate adjusts and will adjust monthly thereafter based on the specified  index plus a margin of 3.5 percent. The maximum lifetime interest rate  is 10.5 percent; there are no other periodic interest rate adjustment  caps that limit how quickly the maximum lifetime rate may be reached.  The minimum monthly payment for the first year is based on the initial  interest rate of 1.5 percent. After that, the minimum monthly payment  adjusts annually, but may increase by no more than 7.5 percent over the  previous year's payment. The minimum monthly payment is $690 in the  first year, $742 in the second year, $798 in the third year, $857 in the  fourth year, and $922 in the fifth year.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The non-standard mortgage is consummated on February 15, 2014,  and the first monthly payment is due on April 1, 2014. Assume that the  consumer has made more than the minimum periodic payments, and that  after the consumer's 12th monthly on-time payment the outstanding  principal balance is $195,000. Based on the calculation of the maximum  loan amount after adjusting for this outstanding principal balance, the  negative amortization cap of 115 percent would be reached on March 1,  2019, the due date of the 60th monthly payment.</p><p class="depth0">iii. On March 15, 2015, the creditor receives the consumer's written  application for a refinancing, after the consumer has made 12 monthly  on-time payments.

The remaining loan term as of March 1, 2019, the date of the  recast, which is exactly 25 years (300 monthly payments).</p><p class="depth0">v. Based on these assumptions, the monthly payment for the non- standard mortgage for purposes of determining whether the standard  mortgage monthly payment is lower than the non-standard mortgage monthly  payment (see Sec. 1026.43(d)(2)(ii)) is $1,769. This is the  substantially equal, monthly payment of principal and interest required  to repay the maximum loan amount at the fully indexed rate over the  remaining term.</p><p class="depth0">43(d)(5)(ii) Standard mortgage.</p><p class="depth0">1. Payment calculation for a standard mortgage. In determining  whether the monthly periodic payment for a standard mortgage is  materially lower than the monthly periodic payment for a non-standard  mortgage, the creditor must consider the monthly payment for the  standard mortgage that will result in substantially equal, monthly,  fully amortizing payments (as defined in Sec. 1026.43(b)(2)) using the  rate as of consummation. For guidance regarding the meaning of  ``substantially equal'' see comment 43(c)(5)(i)-4. For a mortgage with a  single, fixed rate for the first five years after consummation, the  maximum rate that will apply during the first five years after  consummation will be the rate at consummation. For a step-rate mortgage,  however, the rate that must be used is the highest rate that will apply  during the first five years after consummation. For example, if the rate  for the first two years after the date on which the first regular  periodic payment will be due is 4 percent, the rate for the following  two years is 5 percent, and the rate for the next two years is 6  percent, the rate that must be used is 6 percent.</p><p class="depth0">2.

The loan agreement provides for an interest rate of 6 percent that is  fixed for an initial period of five years, after which time the interest  rate will adjust annually based on a specified index plus a margin of 3  percent, subject to a 2 percent annual interest rate adjustment cap. The  creditor must determine whether the standard mortgage monthly payment is  materially lower than the non-standard mortgage monthly payment (see  Sec. 1026.43(d)(2)(ii)) based on a standard mortgage payment of $1,199.  This is the substantially equal, monthly payment of principal and  interest required to repay $200,000 over 30 years at an interest rate of  6 percent.</p><p class="depth0">43(e) Qualified mortgages.</p><p class="depth0">43(e)(1) Safe harbor and presumption of compliance.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Section 1026.43(c) requires a creditor to make a  reasonable and good faith determination at or before consummation that a  consumer will be able to repay a covered transaction. Section  1026.43(e)(1)(i) and (ii) provide a safe harbor and presumption of  compliance, respectively, with the repayment ability requirements of  Sec. 1026.43(c) for creditors and assignees of covered transactions  that satisfy the requirements of a qualified mortgage under Sec.  1026.43(e)(2), (e)(4), or (f).

Safe harbor. To qualify for the safe harbor in Sec.  1026.43(e)(1)(i), a covered transaction must meet the requirements of a  qualified mortgage under Sec. 1026.43(e)(2), (e)(4), or (f) and must  not be a higher-priced covered transaction, as defined in Sec.  1026.43(b)(4). For guidance on determining whether a loan is a higher- priced covered transaction, see comment 43(b)(4)-1.</p><p class="depth0">43(e)(1)(ii) Presumption of compliance for higher-priced covered  transactions.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Under Sec. 1026.43(e)(1)(ii), a creditor or assignee of  a qualified mortgage under Sec. 1026.43(e)(2), (e)(4), or (f) that is a  higher-priced covered transaction is presumed to comply with the  repayment ability requirements of Sec. 1026.43(c). To rebut the  presumption, it must be proven that, despite meeting the standards for a  qualified mortgage (including either the debt-to-income standard in  Sec. 1026.43(e)(2)(vi) or the standards of one of the entities  specified in Sec. 1026.43(e)(4)(ii)), the creditor did not have a  reasonable and good faith belief in the consumer's repayment ability.  Specifically, it must be proven that, at the time of consummation, based  on the information available to the creditor, the consumer's income,  debt obligations, alimony, child support, and the consumer's monthly  payment (including mortgage-related obligations) on the covered  transaction and on any simultaneous loans of which the creditor was  aware at consummation would leave the consumer with insufficient  residual income or assets other than the value of the dwelling  (including any real property attached to the dwelling) that secures the  loan with which to meet living   expenses, including any recurring and material non-debt obligations of  which the creditor was aware at the time of consummation, and that the  creditor thereby did not make a reasonable and good faith determination  of the consumer's repayment ability. For example, a consumer may rebut  the presumption with evidence demonstrating that the consumer's residual  income was insufficient to meet living expenses, such as food, clothing,  gasoline, and health care, including the payment of recurring medical  expenses of which the creditor was aware at the time of consummation,  and after taking into account the consumer's assets other than the value  of the dwelling securing the loan, such as a savings account. In  addition, the longer the period of time that the consumer has  demonstrated actual ability to repay the loan by making timely payments,  without modification or accommodation, after consummation or, for an  adjustable-rate mortgage, after recast, the less likely the consumer  will be able to rebut the presumption based on insufficient residual  income and prove that, at the time the loan was made, the creditor  failed to make a reasonable and good faith determination that the  consumer had the reasonable ability to repay the loan.</p><p class="depth0">43(e)(2) Qualified mortgage defined--general.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(e)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Regular periodic payments. Under Sec. 1026.43(e)(2)(i), a  qualified mortgage must provide for regular periodic payments that may  not result in an increase of the principal balance (negative  amortization), deferral of principal repayment, or a balloon payment.  Thus, the terms of the legal obligation must require the consumer to  make payments of principal and interest, on a monthly or other periodic  basis, that will fully repay the loan amount over the loan term. The  periodic payments must be substantially equal except for the effect that  any interest rate change after consummation has on the payment in the  case of an adjustable-rate or step-rate mortgage. In addition, because  Sec. 1026.43(e)(2)(i) requires that a qualified mortgage provide for  regular periodic payments, a single-payment transaction may not be a  qualified mortgage.</p><p class="depth0">2. Deferral of principal repayment. Under Sec. 1026.43(e)(2)(i)(B),  a qualified mortgage's regular periodic payments may not allow the  consumer to defer repayment of principal, except as provided in Sec.  1026.43(f). A loan allows the deferral of principal repayment if one or  more of the periodic payments may be applied solely to accrued interest  and not to loan principal. Deferred principal repayment also occurs if  the payment is applied to both accrued interest and principal but the  consumer is permitted to make periodic payments that are less than the  amount that would be required under a payment schedule that has  substantially equal payments that fully repay the loan amount over the  loan term. Graduated payment mortgages, for example, allow deferral of  principal repayment in this manner and therefore may not be qualified  mortgages.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(e)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. General. The 30-year term limitation in Sec. 1026.43(e)(2)(ii)  is applied without regard to any interim period between consummation and  the beginning of the first full unit period of the repayment schedule.  For example, assume a covered transaction is consummated on March 20,  2014 and the due date of the first regular periodic payment is April 30,  2014. The beginning of the first full unit period of the repayment  schedule is April 1, 2014 and the loan term therefore ends on April 1,  2044. The transaction would comply with the 30-year term limitation in  Sec. 1026.43(e)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(e)(2)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">1. Maximum interest rate during the first five years. For a  qualified mortgage, the creditor must underwrite the loan using a  periodic payment of principal and interest based on the maximum interest  rate that may apply during the first five years after the date on which  the first regular periodic payment will be due. Creditors must use the  maximum rate that could apply at any time during the first five years  after the date on which the first regular periodic payment will be due,  regardless of whether the maximum rate is reached at the first or  subsequent adjustment during the five year period.</p><p class="depth0">2. Fixed-rate mortgage. For a fixed-rate mortgage, creditors should  use the interest rate in effect at consummation. ``Fixed-rate mortgage''  is defined in Sec. 1026.18(s)(7)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">3. Interest rate adjustment caps. For an adjustable-rate mortgage,  creditors should assume the interest rate increases after consummation  as rapidly as possible, taking into account the terms of the legal  obligation. That is, creditors should account for any periodic interest  rate adjustment cap that may limit how quickly the interest rate can  increase under the terms of the legal obligation. Where a range for the  maximum interest rate during the first five years is provided, the  highest rate in that range is the maximum interest rate for purposes of  Sec. 1026.43(e)(2)(iv). Where the terms of the legal obligation are not  based on an index plus margin or formula, the creditor must use the  maximum interest rate that occurs during the first five years after the  date on which the first regular periodic payment will be due. To  illustrate:</p><p class="depth0">i. Adjustable-rate mortgage with discount for three years. Assume an  adjustable-rate mortgage has an initial discounted rate of 5 percent  that is fixed for the first three years, measured from the first day of  the first full calendar month following consummation, after which the  rate will adjust annually based on a specified index plus a margin of 3   percent. The index value in effect at consummation is 4.5 percent. The  loan agreement provides for an annual interest rate adjustment cap of 2  percent, and a lifetime maximum interest rate of 12 percent. The first  rate adjustment occurs on the due date of the 36th monthly payment; the  rate can adjust to no more than 7 percent (5 percent initial discounted  rate plus 2 percent annual interest rate adjustment cap). The second  rate adjustment occurs on the due date of the 48th monthly payment; the  rate can adjust to no more than 9 percent (7 percent rate plus 2 percent  annual interest rate adjustment cap). The third rate adjustment occurs  on the due date of the 60th monthly payment; the rate can adjust to no  more than 11 percent (9 percent rate plus 2 percent annual interest rate  cap adjustment). The maximum interest rate during the first five years  after the date on which the first regular periodic payment will be due  is 11 percent (the rate on the due date of the 60th monthly payment).

Adjustable-rate mortgage with discount for three years. Assume  the same facts as in paragraph 3.i except that the lifetime maximum  interest rate is 10 percent, which is less than the maximum interest  rate in the first five years after the date on which the first regular  periodic payment will be due of 11 percent that would apply but for the  lifetime maximum interest rate. The maximum interest rate during the  first five years after the date on which the first regular periodic  payment will be due is 10 percent.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Step-rate mortgage. Assume a step-rate mortgage with an  interest rate fixed at 6.5 percent for the first two years, measured  from the first day of the first full calendar month following  consummation, 7 percent for the next three years, and then 7.5 percent  for the remainder of the loan term. The maximum interest rate during the  first five years after the date on which the first regular periodic  payment will be due is 7.5 percent.</p><p class="depth0">4. First five years after the date on which the first regular  periodic payment will be due. Under Sec. 1026.43(e)(2)(iv)(A), the  creditor must underwrite the loan using the maximum interest rate that  may apply during the first five years after the date on which the first  regular periodic payment will be due. To illustrate, assume an  adjustable-rate mortgage with an initial fixed interest rate of 5  percent for the first five years, measured from the first day of the  first full calendar month following consummation, after which the  interest rate will adjust annually to the specified index plus a margin  of 6 percent, subject to a 2 percent annual interest rate adjustment  cap. The index value in effect at consummation is 5.5 percent. The loan  consummates on September 15, 2014, and the first monthly payment is due  on November 1, 2014. The first rate adjustment to no more than 7 percent  (5 percent plus 2 percent annual interest rate adjustment cap) occurs on  the due date of the 60th monthly payment, which is October 1, 2019, and  therefore, the rate adjustment occurs during the first five years after  the date on which the first regular periodic payment will be due. To  meet the definition of qualified mortgage under Sec. 1026.43(e)(2), the  creditor must underwrite the loan using a monthly payment of principal  and interest based on an interest rate of 7 percent.</p><p class="depth0">5. Loan amount. To meet the definition of qualified mortgage under  Sec. 1026.43(e)(2), a creditor must determine the periodic payment of  principal and interest using the maximum interest rate permitted during  the first five years after the date on which the first regular periodic  payment will be due that repays either:</p><p class="depth0">i. The outstanding principal balance as of the earliest date the  maximum interest rate during the first five years after the date on  which the first regular periodic payment will be due can take effect  under the terms of the legal obligation, over the remaining term of the  loan. To illustrate, assume a loan in an amount of $200,000 has a 30- year loan term. The loan agreement provides for a discounted interest  rate of 5 percent that is fixed for an initial period of three years,  measured from the first day of the first full calendar month following  consummation, after which the interest rate will adjust annually based  on a specified index plus a margin of 3 percent, subject to a 2 percent  annual interest rate adjustment cap and a lifetime maximum interest rate  of 9 percent. The index value in effect at consummation equals 4.5  percent. Assuming the interest rate increases after consummation as  quickly as possible, the rate adjustment to the lifetime maximum  interest rate of 9 percent occurs on the due date of the 48th monthly  payment. The outstanding principal balance on the loan at the end of the  fourth year (after the 48th monthly payment is credited) is $188,218.  The creditor will meet the definition of qualified mortgage if it  underwrites the covered transaction using the monthly payment of  principal and interest of $1,564 to repay the outstanding principal  balance of $188,218 over the remaining 26 years of the loan term (312  months) using the maximum interest rate during the first five years of 9  percent; or</p><p class="depth0">ii. The loan amount, as that term is defined in Sec. 1026.43(b)(5),  over the entire loan term, as that term is defined in Sec.  1026.43(b)(6). Using the same example above, the creditor   will meet the definition of qualified mortgage if it underwrites the  covered transaction using the monthly payment of principal and interest  of $1,609 to repay the loan amount of $200,000 over the 30-year loan  term using the maximum interest rate during the first five years of 9  percent.</p><p class="depth0">6. Mortgage-related obligations. Section 1026.43(e)(2)(iv) requires  creditors to take the consumer's monthly payment for mortgage-related  obligations into account when underwriting the loan. For the meaning of  the term ``mortgage-related obligations,'' see Sec. 1026.43(b)(8) and  associated commentary.</p><p class="depth0">7. Examples. The following are examples of how to determine the  periodic payment of principal and interest based on the maximum interest  rate during the first five years after the date on which the first  regular periodic payment will be due for purposes of meeting the  definition of qualified mortgage under Sec. 1026.43(e) (all payment  amounts shown are rounded, and all amounts are calculated using non- rounded values; all initial fixed interest rate periods are measured  from the first day of the first full calendar month following  consummation):</p><p class="depth0">i. Fixed-rate mortgage. A loan in an amount of $200,000 has a 30- year loan term and a fixed interest rate of 7 percent. The maximum  interest rate during the first five years after the date on which the  first regular periodic payment will be due for a fixed-rate mortgage is  the interest rate in effect at consummation, which is 7 percent under  this example. The monthly fully amortizing payment scheduled over the 30  years is $1,331. The creditor will meet the definition of qualified  mortgage if it underwrites the loan using the fully amortizing payment  of $1,331.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Adjustable-rate mortgage with discount for three years. A. A  loan in an amount of $200,000 has a 30-year loan term. The loan  agreement provides for a discounted interest rate of 5 percent that is  fixed for an initial period of three years, after which the interest  rate will adjust annually based on a specified index plus a margin of 3  percent, subject to a 2 percent annual interest rate adjustment cap and  a lifetime maximum interest rate of 9 percent. The index value in effect  at consummation is 4.5 percent. The loan is consummated on March 15,  2014, and the first regular periodic payment is due May 1, 2014. The  loan agreement provides that the first rate adjustment occurs on April  1, 2017 (the due date of the 36th monthly payment); the second rate  adjustment occurs on April 1, 2018 (the due date of the 48th monthly  payment); and the third rate adjustment occurs on April 1, 2019 (the due  date of the 60th monthly payment). Under this example, the maximum  interest rate during the first five years after the date on which the  first regular periodic payment due is 9 percent (the lifetime interest  rate cap), which applies beginning on April 1, 2018 (the due date of the  48th monthly payment). The outstanding principal balance at the end of  the fourth year (after the 48th payment is credited) is $188,218.</p><p class="depth0">B. The transaction will meet the definition of a qualified mortgage  if the creditor underwrites the loan using the monthly payment of  principal and interest of $1,564 to repay the outstanding principal  balance at the end of the fourth year of $188,218 over the remaining 26  years of the loan term (312 months), using the maximum interest rate  during the first five years after the date on which the first regular  periodic payment will be due of 9 percent. Alternatively, the  transaction will meet the definition of a qualified mortgage if the  creditor underwrites the loan using the monthly payment of principal and  interest of $1,609 to repay the loan amount of $200,000 over the 30-year  loan term, using the maximum interest rate during the first five years  after the date on which the first regular periodic payment will be due  of 9 percent.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Adjustable-rate mortgage with discount for five years. A. A  loan in an amount of $200,000 has a 30-year loan term. The loan  agreement provides for a discounted interest rate of 6 percent that is  fixed for an initial period of five years, after which the interest rate  will adjust annually based on a specified index plus a margin of 3  percent, subject to a 2 percent annual interest rate adjustment cap. The  index value in effect at consummation is 4.5 percent. The loan  consummates on March 15, 2014 and the first regular periodic payment is  due May 1, 2014. Under the terms of the loan agreement, the first rate  adjustment to no more than 8 percent (6 percent plus 2 percent annual  interest rate adjustment cap) is on April 1, 2019 (the due date of the  60th monthly payment), which occurs less than five years after the date  on which the first regular periodic payment will be due. Thus, the  maximum interest rate under the terms of the loan during the first five  years after the date on which the first regular periodic payment will be  due is 8 percent.</p><p class="depth0">B. The transaction will meet the definition of a qualified mortgage  if the creditor underwrites the loan using the monthly payment of  principal and interest of $1,436 to repay the outstanding principal  balance at the end of the fifth year of $186,109 over the remaining 25  years of the loan term (300 months), using the maximum interest rate  during the first five years after the date on which the first regular  periodic payment will be due of 8 percent. Alternatively, the  transaction will meet the definition of a qualified mortgage if the  creditor underwrites the loan using the monthly payment of principal and  interest of $1,468 to repay the loan amount of $200,000 over the 30-year  loan term, using the maximum interest rate during the first five   years after the date on which the first regular periodic payment will be  due of 8 percent.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Adjustable-rate mortgage with discount for seven years. A. A  loan in an amount of $200,000 has a 30-year loan term. The loan  agreement provides for a discounted interest rate of 6 percent that is  fixed for an initial period of seven years, after which the interest  rate will adjust annually based on a specified index plus a margin of 3  percent, subject to a 2 percent annual interest rate adjustment cap. The  index value in effect at consummation is 4.5 percent. The loan is  consummated on March 15, 2014, and the first regular periodic payment is  due May 1, 2014. Under the terms of the loan agreement, the first rate  adjustment is on April 1, 2021 (the due date of the 84th monthly  payment), which occurs more than five years after the date on which the  first regular periodic payment will be due. Thus, the maximum interest  rate under the terms of the loan during the first five years after the  date on which the first regular periodic payment will be due is 6  percent.</p><p class="depth0">B. The transaction will meet the definition of a qualified mortgage  if the creditor underwrites the loan using the monthly payment of  principal and interest of $1,199 to repay the loan amount of $200,000  over the 30-year loan term using the maximum interest rate during the  first five years after the date on which the first regular periodic  payment will be due of 6 percent.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Step-rate mortgage. A. A loan in an amount of $200,000 has a 30- year loan term. The loan agreement provides that the interest rate is  6.5 percent for the first two years of the loan, 7 percent for the next  three years, and then 7.5 percent for remainder of the loan term. The  maximum interest rate during the first five years after the date on  which the first regular periodic payment will be due is 7.5 percent,  which occurs on the due date of the 60th monthly payment. The  outstanding principal balance at the end of the fifth year (after the  60th payment is credited) is $187,868.</p><p class="depth0">B. The transaction will meet the definition of a qualified mortgage  if the creditor underwrites the loan using a monthly payment of  principal and interest of $1,388 to repay the outstanding principal  balance of $187,868 over the remaining 25 years of the loan term (300  months), using the maximum interest rate during the first five years  after the date on which the first regular periodic payment will be due  of 7.5 percent. Alternatively, the transaction will meet the definition  of a qualified mortgage if the creditor underwrites the loan using a  monthly payment of principal and interest of $1,398 to repay $200,000  over the 30-year loan term using the maximum interest rate during the  first five years after the date on which the first regular periodic  payment will be due of 7.5 percent.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(e)(2)(v).</p><p class="depth0">1. General. For guidance on satisfying Sec. 1026.43(e)(2)(v), a  creditor may rely on commentary to Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(i) and (vi),  (c)(3), and (c)(4).</p><p class="depth0">2. Income or assets. Section 1026.43(e)(2)(v)(A) requires creditors  to consider and verify the consumer's current or reasonably expected  income or assets. For purposes of this requirement, the creditor must  consider and verify, at a minimum, any income specified in appendix Q. A  creditor may also consider and verify any other income in accordance  with Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(i) and (c)(4); however, such income would not  be included in the total monthly debt-to-income ratio determination  required by Sec. 1026.43(e)(2)(vi).</p><p class="depth0">3. Debts. Section 1026.43(e)(2)(v)(B) requires creditors to consider  and verify the consumer's current debt obligations, alimony, and child  support. For purposes of this requirement, the creditor must consider  and verify, at a minimum, any debt or liability specified in appendix Q.  A creditor may also consider and verify other debt in accordance with  Sec. 1026.43(c)(2)(vi) and (c)(3); however, such debt would not be  included in the total monthly debt-to-income ratio determination  required by Sec. 1026.43(e)(2)(vi).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(e)(2)(vi).</p><p class="depth0">1. Calculation of monthly payment on the covered transaction and  simultaneous loans. As provided in appendix Q, for purposes of Sec.  1026.43(e)(2)(vi), creditors must include in the definition of ``debt''  a consumer's monthly housing expense. This includes, for example, the  consumer's monthly payment on the covered transaction (including  mortgage-related obligations) and on simultaneous loans. Accordingly,  Sec. 1026.43(e)(2)(vi)(B) provides the method by which a creditor  calculates the consumer's monthly payment on the covered transaction and  on any simultaneous loan that the creditor knows or has reason to know  will be made.</p><p class="depth0">43(e)(3) Limits on points and fees for qualified mortgages.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(e)(3)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Total loan amount. The term ``total loan amount'' is defined in  Sec. 1026.32(b)(4)(i). For an explanation of how to calculate the  ``total loan amount'' under Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(i), see comment  32(b)(4)(i)-1.</p><p class="depth0">2. Calculation of allowable points and fees. A creditor must  determine which category the loan falls into based on the face amount of  the note (the ``loan amount'' as defined in Sec. 1026.43(b)(5)). For  categories with a percentage limit, the creditor must apply the  allowable points and fees percentage to the ``total loan amount,'' which  may be different than the loan amount. A creditor must calculate the  allowable amount of points and fees for a qualified mortgage as follows:</p><p class="depth0">i. First, the creditor must determine the ``tier'' into which the  loan falls based on the loan amount. The loan amount is the principal  amount the consumer will borrow, as reflected in the promissory note or  loan contract. See Sec. 1026.43(b)(5). For example, if the loan amount  is $55,000, the loan falls into the tier for loans greater than or equal  to $20,000 but less than $60,000, to which a 5 percent cap on points and  fees applies. For tiers with a prescribed dollar limit on points and  fees (e.g., for loans from $60,000 up to $100,000, the limit is $3,000),  the creditor does not need to do any further calculations.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Second, for tiers with a percentage limit, the creditor must  determine the total loan amount based on the calculation for the total  loan amount under comment 32(b)(4)(i)-1. If the loan amount is $55,000,  for example, the total loan amount may be a different amount, such as  $52,000.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Third, the creditor must apply the percentage cap on points and  fees to the total loan amount. For example, for a loan of $55,000 where  the total loan amount is $52,000, the allowable points and fees are 5  percent of $52,000, or $2,600.</p><p class="depth0">3. Sample determination of allowable points and fees.</p><p class="depth0">i. A covered transaction with a loan amount of $105,000 falls into  the first points and fees tier, to which a points and fees cap of 3  percent of the total loan amount applies. See Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(i)(A).  Therefore, if the calculation under comment 32(b)(4)(i)-1 results in a  total loan amount of $102,000, then the allowable total points and fees  for this loan are 3 percent of $102,000, or $3,060.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A covered transaction with a loan amount of $75,000 falls into  the second points and fees tier, to which a points and fees cap of  $3,000 applies. See Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(i)(B). The allowable total  points and fees for this loan are $3,000, regardless of the total loan  amount.</p><p class="depth0">iii. A covered transaction with a loan amount of $50,000 falls into  the third points and fees tier, to which a points and fees cap of 5  percent of the total loan amount applies. See Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(i)(C).  Therefore, if the calculation under comment 32(b)(4)(i)-1 results in a  total loan amount of $48,000, then the allowable total points and fees  for this loan are 5 percent of $48,000, or $2,400.</p><p class="depth0">iv. A covered transaction with a loan amount of $15,000 falls into  the fourth points and fees tier, to which a points and fees cap of  $1,000 applies. See Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(i)(D). The allowable total  points and fees for this loan are $1,000, regardless of the total loan  amount.</p><p class="depth0">v. A covered transaction with a loan amount of $10,000 falls into  the fifth points and fees tier, to which a points and fees cap of 8  percent of the total loan amount applies. See Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(i)(E).  Therefore, if the calculation under comment 32(b)(4)(i)-1 results in a  total loan amount of $7,000, then the allowable total points and fees  for this loan are 8 percent of $7,000, or $560.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(e)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Annual adjustment for inflation.

The creditor or assignee, as applicable,  complies with Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(iii)(B) if it pays to the consumer the  amount described in Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(iv) within 210 days after  consummation and prior to the occurrence of any of the events in Sec.  1026.43(e)(3)(iii)(B)(1) through (3). A creditor or assignee, as  applicable, does not comply with Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(iii)(B) if it pays  to the consumer the amount described in Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(iv) more  than 210 days after consummation or after the occurrence of any of the  events in Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(iii)(B)(1) through (3). Payment may be  made by any means mutually agreeable to the consumer and the creditor or  assignee, as applicable, or by check. If payment is made by check, the  creditor or assignee complies with Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(iii)(B) if the  check is delivered or placed in the mail to the consumer within 210 days  after consummation.</p><p class="depth0">2. 60 days past due. Section 1026.43(e)(3)(iii)(B)(3) provides that,  to comply with Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(iii)(B), the creditor or assignee  must pay to the consumer the amount described in Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(iv)  prior to the consumer becoming 60 days past due on the legal obligation.  For this purpose, ``past due'' means the failure to make a periodic  payment (in one full payment or in two or more partial payments)  sufficient to cover principal, interest, and, if applicable, escrow  under the terms of the legal obligation. Other amounts, such as any late  fees, are not considered for this purpose. For purposes of Sec.  1026.43(e)(3)(iii)(B)(3), a periodic payment is   30 days past due when it is not paid on or before the due date of the  following scheduled periodic payment and is 60 days past due when, after  already becoming 30 days past due, it is not paid on or before the due  date of the next scheduled periodic payment. For purposes of Sec.  1026.43(e)(3)(iii)(B)(3), the creditor or assignee may treat a received  payment as applying to the oldest outstanding periodic payment. The  following example illustrates the meaning of 60 days past due for  purposes of Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(iii)(B)(3):</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume a loan is consummated on October 15, 2015, that the  consumer's periodic payment is due on the 1st of each month, and that  the consumer timely made the first periodic payment due on December 1,  2015. For purposes of Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(iii)(B)(3), the consumer is 30  days past due if the consumer fails to make a payment (sufficient to  cover the scheduled January 1, 2016 periodic payment of principal,  interest, and, if applicable, escrow) on or before February 1, 2016. For  purposes of Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(iii)(B)(3), the consumer is 60 days past  due if the consumer then also fails to make a payment (sufficient to  cover the scheduled January 1, 2016 periodic payment of principal,  interest, and, if applicable, escrow) on or before March 1, 2016. For  purposes of Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(iii)(B)(3), the consumer is not 60 days  past due if the consumer makes a payment (sufficient to cover the  scheduled January 1, 2016 periodic payment of principal, interest, and,  if applicable, escrow) on or before March 1, 2016.</p><p class="depth0">3. Post-consummation policies and procedures. The policies and  procedures described in Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(iii)(C) need not require  that a creditor or assignee, as applicable, conduct a post-consummation  review of all loans originated by the creditor or acquired by the  assignee, nor must such policies and procedures require a creditor or  assignee to apply Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(iii) and (iv) for all loans for  which the total points and fees are found to exceed the applicable limit  under Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(i).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(e)(3)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">1. Interest rate. For purposes of Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(iv)(B),  interest is calculated using the contract interest rate applicable  during the period from consummation until the payment described in Sec.  1026.43(e)(3)(iv) is made to the consumer. In an adjustable-rate or  step-rate transaction in which more than one interest rate applies  during the period from consummation until payment is made to the  consumer, the minimum payment amount is determined by calculating  interest on the dollar amount described in Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(iv)(A) at  each such interest rate for the part of the overall period during which  that rate applies. However, Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(iv) provides that, for  purposes of Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(iii), the creditor or assignee can pay  to the consumer an amount that exceeds the sum of the amounts described  in Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(iv)(A) and (B). Therefore, a creditor or assignee  may, for example, elect to calculate interest using the maximum interest  rate that may apply during the period from consummation until payment is  made to the consumer. See comment 43(e)(3)(iii)-1 for guidance on making  payments to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">2. Relationship to RESPA tolerance cure. Under Regulation X (12 CFR  1024.7(i)), if any charges at settlement exceed the charges listed on  the good faith estimate of settlement costs by more than the amounts  permitted under 12 CFR 1024.7(e), the loan originator may cure the  tolerance violation by reimbursing the amount by which the tolerance was  exceeded at settlement or within 30 calendar days after settlement. The  amount paid to the consumer pursuant to Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(iv) may be  offset by the amount paid to the consumer pursuant to 12 CFR 1024.7(i),  to the extent that the amount paid to the consumer pursuant to 12 CFR  1024.7(i) is being applied to fees or charges included in points and  fees pursuant to Sec. 1026.32(b)(1). However, a creditor or assignee  has not satisfied Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(iii) unless the total amount  described in Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(iv), including any offset due to a  payment made pursuant to 12 CFR 1024.7(i), is paid to the consumer  within 210 days after consummation and prior to the occurrence of any of  the events in Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(iii)(B)(1) through (3).</p><p class="depth0">43(e)(4) Qualified mortgage defined--special rules.</p><p class="depth0">1. Alternative definition. Subject to the sunset provided under  Sec. 1026.43(e)(4)(iii), Sec. 1026.43(e)(4) provides an alternative  definition of qualified mortgage to the definition provided in Sec.  1026.43(e)(2). To be a qualified mortgage under Sec. 1026.43(e)(4), the  transaction must satisfy the requirements under Sec. 1026.43(e)(2)(i)  through (iii), in addition to being one of the types of loans specified  in Sec. 1026.43(e)(4)(ii)(A) through (E).</p><p class="depth0">2. Termination of conservatorship. Section 1026.43(e)(4)(ii)(A)  requires that a covered transaction be eligible for purchase or  guarantee by the Federal National Mortgage Association (``Fannie Mae'')  or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (``Freddie Mac'') (or any  limited-life regulatory entity succeeding the charter of either)  operating under the conservatorship or receivership of the Federal  Housing Finance Agency pursuant to section 1367 of the Federal Housing  Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (12 U.S.C. 4617).  The special rule under Sec. 1026.43(e)(4)(ii)(A) does not apply if  Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (or any limited-life regulatory entity  succeeding the charter of either) has ceased operating under the  conservatorship or receivership of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.  For example, if either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (or succeeding limited- life regulatory entity) ceases   to operate under the conservatorship or receivership of the Federal  Housing Finance Agency, Sec. 1026.43(e)(4)(ii)(A) would no longer apply  to loans eligible for purchase or guarantee by that entity; however, the  special rule would be available for a loan that is eligible for purchase  or guarantee by the other entity still operating under conservatorship  or receivership.</p><p class="depth0">3. Timing. Under Sec. 1026.43(e)(4)(iii), the definition of  qualified mortgage under paragraph (e)(4) applies only to loans  consummated on or before January 10, 2021, regardless of whether Fannie  Mae or Freddie Mac (or any limited-life regulatory entity succeeding the  charter of either) continues to operate under the conservatorship or  receivership of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Accordingly, Sec.  1026.43(e)(4) is available only for covered transactions consummated on  or before the earlier of either:</p><p class="depth0">i.

January 10, 2021, as provided by Sec. 1026.43(e)(4)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">4. Eligible for purchase, guarantee, or insurance except with regard  to matters wholly unrelated to ability to repay. To satisfy Sec.  1026.43(e)(4)(ii), a loan need not be actually purchased or guaranteed  by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or insured or guaranteed by one of the  Agencies (the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), U.S. Department of Agriculture  (USDA), or Rural Housing Service (RHS)). Rather, Sec. 1026.43(e)(4)(ii)  requires only that the creditor determine that the loan is eligible  (i.e., meets the criteria) for such purchase, guarantee, or insurance at  consummation. For example, for purposes of Sec. 1026.43(e)(4), a  creditor is not required to sell a loan to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (or  any limited-life regulatory entity succeeding the charter of either) for  that loan to be a qualified mortgage; however, the loan must be eligible  for purchase or guarantee by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (or any limited- life regulatory entity succeeding the charter of either), including  satisfying any requirements regarding consideration and verification of  a consumer's income or assets, credit history, debt-to-income ratio or  residual income, and other credit risk factors, but not any requirements  regarding matters wholly unrelated to ability to repay. To determine  eligibility for purchase, guarantee or insurance, a creditor may rely on  a valid underwriting recommendation provided by a GSE automated  underwriting system (AUS) or an AUS that relies on an Agency  underwriting tool; compliance with the standards in the GSE or Agency  written guide in effect at the time; a written agreement between the  creditor or a direct sponsor or aggregator of the creditor and a GSE or  Agency that permits variation from the standards of the written guides  and/or variation from the AUSs, in effect at the time of consummation;  or an individual loan waiver granted by the GSE or Agency to the  creditor. For creditors relying on the variances of a sponsor or  aggregator, a loan that is transferred directly to or through the  sponsor or aggregator at or after consummation complies with Sec.  1026.43(e)(4). In using any of the four methods listed above, the  creditor need not satisfy standards that are wholly unrelated to  assessing a consumer's ability to repay that the creditor is required to  perform. Matters wholly unrelated to ability to repay are those matters  that are wholly unrelated to credit risk or the underwriting of the  loan. Such matters include requirements related to the status of the  creditor rather than the loan, requirements related to selling,  securitizing, or delivering the loan, and any requirement that the  creditor must perform after the consummated loan is sold, guaranteed, or  endorsed for insurance such as document custody, quality control, or  servicing.</p><p class="depth0">Accordingly, a covered transaction is eligible for purchase or  guarantee by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, for example, if:</p><p class="depth0">i. The loan conforms to the relevant standards set forth in the  Fannie Mae Single-Family Selling Guide or the Freddie Mac Single-Family  Seller/Servicer Guide in effect at the time, or to standards set forth  in a written agreement between the creditor or a sponsor or aggregator  of the creditor and Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac in effect at that time  that permits variation from the standards of those guides;</p><p class="depth0">ii. The loan has been granted an individual waiver by a GSE, which  will allow purchase or guarantee in spite of variations from the  applicable standards; or</p><p class="depth0">iii. The creditor inputs accurate information into the Fannie Mae or  Freddie Mac AUS or another AUS pursuant to a written agreement between  the creditor and Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac that permits variation from  the GSE AUS; the loan receives one of the recommendations specified  below in paragraphs A or B from the corresponding GSE AUS or an  equivalent recommendation pursuant to another AUS as authorized in the  written agreement; and the creditor satisfies any requirements and  conditions specified by the relevant AUS that are not wholly unrelated  to ability to repay, the non-satisfaction of which would invalidate that  recommendation:</p><p class="depth0">A. An ``Approve/Eligible'' recommendation from Desktop Underwriter  (DU); or</p><p class="depth0">B. A risk class of ``Accept'' and purchase eligibility of ``Freddie  Mac Eligible'' from Loan Prospector (LP).</p><p class="depth0">5. Repurchase and indemnification demands. A repurchase or  indemnification demand by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, HUD, VA, USDA, or RHS  is not dispositive of qualified mortgage status. Qualified mortgage  status under Sec. 1026.43(e)(4) depends on whether a loan is eligible  to be purchased, guaranteed, or insured at the time of consummation,  provided that other requirements under Sec. 1026.43(e)(4) are  satisfied. Some repurchase or indemnification demands are not related to  eligibility criteria at consummation. See comment 43(e)(4)-4. Further,  even where a repurchase or indemnification demand relates to whether the  loan satisfied relevant eligibility requirements as of the time of  consummation, the mere fact that a demand has been made, or even  resolved, between a creditor and GSE or agency is not dispositive for  purposes of Sec. 1026.43(e)(4). However, evidence of whether a  particular loan satisfied the Sec. 1026.43(e)(4) eligibility criteria  at consummation may be brought to light in the course of dealing over a  particular demand, depending on the facts and circumstances.  Accordingly, each loan should be evaluated by the creditor based on the  facts and circumstances relating to the eligibility of that loan at the  time of consummation. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume eligibility to purchase a loan was based in part on the  consumer's employment income of $50,000 per year. The creditor uses the  income figure in obtaining an approve/eligible recommendation from DU. A  quality control review, however, later determines that the documentation  provided and verified by the creditor to comply with Fannie Mae  requirements did not support the reported income of $50,000 per year. As  a result, Fannie Mae demands that the creditor repurchase the loan.  Assume that the quality control review is accurate, and that DU would  not have issued an approve/eligible recommendation if it had been  provided the accurate income figure. The DU determination at the time of  consummation was invalid because it was based on inaccurate information  provided by the creditor; therefore, the loan was never a qualified  mortgage under Sec. 1026.43(e)(4).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume that a creditor delivered a loan, which the creditor  determined was a qualified mortgage at the time of consummation under  Sec. 1026.43(e)(4), to Fannie Mae for inclusion in a particular To-Be- Announced Mortgage Backed Security (MBS) pool of loans. The data  submitted by the creditor at the time of loan delivery indicated that  the various loan terms met the product type, weighted-average coupon,  weighted-average maturity, and other MBS pooling criteria, and MBS  issuance disclosures to investors reflected this loan data. However,  after delivery and MBS issuance, a quality control review determines  that the loan violates the pooling criteria.The loan still meets  eligibility requirements for Fannie Mae products and loan terms. Fannie  Mae, however, requires the creditor to repurchase the loan due to the  violation of MBS pooling requirements. Assume that the quality control  review determination is accurate. Because the loan still meets Fannie  Mae's eligibility requirements, it remains a qualified mortgage based on  these facts and circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(e)(5).</p><p class="depth0">1. Satisfaction of qualified mortgage requirements. For a covered  transaction to be a qualified mortgage under Sec. 1026.43(e)(5), the  mortgage must satisfy the requirements for a qualified mortgage under  Sec. 1026.43(e)(2), other than the requirements regarding debt-to- income ratio. For example, a qualified mortgage under Sec.  1026.43(e)(5) may not have a loan term in excess of 30 years because  longer terms are prohibited for qualified mortgages under Sec.  1026.43(e)(2)(ii). Similarly, a qualified mortgage under Sec.  1026.43(e)(5) may not result in a balloon payment because Sec.  1026.43(e)(2)(i)(C) provides that qualified mortgages may not have  balloon payments except as provided under Sec. 1026.43(f). However, a  covered transaction need not comply with Sec. 1026.43(e)(2)(vi), which  prohibits consumer monthly debt-to-income ratios in excess of 43  percent. A covered transaction therefore can be a qualified mortgage  under Sec. 1026.43(e)(5) even though the consumer's monthly debt-to- income ratio is greater than 43 percent.</p><p class="depth0">2. Debt-to-income ratio or residual income. Section 1026.43(e)(5)  does not prescribe a specific monthly debt-to-income ratio with which  creditors must comply. Instead, creditors must consider a consumer's  debt-to-income ratio or residual income calculated generally in  accordance with Sec. 1026.43(c)(7) and verify the information used to  calculate the debt-to-income ratio or residual income in accordance with  Sec. 1026.43(c)(3) and (4). However, Sec. 1026.43(c)(7) refers  creditors to Sec. 1026.43(c)(5) for instructions on calculating the  payment on the covered transaction. Section 1026.43(c)(5) requires  creditors to calculate the payment differently than Sec.  1026.43(e)(2)(iv). For purposes of the qualified mortgage definition in  Sec. 1026.43(e)(5), creditors must base their calculation of the  consumer's debt-to-income ratio or residual income on the payment on the  covered transaction calculated according to Sec. 1026.43(e)(2)(iv)  instead of according to Sec. 1026.43(c)(5). Creditors are not required  to calculate the consumer's monthly debt-to-income ratio in accordance  with appendix Q to this part as is required under the general definition  of qualified mortgages by Sec. 1026.43(e)(2)(vi).</p><p class="depth0">3. Forward commitments. A creditor may make a mortgage loan that  will be transferred or sold to a purchaser pursuant to an agreement that  has been entered into at or before the time the transaction is  consummated. Such an agreement is sometimes known as a ``forward  commitment.'' A mortgage that will be acquired by a purchaser pursuant  to a forward commitment does not satisfy the requirements of Sec.  1026.43(e)(5), whether the forward commitment provides for the purchase  and sale of the specific transaction or for the purchase and sale of  transactions with certain prescribed criteria that the transaction  meets. However, a forward commitment to another person that also meets  the requirements of Sec. 1026.43(e)(5)(i)(D) is permitted. For example,  assume a creditor that is eligible to make qualified mortgages under  Sec. 1026.43(e)(5) makes a mortgage. If that mortgage meets the  purchase criteria of an investor with which the creditor has an  agreement to sell loans after consummation, then the loan does not meet  the definition of a qualified mortgage under Sec. 1026.43(e)(5).  However, if the investor meets the requirements of Sec.  1026.43(e)(5)(i)(D), the mortgage will be a qualified mortgage if all  other applicable criteria also are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0">4. Creditor qualifications. To be eligible to make qualified  mortgages under Sec. 1026.43(e)(5), a creditor must satisfy the  requirements stated in Sec. 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(B) and (C). Section  1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(B) requires that, during the preceding calendar year,  the creditor and its affiliates together originated 500 or fewer first- lien covered transactions. Section 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(C) requires that,  as of the end of the preceding calendar year, the creditor had total  assets of less than $2 billion, adjusted annually by the Bureau for  inflation.</p><p class="depth0">5. Requirement to hold in portfolio. Creditors generally must hold a  loan in portfolio to maintain the transaction's status as a qualified  mortgage under Sec. 1026.43(e)(5), subject to four exceptions. Unless  one of these exceptions applies, a loan is no longer a qualified  mortgage under Sec. 1026.43(e)(5) once legal title to the debt  obligation is sold, assigned, or otherwise transferred to another  person. Accordingly, unless one of the exceptions applies, the  transferee could not benefit from the presumption of compliance for  qualified mortgages under Sec. 1026.43(e)(1) unless the loan also met  the requirements of another qualified mortgage definition.</p><p class="depth0">6. Application to subsequent transferees. The exceptions contained  in Sec. 1026.43(e)(5)(ii) apply not only to an initial sale,  assignment, or other transfer by the originating creditor but to  subsequent sales, assignments, and other transfers as well. For example,  assume Creditor A originates a qualified mortgage under Sec.  1026.43(e)(5). Six months after consummation, Creditor A sells the  qualified mortgage to Creditor B pursuant to Sec. 1026.43(e)(5)(ii)(B)  and the loan retains its qualified mortgage status because Creditor B  complies with the limits on asset size and number of transactions. If  Creditor B sells the qualified mortgage, it will lose its qualified  mortgage status under Sec. 1026.43(e)(5) unless the sale qualifies for  one of the Sec. 1026.43(e)(5)(ii) exceptions for sales three or more  years after consummation, to another qualifying institution, as required  by supervisory action, or pursuant to a merger or acquisition.</p><p class="depth0">7. Transfer three years after consummation. Under Sec.  1026.43(e)(5)(ii)(A), if a qualified mortgage under Sec. 1026.43(e)(5)  is sold, assigned, or otherwise transferred three years or more after  consummation, the loan retains its status as a qualified mortgage under  Sec. 1026.43(e)(5) following the transfer. The transferee need not be  eligible to originate qualified mortgages under Sec. 1026.43(e)(5). The  loan will continue to be a qualified mortgage throughout its life, and  the transferee, and any subsequent transferees, may invoke the  presumption of compliance for qualified mortgages under Sec.  1026.43(e)(1).</p><p class="depth0">8. Transfer to another qualifying creditor. Under Sec.  1026.43(e)(5)(ii)(B), a qualified mortgage under Sec. 1026.43(e)(5) may  be sold, assigned, or otherwise transferred at any time to another  creditor that meets the requirements of Sec. 1026.43(e)(5)(i)(D). That  section requires that a creditor, during the preceding calendar year,  together with all affiliates, originated 500 or fewer first-lien covered  transactions and had total assets less than $2 billion (as adjusted for  inflation) at the end of the preceding calendar year. A qualified  mortgage under Sec. 1026.43(e)(5) transferred to a creditor that meets  these criteria would retain its qualified mortgage status even if it is  transferred less than three years after consummation.</p><p class="depth0">9. Supervisory sales. Section 1026.43(e)(5)(ii)(C) facilitates sales  that are deemed necessary by supervisory agencies to revive troubled  creditors and resolve failed creditors. A qualified mortgage under Sec.  1026.43(e)(5) retains its qualified mortgage status if it is sold,  assigned, or otherwise transferred to another person pursuant to: A  capital restoration plan or other action under 12 U.S.C. 1831o; the  actions or instructions of any person acting as conservator, receiver or  bankruptcy trustee; an order of a State or Federal government agency  with jurisdiction to examine the creditor pursuant to State or Federal  law; or an agreement between the creditor and such an agency. A  qualified mortgage under Sec. 1026.43(e)(5) that is sold, assigned, or  otherwise transferred under these circumstances retains its qualified  mortgage status regardless of how long after consummation it is sold and  regardless of the size or other characteristics of the transferee.  Section 1026.43(e)(5)(ii)(C) does   not apply to transfers done to comply with a generally applicable  regulation with future effect designed to implement, interpret, or  prescribe law or policy in the absence of a specific order by or a  specific agreement with a governmental agency described in Sec.  1026.43(e)(5)(ii)(C) directing the sale of one or more qualified  mortgages under Sec. 1026.43(e)(5) held by the creditor or one of the  other circumstances listed in Sec. 1026.43(e)(5)(ii)(C). For example, a  qualified mortgage under Sec. 1026.43(e)(5) that is sold pursuant to a  capital restoration plan under 12 U.S.C. 1831o would retain its status  as a qualified mortgage following the sale. However, if the creditor  simply chose to sell the same qualified mortgage as one way to comply  with general regulatory capital requirements in the absence of  supervisory action or agreement it would lose its status as a qualified  mortgage following the sale unless it qualifies under another definition  of qualified mortgage.</p><p class="depth0">10. Mergers and acquisitions. A qualified mortgage under Sec.  1026.43(e)(5) retains its qualified mortgage status if a creditor merges  with, is acquired by, or acquires another person regardless of whether  the creditor or its successor is eligible to originate new qualified  mortgages under Sec. 1026.43(e)(5) after the merger or acquisition.  However, the creditor or its successor can originate new qualified  mortgages under Sec. 1026.43(e)(5) only if it complies with all of the  requirements of Sec. 1026.43(e)(5) after the merger or acquisition. For  example, assume a creditor that originates 250 covered transactions each  year and originates qualified mortgages under Sec. 1026.43(e)(5) is  acquired by a larger creditor that originates 10,000 covered  transactions each year. Following the acquisition, the small creditor  would no longer be able to originate Sec. 1026.43(e)(5) qualified  mortgages because, together with its affiliates, it would originate more  than 500 covered transactions each year. However, the Sec.  1026.43(e)(5) qualified mortgages originated by the small creditor  before the acquisition would retain their qualified mortgage status.</p><p class="depth0">43(f) Balloon-Payment qualified mortgages made by certain creditors.</p><p class="depth0">43(f)(1) Exemption.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(f)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Satisfaction of qualified mortgage requirements. Under Sec.  1026.43(f)(1)(i), for a mortgage that provides for a balloon payment to  be a qualified mortgage, the mortgage must satisfy the requirements for  a qualified mortgage in paragraphs (e)(2)(i)(A), (e)(2)(ii), (iii), and  (v). Therefore, a covered transaction with balloon payment terms must  provide for regular periodic payments that do not result in an increase  of the principal balance, pursuant to Sec. 1026.43(e)(2)(i)(A); must  have a loan term that does not exceed 30 years, pursuant to Sec.  1026.43(e)(2)(ii); must have total points and fees that do not exceed  specified thresholds pursuant to Sec. 1026.43(e)(2)(iii); and must  satisfy the consideration and verification requirements in Sec.  1026.43(e)(2)(v).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(f)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Example. Under Sec. 1026.43(f)(1)(ii), if a qualified mortgage  provides for a balloon payment, the creditor must determine that the  consumer is able to make all scheduled payments under the legal  obligation other than the balloon payment. For example, assume a loan in  an amount of $200,000 that has a five-year loan term, but is amortized  over 30 years. The loan agreement provides for a fixed interest rate of  6 percent. The loan consummates on March 3, 2014, and the monthly  payment of principal and interest scheduled for the first five years is  $1,199, with the first monthly payment due on April 1, 2014. The balloon  payment of $187,308 is required on the due date of the 60th monthly  payment, which is April 1, 2019. The loan can be a qualified mortgage if  the creditor underwrites the loan using the scheduled principal and  interest payment of $1,199, plus the consumer's monthly payment for all  mortgage-related obligations, and satisfies the other criteria set forth  in Sec. 1026.43(f).</p><p class="depth0">2. Creditor's determination. A creditor must determine that the  consumer is able to make all scheduled payments other than the balloon  payment to satisfy Sec. 1026.43(f)(1)(ii), in accordance with the legal  obligation, together with the consumer's monthly payments for all  mortgage-related obligations and excluding the balloon payment, to meet  the repayment ability requirements of Sec. 1026.43(f)(1)(ii). A  creditor satisfies Sec. 1026.43(f)(1)(ii) if it uses the maximum  payment in the payment schedule, excluding any balloon payment, to  determine if the consumer has the ability to make the scheduled  payments.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(f)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Debt-to-income or residual income. A creditor must consider and  verify the consumer's monthly debt-to-income ratio or residual income to  meet the requirements of Sec. 1026.43(f)(1)(iii). To calculate the  consumer's monthly debt-to-income or residual income for purposes of  Sec. 1026.43(f)(1)(iii), the creditor may rely on the definitions and  calculation rules in Sec. 1026.43(c)(7) and its accompanying  commentary, except for the calculation rules for a consumer's total  monthly debt obligations (which is a component of debt-to-income and  residual income under Sec. 1026.43(c)(7)). For purposes of calculating  the consumer's total monthly debt obligations under Sec.  1026.43(f)(1)(iii), the creditor must calculate the monthly payment on  the covered transaction using the payment calculation rules in Sec.  1026.43(f)(1)(iv)(A), together with all mortgage-related obligations and  excluding the balloon payment.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(f)(1)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">1. Scheduled payments. Under Sec. 1026.43(f)(1)(iv)(A), the legal  obligation must   provide that scheduled payments must be substantially equal and  determined using an amortization period that does not exceed 30 years.  Balloon payments often result when the periodic payment would fully  repay the loan amount only if made over some period that is longer than  the loan term. For example, a loan term of 10 years with periodic  payments based on an amortization period of 20 years would result in a  balloon payment being due at the end of the loan term. Whatever the loan  term, the amortization period used to determine the scheduled periodic  payments that the consumer must pay under the terms of the legal  obligation may not exceed 30 years.</p><p class="depth0">2. Substantially equal. The calculation of payments scheduled by the  legal obligation under Sec. 1026.43(f)(1)(iv)(A) are required to result  in substantially equal amounts. This means that the scheduled payments  need to be similar, but need not be equal. For further guidance on  substantially equal payments, see comment 43(c)(5)(i)-4.</p><p class="depth0">3. Interest-only payments. A mortgage that only requires the payment  of accrued interest each month does not meet the requirements of Sec.  1026.43(f)(1)(iv)(A).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(f)(1)(v).</p><p class="depth0">1. Forward commitments. A creditor may make a mortgage loan that  will be transferred or sold to a purchaser pursuant to an agreement that  has been entered into at or before the time the transaction is  consummated. Such an agreement is sometimes known as a ``forward  commitment.'' A balloon-payment mortgage that will be acquired by a  purchaser pursuant to a forward commitment does not satisfy the  requirements of Sec. 1026.43(f)(1)(v), whether the forward commitment  provides for the purchase and sale of the specific transaction or for  the purchase and sale of transactions with certain prescribed criteria  that the transaction meets. However, a purchase and sale of a balloon- payment qualified mortgage to another person that separately meets the  requirements of Sec. 1026.43(f)(1)(vi) is permitted. For example:  assume a creditor that meets the requirements of Sec. 1026.43(f)(1)(vi)  makes a balloon-payment mortgage that meets the requirements of Sec.  1026.43(f)(1)(i) through (iv); if the balloon-payment mortgage meets the  purchase criteria of an investor with which the creditor has an  agreement to sell such loans after consummation, then the balloon- payment mortgage does not meet the definition of a qualified mortgage in  accordance with Sec. 1026.43(f)(1)(v). However, if the investor meets  the requirement of Sec. 1026.43(f)(1)(vi), the balloon-payment  qualified mortgage retains its qualified mortgage status.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(f)(1)(vi).</p><p class="depth0">1. Creditor qualifications. Under Sec. 1026.43(f)(1)(vi), to make a  qualified mortgage that provides for a balloon payment, the creditor  must satisfy three criteria that are also required under Sec.  1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A), (B) and (C), which require:</p><p class="depth0">i. During the preceding calendar year, the creditor extended over 50  percent of its total first-lien covered transactions, as defined in  Sec. 1026.43(b)(1), on properties that are located in counties that are  designated either ``rural'' or ``underserved,'' as defined in Sec.  1026.35(b)(2)(iv), to satisfy the requirement of Sec.  1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A). Pursuant to Sec. 1026.35(b)(2)(iv), a county is  considered to be rural if it is neither in a metropolitan statistical  area, nor a micropolitan statistical area adjacent to a metropolitan  statistical area, as those terms are defined by the U.S. Office of  Management and Budget. A county is considered to be underserved if no  more than two creditors extend covered transactions secured by a first  lien five or more times in that county during a calendar year. The  Bureau determines annually which counties in the United States are rural  or underserved and publishes on its public Web site lists of those  counties to enable creditors to determine whether they meet this  criterion. Thus, for example, if a creditor originated 90 first-lien  covered transactions during 2013, the creditor meets this element of the  exception in 2014 if at least 46 of those transactions are secured by  first liens on properties located in one or more counties that are on  the Bureau's lists for 2013.</p><p class="depth0">ii. During the preceding calendar year, the creditor together with  its affiliates originated 500 or fewer first-lien covered transactions,  as defined by Sec. 1026.43(b)(1), to satisfy the requirement of Sec.  1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(B).</p><p class="depth0">iii. As of the end of the preceding calendar year, the creditor had  total assets that do not exceed the current asset threshold established  by the Bureau, to satisfy the requirement of Sec.  1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(C). For calendar year 2013, the asset threshold was  $2,000,000,000.</p><p class="depth0">43(f)(2) Post-consummation transfer of balloon-payment qualified  mortgage.</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirement to hold in portfolio. Creditors generally must hold a  balloon-payment qualified mortgage in portfolio to maintain the  transaction's status as a qualified mortgage under Sec. 1026.43(f)(1),  subject to four exceptions. Unless one of these exceptions applies, a  balloon-payment qualified mortgage is no longer a qualified mortgage  under Sec. 1026.43(f)(1) once legal title to the debt obligation is  sold, assigned, or otherwise transferred to another person.

Application to subsequent transferees. The exceptions contained  in Sec. 1026.43(f)(2) apply not only to an initial sale, assignment, or  other transfer by the originating creditor   but to subsequent sales, assignments, and other transfers as well. For  example, assume Creditor A originates a qualified mortgage under Sec.  1026.43(f)(1). Six months after consummation, Creditor A sells the  qualified mortgage to Creditor B pursuant to Sec. 1026.43(f)(2)(ii) and  the loan retains its qualified mortgage status because Creditor B  complies with the limits on operating predominantly in rural or  underserved areas, asset size, and number of transactions. If Creditor B  sells the qualified mortgage, it will lose its qualified mortgage status  under Sec. 1026.43(f)(1) unless the sale qualifies for one of the Sec.  1026.43(f)(2) exceptions for sales three or more years after  consummation, to another qualifying institution, as required by  supervisory action, or pursuant to a merger or acquisition.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(f)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1.

That section requires that a creditor: (1) Operate  predominantly in a rural or underserved area during the preceding  calendar year; (2) during the preceding calendar year, together with all  affiliates, originated 500 or fewer first-lien covered transactions; and  (3) had total assets less than $2 billion (as adjusted for inflation) at  the end of the preceding calendar year. A balloon-payment qualified  mortgage under Sec. 1026.43(f)(1) transferred to a creditor that meets  these criteria would retain its qualified mortgage status even if it is  transferred less than three years after consummation.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(f)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Supervisory sales. Section 1026.43(f)(2)(iii) facilitates sales  that are deemed necessary by supervisory agencies to revive troubled  creditors and resolve failed creditors. A balloon-payment qualified  mortgage under Sec. 1026.43(f)(1) retains its qualified mortgage status  if it is sold, assigned, or otherwise transferred to another person  pursuant to: (1) A capital restoration plan or other action under 12  U.S.C. 1831o; (2) the actions or instructions of any person acting as  conservator, receiver, or bankruptcy trustee; (3) an order of a State or  Federal government agency with jurisdiction to examine the creditor  pursuant to State or Federal law; or (4) an agreement between the  creditor and such an agency. A balloon-payment qualified mortgage under  Sec. 1026.43(f)(1) that is sold, assigned, or otherwise transferred  under these circumstances retains its qualified mortgage status  regardless of how long after consummation it is sold and regardless of  the size or other characteristics of the transferee. Section  1026.43(f)(2)(iii) does not apply to transfers done to comply with a  generally applicable regulation with future effect designed to  implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy in the absence of a  specific order by or a specific agreement with a governmental agency  described in Sec. 1026.43(f)(2)(iii) directing the sale of one or more  qualified mortgages under Sec. 1026.43(f)(1) held by the creditor or  one of the other circumstances listed in Sec. 1026.43(f)(2)(iii). For  example, a balloon-payment qualified mortgage under Sec. 1026.43(f)(1)  that is sold pursuant to a capital restoration plan under 12 U.S.C.  1831o would retain its status as a qualified mortgage following the  sale. However, if the creditor simply chose to sell the same qualified  mortgage as one way to comply with general regulatory capital  requirements in the absence of supervisory action or agreement the  transaction would lose its status as a qualified mortgage following the  sale unless it qualifies under another definition of qualified mortgage.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(f)(2)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">1. Mergers and acquisitions. A qualified mortgage under Sec.  1026.43(f)(1) retains its qualified mortgage status if a creditor merges  with, is acquired by another person, or acquires another person  regardless of whether the creditor or its successor is eligible to  originate new balloon-payment qualified mortgages under Sec.  1026.43(f)(1) after the merger or acquisition. However, the creditor or  its successor can originate new balloon-payment qualified mortgages  under Sec. 1026.43(f)(1) only if it complies with all of the  requirements of Sec. 1026.43(f)(1) after the merger or acquisition. For  example, assume a small creditor that originates 250 first-lien covered  transactions each year and originates balloon-payment qualified  mortgages under Sec. 1026.43(f)(1) is acquired by a larger creditor  that originates 10,000 first-lien covered transactions each year.  Following the acquisition, the small creditor would no longer be able to  originate balloon-payment qualified mortgages because, together with its  affiliates, it would originate more than 500 first-lien covered  transactions each year. However, the balloon-payment qualified mortgages  originated by the small creditor   before the acquisition would retain their qualified mortgage status.</p><p class="depth0">43(g) Prepayment penalties.</p><p class="depth0">43(g)(2) Limits on prepayment penalties.</p><p class="depth0">1. Maximum period and amount. Section 1026.43(g)(2) establishes the  maximum period during which a prepayment penalty may be imposed and the  maximum amount of the prepayment penalty. A covered transaction may  include a prepayment penalty that may be imposed during a shorter period  or in a lower amount than provided under Sec. 1026.43(g)(2). For  example, a covered transaction may include a prepayment penalty that may  be imposed for two years after consummation and that equals 1 percent of  the amount prepaid in each of those two years.</p><p class="depth0">43(g)(3) Alternative offer required.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(g)(3)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Same type of interest rate. Under Sec. 1026.43(g)(3)(i), if a  creditor offers a consumer a covered transaction with a prepayment  penalty, the creditor must offer the consumer an alternative covered  transaction without a prepayment penalty and with an annual percentage  rate that cannot increase after consummation. Under Sec.  1026.43(g)(3)(i), if the covered transaction with a prepayment penalty  is a fixed-rate mortgage, as defined in Sec. 1026.18(s)(7)(iii), then  the alternative covered transaction without a prepayment penalty must  also be a fixed-rate mortgage. Likewise, if the covered transaction with  a prepayment penalty is a step-rate mortgage, as defined in Sec.  1026.18(s)(7)(ii), then the alternative covered transaction without a  prepayment penalty must also be a step-rate mortgage.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(g)(3)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">1. Points and fees. Whether or not an alternative covered  transaction without a prepayment penalty satisfies the points and fees  conditions for a qualified mortgage is determined based on the  information known to the creditor at the time the creditor offers the  consumer the transaction. At the time a creditor offers a consumer an  alternative covered transaction without a prepayment penalty under Sec.  1026.43(g)(3), the creditor may know the amount of some, but not all, of  the points and fees that will be charged for the transaction. For  example, a creditor may not know that a consumer intends to buy single- premium credit unemployment insurance, which would be included in the  points and fees for the covered transaction. The points and fees  condition under Sec. 1026.43(g)(3)(iv) is satisfied if a creditor  reasonably believes, based on information known to the creditor at the  time the offer is made, that the amount of points and fees to be charged  for an alternative covered transaction without a prepayment penalty will  be less than or equal to the amount of points and fees allowed for a  qualified mortgage under Sec. 1026.43(e)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 43(g)(3)(v).</p><p class="depth0">1. Transactions for which the consumer likely qualifies. Under Sec.  1026.43(g)(3)(v), the alternative covered transaction without a  prepayment penalty the creditor must offer under Sec. 1026.43(g)(3)  must be a transaction for which the creditor has a good faith belief the  consumer likely qualifies. For example, assume the creditor has a good  faith belief the consumer can afford monthly payments of up to $800. If  the creditor offers the consumer a fixed-rate mortgage with a prepayment  penalty for which monthly payments are $700 and an alternative covered  transaction without a prepayment penalty for which monthly payments are  $900, the requirements of Sec. 1026.43(g)(3)(v) are not met. The  creditor's belief that the consumer likely qualifies for the covered  transaction without a prepayment penalty should be based on the  information known to the creditor at the time the creditor offers the  transaction. In making this determination, the creditor may rely on  information provided by the consumer, even if the information  subsequently is determined to be inaccurate.</p><p class="depth0">43(g)(4) Offer through a mortgage broker.</p><p class="depth0">1. Rate sheet. Under Sec. 1026.43(g)(4), where the creditor offers  covered transactions with a prepayment penalty to consumers through a  mortgage broker, as defined in Sec. 1026.36(a)(2), the creditor must  present the mortgage broker an alternative covered transaction that  satisfies the requirements of Sec. 1026.43(g)(3). Creditors may comply  with this requirement by providing a rate sheet to the mortgage broker  that states the terms of such an alternative covered transaction without  a prepayment penalty.</p><p class="depth0">2. Alternative to creditor's offer. Section 1026.43(g)(4)(ii)  requires that the creditor provide, by agreement, for the mortgage  broker to present the consumer an alternative covered transaction that  satisfies the requirements of Sec. 1026.43(g)(3) offered by either the  creditor or by another creditor, if the other creditor offers a covered  transaction with a lower interest rate or a lower total dollar amount of  discount points and origination points or fees. The agreement may  provide for the mortgage broker to present both the creditor's covered  transaction and an alternative covered transaction offered by another  creditor with a lower interest rate or a lower total dollar amount of  origination discount points and points or fees. See comment 36(e)(3)-3  for guidance in determining which step-rate mortgage has a lower  interest rate.</p><p class="depth0">3. Agreement. The creditor's agreement with a mortgage broker for  purposes of Sec. 1026.43(g)(4) may be part of another agreement with  the mortgage broker, for example, a compensation agreement. Thus, the  creditor need not enter into a separate agreement with the mortgage  broker with respect to each covered transaction with a prepayment  penalty.</p><p class="depth0">43(g)(5) Creditor that is a loan originator.</p><p class="depth0">1. Loan originator. The definition of ``loan originator'' in Sec.  1026.36(a)(1) applies for purposes of Sec. 1026.43(g)(5). Thus, a loan  originator includes any creditor that satisfies the definition of loan  originator but makes use of ``table-funding'' by a third party. See  comment 36(a)-1.i and ii.</p><p class="depth0">2. Lower interest rate. Under Sec. 1026.43(g)(5), a creditor that  is a loan originator must present an alternative covered transaction  without a prepayment penalty that satisfies the requirements of Sec.  1026.43(g)(3) offered by either the assignee for the covered transaction  or another person, if that other person offers a transaction with a  lower interest rate or a lower total dollar amount of origination points  or fees or discount points. See comment 36(e)(3)-3 for guidance in  determining which step-rate mortgage has a lower interest rate.</p><p class="depth0">43(h) Evasion; open-end credit.</p><p class="depth0">1. Subject to closed-end credit rules. Where a creditor documents a  loan as open-end credit but the features and terms, or other  circumstances, demonstrate that the loan does not meet the definition of  open-end credit in Sec. 1026.2(a)(20), the loan is subject to the rules  for closed-end credit, including Sec. 1026.43.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart F--Special Rules for Private Education Loans</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.46--Special Disclosure Requirements for Private Education</p><p class="depth0">Loans</p><p class="depth0">46(a) Coverage</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. This subpart applies to all private education loans as  defined in Sec. 1026.46(b)(5). Coverage under this subpart is optional  for certain extensions of credit that do not meet the definition of  ``private education loan'' because the credit is not extended, in whole  or in part, for ``postsecondary educational expenses'' defined in Sec.  1026.46(b)(3). If a transaction is not covered and a creditor opts to  comply with any section of this subpart, the creditor must comply with  all applicable sections of this subpart. If a transaction is not covered  and a creditor opts not to comply with this subpart, the creditor must  comply with all applicable requirements under Sec. Sec. 1026.17 and  1026.18. Compliance with this subpart is optional for an extension of  credit for expenses incurred after graduation from a law, medical,  dental, veterinary, or other graduate school and related to relocation,  study for a bar or other examination, participation in an internship or  residency program, or similar purposes. However, if any part of such  loan is used for postsecondary educational expenses as defined in Sec.  1026.46(b)(3), then compliance with Subpart F is mandatory not optional.</p><p class="depth0">46(b) Definitions</p><p class="depth0">46(b)(1) Covered Educational Institution</p><p class="depth0">1. General. A covered educational institution includes any  educational institution that meets the definition of an institution of  higher education in Sec. 1026.46(b)(2). An institution is also a  covered educational institution if it otherwise meets the definition of  an institution of higher education, except for its lack of  accreditation. Such an institution may include, for example, a  university or community college. It may also include an institution,  whether accredited or unaccredited, offering instruction to prepare  students for gainful employment in a recognized profession, such as  flying, culinary arts, or dental assistance. A covered educational  institution does not include elementary or secondary schools.</p><p class="depth0">2. Agent. For purposes of Sec. 1026.46(b)(1), the term agent means  an institution-affiliated organization as defined by Section 151 of the  Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C 1019) or an officer or employee  of an institution-affiliated organization. Under Section 151 of the  Higher Education Act, an institution-affiliated organization means any  organization that is directly or indirectly related to a covered  institution and is engaged in the practice of recommending, promoting,  or endorsing education loans for students attending the covered  institution or the families of such students. An institution-affiliated  organization may include an alumni organization, athletic organization,  foundation, or social, academic, or professional organization, of a  covered institution, but does not include any creditor with respect to  any private education loan made by that creditor.</p><p class="depth0">46(b)(2) Institution of Higher Education</p><p class="depth0">1. General. An institution of higher education includes any  institution that meets the definitions contained in sections 101 and 102  of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001-1002) and  implementing Department of Education regulations (34 CFR 600). Such an  institution may include, for example, a university or community college.  It may also include an institution offering instruction to prepare  students for gainful employment in a recognized profession, such as  flying, culinary arts, or dental assistance. An institution of higher  education does not include elementary or secondary schools.</p><p class="depth0">46(b)(3) Postsecondary Educational Expenses</p><p class="depth0">1. General. The examples listed in Sec. 1026.46(b)(3) are  illustrative only. The full list of postsecondary educational expenses  is contained in section 472 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20  U.S.C. 1087ll).</p><p class="depth0">46(b)(4) Preferred Lender Arrangement</p><p class="depth0">1. General. The term ``preferred lender arrangement'' is defined in  section 151 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1019). The  term refers to an arrangement or agreement between a creditor and a  covered educational institution (or an institution-affiliated  organization as defined by section 151 of the Higher Education Act of  1965 (20 U.S.C 1019)) under which a creditor provides private education  loans to consumers for students attending the covered educational  institution and the covered educational institution recommends,  promotes, or endorses the private education loan products of the  creditor. It does not include arrangements or agreements with respect to  Federal Direct Stafford/Ford loans, or Federal PLUS loans made under the  Federal PLUS auction pilot program.</p><p class="depth0">46(b)(5) Private Education Loan</p><p class="depth0">1. Extended expressly for postsecondary educational expenses. A  private education loan is one that is extended expressly for  postsecondary educational expenses. The term includes loans extended for  postsecondary educational expenses incurred while a student is enrolled  in a covered educational institution as well as loans extended to  consolidate a consumer's pre-existing private education loans.</p><p class="depth0">2. Multiple-purpose loans. i. Definition. A private education loan  may include an extension of credit not excluded under Sec.  1026.46(b)(5) that the consumer may use for multiple purposes including,  but not limited to, postsecondary educational expenses. If the consumer  expressly indicates that the proceeds of the loan will be used to pay  for postsecondary educational expenses by indicating the loan's purpose  on an application, the loan is a private education loan.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Coverage. A creditor generally will not know before an  application is received whether the consumer intends to use the loan for  postsecondary educational expenses. For this reason, the creditor need  not provide the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.47(a) on or with the  application or solicitation for a loan that may be used for multiple  purposes. See Sec. 1026.47(d)(1)(i). However, if the consumer expressly  indicates that the proceeds of the loan will be used to pay for  postsecondary educational expenses, the creditor must comply with  Sec. Sec. 1026.47(b) and (c) and Sec. 1026.48. For purposes of the  required disclosures, the creditor must calculate the disclosures based  on the entire amount of the loan, even if only a part of the proceeds is  intended for postsecondary educational expenses. The creditor may rely  solely on a check-box, or a purpose line, on a loan application to  determine whether or not the applicant intends to use loan proceeds for  postsecondary educational expenses.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Examples. The creditor must comply only if the extension of  credit also meets the other parts of the definition of private education  loan. For example, if the creditor uses a single application form for  both open-end and closed-end credit, and the consumer applies for open- end credit to be used for postsecondary educational expenses, the  extension of credit is not covered. Similarly, if the consumer indicates  the extension of credit will be used for educational expenses that are  not postsecondary educational expenses, such as elementary or secondary  educational expenses, the extension of credit is not covered. These  examples are only illustrative, not exhaustive.</p><p class="depth0">3. Short-term loans. Some covered educational institutions offer  loans to students with terms of 90 days or less to assist the student in  paying for educational expenses, usually while the student waits for  other funds to be disbursed. Under Sec. 1026.46(b)(5)(iv)(A) such loans  are not considered private education loans, even if interest is charged  on the credit balance. (Because these loans charge interest, they are  not covered by the exception under Sec. 1026.46(b)(5)(iv)(B).) However,  these loans are extensions of credit subject to the requirements of  Sec. Sec. 1026.17 and 18. The legal agreement may provide that  repayment is required when the consumer or the educational institution  receives certain funds. If, under the terms of the legal obligation,  repayment of the loan is required when the certain funds are received by  the consumer or the educational institution (such as by deposit into the  consumer's or educational institution's account), the disclosures should  be based on the creditor's estimate of the time the funds will be  delivered.</p><p class="depth0">4. Billing plans. Some covered educational institutions offer  billing plans that permit a consumer to make payments in installments.  Such plans are not considered private education loans, if an interest  rate will not be applied to the credit balance and the term of the  extension of credit is one year or less, even if the plan is payable in  more than four installments. However, such plans may be extensions of  credit subject to the requirements of Sec. Sec. 1026.17 and 1026.18.</p><p class="depth0">46(c) Form of Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Form of disclosures--relation to other sections. Creditors must  make the disclosures required under this subpart in accordance with  Sec. 1026.46(c). Section 1026.46(c)(2) requires that the disclosures be  grouped together and segregated from everything else. In complying with  this requirement, creditors may follow the rules in Sec. 1026.17,  except where specifically provided otherwise. For example, although  Sec. 1026.17(b) requires creditors to provide only one set of  disclosures before consummation of the transaction,   Sec. Sec. 1026.47(b) and (c) require that the creditor provide the  disclosures under Sec. 1026.18 both upon approval and after the  consumer accepts the loan.</p><p class="depth0">46(c)(3) Electronic Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Application and solicitation disclosures--electronic disclosures.  If the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.47(a) are provided  electronically, they must be provided on or with the application or  solicitation reply form. Electronic disclosures are deemed to be on or  with an application or solicitation if they meet one of the following  conditions:</p><p class="depth0">i. They automatically appear on the screen when the application or  solicitation reply form appears;</p><p class="depth0">ii. They are located on the same Web ``page'' as the application or  solicitation reply form without necessarily appearing on the initial  screen, if the application or reply form contains a clear and  conspicuous reference to the location of the disclosures and indicates  that the disclosures contain rate, fee, and other cost information, as  applicable; or</p><p class="depth0">iii. They are posted on a Web site and the application or  solicitation reply form is linked to the disclosures in a manner that  prevents the consumer from by passing the disclosures before submitting  the application or reply form.</p><p class="depth0">46(d) Timing of Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Receipt of disclosures. Under Sec. 1026.46(d)(4), if the  creditor places the disclosures in the mail, the consumer is considered  to have received them three business days after they are mailed. For  purposes of Sec. 1026.46(d)(4), ``business day'' means all calendar  days except Sundays and the legal public holidays referred to in Sec.  1026.2(a)(6). See comment 2(a)(6)-2. For example, if the creditor places  the disclosures in the mail on Thursday, June 4, the disclosures are  considered received on Monday, June 8.</p><p class="depth0">46(d)(1) Application or Solicitation Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Invitations to apply. A creditor may contact a consumer who has  not been pre-selected for a private education loan about taking out a  loan (whether by direct mail, telephone, or other means) and invite the  consumer to complete an application. Such a contact does not meet the  definition of solicitation, nor is it covered by this subpart, unless  the contact itself includes the following:</p><p class="depth0">i. An application form in a direct mailing, electronic communication  or a single application form as a ``take-one'' (in racks in public  locations, for example);</p><p class="depth0">ii. An oral application in a telephone contact; or</p><p class="depth0">iii. An application in an in-person contact.</p><p class="depth0">46(d)(2) Approval Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Timing. The creditor must provide the disclosures required by  Sec. 1026.47(b) at the time the creditor provides to the consumer any  notice that the loan has been approved. However, nothing in this section  prevents the creditor from communicating to the consumer that additional  information is required from the consumer before approval may be  granted. In such a case, a creditor is not required to provide the  disclosures at that time. If the creditor communicates notice of  approval to the consumer by mail, the disclosures must be mailed at the  same time as the notice of approval. If the creditor communicates notice  of approval by telephone, the creditor must place the disclosures in the  mail within three business days of the telephone call. If the creditor  communicates notice of approval in electronic form, the creditor may  provide the disclosures in electronic form. If the creditor has complied  with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the  Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act)  (15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq.) the creditor may provide the disclosures solely  in electronic form; otherwise, the creditor must place the disclosures  in the mail within three business days of the communication.</p><p class="depth0">46(g) Effect of Subsequent Events</p><p class="depth0">1. Approval disclosures. Inaccuracies in the disclosures required  under Sec. 1026.47(b) are not violations if attributable to events  occurring after disclosures are made, although creditors are restricted  under Sec. 1026.48(c)(2) from making certain changes to the loan's rate  or terms after the creditor provides an approval disclosure to a  consumer. Since creditors are required provide the final disclosures  under Sec. 1026.47(c), they need not make new approval disclosures in  response to an event that occurs after the creditor delivers the  required approval disclosures, except as specified under Sec.  1026.48(c)(4). For example, at the time the approval disclosures are  provided, the creditor may not know the precise disbursement date of the  loan funds and must provide estimated disclosures based on the best  information reasonably available and labeled as an estimate. If, after  the approval disclosures are provided, the creditor learns from the  educational institution the precise disbursement date, new approval  disclosures would not be required, unless specifically required under  Sec. 1026.48(c)(4) if other changes are made. Similarly, the creditor  may not know the precise amounts of each loan to be consolidated in a  consolidation loan transaction and information about the precise amounts  would not require new approval disclosures, unless specifically required  under Sec. 1026.48(c)(4) if other changes are made.</p><p class="depth0">2. Final disclosures. Inaccuracies in the disclosures required under  Sec. 1026.47(c) are not   violations if attributable to events occurring after disclosures are  made. For example, if the consumer initially chooses to defer payment of  principal and interest while enrolled in a covered educational  institution, but later chooses to make payments while enrolled, such a  change does not make the original disclosures inaccurate.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.47--Content of Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. As applicable. The disclosures required by this subpart need be  made only as applicable, unless specifically required otherwise. The  creditor need not provide any disclosure that is not applicable to a  particular transaction. For example, in a transaction consolidating  private education loans, or in transactions under Sec. 1026.46(a) for  which compliance with this subpart is optional, the creditor need not  disclose the information under Sec. Sec. 1026.47(a)(6), and (b)(4), and  any other information otherwise required to be disclosed under this  subpart that is not applicable to the transaction. Similarly, creditors  making loans to consumers where the student is not attending an  institution of higher education, as defined in Sec. 1026.46(b)(2), need  not provide the disclosures regarding the self-certification form in  Sec. 1026.47(a)(8).</p><p class="depth0">47(a) Application or Solicitation Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 47(a)(1)(i)</p><p class="depth0">1. Rates actually offered. The disclosure may state only those rates  that the creditor is actually prepared to offer. For example, a creditor  may not disclose a very low interest rate that will not in fact be  offered at any time. For a loan with variable interest rates, the ranges  of rates will be considered actually offered if:</p><p class="depth0">i. For disclosures in applications or solicitations sent by direct  mail, the rates were in effect within 60 days before mailing;</p><p class="depth0">ii. For disclosures in applications or solicitations in electronic  form, the rates were in effect within 30 days before the disclosures are  sent to a consumer, or for disclosures made on an Internet Web site,  within 30 days before being viewed by the public;</p><p class="depth0">iii. For disclosures in printed applications or solicitations made  available to the general public, the rates were in effect within 30 days  before printing; or</p><p class="depth0">iv. For disclosures provided orally in telephone applications or  solicitations, the rates are currently available at the time the  disclosures are provided.</p><p class="depth0">2. Creditworthiness and other factors. If the rate will depend, at  least in part, on a later determination of the consumer's  creditworthiness or other factors, the disclosure must include a  statement that the rate for which the consumer may qualify at approval  will depend on the consumer's creditworthiness and other factors. The  creditor may, but is not required to, specify any additional factors  that it will use to determine the interest rate. For example, if the  creditor will determine the interest rate based on information in the  consumer's or cosigner's credit report and the type of school the  consumer attends, the creditor may state, ``Your interest rate will be  based on your credit history and other factors (cosigner credit and  school type).''</p><p class="depth0">3. Rates applicable to the loan. For a variable-rate private  education loan, the disclosure of the interest rate or range of rates  must reflect the rate or rates calculated based on the index and margin  that will be used to make interest rate adjustments for the loan. The  creditor may provide a description of the index and margin or range of  margins used to make interest rate adjustments, including a reference to  a source, such as a newspaper, where the consumer may look up the index.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 47(a)(1)(iii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. The interest rate is considered variable if the terms  of the legal obligation allow the creditor to increase the interest rate  originally disclosed to the consumer and the requirements of Sec.  1026.47(a)(1)(iii) apply to all such transactions. The provisions do not  apply to increases resulting from delinquency (including late payment),  default, assumption, or acceleration.</p><p class="depth0">2. Limitations. The creditor must disclose how often the rate may  change and any limit on the amount that the rate may increase at any one  time. The creditor must also disclose any maximum rate over the life of  the transaction. If the legal obligation between the parties does  specify a maximum rate, the creditor must disclose any legal limits in  the nature of usury or rate ceilings under state or Federal statutes or  regulations. However, if the applicable maximum rate is in the form of a  legal limit, such as a state's usury cap (rather than a maximum rate  specified in the legal obligation between the parties), the creditor  must disclose that the maximum rate is determined by applicable law. The  creditor must also disclose that the consumer's actual rate may be  higher or lower than the initial rates disclosed under Sec.  1026.47(a)(1)(i), if applicable.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 47(a)(1)(iv)</p><p class="depth0">1. Cosigner or guarantor--changes in applicable interest rate. The  creditor must state whether the interest rate typically will be higher  if the loan is not co-signed or guaranteed by a third party. The  creditor is required to provide a statement of the effect on the  interest rate and is not required to provide a numerical estimate of the  effect on the interest rate. For example, a creditor may state: ``Rates  are typically higher without a cosigner.''</p><p class="depth0">47(a)(2) Fees and Default or Late Payment Costs</p><p class="depth0">1. Fees or range of fees. The creditor must itemize fees required to  obtain the private education loan. The creditor must give a single  dollar amount for each fee, unless the fee is based on a percentage, in  which case a percentage must be stated. If the exact amount of the fee  is not known at the time of disclosure, the creditor may disclose the  dollar amount or percentage for each fee as an estimated range.</p><p class="depth0">2. Fees required to obtain the private education loan. The creditor  must itemize the fees that the consumer must pay to obtain the private  education loan. Fees disclosed include all finance charges under Sec.  1026.4, such as loan origination fees, credit report fees, and fees  charged upon entering repayment, as well as fees not considered finance  charges but required to obtain credit, such as application fees that are  charged whether or not credit is extended. Fees disclosed include those  paid by the consumer directly to the creditor and fees paid to third  parties by the creditor on the consumer's behalf. Creditors are not  required to disclose fees that apply if the consumer exercises an option  under the loan agreement after consummation, such as fees for deferment,  forbearance, or loan modification.</p><p class="depth0">47(a)(3) Repayment Terms</p><p class="depth0">1. Loan term. The term of the loan is the maximum period of time  during which regularly scheduled payments of principal and interest will  be due on the loan.</p><p class="depth0">2. Payment deferral options--general. The creditor must describe the  options that the consumer has under the loan agreement to defer payment  on the loan. When there is no deferment option provided for the loan,  the creditor must disclose that fact. Payment deferral options required  to be disclosed include options for immediate deferral of payments, such  as when the student is currently enrolled at a covered educational  institution. The description may include of the length of the maximum  initial in-school deferment period, the types of payments that may be  deferred, and a description of any payments that are required during the  deferment period. The creditor may, but need not, disclose any  conditions applicable to the deferment option, such as that deferment is  permitted only while the student is continuously enrolled in school. If  payment deferral is not an option while the student is enrolled in  school, the creditor may disclose that the consumer must begin repayment  upon disbursement of the loan and that the consumer may not defer  repayment while enrolled in school. If the creditor offers payment  deferral options that may apply during the repayment period, such as an  option to defer payments if the student returns to school to pursue an  additional degree, the creditor must include a statement referring the  consumer to the contract document or promissory note for more  information.</p><p class="depth0">3. Payment deferral options--in school deferment. For each payment  deferral option applicable while the student is enrolled at a covered  educational institution the creditor must disclose whether interest will  accrue while the student is enrolled at a covered educational  institution and, if interest does accrue, whether payment of interest  may be deferred and added to the principal balance.</p><p class="depth0">4. Combination with cost estimate disclosure. The disclosures of the  loan term under Sec. 1026.47(a)(3)(i) and of the payment deferral  options applicable while the student is enrolled at a covered  educational institution under Sec. Sec. 1026.47(a)(3)(ii) and (iii) may  be combined with the disclosure of cost estimates required in Sec.  1026.47(a)(4). For example, the creditor may describe each payment  deferral option in the same chart or table that provides the cost  estimates for each payment deferral option. See appendix H-21.</p><p class="depth0">5. Bankruptcy limitations. The creditor may comply with Sec.  1026.47(a)(3)(iv) by disclosing the following statement: ``If you file  for bankruptcy you may still be required to pay back this loan.''</p><p class="depth0">47(a)(4) Cost Estimates</p><p class="depth0">1. Total cost of the loan. For purposes of Sec. 1026.47(a)(4), the  creditor must calculate the example of the total cost of the loan in  accordance with the rules in Sec. 1026.18(h) for calculating the loan's  total of payments.</p><p class="depth0">2. Basis for estimates. i. The creditor must calculate the total  cost estimate by determining all finance charges that would be  applicable to loans with the highest rate of interest required to be  disclosed under Sec. 1026.47(a)(1)(i). For example, if a creditor  charges a range of origination fees from 0% to 3%, but the 3%  origination fee would apply to loans with the highest initial rate, the  lender must assume the 3% origination fee is charged. The creditor must  base the total cost estimate on a total loan amount that includes all  prepaid finance charges and results in a $10,000 amount financed. For  example, if the prepaid finance charges are $600, the creditor must base  the estimate on a $10,600 total loan amount and an amount financed of  $10,000. The example must reflect an amount provided of $10,000. If the  creditor only offers a particular private education loan for less than  $10,000, the creditor may assume a loan amount that results in a $5,000  amount financed for that loan.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If a prepaid finance charge is determined as a percentage of the  amount financed, for purposes of the example, the creditor should assume  that the fee is determined as a percentage of the total loan amount,  even if this is not the creditor's   usual practice. For example, suppose the consumer requires a  disbursement of $10,000 and the creditor charges a 3% origination fee.  In order to calculate the total cost example, the creditor must  determine the loan amount that will result in a $10,000 amount financed  after the 3% fee is assessed. In this example, the resulting loan amount  would be $10,309.28. Assessing the 3% origination fee on the loan amount  of $10,309.28 results in an origination fee of $309.28, which is  withheld from the loan funds disbursed to the consumer. The principal  loan amount of $10,309.28 minus the prepaid finance charge of $309.28  results in an amount financed of $10,000.</p><p class="depth0">3. Calculated for each option to defer interest payments. The  example must include an estimate of the total cost of the loan for each  in-school deferral option disclosed in Sec. 1026.47(a)(3)(iii). For  example, if the creditor provides the consumer with the option to begin  making principal and interest payments immediately, to defer principal  payments but begin making interest-only payments immediately, or to  defer all principal and interest payments while in school, the creditor  is required to disclose three estimates of the total cost of the loan,  one for each deferral option. If the creditor adds accrued interest to  the loan balance (i.e., interest is capitalized), the estimate of the  total loan cost should be based on the capitalization method that the  creditor actually uses for the loan. For instance, for each deferred  payment option where the creditor would capitalize interest on a  quarterly basis, the total loan cost must be calculated assuming  interest capitalizes on a quarterly basis.</p><p class="depth0">4. Deferment period assumptions. Creditors may use either of the  following two methods for estimating the duration of in-school deferment  periods:</p><p class="depth0">i. For loan programs intended for educational expenses of  undergraduate students, the creditor may assume that the consumer defers  payments for a four-year matriculation period, plus the loan's maximum  applicable grace period, if any. For all other loans, the creditor may  assume that the consumer defers for a two-year matriculation period,  plus the maximum applicable grace period, if any, or the maximum time  the consumer may defer payments under the loan program, whichever is  shorter.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Alternatively, if the creditor knows that the student will be  enrolled in a program with a standard duration, the creditor may assume  that the consumer defers payments for the full duration of the program  (plus any grace period). For example, if a creditor makes loans intended  for students enrolled in a four-year medical school degree program, the  creditor may assume that the consumer defers payments for four years  plus the loan's maximum applicable grace period, if any. However, the  creditor may not modify the disclosure to correspond to a particular  student's situation. For example, even if the creditor knows that a  student will be a second-year medical school student, the creditor must  assume a four-year deferral period.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 47(a)(6)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Terms of Federal student loans. The creditor must disclose the  interest rates available under each program under title IV of the Higher  Education Act of 1965 and whether the rates are fixed or variable, as  prescribed in the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1077a). Where  the fixed interest rate for a loan varies by statute depending on the  date of disbursement or receipt of application, the creditor must  disclose only the interest rate as of the time the disclosure is  provided.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 47(a)(6)(iii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Web site address. The creditor must include with this disclosure  an appropriate U.S. Department of Education Web site address such as  ``federalstudentaid.ed.gov.''</p><p class="depth0">47(b) Approval Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">47(b)(1) Interest Rate</p><p class="depth0">1. Variable rate disclosures. The interest rate is considered  variable if the terms of the legal obligation allow the creditor to  increase the interest rate originally disclosed to the consumer. The  provisions do not apply to increases resulting from delinquency  (including late payment), default, assumption, or acceleration. In  addition to disclosing the information required under Sec. Sec.  1026.47(b)(ii) and (iii), the creditor must disclose the information  required under Sec. Sec. 1026.18(f)(1)(i) and (iii)--the circumstances  under which the rate may increase and the effect of an increase,  respectively. The creditor is required to disclose the maximum monthly  payment based on the maximum possible rate in Sec. 1026.47(b)(3)(viii),  and the creditor need not disclose a separate example of the payment  terms that would result from an increase under Sec. 1026.18(f)(1)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">2. Limitations on rate adjustments. The creditor must disclose how  often the rate may change and any limit on the amount that the rate may  increase at any one time. The creditor must also disclose any maximum  rate over the life of the transaction. If the legal obligation between  the parties does provide a maximum rate, the creditor must disclose any  legal limits in the nature of usury or rate ceilings under state or  Federal statutes or regulations. However, if the applicable maximum rate  is in the form of a legal limit, such as a state's usury cap (rather  than a maximum rate specified in the legal obligation between the  parties), the creditor must   disclose that the maximum rate is determined by applicable law.  Compliance with Sec. 1026.18(f)(1)(ii) (requiring disclosure of any  limitations on the increase of the interest rate) does not necessarily  constitute compliance with this section. Specifically, this section  requires that if there are no limitations on interest rate increases,  the creditor must disclose that fact. By contrast, comment 18(f)(1)(ii)- 1 states that if there are no limitations the creditor need not disclose  that fact. In addition, under this section, limitations on rate  increases include, rather than exclude, legal limits in the nature of  usury or rate ceilings under state or Federal statutes or regulations.</p><p class="depth0">3. Rates applicable to the loan. For a variable-rate loan, the  disclosure of the interest rate must reflect the index and margin that  will be used to make interest rate adjustments for the loan. The  creditor may provide a description of the index and margin or range of  margins used to make interest rate adjustments, including a reference to  a source, such as a newspaper, where the consumer may look up the index.</p><p class="depth0">47(b)(2) Fees and Default or Late Payment Costs</p><p class="depth0">1. Fees and default or late payment costs. Creditors may follow the  commentary for Sec. 1026.47(a)(2) in complying with Sec.  1026.47(b)(2). Creditors must disclose the late payment fees required to  be disclosed under Sec. 1026.18(l) as part of the disclosure required  under Sec. 1026.47(b)(2)(ii). If the creditor includes the itemization  of the amount financed under Sec. 1026.18(c)(1), any fees disclosed as  part of the itemization need not be separately disclosed elsewhere.</p><p class="depth0">47(b)(3) Repayment Terms</p><p class="depth0">1. Principal amount. The principal amount must equal what the face  amount of the note would be as of the time of approval, and it must be  labeled ``Total Loan Amount.'' See appendix H-18. This amount may be  different from the ``principal loan amount'' used to calculate the  amount financed under comment 18(b)(3)-1, because the creditor has the  option under that comment of using a ``principal loan amount'' that is  different from the face amount of the note. If the creditor elects to  provide an itemization of the amount financed under Sec. 1026.18(c)(1)  the creditor need not disclose the amount financed elsewhere.</p><p class="depth0">2. Loan term. The term of the loan is the maximum period of time  during which regularly scheduled payments of principal and interest are  due on the loan.</p><p class="depth0">3. Payment deferral options applicable to the consumer. Creditors  may follow the commentary for Sec. 1026.47(a)(3)(ii) in complying with  Sec. 1026.47(b)(3)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">4. Payments required during enrollment. Required payments that must  be disclosed include payments of interest and principal, interest only,  or other payments that the consumer must make during the time that the  student is enrolled. Compliance with Sec. 1026.18(g) constitutes  compliance with Sec. 1026.47(b)(3)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">5. Bankruptcy limitations. The creditor may comply with Sec.  1026.47(b)(3)(vi) by disclosing the following statement: ``If you file  for bankruptcy you may still be required to pay back this loan.''</p><p class="depth0">6. An estimate of the total amount for repayment. The creditor must  disclose an estimate of the total amount for repayment at two interest  rates:</p><p class="depth0">i. The interest rate in effect on the date of approval. Compliance  with the total of payments disclosure requirement of Sec. 1026.18(h)  constitutes compliance with this requirement.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The maximum possible rate of interest applicable to the loan or,  if the maximum rate cannot be determined, a rate of 25%. If the legal  obligation between the parties specifies a maximum rate of interest, the  creditor must calculate the total amount for repayment based on that  rate. If the legal obligation does not specify a maximum rate but a  usury or rate ceiling under state or Federal statutes or regulations  applies, the creditor must use that rate. If a there is no maximum rate  in the legal obligation or under a usury or rate ceiling, the creditor  must base the disclosure on a rate of 25% and must disclose that there  is no maximum rate and that the total amount for repayment disclosed  under Sec. 1026.47(b)(3)(vii)(B) is an estimate and will be higher if  the applicable interest rate increases.</p><p class="depth0">iii. If terms of the legal obligation provide a limitation on the  amount that the interest rate may increase at any one time, the creditor  may reflect the effect of the interest rate limitation in calculating  the total cost example. For example, if the legal obligation provides  that the interest rate may not increase by more than three percentage  points each year, the creditor may assume that the rate increases by  three percentage points each year until it reaches that maximum possible  rate, or if a maximum rate cannot be determined, an interest rate of  25%.</p><p class="depth0">7. The maximum monthly payment. The creditor must disclose the  maximum payment that the consumer could be required to make under the  loan agreement, calculated using the maximum rate of interest applicable  to the loan, or if the maximum rate cannot be determined, a rate of 25%.  The creditor must determine and disclose the maximum rate of interest in  accordance with comments 47(b)(3)-6.ii and 47(b)(3)-6.iii. In addition,  if a maximum rate cannot be determined, the creditor must state that  there is no maximum rate and that the monthly payment   amounts disclosed under Sec. 1026.47(b)(3)(viii) are estimates and will  be higher if the applicable interest rate increases.</p><p class="depth0">47(b)(4) Alternatives to Private Education Loans</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Creditors may use the guidance provided in the  commentary for Sec. 1026.47(a)(6) in complying with Sec.  1026.47(b)(4).</p><p class="depth0">47(b)(5) Rights of the Consumer</p><p class="depth0">1. Notice of acceptance period. The disclosure that the consumer may  accept the terms of the loan until the acceptance period under Sec.  1026.48(c)(1) has expired must include the specific date on which the  acceptance period expires and state that the consumer may accept the  terms of the loan until that date. Under Sec. 1026.48(c)(1), the date  on which the acceptance period expires is based on when the consumer  receives the disclosures. If the creditor mails the disclosures, the  consumer is considered to have received them three business days after  the creditor places the disclosures in the mail See Sec. 1026.46(d)(4).  If the creditor provides an acceptance period longer than the minimum 30  calendar days, the disclosure must reflect the later date. The  disclosure must also specify the method or methods by which the consumer  may communicate acceptance.</p><p class="depth0">47(c) Final Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Notice of right to cancel. The disclosure of the right to cancel  must include the specific date on which the three-day cancellation  period expires and state that the consumer has a right to cancel by that  date. See comments 48(d)-1 and -2. For example, if the disclosures were  mailed to the consumer on Friday, June 1, and the consumer is deemed to  receive them on Tuesday, June 5, the creditor could state: ``You have a  right to cancel this transaction, without penalty, by midnight on June  8, 2009. No funds will be disbursed to you or to your school until after  this time. You may cancel by calling us at 800-XXX-XXXX.'' If the  creditor permits cancellation by mail, the statement must specify that  the consumer's mailed request will be deemed timely if placed in the  mail not later than the cancellation date specified on the disclosure.  The disclosure must also specify the method or methods by which the  consumer may cancel.</p><p class="depth0">2. More conspicuous. The statement of the right to cancel must be  more conspicuous than any other disclosure required under this section  except for the finance charge, the interest rate, and the creditor's  identity. See Sec. 1026.46(c)(2)(iii). The statement will be deemed to  be made more conspicuous if it is segregated from other disclosures,  placed near or at the top of the disclosure document, and highlighted in  relation to other required disclosures. For example, the statement may  be outlined with a prominent, noticeable box; printed in contrasting  color; printed in larger type, bold print, or different type face;  underlined; or set off with asterisks.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.48--Limitations on Private Education Loans</p><p class="depth0">1. Co-branding--definition of marketing. The prohibition on co- branding in Sec. Sec. 1026.48(a) and (b) applies to the marketing of  private education loans. The term marketing includes any advertisement  under Sec. 1026.2(a)(2). In addition, the term marketing includes any  document provided by the creditor to the consumer related to a specific  transaction, such as an application or solicitation, a promissory note  or a contract provided to the consumer. For example, prominently  displaying the name of the educational institution at the top of the  application form or promissory note without mentioning the name of the  creditor, such as by naming the loan product the ``University of ABC  Loan,'' would be prohibited.2. Implied endorsement. A suggestion that a  private education loan is offered or made by the covered educational  institution instead of by the creditor is included in the prohibition on  implying that the covered educational institution endorses the private  education loan under Sec. 1026.48(a)(1). For example, naming the loan  the ``University of ABC Loan,'' suggests that the loan is offered by the  educational institution. However, the use of a creditor's full name,  even if that name includes the name of a covered educational  institution, does not imply endorsement. For example, a credit union  whose name includes the name of a covered educational institution is not  prohibited from using its own name. In addition, the authorized use of a  state seal by a state or an institution of higher education in the  marketing of state education loan products does not imply endorsement.</p><p class="depth0">3. Disclosure. i. A creditor is considered to have complied with  Sec. 1026.48(a)(2) if the creditor's marketing contains a clear and  conspicuous statement, equally prominent and closely proximate to the  reference to the covered educational institution, using the name of the  creditor and the name of the covered educational institution that the  covered educational institution does not endorse the creditor's loans  and that the creditor is not affiliated with the covered educational  institution. For example, ``[Name of creditor]'s loans are not endorsed  by [name of school] and [name of creditor] is not affiliated with [name  of school].'' The statement is considered to be equally prominent and  closely proximate if it is the same type size and is located immediately  next to or directly above or below the reference to the educational  institution, without any intervening text or graphical displays.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A creditor is considered to have complied with Sec. 1026.48(b)  if the creditor's marketing contains a clear and conspicuous statement,  equally prominent and closely proximate to the reference to the covered  educational institution, using the name of the creditor's loan or loan  program, the name of the covered educational institution, and the name  of the creditor, that the creditor's loans are not offered or made by  the covered educational institution, but are made by the creditor. For  example, ``[Name of loan or loan program] is not being offered or made  by [name of school], but by [name of creditor].'' The statement is  considered to be equally prominent and closely proximate if it is the  same type size and is located immediately next to or directly above or  below the reference to the educational institution, without any  intervening text or graphical displays.</p><p class="depth0">48(c) Consumer's Right to Accept</p><p class="depth0">1. 30 day acceptance period. The creditor must provide the consumer  with at least 30 calendar days from the date the consumer receives the  disclosures required under Sec. 1026.47(b) to accept the terms of the  loan. The creditor may provide the consumer with a longer period of  time. If the creditor places the disclosures in the mail, the consumer  is considered to have received them three business days after they are  mailed under Sec. 1026.46(d)(4). For purposes of determining when a  consumer receives mailed disclosures, ``business day'' means all  calendar days except Sundays and the legal public holidays referred to  in Sec. 1026.2(a)(6). See comment 46(d)-1. The consumer may accept the  loan at any time before the end of the 30-day period.</p><p class="depth0">2. Method of acceptance. The creditor must specify a method or  methods by which the consumer can accept the loan at any time within the  30-day acceptance period. The creditor may require the consumer to  communicate acceptance orally or in writing. Acceptance may also be  communicated electronically, but electronic communication must not be  the only means provided for the consumer to communicate acceptance  unless the creditor has provided the approval disclosure electronically  in compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions  of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign  Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq.). If acceptance by mail is allowed, the  consumer's communication of acceptance is considered timely if placed in  the mail within the 30-day period.</p><p class="depth0">3. Prohibition on changes to rates and terms. The prohibition on  changes to the rates and terms of the loan applies to changes that  affect those terms that are required to be disclosed under Sec. Sec.  1026.47(b) and (c). The creditor is permitted to make changes that do  not affect any of the terms disclosed to the consumer under those  sections.</p><p class="depth0">4. Permissible changes to rates and terms--re-disclosure not  required. Creditors are not required to consummate a loan where the  extension of credit would be prohibited by law or where the creditor has  reason to believe that the consumer has committed fraud. A creditor may  make changes to the rate based on adjustments to the index used for the  loan and changes that will unequivocally benefit the consumer. For  example, a creditor is permitted to reduce the interest rate or lower  the amount of a fee. A creditor may also reduce the loan amount based on  a certification or other information received from a covered educational  institution or from the consumer indicating that the student's cost of  attendance has decreased or the amount of other financial aid has  increased. A creditor may also withdraw the loan approval based on a  certification or other information received from a covered educational  institution or from the consumer indicating that the student is not  enrolled in the institution. For these changes permitted by Sec.  1026.48(c)(3), the creditor is not required to provide a new set of  approval disclosures required under Sec. 1026.47(b) or provide the  consumer with a new 30-day acceptance period under Sec. 1026.48(c)(1).  The creditor must provide the final disclosures under Sec. 1026.47(c).</p><p class="depth0">5. Permissible changes to rates and terms--school certification. If  the creditor reduces the loan amount based on information that the  student's cost of attendance has decreased or the amount of other  financial aid has increased, the creditor may make certain corresponding  changes to the rate and terms. The creditor may change the rate or terms  to those that the consumer would have received if the consumer had  applied for the reduced loan amount. For example, assume a consumer  applies for, and is approved for, a $10,000 loan at a 7% interest rate.  However, after the consumer receives the approval disclosures, the  consumer's school certifies that the consumer's financial need is only  $8,000. The creditor may reduce the loan amount for which the consumer  is approved to $8,000. The creditor may also, for example, increase the  interest rate on the loan to 7.125%, but only if the consumer would have  received a rate of 7.125% if the consumer had originally applied for an  $8,000 loan.</p><p class="depth0">6. Permissible changes to rates and terms--re-disclosure required. A  creditor may make changes to the interest rate or terms to accommodate a  request from a consumer. For example, assume a consumer applies for a  $10,000 loan and is approved for the $10,000 amount at an interest rate  of 6%. After the creditor has provided the approval disclosures, the  consumer's financial need increases, and the consumer requests to a loan  amount of $15,000. In this situation, the creditor is permitted to offer  a $15,000 loan, and   to make any other changes such as raising the interest rate to 7%, in  response to the consumer's request. The creditor must provide a new set  of disclosures under Sec. 1026.47(b) and provide the consumer with 30  days to accept the offer under Sec. 1026.48(c) for the $15,000 loan  offered in response to the consumer's request. However, because the  consumer may choose not to accept the offer for the $15,000 loan at the  higher interest rate, the creditor may not withdraw or change the rate  or terms of the offer for the $10,000 loan, except as permitted under  Sec. 1026.48(c)(3), unless the consumer accepts the $15,000 loan.</p><p class="depth0">48(d) Consumer's Right to Cancel</p><p class="depth0">1. Right to cancel. If the creditor mails the disclosures, the  disclosures are considered received by the consumer three business days  after the disclosures were mailed. For purposes of determining when the  consumer receives the disclosures, the term ``business day'' is defined  as all calendar days except Sunday and the legal public holidays  referred to in Sec. 1026.2(a)(6). See Sec. 1026.46(d)(4). The consumer  has three business days from the date on which the disclosures are  deemed received to cancel the loan. For example, if the creditor places  the disclosures in the mail on Thursday, June 4, the disclosures are  considered received on Monday, June 8. The consumer may cancel any time  before midnight Thursday, June 11. The creditor may provide the consumer  with more time to cancel the loan than the minimum three business days  required under this section. If the creditor provides the consumer with  a longer period of time in which to cancel the loan, the creditor may  disburse the funds three business days after the consumer has received  the disclosures required under this section, but the creditor must honor  the consumer's later timely cancellation request.</p><p class="depth0">2. Method of cancellation. The creditor must specify a method or  methods by which the consumer may cancel. For example, the creditor may  require the consumer to communicate cancellation orally or in writing.  Cancellation may also be communicated electronically, but electronic  communication must not be the only means by which the consumer may  cancel unless the creditor provided the final disclosure electronically  in compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions  of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign  Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq.). If the creditor allows cancellation by  mail, the creditor must specify an address or the name and address of an  agent of the creditor to receive notice of cancellation. The creditor  must wait to disburse funds until it is reasonably satisfied that the  consumer has not canceled. For example, the creditor may satisfy itself  by waiting a reasonable time after expiration of the cancellation period  to allow for delivery of a mailed notice. The creditor may also satisfy  itself by obtaining a written statement from the consumer, which must be  provided to and signed by the consumer only at the end of the three-day  period, that the right has not been exercised.</p><p class="depth0">3. Cancellation without penalty. The creditor may not charge the  consumer a fee for exercising the right to cancel under Sec.  1026.48(d). The prohibition extends only to fees charged specifically  for canceling the loan. The creditor is not required to refund fees,  such as an application fee, that are charged to all consumers whether or  not the consumer cancels the loan.</p><p class="depth0">48(e) Self-Certification Form</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Section 1026.48(e) requires that the creditor obtain the  self-certification form, signed by the consumer, before consummating the  private education loan. The rule applies only to private education loans  that will be used for the postsecondary educational expenses of a  student while that student is attending an institution of higher  education as defined in Sec. 1026.46(b)(2). It does not apply to all  covered educational institutions. The requirement applies even if the  student is not currently attending an institution of higher education,  but will use the loan proceeds for postsecondary educational expenses  while attending such institution. For example, a creditor is required to  obtain the form before consummating a private education loan provided to  a high school senior for expenses to be incurred during the consumer's  first year of college. This provision does not require that the creditor  obtain the self-certification form in instances where the loan is not  intended for a student attending an institution of higher education,  such as when the consumer is consolidating loans after graduation.  Section 155(a)(2) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 provides that the  form shall be made available to the consumer by the relevant institution  of higher education. However, Sec. 1026.48(e) provides flexibility to  institutions of higher education and creditors as to how the completed  self-certification form is provided to the lender. The creditor may  receive the form directly from the consumer, or the creditor may receive  the form from the consumer through the institution of higher education.  In addition, the creditor may provide the form, and the information the  consumer will require to complete the form, directly to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">2. Electronic signature. Under section 155(a)(2) of the Higher  Education Act of 1965, the institution of higher education may provide  the self-certification form to the consumer in written or electronic  form. Under section 155(a)(5) of the Higher Education Act   of 1965, the form may be signed electronically by the consumer. A  creditor may accept the self-certification form from the consumer in  electronic form. A consumer's electronic signature is considered valid  if it meets the requirements issued by the Department of Education under  section 155(a)(5) of the Higher Education Act of 1965.</p><p class="depth0">48(f) Provision of Information by Preferred Lenders</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Section 1026.48(f) does not specify the format in which  creditors must provide the required information to the covered  educational institution. Creditors may choose to provide only the  required information or may provide copies of the form or forms the  lender uses to comply with Sec. 1026.47(a). A creditor is only required  to provide the required information if the creditor is aware that it is  a party to a preferred lender arrangement. For example, if a creditor is  placed on a covered educational institution's preferred lender list  without the creditor's knowledge, the creditor is not required to comply  with Sec. 1026.48(f).

Consideration of additional factors. Section 1026.51(a) requires  a card issuer to consider a consumer's ability to make the required  minimum periodic payments under the terms of an account based on the  consumer's income or assets and current obligations. The card issuer may  also consider consumer reports, credit scores, and other factors,  consistent with Regulation B (12 CFR part 1002).</p><p class="depth0">2. Ability to pay as of application or consideration of increase. A  card issuer complies with Sec. 1026.51(a) if it bases its consideration  of a consumer's ability to make the required minimum periodic payments  on the facts and circumstances known to the card issuer at the time the  consumer applies to open the credit card account or when the card issuer  considers increasing the credit line on an existing account.</p><p class="depth0">3. Credit line increase. When a card issuer considers increasing the  credit line on an existing account, Sec. 1026.51(a) applies whether the  consideration is based upon a request of the consumer or is initiated by  the card issuer.</p><p class="depth0">4. Consideration of income and assets. For purposes of Sec.  1026.51(a):</p><p class="depth0">i. A card issuer may consider any current or reasonably expected  income or assets of the consumer or consumers who are applying for a new  account or will be liable for debts incurred on that account, including  a cosigner or guarantor. Similarly, when a card issuer is considering  whether to increase the credit limit on an existing account, the card  issuer may consider any current or reasonably expected income or assets  of the consumer or consumers who are accountholders, cosigners, or  guarantors, and are liable for debts incurred on that account. In both  of these circumstances, a card issuer may treat any income and assets to  which an applicant, accountholder, joint applicant, cosigner, or  guarantor who is or will be liable for debts incurred on the account has  a reasonable expectation of access as the applicant's current or  reasonably expected income--but is not required to do so. A card issuer  may instead limit its consideration of a consumer's current or  reasonably expected income or assets to the consumer's independent  income or assets as discussed in comments 51(b)(1)(i)-1 and 51(b)(2)-2.  Although these comments clarify the independent ability-to-pay  requirement that governs applications from consumers under 21, they  provide guidance regarding the use of ``independent income and assets''  as an underwriting criterion under Sec. 1026.51(a). For example,  comment 51(b)(1)(i)-1 explains that card issuers may not consider income  or assets to which applicants under 21 have only a reasonable  expectation of access. An issuer who chooses to comply with Sec.  1026.51(a) by limiting its consideration to applicants' independent  income and assets likewise would not consider income or assets to which  applicants 21 or older have only a reasonable expectation of access.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Current or reasonably expected income includes, for example,  current or expected salary, wages, bonus pay, tips, and commissions.  Employment may be full-time, part-time, seasonal, irregular, military,  or self-employment. Other sources of income include interest or  dividends, retirement benefits, public assistance, alimony, child  support, and separate maintenance payments. Proceeds from student loans  may be considered as current or reasonably expected income only to the  extent that those proceeds exceed the amount disbursed or owed to an  educational institution for tuition and other expenses. Current or  reasonably expected income also includes income that is being deposited  regularly into an account on which the consumer is an accountholder  (e.g., an individual deposit account or joint account). Assets include,  for example, savings accounts and investments.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Consideration of the income or assets of authorized users,  household members, or other persons who are not liable for debts  incurred on the account does not satisfy the requirement to consider the  consumer's current or reasonably expected income or assets, unless a  Federal or State statute or   regulation grants a consumer who is liable for debts incurred on the  account an ownership interest in such income and assets (e.g., joint  ownership granted under State community property laws), such income is  being deposited regularly into an account on which the consumer is an  accountholder (e.g., an individual deposit account or a joint account),  or the consumer has a reasonable expectation of access to such income or  assets even though the consumer does not have a current or expected  ownership interest in the income or assets. See comment 51(a)(1)-6 for  examples of non-applicant income to which a consumer has a reasonable  expectation of access.</p><p class="depth0">5. Information regarding income and assets. For purposes of Sec.  1026.51(a), a card issuer may consider the consumer's current or  reasonably expected income and assets based on the following  information:</p><p class="depth0">i. Information provided by the consumer in connection with the  account, including information provided by the consumer through the  application process. For example, card issuers may rely without further  inquiry on information provided by applicants in response to a request  for ``salary,'' ``income,'' ``assets,'' ``available income,''  ``accessible income,'' or other language requesting that the applicant  provide information regarding current or reasonably expected income or  assets or any income or assets to which the applicant has a reasonable  expectation of access. However, card issuers may not rely solely on  information provided in response to a request for ``household income.''  In that case, the card issuer would need to obtain additional  information about an applicant's current or reasonably expected income,  including income and assets to which the applicant has a reasonable  expectation of access (such as by contacting the applicant). See  comments 51(a)(1)-4, -5, and -6 for additional guidance on determining  the consumer's current or reasonably expected income under Sec.  1026.51(a)(1). See comment 51(a)(1)-9 for guidance regarding the use of  a single, common application form or process for all credit card  applicants, regardless of age.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Information provided by the consumer in connection with any  other financial relationship the card issuer or its affiliates have with  the consumer (subject to any applicable information-sharing rules).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Information obtained through third parties (subject to any  applicable information-sharing rules).</p><p class="depth0">iv. Information obtained through any empirically derived,  demonstrably and statistically sound model that reasonably estimates a  consumer's income or assets, including any income or assets to which the  consumer has a reasonable expectation of access.</p><p class="depth0">6. Examples of considering income. Assume that an applicant is not  employed and that the applicant is age 21 or older so Sec. 1026.51(b)  does not apply.</p><p class="depth0">i. If a non-applicant's salary or other income is deposited  regularly into a joint account shared with the applicant, a card issuer  is permitted to consider the amount of the non-applicant's income that  is being deposited regularly into the account to be the applicant's  current or reasonably expected income for purposes of Sec. 1026.51(a).</p><p class="depth0">ii. The non-applicant's salary or other income is deposited into an  account to which the applicant does not have access. However, the non- applicant regularly transfers a portion of that income into the  applicant's individual deposit account. A card issuer is permitted to  consider the amount of the non-applicant's income that is being  transferred regularly into the applicant's account to be the applicant's  current or reasonably expected income for purposes of Sec. 1026.51(a).</p><p class="depth0">iii. The non-applicant's salary or other income is deposited into an  account to which the applicant does not have access. However, the non- applicant regularly uses a portion of that income to pay for the  applicant's expenses. A card issuer is permitted to consider the amount  of the non-applicant's income that is used regularly to pay for the  applicant's expenses to be the applicant's current or reasonably  expected income for purposes of Sec. 1026.51(a) because the applicant  has a reasonable expectation of access to that income.</p><p class="depth0">iv. The non-applicant's salary or other income is deposited into an  account to which the applicant does not have access, the non-applicant  does not regularly use that income to pay for the applicant's expenses,  and no Federal or State statute or regulation grants the applicant an  ownership interest in that income. A card issuer is not permitted to  consider the non-applicant's income as the applicant's current or  reasonably expected income for purposes of Sec. 1026.51(a) because the  applicant does not have a reasonable expectation of access to the non- applicant's income.</p><p class="depth0">7. Current obligations. A card issuer may consider the consumer's  current obligations based on information provided by the consumer or in  a consumer report. In evaluating a consumer's current obligations, a  card issuer need not assume that credit lines for other obligations are  fully utilized.</p><p class="depth0">8. Joint applicants and joint accountholders. With respect to the  opening of a joint account for two or more consumers or a credit line  increase on such an account, the card issuer may consider the collective  ability of all persons who are or will be liable for debts incurred on  the account to make the required payments.</p><p class="depth0">9. Single application. A card issuer may use a single, common  application form or process for all credit card applicants, regardless  of age. A card issuer may rely without further verification on income  and asset information provided by applicants through such an  application, so long as the application questions gather sufficient  information to allow the card issuer to satisfy the requirements of both  Sec. 1026.51(a) and (b), depending on whether a particular applicant  has reached the age of 21. For example, a card issuer might provide two  separate line items on its application form, one prompting applicants to  provide their ``personal income,'' and the other prompting applicants  for ``available income.'' A card issuer might also prompt applicants,  regardless of age, using only the term ``income'' and satisfy the  requirements of both Sec. 1026.51(a) and (b).</p><p class="depth0">51(a)(2) Minimum Periodic Payments</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicable minimum payment formula. For purposes of estimating  required minimum periodic payments under the safe harbor set forth in  Sec. 1026.51(a)(2)(ii), if the account has or may have a promotional  program, such as a deferred payment or similar program, where there is  no applicable minimum payment formula during the promotional period, the  issuer must estimate the required minimum periodic payment based on the  minimum payment formula that will apply when the promotion ends.</p><p class="depth0">2. Interest rate for purchases. For purposes of estimating required  minimum periodic payments under the safe harbor set forth in Sec.  1026.51(a)(2)(ii), if the interest rate for purchases is or may be a  promotional rate, the issuer must use the post-promotional rate to  estimate interest charges.</p><p class="depth0">3. Mandatory fees. For purposes of estimating required minimum  periodic payments under the safe harbor set forth in Sec.  1026.51(a)(2)(ii), mandatory fees that must be assumed to be charged  include those fees the card issuer knows the consumer will be required  to pay under the terms of the account if the account is opened, such as  an annual fee. If a mandatory fee is a promotional fee (as defined in  Sec. 1026.16(g)), the issuer must use the post-promotional fee amount  for purposes of Sec. 1026.51(a)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">51(b) Rules Affecting Young Consumers</p><p class="depth0">1. Age as of date of application or consideration of credit line  increase. Sections 1026.51(b)(1) and (b)(2) apply only to a consumer who  has not attained the age of 21 as of the date of submission of the  application under Sec. 1026.51(b)(1) or the date the credit line  increase is requested by the consumer (or if no request has been made,  the date the credit line increase is considered by the card issuer)  under Sec. 1026.51(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">2. Liability of cosigner, guarantor, or joint accountholder.  Sections 1026.51(b)(1)(ii) and (b)(2) require the signature or written  consent of a cosigner, guarantor, or joint accountholder agreeing either  to be secondarily liable for any debt on the account incurred by the  consumer before the consumer has attained the age of 21 or to be jointly  liable with the consumer for any debt on the account. Sections  1026.51(b)(1)(ii) and (b)(2) do not prohibit a card issuer from also  requiring the cosigner, guarantor, or joint accountholder to assume  liability for debts incurred after the consumer has attained the age of  21, consistent with any agreement made between the parties.</p><p class="depth0">3. Authorized users exempt. If a consumer who has not attained the  age of 21 is being added to another person's account as an authorized  user and has no liability for debts incurred on the account, Sec.  1026.51(b)(1) and (b)(2) do not apply.</p><p class="depth0">4. Electronic application. Consistent with Sec. 1026.5(a)(1)(iii),  an application may be provided to the consumer in electronic form  without regard to the consumer consent or other provisions of the  Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act)  (15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq.) in the circumstances set forth in Sec.  1026.60. The electronic submission of an application from a consumer or  a consent to a credit line increase from a cosigner, guarantor, or joint  accountholder to a card issuer would constitute a written application or  consent for purposes of Sec. 1026.51(b) and would not be considered a  consumer disclosure for purposes of the E-Sign Act.</p><p class="depth0">5. Current obligations. A card issuer may consider the consumer's  current obligations under Sec. 1026.51(b)(1) and (b)(2)(i) based on  information provided by the consumer or in a consumer report. In  evaluating a consumer's current obligations, a card issuer need not  assume that credit lines for other obligations are fully utilized.</p><p class="depth0">6. Joint applicants or joint accountholders. With respect to the  opening of a joint account for two or more consumers under Sec.  1026.51(b)(1) or a credit line increase on such an account under Sec.  1026.51(b)(2)(i), the card issuer may consider the collective ability of  all persons who are or will be liable for debts incurred on the account  to make the required payments. See commentary to Sec. 1026.51(b)(1)(i)  and (b)(2) for information on income and assets that may be considered  for joint applicants, joint accountholders, cosigners, or guarantors who  are under the age of 21, and commentary to Sec. 1026.51(b)(1)(ii) for  information on income and assets that may be considered for joint  applicants, joint accountholders, cosigners, or guarantors who are at  least 21 years old.</p><p class="depth0">7. Relation to Regulation B. In considering an application or credit  line increase on the credit card account of a consumer who is less   than 21 years old, card issuers must comply with the applicable rules in  Regulation B (12 CFR part 1026). A card issuer does not violate  Regulation B by complying with the requirements in Sec. 1026.51(b).</p><p class="depth0">51(b)(1) Applications from young consumers</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 51(b)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1.

A card issuer may consider any current or reasonably expected  income or assets of the consumer or consumers who are applying for a new  account or will be liable for debts incurred on that account, including  a cosigner or guarantor. However, because Sec. 1026.51(b)(1)(i)  requires that the consumer who has not attained the age of 21 have an  independent ability to make the required minimum periodic payments, the  card issuer may only consider the applicant's current or reasonably  expected income or assets under Sec. 1026.51(b)(1)(i). The card issuer  may not consider income or assets to which an applicant, joint  applicant, cosigner, or guarantor, in each case who is under the age of  21 and is or will be liable for debts incurred on the account, has only  a reasonable expectation of access.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Current or reasonably expected income includes, for example,  current or expected salary, wages, bonus pay, tips, and commissions.  Employment may be full-time, part-time, seasonal, irregular, military,  or self-employment. Other sources of income include interest or  dividends, retirement benefits, public assistance, alimony, child  support, and separate maintenance payments. Proceeds from student loans  may be considered as current or reasonably expected income only to the  extent that those proceeds exceed the amount disbursed or owed to an  educational institution for tuition and other expenses. Current or  reasonably expected income includes income that is being deposited  regularly into an account on which the consumer is an accountholder  (e.g., an individual deposit account or a joint account).

Independent ability-to-pay standard. Under Sec. 1026.51(b)(2),  if a credit card account has been opened pursuant to Sec.  1026.51(b)(1)(i), no increase in the credit limit may be made on such  account before the consumer attains the age of 21 unless, at the time of  the contemplated increase, the consumer has an independent ability to  make the required minimum periodic payments on the increased limit,  consistent with Sec. 1026.51(b)(1)(i), or a cosigner, guarantor, or  joint applicant who is at least 21 years old assumes liability for any  debt incurred on the account, consistent with Sec. 1026.51(b)(1)(ii).  Thus, when a card issuer is considering whether to increase the credit  limit on an existing account, Sec. 1026.51(b)(2)(i)(A) requires that  consumers who have not attained the age of 21 and do not have a  cosigner, guarantor, or joint applicant who is 21 years or older must  have an independent ability to make the required minimum periodic  payments as of the time of the contemplated increase. Thus, the card  issuer may not consider income or assets to which an accountholder,  cosigner, or guarantor, in each case who is under the age of 21 and is  or will be liable for debts incurred on the account, has only a  reasonable expectation of access under Sec. 1026.51(b)(2)(i)(A). The  card issuer, however, may consider income or assets to which an  accountholder, cosigner, or guarantor, in each case who is age 21 or  older and is or will be liable for debts incurred on the account, has a  reasonable expectation of access under Sec. 1026.51(b)(2)(i)(B).  Information regarding income and assets that satisfies the requirements  of Sec. 1026.51(b)(1)(i) also satisfies the requirements of Sec.  1026.51(b)(2)(i)(A) and card issuers may rely on the guidance in the  commentary to Sec. 1026.51(b)(1)(i) for purposes of determining whether  an accountholder who is less than 21 years old has the independent  ability to make the required minimum periodic payments in accordance  with Sec. 1026.51(b)(2)(i)(A). Information regarding income and assets  that satisfies the requirements of Sec. 1026.51(a) also satisfies the  requirements of Sec. 1026.51(b)(2)(i)(B) and card issuers may rely on  the guidance in comments 51(a)(1)-4, -5, and -6 for purposes of  determining whether a cosigner, guarantor, or joint applicant who is at  least 21 years old has the ability to make the required minimum periodic  payments in accordance with Sec. 1026.51(b)(2)(i)(B).</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.52--Limitations on Fees</p><p class="depth0">52(a) Limitations during first year after account opening.</p><p class="depth0">52(a)(1) General rule</p><p class="depth0">1. Application. The 25 percent limit in Sec. 1026.52(a)(1) applies  to fees that the card issuer charges to the account as well as to fees  that the card issuer requires the consumer to pay with respect to the  account through other means (such as through a payment from the  consumer's asset account to   the card issuer or from another credit account provided by the card  issuer). For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that, under the terms of a credit card account, a consumer  is required to pay $120 in fees for the issuance or availability of  credit at account opening. The consumer is also required to pay a cash  advance fee that is equal to five percent of the cash advance and a late  payment fee of $15 if the required minimum periodic payment is not  received by the payment due date (which is the twenty-fifth of the  month). At account opening on January 1 of year one, the credit limit  for the account is $500. Section 1026.52(a)(1) permits the card issuer  to charge to the account the $120 in fees for the issuance or  availability of credit at account opening. On February 1 of year one,  the consumer uses the account for a $100 cash advance. Section  1026.52(a)(1) permits the card issuer to charge a $5 cash-advance fee to  the account. On March 26 of year one, the card issuer has not received  the consumer's required minimum periodic payment. Section 1026.52(a)(2)  permits the card issuer to charge a $15 late payment fee to the account.  On July 15 of year one, the consumer uses the account for a $50 cash  advance. Section 1026.52(a)(1) does not permit the card issuer to charge  a $2.50 cash advance fee to the account. Furthermore, Sec.  1026.52(a)(1) prohibits the card issuer from collecting the $2.50 cash  advance fee from the consumer by other means.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume that, under the terms of a credit card account, a  consumer is required to pay $125 in fees for the issuance or  availability of credit during the first year after account opening. At  account opening on January 1 of year one, the credit limit for the  account is $500. Section 1026.52(a)(1) permits the card issuer to charge  the $125 in fees to the account. However, Sec. 1026.52(a)(1) prohibits  the card issuer from requiring the consumer to make payments to the card  issuer for additional non-exempt fees with respect to the account during  the first year after account opening. Section 1026.52(a)(1) also  prohibits the card issuer from requiring the consumer to open a separate  credit account with the card issuer to fund the payment of additional  non-exempt fees during the first year after the credit card account is  opened.</p><p class="depth0">2. Fees that exceed 25 percent limit. A card issuer that charges a  fee to a credit card account that exceeds the 25 percent limit complies  with Sec. 1026.52(a)(1) if the card issuer waives or removes the fee  and any associated interest charges or credits the account for an amount  equal to the fee and any associated interest charges within a reasonable  amount of time but no later than the end of the billing cycle following  the billing cycle during which the fee was charged. For example,  assuming the facts in the example in comment 52(a)(1)-1.i above, the  card issuer complies with Sec. 1026.52(a)(1) if the card issuer charged  the $2.50 cash advance fee to the account on July 15 of year one but  waived or removed the fee or credited the account for $2.50 (plus any  interest charges on that $2.50) at the end of the billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">3. Changes in credit limit during first year.</p><p class="depth0">i. Increases in credit limit. If a card issuer increases the credit  limit during the first year after the account is opened, Sec.  1026.52(a)(1) does not permit the card issuer to require the consumer to  pay additional fees that would otherwise be prohibited (such as a fee  for increasing the credit limit). For example, assume that, at account  opening on January 1, the credit limit for a credit card account is $400  and the consumer is required to pay $100 in fees for the issuance or  availability of credit. On July 1, the card issuer increases the credit  limit for the account to $600. Section 1026.52(a)(1) does not permit the  card issuer to require the consumer to pay additional fees based on the  increased credit limit.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Decreases in credit limit. If a card issuer decreases the credit  limit during the first year after the account is opened, Sec.  1026.52(a)(1) requires the card issuer to waive or remove any fees  charged to the account that exceed 25 percent of the reduced credit  limit or to credit the account for an amount equal to any fees the  consumer was required to pay with respect to the account that exceed 25  percent of the reduced credit limit within a reasonable amount of time  but no later than the end of the billing cycle following the billing  cycle during which the credit limit was reduced. For example, assume  that, at account opening on January 1, the credit limit for a credit  card account is $1,000 and the consumer is required to pay $250 in fees  for the issuance or availability of credit. The billing cycles for the  account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of  the month. On July 30, the card issuer decreases the credit limit for  the account to $600. Section 1026.52(a)(1) requires the card issuer to  waive or remove $100 in fees from the account or to credit the account  for an amount equal to $100 within a reasonable amount of time but no  later than August 31.</p><p class="depth0">4. Date on which account may first be used by consumer to engage in  transactions. i. Methods of compliance. For purposes of Sec.  1026.52(a)(1), an account is considered open no earlier than the date on  which the account may first be used by the consumer to engage in  transactions. A card issuer may consider an account open for purposes of  Sec. 1026.52(a)(1) on any of the following dates:</p><p class="depth0">A. The date the account is first used by the consumer for a  transaction (such as when an account is established in connection with  financing the purchase of goods or services).</p><p class="depth0">B. The date the consumer complies with any reasonable activation  procedures imposed by the card issuer for preventing fraud   or unauthorized use of a new account (such as requiring the consumer to  provide information that verifies his or her identity), provided that  the account may be used for transactions on that date.</p><p class="depth0">C. The date that is seven days after the card issuer mails or  delivers to the consumer account-opening disclosures that comply with  Sec. 1026.6, provided that the consumer may use the account for  transactions after complying with any reasonable activation procedures  imposed by the card issuer for preventing fraud or unauthorized use of  the new account (such as requiring the consumer to provide information  that verifies his or her identity). If a card issuer has reasonable  procedures designed to ensure that account-opening disclosures that  comply with Sec. 1026.6 are mailed or delivered to consumers no later  than a certain number of days after the card issuer establishes the  account, the card issuer may add that number of days to the seven-day  period for purposes of determining the date on which the account was  opened.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Examples. A. Assume that, on July 1 of year one, a credit card  account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan is  established in connection with financing the purchase of goods or  services and a $500 transaction is charged to the account by the  consumer. The card issuer may consider the account open on July 1 of  year one for purposes of Sec. 1026.52(a)(1). Accordingly, Sec.  1026.52(a)(1) ceases to apply to the account on July 1 of year two.</p><p class="depth0">B. Assume that, on July 1 of year one, a card issuer approves a  consumer's application for a credit card account under an open-end (not  home-secured) consumer credit plan and establishes the account on its  internal systems. On July 5, the card issuer mails or delivers to the  consumer account-opening disclosures that comply with Sec. 1026.6. If  the consumer may use the account for transactions on the date the  consumer complies with any reasonable procedures imposed by the card  issuer for preventing fraud or unauthorized use, the card issuer may  consider the account open on July 12 of year one for purposes of Sec.  1026.52(a)(1). Accordingly, Sec. 1026.52(a)(1) ceases to apply to the  account on July 12 of year two.</p><p class="depth0">C. Same facts as in paragraph B above except that the card issuer  has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that account- opening disclosures that comply with Sec. 1026.6 are mailed or  delivered to consumers no later than three days after an account is  established on its systems. If the consumer may use the account for  transactions on the date the consumer complies with any reasonable  procedures imposed by the card issuer for preventing fraud or  unauthorized use, the card issuer may consider the account open on July  11 of year one for purposes of Sec. 1026.52(a)(1). Accordingly, Sec.  1026.52(a)(1) ceases to apply to the account on July 11 of year two.  However, if the consumer uses the account for a transaction or complies  with the card issuer's reasonable procedures for preventing fraud or  unauthorized use on July 8 of year one, the card issuer may, at its  option, consider the account open on that date for purposes of Sec.  1026.52(a)(1) and Sec. 1026.52(a)(1) therefore ceases to apply to the  account on July 8 of year two.</p><p class="depth0">52(a)(2) Fees Not Subject to Limitations</p><p class="depth0">1. Covered fees. Except as provided in Sec. 1026.52(a)(2), Sec.  1026.52(a) applies to any fees or other charges that a card issuer will  or may require the consumer to pay with respect to a credit card account  during the first year after account opening, other than charges  attributable to periodic interest rates. For example, Sec. 1026.52(a)  applies to:</p><p class="depth0">i. Fees that the consumer is required to pay for the issuance or  availability of credit described in Sec. 1026.60(b)(2), including any  fee based on account activity or inactivity and any fee that a consumer  is required to pay in order to receive a particular credit limit;</p><p class="depth0">ii. Fees for insurance described in Sec. 1026.4(b)(7) or debt  cancellation or debt suspension coverage described in Sec.  1026.4(b)(10) written in connection with a credit transaction, if the  insurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage is required  by the terms of the account;</p><p class="depth0">iii. Fees that the consumer is required to pay in order to engage in  transactions using the account (such as cash advance fees, balance  transfer fees, foreign transaction fees, and fees for using the account  for purchases);</p><p class="depth0">iv. Fees that the consumer is required to pay for violating the  terms of the account (except to the extent specifically excluded by  Sec. 1026.52(a)(2)(i));</p><p class="depth0">v. Fixed finance charges; and</p><p class="depth0">vi. Minimum charges imposed if a charge would otherwise have been  determined by applying a periodic interest rate to a balance except for  the fact that such charge is smaller than the minimum.</p><p class="depth0">2. Fees the consumer is not required to pay. Section  1026.52(a)(2)(ii) provides that Sec. 1026.52(a) does not apply to fees  that the consumer is not required to pay with respect to the account.  For example, Sec. 1026.52(a) generally does not apply to fees for  making an expedited payment (to the extent permitted by Sec.  1026.10(e)), fees for optional services (such as travel insurance), fees  for reissuing a lost or stolen card, or statement reproduction fees.</p><p class="depth0">3. Security deposits. A security deposit that is charged to a credit  card account is a fee for purposes of Sec. 1026.52(a). In contrast,  however, a security deposit is not subject to the 25 percent limit in  Sec. 1026.52(a)(1) if it is not charged to the account. For example,  Sec. 1026.52(a)(1) does not prohibit a card issuer from requiring a  consumer to provide funds at account opening pledged as security for   the account that exceed 25 percent of the credit limit at account  opening so long as those funds are not obtained from the account.</p><p class="depth0">52(a)(3) Rule of Construction</p><p class="depth0">1. Fees or charges otherwise prohibited by law. Section 1026.52(a)  does not authorize the imposition or payment of fees or charges  otherwise prohibited by law. For example, see 16 CFR 310.4(a)(4).</p><p class="depth0">52(b) Limitations on Penalty Fees</p><p class="depth0">1. Fees for violating the account terms or other requirements. For  purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b), a fee includes any charge imposed by a  card issuer based on an act or omission that violates the terms of the  account or any other requirements imposed by the card issuer with  respect to the account, other than charges attributable to periodic  interest rates. Accordingly, for purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b), a fee  does not include charges attributable to an increase in an annual  percentage rate based on an act or omission that violates the terms or  other requirements of an account.</p><p class="depth0">i. The following are examples of fees that are subject to the  limitations in Sec. 1026.52(b) or are prohibited by Sec. 1026.52(b):</p><p class="depth0">A. Late payment fees and any other fees imposed by a card issuer if  an account becomes delinquent or if a payment is not received by a  particular date.</p><p class="depth0">B. Returned payment fees and any other fees imposed by a card issuer  if a payment received via check, automated clearing house, or other  payment method is returned.</p><p class="depth0">C. Any fee or charge for an over-the-limit transaction as defined in  Sec. 1026.56(a), to the extent the imposition of such a fee or charge  is permitted by Sec. 1026.56.</p><p class="depth0">D. Any fee imposed by a card issuer if payment on a check that  accesses a credit card account is declined.</p><p class="depth0">E. Any fee or charge for a transaction that the card issuer declines  to authorize. See Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B).</p><p class="depth0">F. Any fee imposed by a card issuer based on account inactivity  (including the consumer's failure to use the account for a particular  number or dollar amount of transactions or a particular type of  transaction). See Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B).</p><p class="depth0">G. Any fee imposed by a card issuer based on the closure or  termination of an account. See Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B).</p><p class="depth0">ii. The following are examples of fees to which Sec. 1026.52(b)  does not apply:</p><p class="depth0">A. Balance transfer fees.</p><p class="depth0">B. Cash advance fees.</p><p class="depth0">C. Foreign transaction fees.</p><p class="depth0">D. Annual fees and other fees for the issuance or availability of  credit described in Sec. 1026.60(b)(2), except to the extent that such  fees are based on account inactivity. See Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B).</p><p class="depth0">E. Fees for insurance described in Sec. 1026.4(b)(7) or debt  cancellation or debt suspension coverage described in Sec.  1026.4(b)(10) written in connection with a credit transaction, provided  that such fees are not imposed as a result of a violation of the account  terms or other requirements of an account.</p><p class="depth0">F. Fees for making an expedited payment (to the extent permitted by  Sec. 1026.10(e)).</p><p class="depth0">G. Fees for optional services (such as travel insurance).</p><p class="depth0">H. Fees for reissuing a lost or stolen card.</p><p class="depth0">2. Rounding to nearest whole dollar. A card issuer may round any fee  that complies with Sec. 1026.52(b) to the nearest whole dollar. For  example, if Sec. 1026.52(b) permits a card issuer to impose a late  payment fee of $21.50, the card issuer may round that amount up to the  nearest whole dollar and impose a late payment fee of $22. However, if  the late payment fee permitted by Sec. 1026.52(b) were $21.49, the card  issuer would not be permitted to round that amount up to $22, although  the card issuer could round that amount down and impose a late payment  fee of $21.</p><p class="depth0">52(b)(1) General Rule</p><p class="depth0">1. Relationship between Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(i), (b)(1)(ii), and  (b)(2). i. Relationship between Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(ii). A  card issuer may impose a fee for violating the terms or other  requirements of an account pursuant to either Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(i) or  (b)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">A. A card issuer that complies with the safe harbors in Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii) is not required to determine that its fees represent a  reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as  a result of a type of violation under Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">B. A card issuer may impose a fee for one type of violation pursuant  to Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(i) and may impose a fee for a different type of  violation pursuant to Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii). For example, a card  issuer may impose a late payment fee of $30 based on a cost  determination pursuant to Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(i) but impose returned  payment and over-the-limit fees of $25 or $35 pursuant to the safe  harbors in Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">C. A card issuer that previously based the amount of a penalty fee  for a particular type of violation on a cost determination pursuant to  Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(i) may begin to impose a penalty fee for that type  of violation that is consistent with Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii) at any time  (subject to the notice requirements in Sec. 1026.9), provided that the  first fee imposed pursuant to Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii) is consistent with  Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A). For example, assume that a late payment  occurs on January 15 and that, based on a cost determination pursuant to  Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(i), the card issuer imposes a $30 late payment fee.  Another late payment occurs on July 15. The card issuer   may impose another $30 late payment fee pursuant to Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(i) or may impose a $25 late payment fee pursuant to Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A). However, the card issuer may not impose a $35 late  payment fee pursuant to Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B). If the card issuer  imposes a $25 fee pursuant to Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) for the July 15  late payment and another late payment occurs on September 15, the card  issuer may impose a $35 fee for the September 15 late payment pursuant  to Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Relationship between Sec. 1026.52(b)(1) and (b)(2). Section  1026.52(b)(1) does not permit a card issuer to impose a fee that is  inconsistent with the prohibitions in Sec. 1026.52(b)(2). For example,  if Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i) prohibits the card issuer from imposing a late  payment fee that exceeds $15, Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii) does not permit  the card issuer to impose a higher late payment fee.</p><p class="depth0">52(b)(1)(i) Fees Based on Costs</p><p class="depth0">1. Costs incurred as a result of violations. Section  1026.52(b)(1)(i) does not require a card issuer to base a fee on the  costs incurred as a result of a specific violation of the terms or other  requirements of an account. Instead, for purposes of Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(i), a card issuer must have determined that a fee for  violating the terms or other requirements of an account represents a  reasonable proportion of the costs incurred by the card issuer as a  result of that type of violation. A card issuer may make a single  determination for all of its credit card portfolios or may make separate  determinations for each portfolio. The factors relevant to this  determination include:</p><p class="depth0">i. The number of violations of a particular type experienced by the  card issuer during a prior period of reasonable length (for example, a  period of twelve months).</p><p class="depth0">ii. The costs incurred by the card issuer during that period as a  result of those violations.</p><p class="depth0">iii. At the card issuer's option, the number of fees imposed by the  card issuer as a result of those violations during that period that the  card issuer reasonably estimates it will be unable to collect. See  comment 52(b)(1)(i)-5.</p><p class="depth0">iv. At the card issuer's option, reasonable estimates for an  upcoming period of changes in the number of violations of that type, the  resulting costs, and the number of fees that the card issuer will be  unable to collect. See illustrative examples in comments 52(b)(1)(i)-6  through -9.</p><p class="depth0">2. Amounts excluded from cost analysis. The following amounts are  not costs incurred by a card issuer as a result of violations of the  terms or other requirements of an account for purposes of Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(i):</p><p class="depth0">i. Losses and associated costs (including the cost of holding  reserves against potential losses and the cost of funding delinquent  accounts).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Costs associated with evaluating whether consumers who have not  violated the terms or other requirements of an account are likely to do  so in the future (such as the costs associated with underwriting new  accounts). However, once a violation of the terms or other requirements  of an account has occurred, the costs associated with preventing  additional violations for a reasonable period of time are costs incurred  by a card issuer as a result of violations of the terms or other  requirements of an account for purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">3. Third party charges. As a general matter, amounts charged to the  card issuer by a third party as a result of a violation of the terms or  other requirements of an account are costs incurred by the card issuer  for purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(i). For example, if a card issuer is  charged a specific amount by a third party for each returned payment,  that amount is a cost incurred by the card issuer as a result of  returned payments. However, if the amount is charged to the card issuer  by an affiliate or subsidiary of the card issuer, the card issuer must  have determined that the charge represents a reasonable proportion of  the costs incurred by the affiliate or subsidiary as a result of the  type of violation. For example, if an affiliate of a card issuer  provides collection services to the card issuer on delinquent accounts,  the card issuer must have determined that the amounts charged to the  card issuer by the affiliate for such services represent a reasonable  proportion of the costs incurred by the affiliate as a result of late  payments.</p><p class="depth0">4. Amounts charged by other card issuers. The fact that a card  issuer's fees for violating the terms or other requirements of an  account are comparable to fees assessed by other card issuers does not  satisfy the requirements of Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">5. Uncollected fees. For purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(i), a card  issuer may consider fees that it is unable to collect when determining  the appropriate fee amount. Fees that the card issuer is unable to  collect include fees imposed on accounts that have been charged off by  the card issuer, fees that have been discharged in bankruptcy, and fees  that the card issuer is required to waive in order to comply with a  legal requirement (such as a requirement imposed by 12 CFR Part 1026 or  50 U.S.C. app. 527). However, fees that the card issuer chooses not to  impose or chooses not to collect (such as fees the card issuer chooses  to waive at the request of the consumer or under a workout or temporary  hardship arrangement) are not relevant for purposes of this  determination. See illustrative examples in comments 52(b)(2)(i)-6  through -9.</p><p class="depth0">6. Late payment fees. i. Costs incurred as a result of late  payments. For purposes of   Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(i), the costs incurred by a card issuer as a result  of late payments include the costs associated with the collection of  late payments, such as the costs associated with notifying consumers of  delinquencies and resolving delinquencies (including the establishment  of workout and temporary hardship arrangements).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Examples. A. Late payment fee based on past delinquencies and  costs. Assume that, during year one, a card issuer experienced 1 million  delinquencies and incurred $26 million in costs as a result of those  delinquencies. For purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(i), a $26 late  payment fee would represent a reasonable proportion of the total costs  incurred by the card issuer as a result of late payments during year  two.</p><p class="depth0">B. Adjustment based on fees card issuer is unable to collect. Same  facts as above except that the card issuer imposed a late payment fee  for each of the 1 million delinquencies experienced during year one but  was unable to collect 25% of those fees (in other words, the card issuer  was unable to collect 250,000 fees, leaving a total of 750,000 late  payments for which the card issuer did collect or could have collected a  fee). For purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i), a late payment fee of $35  would represent a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by  the card issuer as a result of late payments during year two.</p><p class="depth0">C. Adjustment based on reasonable estimate of future changes. Same  facts as paragraphs A and B above except the card issuer reasonably  estimates that--based on past delinquency rates and other factors  relevant to potential delinquency rates for year two--it will experience  a 2% decrease in delinquencies during year two (in other words, 20,000  fewer delinquencies for a total of 980,000). The card issuer also  reasonably estimates that it will be unable to collect the same  percentage of fees (25%) during year two as during year one (in other  words, the card issuer will be unable to collect 245,000 fees, leaving a  total of 735,000 late payments for which the card issuer will be able to  collect a fee). The card issuer also reasonably estimates that--based on  past changes in costs incurred as a result of delinquencies and other  factors relevant to potential costs for year two--it will experience a  5% increase in costs during year two (in other words, $1.3 million in  additional costs for a total of $27.3 million). For purposes of Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(i), a $37 late payment fee would represent a reasonable  proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of  late payments during year two.</p><p class="depth0">7. Returned payment fees. i. Costs incurred as a result of returned  payments. For purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(i), the costs incurred by  a card issuer as a result of returned payments include:</p><p class="depth0">A. Costs associated with processing returned payments and  reconciling the card issuer's systems and accounts to reflect returned  payments;</p><p class="depth0">B. Costs associated with investigating potential fraud with respect  to returned payments; and</p><p class="depth0">C. Costs associated with notifying the consumer of the returned  payment and arranging for a new payment.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Examples. A. Returned payment fee based on past returns and  costs. Assume that, during year one, a card issuer experienced 150,000  returned payments and incurred $3.1 million in costs as a result of  those returned payments. For purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(i), a $21  returned payment fee would represent a reasonable proportion of the  total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of returned payments  during year two.</p><p class="depth0">B. Adjustment based on fees card issuer is unable to collect. Same  facts as above except that the card issuer imposed a returned payment  fee for each of the 150,000 returned payments experienced during year  one but was unable to collect 15% of those fees (in other words, the  card issuer was unable to collect 22,500 fees, leaving a total of  127,500 returned payments for which the card issuer did collect or could  have collected a fee). For purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i), a  returned payment fee of $24 would represent a reasonable proportion of  the total costs incurred by the card issuer as a result of returned  payments during year two.</p><p class="depth0">C. Adjustment based on reasonable estimate of future changes. Same  facts as paragraphs A and B above except the card issuer reasonably  estimates that--based on past returned payment rates and other factors  relevant to potential returned payment rates for year two--it will  experience a 2% increase in returned payments during year two (in other  words, 3,000 additional returned payments for a total of 153,000). The  card issuer also reasonably estimates that it will be unable to collect  25% of returned payment fees during year two (in other words, the card  issuer will be unable to collect 38,250 fees, leaving a total of 114,750  returned payments for which the card issuer will be able to collect a  fee). The card issuer also reasonably estimates that--based on past  changes in costs incurred as a result of returned payments and other  factors relevant to potential costs for year two--it will experience a  1% decrease in costs during year two (in other words, a $31,000  reduction in costs for a total of $3.069 million). For purposes of Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(i), a $27 returned payment fee would represent a  reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as  a result of returned payments during year two.</p><p class="depth0">8. Over-the-limit fees. i. Costs incurred as a result of over-the- limit transactions. For purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(i), the costs  incurred by a card issuer as a result of over-the-limit transactions  include:</p><p class="depth0">A. Costs associated with determining whether to authorize over-the- limit transactions; and</p><p class="depth0">B. Costs associated with notifying the consumer that the credit  limit has been exceeded and arranging for payments to reduce the balance  below the credit limit.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Costs not incurred as a result of over-the-limit transactions.  For purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(i), costs associated with obtaining  the affirmative consent of consumers to the card issuer's payment of  transactions that exceed the credit limit consistent with Sec. 1026.56  are not costs incurred by a card issuer as a result of over-the-limit  transactions.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Examples. A. Over-the-limit fee based on past fees and costs.  Assume that, during year one, a card issuer authorized 600,000 over-the- limit transactions and incurred $4.5 million in costs as a result of  those over-the-limit transactions. However, because of the affirmative  consent requirements in Sec. 1026.56, the card issuer was only  permitted to impose 200,000 over-the-limit fees during year one. For  purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(i), a $23 over-the-limit fee would  represent a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the  card issuer as a result of over-the-limit transactions during year two.</p><p class="depth0">B. Adjustment based on fees card issuer is unable to collect. Same  facts as above except that the card issuer was unable to collect 30% of  the 200,000 over-the-limit fees imposed during year one (in other words,  the card issuer was unable to collect 60,000 fees, leaving a total of  140,000 over-the-limit transactions for which the card issuer did  collect or could have collected a fee). For purposes of Sec.  1026.52(b)(2)(i), an over-the-limit fee of $32 would represent a  reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as  a result of over-the-limit transactions during year two.</p><p class="depth0">C. Adjustment based on reasonable estimate of future changes. Same  facts as paragraphs A and B above except the card issuer reasonably  estimates that--based on past over-the-limit transaction rates, the  percentages of over-the-limit transactions that resulted in an over-the- limit fee in the past (consistent with Sec. 1026.56), and factors  relevant to potential changes in those rates and percentages for year  two--it will authorize approximately the same number of over-the-limit  transactions during year two (600,000) and impose approximately the same  number of over-the-limit fees (200,000). The card issuer also reasonably  estimates that it will be unable to collect the same percentage of fees  (30%) during year two as during year one (in other words, the card  issuer was unable to collect 60,000 fees, leaving a total of 140,000  over-the-limit transactions for which the card issuer will be able to  collect a fee). The card issuer also reasonably estimates that--based on  past changes in costs incurred as a result of over-the-limit  transactions and other factors relevant to potential costs for year  two--it will experience a 6% decrease in costs during year two (in other  words, a $270,000 reduction in costs for a total of $4.23 million). For  purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(i), a $30 over-the-limit fee would  represent a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the  card issuer as a result of over-the-limit transactions during year two.</p><p class="depth0">9. Declined access check fees. i. Costs incurred as a result of  declined access checks. For purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(i), the  costs incurred by a card issuer as a result of declining payment on a  check that accesses a credit card account include:</p><p class="depth0">A. Costs associated with determining whether to decline payment on  access checks;</p><p class="depth0">B. Costs associated with processing declined access checks and  reconciling the card issuer's systems and accounts to reflect declined  access checks;</p><p class="depth0">C. Costs associated with investigating potential fraud with respect  to declined access checks; and</p><p class="depth0">D. Costs associated with notifying the consumer and the merchant or  other party that accepted the access check that payment on the check has  been declined.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Example. Assume that, during year one, a card issuer declined  100,000 access checks and incurred $2 million in costs as a result of  those declined checks. The card issuer imposed a fee for each declined  access check but was unable to collect 10% of those fees (in other  words, the card issuer was unable to collect 10,000 fees, leaving a  total of 90,000 declined access checks for which the card issuer did  collect or could have collected a fee). For purposes of Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(i), a $22 declined access check fee would represent a  reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the card issuer as  a result of declined access checks during year two.</p><p class="depth0">52(b)(1)(ii) Safe harbors</p><p class="depth0">1. Multiple violations of same type. i. Same billing cycle or next  six billing cycles. A card issuer cannot impose a fee for a violation  pursuant to Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B) unless a fee has previously been  imposed for the same type of violation pursuant to Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A). Once a fee has been imposed for a violation  pursuant to Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A), the card issuer may impose a fee  pursuant to Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B) for any subsequent violation of  the same type until that type of violation has not occurred for a period  of six consecutive complete billing cycles. A fee has been imposed for  purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii) even if the card issuer waives or  rebates all or part of the fee.</p><p class="depth0">A. Late payments. For purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii), a late  payment occurs during the billing cycle in which the payment may first  be treated as late consistent with   the requirements of this part and the terms or other requirements of the  account.</p><p class="depth0">B. Returned payments. For purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii), a  returned payment occurs during the billing cycle in which the payment is  returned to the card issuer.</p><p class="depth0">C. Transactions that exceed the credit limit. For purposes of Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii), a transaction that exceeds the credit limit for an  account occurs during the billing cycle in which the transaction occurs  or is authorized by the card issuer.</p><p class="depth0">D. Declined access checks. For purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii),  a check that accesses a credit card account is declined during the  billing cycle in which the card issuer declines payment on the check.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Relationship to Sec. Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(ii) and 1026.56(j)(1).  If multiple violations are based on the same event or transaction such  that Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing  more than one fee, the event or transaction constitutes a single  violation for purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii). Furthermore,  consistent with Sec. 1026.56(j)(1)(i), no more than one violation for  exceeding an account's credit limit can occur during a single billing  cycle for purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii). However, Sec.  1026.52(b)(2)(ii) does not prohibit a card issuer from imposing fees for  exceeding the credit limit in consecutive billing cycles based on the  same over-the-limit transaction to the extent permitted by Sec.  1026.56(j)(1). In these circumstances, the second and third over-the- limit fees permitted by Sec. 1026.56(j)(1) may be imposed pursuant to  Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B). See comment 52(b)(2)(ii)-1.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(1)(ii)(B) with respect to credit card  accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan that  are not charge card accounts. For purposes of these examples, assume  that the billing cycles for the account begin on the first day of the  month and end on the last day of the month and that the payment due date  for the account is the twenty-fifth day of the month.</p><p class="depth0">A. Violations of same type (late payments). A required minimum  periodic payment of $50 is due on March 25. On March 26, a late payment  has occurred because no payment has been received. Accordingly,  consistent with Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A), the card issuer imposes a  $25 late payment fee on March 26. In order for the card issuer to impose  a $35 late payment fee pursuant to Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), a second  late payment must occur during the April, May, June, July, August, or  September billing cycles.</p><p class="depth0">1. The card issuer does not receive any payment during the March  billing cycle. A required minimum periodic payment of $100 is due on  April 25. On April 20, the card issuer receives a $50 payment. No  further payment is received during the April billing cycle. Accordingly,  consistent with Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), the card issuer may impose a  $35 late payment fee on April 26. Furthermore, the card issuer may  impose a $35 late payment fee for any late payment that occurs during  the May, June, July, August, September, or October billing cycles.</p><p class="depth0">2. Same facts as in paragraph A above. On March 30, the card issuer  receives a $50 payment and the required minimum periodic payments for  the April, May, June, July, August, and September billing cycles are  received on or before the payment due date. A required minimum periodic  payment of $60 is due on October 25. On October 26, a late payment has  occurred because the required minimum periodic payment due on October 25  has not been received. However, because this late payment did not occur  during the six billing cycles following the March billing cycle, Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii) only permits the card issuer to impose a late payment  fee of $25.</p><p class="depth0">B. Violations of different types (late payment and over the credit  limit). The credit limit for an account is $1,000. Consistent with Sec.  1026.56, the consumer has affirmatively consented to the payment of  transactions that exceed the credit limit. A required minimum periodic  payment of $30 is due on August 25. On August 26, a late payment has  occurred because no payment has been received. Accordingly, consistent  with Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A), the card issuer imposes a $25 late  payment fee on August 26. On August 30, the card issuer receives a $30  payment. On September 10, a transaction causes the account balance to  increase to $1,150, which exceeds the account's $1,000 credit limit. On  September 11, a second transaction increases the account balance to  $1,350. On September 23, the card issuer receives the $50 required  minimum periodic payment due on September 25, which reduces the account  balance to $1,300. On September 30, the card issuer imposes a $25 over- the-limit fee, consistent with Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A). On October  26, a late payment has occurred because the $60 required minimum  periodic payment due on October 25 has not been received. Accordingly,  consistent with Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), the card issuer imposes a  $35 late payment fee on October 26.</p><p class="depth0">C. Violations of different types (late payment and returned  payment). A required minimum periodic payment of $50 is due on July 25.  On July 26, a late payment has occurred because no payment has been  received. Accordingly, consistent with Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A), the  card issuer imposes a $25 late payment fee on July 26. On July 30, the  card issuer receives a $50 payment. A required minimum periodic payment  of $50 is due on August 25. On August 24, a $50 payment is received. On  August 27, the $50 payment is returned to the card issuer for  insufficient funds. In these circumstances, Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(ii)  permits the card issuer to impose either a late payment   fee or a returned payment fee but not both because the late payment and  the returned payment result from the same event or transaction.  Accordingly, for purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii), the event or  transaction constitutes a single violation. However, if the card issuer  imposes a late payment fee, Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B) permits the  issuer to impose a fee of $35 because the late payment occurred during  the six billing cycles following the July billing cycle. In contrast, if  the card issuer imposes a returned payment fee, the amount of the fee  may be no more than $25 pursuant to Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A).</p><p class="depth0">2. Adjustments based on Consumer Price Index. For purposes of Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(1)(ii)(B), the Bureau shall calculate each  year price level adjusted amounts using the Consumer Price Index in  effect on June 1 of that year. When the cumulative change in the  adjusted minimum value derived from applying the annual Consumer Price  level to the current amounts in Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and  (b)(1)(ii)(B) has risen by a whole dollar, those amounts will be  increased by $1.00. Similarly, when the cumulative change in the  adjusted minimum value derived from applying the annual Consumer Price  level to the current amounts in Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and  (b)(1)(ii)(B) has decreased by a whole dollar, those amounts will be  decreased by $1.00. The Bureau will publish adjustments to the amounts  in Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(1)(ii)(B).</p><p class="depth0">i. Historical thresholds.</p><p class="depth0">A. Card issuers were permitted to impose a fee for violating the  terms of an agreement if the fee did not exceed $25 under Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and $35 under Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), through  December 31, 2013.</p><p class="depth0">B. Card issuers were permitted to impose a fee for violating the  terms of an agreement if the fee did not exceed $26 under Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and $37 under Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), through  December 31, 2014.</p><p class="depth0">3. Delinquent balance for charge card accounts. Section  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(C) provides that, when a charge card issuer that  requires payment of outstanding balances in full at the end of each  billing cycle has not received the required payment for two or more  consecutive billing cycles, the card issuer may impose a late payment  fee that does not exceed three percent of the delinquent balance. For  purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(C), the delinquent balance is any  previously billed amount that remains unpaid at the time the late  payment fee is imposed pursuant to Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(C).  Consistent with Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(ii), a charge card issuer that  imposes a fee pursuant to Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(C) with respect to a  late payment may not impose a fee pursuant to Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B)  with respect to the same late payment. The following examples illustrate  the application of Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(C):</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that a charge card issuer requires payment of outstanding  balances in full at the end of each billing cycle and that the billing  cycles for the account begin on the first day of the month and end on  the last day of the month. At the end of the June billing cycle, the  account has a balance of $1,000. On July 5, the card issuer provides a  periodic statement disclosing the $1,000 balance consistent with Sec.  1026.7. During the July billing cycle, the account is used for $300 in  transactions, increasing the balance to $1,300. At the end of the July  billing cycle, no payment has been received and the card issuer imposes  a $25 late payment fee consistent with Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A). On  August 5, the card issuer provides a periodic statement disclosing the  $1,325 balance consistent with Sec. 1026.7. During the August billing  cycle, the account is used for $200 in transactions, increasing the  balance to $1,525. At the end of the August billing cycle, no payment  has been received. Consistent with Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(C), the card  issuer may impose a late payment fee of $40, which is 3% of the $1,325  balance that was due at the end of the August billing cycle. Section  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(C) does not permit the card issuer to include the $200  in transactions that occurred during the August billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Same facts as above except that, on August 25, a $100 payment is  received. Consistent with Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(C), the card issuer  may impose a late payment fee of $37, which is 3% of the unpaid portion  of the $1,325 balance that was due at the end of the August billing  cycle ($1,225).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Same facts as in paragraph A above except that, on August 25, a  $200 payment is received. Consistent with Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(C),  the card issuer may impose a late payment fee of $34, which is 3% of the  unpaid portion of the $1,325 balance that was due at the end of the  August billing cycle ($1,125). In the alternative, the card issuer may  impose a late payment fee of $35 consistent with Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B). However, Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the  card issuer from imposing both fees.</p><p class="depth0">52(b)(2) Prohibited fees</p><p class="depth0">1. Relationship to Sec. 1026.52(b)(1). A card issuer does not  comply with Sec. 1026.52(b) if it imposes a fee that is inconsistent  with the prohibitions in Sec. 1026.52(b)(2). Thus, the prohibitions in  Sec. 1026.52(b)(2) apply even if a fee is consistent with Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii). For example, even if a card issuer has  determined for purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(i) that a $27 fee  represents a reasonable proportion of the total costs incurred by the  card issuer as a result of a particular type of violation, Sec.  1026.52(b)(2)(i) prohibits the card issuer from   imposing that fee if the dollar amount associated with the violation is  less than $27. Similarly, even if Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii) permits a card  issuer to impose a $25 fee, Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i) prohibits the card  issuer from imposing that fee if the dollar amount associated with the  violation is less than $25.</p><p class="depth0">52(b)(2)(i) Fees That Exceed Dollar Amount Associated With Violation</p><p class="depth0">1. Late payment fees. For purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i), the  dollar amount associated with a late payment is the amount of the  required minimum periodic payment due immediately prior to assessment of  the late payment fee. Thus, Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits a card  issuer from imposing a late payment fee that exceeds the amount of that  required minimum periodic payment. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that a $15 required minimum periodic payment is due on  September 25. The card issuer does not receive any payment on or before  September 25. On September 26, the card issuer imposes a late payment  fee. For purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount  associated with the late payment is the amount of the required minimum  periodic payment due on September 25 ($15). Thus, under Sec.  1026.52(b)(2)(i)(A), the amount of that fee cannot exceed $15 (even if a  higher fee would be permitted under Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Same facts as above except that, on September 25, the card  issuer receives a $10 payment. No further payments are received. On  September 26, the card issuer imposes a late payment fee. For purposes  of Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with the late  payment is the full amount of the required minimum periodic payment due  on September 25 ($15), rather than the unpaid portion of that payment  ($5). Thus, under Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(A), the amount of the late  payment fee cannot exceed $15 (even if a higher fee would be permitted  under Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Assume that a $15 required minimum periodic payment is due on  October 28 and the billing cycle for the account closes on October 31.  The card issuer does not receive any payment on or before November 3. On  November 3, the card issuer determines that the required minimum  periodic payment due on November 28 is $50. On November 5, the card  issuer imposes a late payment fee. For purposes of Sec.  1026.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with the late payment is  the amount of the required minimum periodic payment due on October 28  ($15), rather than the amount of the required minimum periodic payment  due on November 28 ($50). Thus, under Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(A), the  amount of that fee cannot exceed $15 (even if a higher fee would be  permitted under Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)).</p><p class="depth0">2. Returned payment fees. For purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i),  the dollar amount associated with a returned payment is the amount of  the required minimum periodic payment due immediately prior to the date  on which the payment is returned to the card issuer. Thus, Sec.  1026.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits a card issuer from imposing a returned  payment fee that exceeds the amount of that required minimum periodic  payment. However, if a payment has been returned and is submitted again  for payment by the card issuer, there is no additional dollar amount  associated with a subsequent return of that payment and Sec.  1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B) prohibits the card issuer from imposing an  additional returned payment fee. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that the billing cycles for an account begin on the first  day of the month and end on the last day of the month and that the  payment due date is the twenty-fifth day of the month. A minimum payment  of $15 is due on March 25. The card issuer receives a check for $100 on  March 23, which is returned to the card issuer for insufficient funds on  March 26. For purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount  associated with the returned payment is the amount of the required  minimum periodic payment due on March 25 ($15). Thus, Sec.  1026.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits the card issuer from imposing a returned  payment fee that exceeds $15 (even if a higher fee would be permitted  under Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)). Furthermore, Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(ii)  prohibits the card issuer from assessing both a late payment fee and a  returned payment fee in these circumstances. See comment 52(b)(2)(ii)-1.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Same facts as above except that the card issuer receives the  $100 check on March 31 and the check is returned for insufficient funds  on April 2. The minimum payment due on April 25 is $30.

Thus, Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits  the card issuer from imposing a returned payment fee that exceeds $15  (even if a higher fee would be permitted under Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)).  Furthermore, Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from  assessing both a late payment fee and a returned payment fee in these  circumstances. See comment 52(b)(2)(ii)-1.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Same facts as paragraph i above except that, on March 28, the  card issuer presents the $100 check for payment a second time. On April  1, the check is again returned for insufficient funds. Section  1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B) prohibits the card issuer from imposing a returned  payment fee based on the return of the payment on April 1.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Assume that the billing cycles for an account begin on the first  day of the month and end on the last day of the month and that the  payment due date is the twenty-   fifth day of the month. A minimum payment of $15 is due on August 25.  The card issuer receives a check for $15 on August 23, which is not  returned. The card issuer receives a check for $50 on September 5, which  is returned to the card issuer for insufficient funds on September 7.  Section 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B) does not prohibit the card issuer from  imposing a returned payment fee in these circumstances. Instead, for  purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with  the returned payment is the amount of the required minimum periodic  payment due on August 25 ($15). Thus, Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(A)  prohibits the card issuer from imposing a returned payment fee that  exceeds $15 (even if a higher fee would be permitted under Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)).</p><p class="depth0">3. Over-the-limit fees. For purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i), the  dollar amount associated with extensions of credit in excess of the  credit limit for an account is the total amount of credit extended by  the card issuer in excess of the credit limit during the billing cycle  in which the over-the-limit fee is imposed. Thus, Sec.  1026.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits a card issuer from imposing an over-the- limit fee that exceeds that amount. Nothing in Sec. 1026.52(b) permits  a card issuer to impose an over-the-limit fee if imposition of the fee  is inconsistent with Sec. 1026.56. The following examples illustrate  the application of Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(A) to over-the-limit fees:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that the billing cycles for a credit card account with a  credit limit of $5,000 begin on the first day of the month and end on  the last day of the month. Assume also that, consistent with Sec.  1026.56, the consumer has affirmatively consented to the payment of  transactions that exceed the credit limit. On March 1, the account has a  $4,950 balance. On March 6, a $60 transaction is charged to the account,  increasing the balance to $5,010. On March 25, a $5 transaction is  charged to the account, increasing the balance to $5,015. On the last  day of the billing cycle (March 31), the card issuer imposes an over- the-limit fee. For purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount  associated with the extensions of credit in excess of the credit limit  is the total amount of credit extended by the card issuer in excess of  the credit limit during the March billing cycle ($15). Thus, Sec.  1026.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits the card issuer from imposing an over-the- limit fee that exceeds $15 (even if a higher fee would be permitted  under Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Same facts as above except that, on March 26, the card issuer  receives a payment of $20, reducing the balance below the credit limit  to $4,995. Nevertheless, for purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i), the  dollar amount associated with the extensions of credit in excess of the  credit limit is the total amount of credit extended by the card issuer  in excess of the credit limit during the March billing cycle ($15).  Thus, consistent with Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer may  impose an over-the-limit fee of $15.</p><p class="depth0">4. Declined access check fees. For purposes of Sec.  1026.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount associated with declining payment on  a check that accesses a credit card account is the amount of the check.  Thus, when a check that accesses a credit card account is declined,  Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits a card issuer from imposing a fee  that exceeds the amount of that check. For example, assume that a check  that accesses a credit card account is used as payment for a $50  transaction, but payment on the check is declined by the card issuer  because the transaction would have exceeded the credit limit for the  account. For purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i), the dollar amount  associated with the declined check is the amount of the check ($50).  Thus, Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(A) prohibits the card issuer from imposing  a fee that exceeds $50. However, the amount of this fee must also comply  with Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">5. Inactivity fees. Section 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(2) prohibits a card  issuer from imposing a fee with respect to a credit card account under  an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan based on inactivity  on that account (including the consumer's failure to use the account for  a particular number or dollar amount of transactions or a particular  type of transaction). For example, Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(2)  prohibits a card issuer from imposing a $50 fee when a credit card  account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan is not  used for at least $2,000 in purchases over the course of a year.  Similarly, Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(2) prohibits a card issuer from  imposing a $50 annual fee on all accounts of a particular type but  waiving the fee on any account that is used for at least $2,000 in  purchases over the course of a year if the card issuer promotes the  waiver or rebate of the annual fee for purposes of Sec. 1026.55(e).  However, if the card issuer does not promote the waiver or rebate of the  annual fee for purposes of Sec. 1026.55(e), Sec.  1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(2) does not prohibit a card issuer from considering  account activity along with other factors when deciding whether to waive  or rebate annual fees on individual accounts (such as in response to a  consumer's request).</p><p class="depth0">6. Closed account fees. Section 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(3) prohibits a  card issuer from imposing a fee based on the closure or termination of  an account. For example, Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(3) prohibits a card  issuer from:</p><p class="depth0">i. Imposing a one-time fee to consumers who close their accounts.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Imposing a periodic fee (such as an annual fee, a monthly  maintenance fee, or a closed account fee) after an account is closed or  terminated if that fee was not imposed   prior to closure or termination. This prohibition applies even if the  fee was disclosed prior to closure or termination. See also comment  55(d)-1.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Increasing a periodic fee (such as an annual fee or a monthly  maintenance fee) after an account is closed or terminated. However, a  card issuer is not prohibited from continuing to impose a periodic fee  that was imposed before the account was closed or terminated.</p><p class="depth0">52(b)(2)(ii) Multiple Fees Based on a Single Event or Transaction</p><p class="depth0">1. Single event or transaction. Section 1026.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits  a card issuer from imposing more than one fee for violating the terms or  other requirements of an account based on a single event or transaction.  If Sec. 1026.56(j)(1) permits a card issuer to impose fees for  exceeding the credit limit in consecutive billing cycles based on the  same over-the-limit transaction, those fees are not based on a single  event or transaction for purposes of Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(ii). The  following examples illustrate the application of Sec.  1026.52(b)(2)(ii). Assume for purposes of these examples that the  billing cycles for a credit card account begin on the first day of the  month and end on the last day of the month and that the payment due date  for the account is the twenty-fifth day of the month.</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that the required minimum periodic payment due on March 25  is $20. On March 26, the card issuer has not received any payment and  imposes a late payment fee. Consistent with Sec. Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(i), the card issuer may impose a $20  late payment fee on March 26. However, Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits  the card issuer from imposing an additional late payment fee if the $20  minimum payment has not been received by a subsequent date (such as  March 31).</p><p class="depth0">A. On April 3, the card issuer provides a periodic statement  disclosing that a $70 required minimum periodic payment is due on April  25. This minimum payment includes the $20 minimum payment due on March  25 and the $20 late payment fee imposed on March 26. On April 20, the  card issuer receives a $20 payment. No additional payments are received  during the April billing cycle. Section 1026.52(b)(2)(ii) does not  prohibit the card issuer from imposing a late payment fee based on the  consumer's failure to make the $70 required minimum periodic payment on  or before April 25. Accordingly, consistent with Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B) and (b)(2)(i), the card issuer may impose a $35  late payment fee on April 26.</p><p class="depth0">B. On April 3, the card issuer provides a periodic statement  disclosing that a $20 required minimum periodic payment is due on April  25. This minimum payment does not include the $20 minimum payment due on  March 25 or the $20 late payment fee imposed on March 26. On April 20,  the card issuer receives a $20 payment. No additional payments are  received during the April billing cycle. Because the card issuer has  received the required minimum periodic payment due on April 25 and  because Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing  a second late payment fee based on the consumer's failure to make the  $20 minimum payment due on March 25, the card issuer cannot impose a  late payment fee in these circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume that the required minimum periodic payment due on March  25 is $30.</p><p class="depth0">A. On March 25, the card issuer receives a check for $50, but the  check is returned for insufficient funds on March 27. Consistent with  Sec. Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer may  impose a late payment fee of $25 or a returned payment fee of $25.  However, Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing  both fees because those fees would be based on a single event or  transaction.</p><p class="depth0">B. Same facts as paragraph ii.A above except that that card issuer  receives the $50 check on March 27 and the check is returned for  insufficient funds on March 29. Consistent with Sec. Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer may impose a late  payment fee of $25 or a returned payment fee of $25. However, Sec.  1026.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing both fees  because those fees would be based on a single event or transaction. If  no payment is received on or before the next payment due date (April  25), Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(ii) does not prohibit the card issuer from  imposing a late payment fee.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Assume that the required minimum periodic payment due on July  25 is $30. On July 10, the card issuer receives a $50 payment, which is  not returned. On July 20, the card issuer receives a $100 payment, which  is returned for insufficient funds on July 24. Consistent with Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer may impose a  returned payment fee of $25. Nothing in Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(ii)  prohibits the imposition of this fee.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Assume that the credit limit for an account is $1,000 and that,  consistent with Sec. 1026.56, the consumer has affirmatively consented  to the payment of transactions that exceed the credit limit. On March  31, the balance on the account is $970 and the card issuer has not  received the $35 required minimum periodic payment due on March 25. On  that same date (March 31), a $70 transaction is charged to the account,  which increases the balance to $1,040. Consistent with Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer may impose a late  payment fee of $25 and an over-the-limit fee of $25. Section  1026.52(b)(2)(ii) does not prohibit the imposition of both fees because  those fees are based   on different events or transactions. No additional transactions are  charged to the account during the March, April, or May billing cycles.  If the account balance remains more than $35 above the credit limit on  April 26, the card issuer may impose an over-the-limit fee of $35  pursuant to Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), to the extent consistent with  Sec. 1026.56(j)(1). Furthermore, if the account balance remains more  than $35 above the credit limit on May 26, the card issuer may again  impose an over-the-limit fee of $35 pursuant to Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B), to the extent consistent with Sec. 1026.56(j)(1).  Thereafter, Sec. 1026.56(j)(1) does not permit the card issuer to  impose additional over-the-limit fees unless another over-the-limit  transaction occurs. However, if an over-the-limit transaction occurs  during the six billing cycles following the May billing cycle, the card  issuer may impose an over-the-limit fee of $35 pursuant to Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B).</p><p class="depth0">v. Assume that the credit limit for an account is $5,000 and that,  consistent with Sec. 1026.56, the consumer has affirmatively consented  to the payment of transactions that exceed the credit limit. On July 23,  the balance on the account is $4,950. On July 24, the card issuer  receives the $100 required minimum periodic payment due on July 25,  reducing the balance to $4,850. On July 26, a $75 transaction is charged  to the account, which increases the balance to $4,925. On July 27, the  $100 payment is returned for insufficient funds, increasing the balance  to $5,025. Consistent with Sec. Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and  (b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer may impose a returned payment fee of $25  or an over-the-limit fee of $25. However, Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(ii)  prohibits the card issuer from imposing both fees because those fees  would be based on a single event or transaction.</p><p class="depth0">vi. Assume that the required minimum periodic payment due on March  25 is $50. On March 20, the card issuer receives a check for $50, but  the check is returned for insufficient funds on March 22. Consistent  with Sec. Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer  may impose a returned payment fee of $25. On March 25, the card issuer  receives a second check for $50, but the check is returned for  insufficient funds on March 27. Consistent with Sec. Sec.  1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A), (b)(1)(ii)(B), and (b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer  may impose a late payment fee of $25 or a returned payment fee of $35.  However, Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing  both fees because those fees would be based on a single event or  transaction.</p><p class="depth0">vii. Assume that the required minimum periodic payment due on  February 25 is $100. On February 25, the card issuer receives a check  for $100. On March 3, the card issuer provides a periodic statement  disclosing that a $120 required minimum periodic payment is due on March  25. On March 4, the $100 check is returned to the card issuer for  insufficient funds. Consistent with Sec. Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A) and  (b)(2)(i)(A), the card issuer may impose a late payment fee of $25 or a  returned payment fee of $25 with respect to the $100 payment. However,  Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing both  fees because those fees would be based on a single event or transaction.  On March 20, the card issuer receives a $120 check, which is not  returned. No additional payments are received during the March billing  cycle. Because the card issuer has received the required minimum  periodic payment due on March 25 and because Sec. 1026.52(b)(2)(ii)  prohibits the card issuer from imposing a second fee based on the $100  payment that was returned for insufficient funds, the card issuer cannot  impose a late payment fee in these circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.53--Allocation of Payments</p><p class="depth0">1. Required minimum periodic payment. Section 1026.53 addresses the  allocation of amounts paid by the consumer in excess of the minimum  periodic payment required by the card issuer. Section 1026.53 does not  limit or otherwise address the card issuer's ability to determine,  consistent with applicable law and regulatory guidance, the amount of  the required minimum periodic payment or how that payment is allocated.  A card issuer may, but is not required to, allocate the required minimum  periodic payment consistent with the requirements in Sec. 1026.53 to  the extent consistent with other applicable law or regulatory guidance.</p><p class="depth0">2. Applicable rates and balances. Section 1026.53 permits a card  issuer to allocate an amount paid by the consumer in excess of the  required minimum periodic payment based on the annual percentage rates  and balances on the day the preceding billing cycle ends, on the day the  payment is credited to the account, or on any day in between those two  dates. The day used by the card issuer to determine the applicable  annual percentage rates and balances for purposes of Sec. 1026.53  generally must be consistent from billing cycle to billing cycle,  although the card issuer may adjust this day from time to time. For  example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that the billing cycles for a credit card account start on  the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month. On the  date the March billing cycle ends (March 31), the account has a purchase  balance of $500 at a promotional annual percentage rate of 5% and  another purchase balance of $200 at a non-promotional annual percentage  rate of 15%. On April 5, a $100 purchase to which the 15% rate applies  is charged to the account. On April 15, the promotional rate expires and  Sec. 1026.55(b)(1) permits the card issuer to increase the rate that  applies to the $500 balance from 5% to 18%. On April 25, the card issuer  credits to the account $400   paid by the consumer in excess of the required minimum periodic payment.  If the card issuer's practice is to allocate payments based on the rates  and balances on the last day of the prior billing cycle, the card issuer  would allocate the $400 payment to pay in full the $200 balance to which  the 15% rate applied on March 31 and then allocate the remaining $200 to  the $500 balance to which the 5% rate applied on March 31. In the  alternative, if the card issuer's practice is to allocate payments based  on the rates and balances on the day a payment is credited to the  account, the card issuer would allocate the $400 payment to the $500  balance to which the 18% rate applied on April 25.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Same facts as above except that, on April 25, the card issuer  credits to the account $750 paid by the consumer in excess of the  required minimum periodic payment. If the card issuer's practice is to  allocate payments based on the rates and balances on the last day of the  prior billing cycle, the card issuer would allocate the $750 payment to  pay in full the $200 balance to which the 15% rate applied on March 31  and the $500 balance to which the 5% rate applied on March 31 and then  allocate the remaining $50 to the $100 purchase made on April 5. In the  alternative, if the card issuer's practice is to allocate payments based  on the rates and balances on the day a payment is credited to the  account, the card issuer would allocate the $750 payment to pay in full  the $500 balance to which the 18% rate applied on April 25 and then  allocate the remaining $250 to the $300 balance to which the 15% rate  applied on April 25.</p><p class="depth0">3. Claims or defenses under Sec. 1026.12(c) and billing error  disputes under Sec. 1026.13. When a consumer has asserted a claim or  defense against the card issuer pursuant to Sec. 1026.12(c) or alleged  a billing error under Sec. 1026.13, the card issuer must apply the  consumer's payment in a manner that avoids or minimizes any reduction in  the amount subject to that claim, defense, or dispute. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that a credit card account has a $500 cash advance balance  at an annual percentage rate of 25% and a $1,000 purchase balance at an  annual percentage rate of 17%. Assume also that $200 of the cash advance  balance is subject to a claim or defense under Sec. 1026.12(c) or a  billing error dispute under Sec. 1026.13. If the consumer pays $900 in  excess of the required minimum periodic payment, the card issuer must  allocate $300 of the excess payment to pay in full the portion of the  cash advance balance that is not subject to the claim, defense, or  dispute and then allocate the remaining $600 to the $1,000 purchase  balance.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Same facts as above except that the consumer pays $1,400 in  excess of the required minimum periodic payment. The card issuer must  allocate $1,300 of the excess payment to pay in full the $300 cash  advance balance that is not subject to the claim, defense, or dispute  and the $1,000 purchase balance. If there are no new transactions or  other amounts to which the remaining $100 can be allocated, the card  issuer may apply that amount to the $200 cash advance balance that is  subject to the claim, defense, or dispute. However, if the card issuer  subsequently determines that a billing error occurred as asserted by the  consumer, the card issuer must credit the account for the disputed  amount and any related finance or other charges and send a correction  notice consistent with Sec. 1026.13(e).</p><p class="depth0">4. Balances with the same rate. When the same annual percentage rate  applies to more than one balance on an account and a different annual  percentage rate applies to at least one other balance on that account,  Sec. 1026.53 generally does not require that any particular method be  used when allocating among the balances with the same annual percentage  rate. Under these circumstances, a card issuer may treat the balances  with the same rate as a single balance or separate balances. See example  in comment 53-5.iv. However, when a balance on a credit card account is  subject to a deferred interest or similar program that provides that a  consumer will not be obligated to pay interest that accrues on the  balance if the balance is paid in full prior to the expiration of a  specified period of time, that balance must be treated as a balance with  an annual percentage rate of zero for purposes of Sec. 1026.53 during  that period of time. For example, if an account has a $1,000 purchase  balance and a $2,000 balance that is subject to a deferred interest  program that expires on July 1 and a 15% annual percentage rate applies  to both, the balances must be treated as balances with different rates  for purposes of Sec. 1026.53 until July 1. In addition, unless the card  issuer allocates amounts paid by the consumer in excess of the required  minimum periodic payment in the manner requested by the consumer  pursuant to Sec. 1026.53(b)(1)(ii), Sec. 1026.53(b)(1)(i) requires the  card issuer to apply any excess payments first to the $1,000 purchase  balance except during the last two billing cycles of the deferred  interest period (when it must be applied first to any remaining portion  of the $2,000 balance). See example in comment 53-5.v.</p><p class="depth0">5. Examples. For purposes of the following examples, assume that  none of the required minimum periodic payment is allocated to the  balances discussed (unless otherwise stated).</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that a credit card account has a cash advance balance of  $500 at an annual percentage rate of 20% and a purchase balance of  $1,500 at an annual percentage rate of   15% and that the consumer pays $800 in excess of the required minimum  periodic payment. Under Sec. 1026.53(a), the card issuer must allocate  $500 to pay off the cash advance balance and then allocate the remaining  $300 to the purchase balance.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume that a credit card account has a cash advance balance of  $500 at an annual percentage rate of 20% and a purchase balance of  $1,500 at an annual percentage rate of 15% and that the consumer pays  $400 in excess of the required minimum periodic payment. Under Sec.  1026.53(a), the card issuer must allocate the entire $400 to the cash  advance balance.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Assume that a credit card account has a cash advance balance of  $100 at an annual percentage rate of 20%, a purchase balance of $300 at  an annual percentage rate of 18%, and a $600 protected balance on which  the 12% annual percentage rate cannot be increased pursuant to Sec.  1026.55. If the consumer pays $500 in excess of the required minimum  periodic payment, Sec. 1026.53(a) requires the card issuer to allocate  $100 to pay off the cash advance balance, $300 to pay off the purchase  balance, and $100 to the protected balance.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Assume that a credit card account has a cash advance balance of  $500 at an annual percentage rate of 20%, a purchase balance of $1,000  at an annual percentage rate of 15%, and a transferred balance of $2,000  that was previously at a discounted annual percentage rate of 5% but is  now at an annual percentage rate of 15%. Assume also that the consumer  pays $800 in excess of the required minimum periodic payment. Under  Sec. 1026.53(a), the card issuer must allocate $500 to pay off the cash  advance balance and allocate the remaining $300 among the purchase  balance and the transferred balance in the manner the card issuer deems  appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">v. Assume that on January 1 a consumer uses a credit card account to  make a $1,200 purchase subject to a deferred interest program under  which interest accrues at an annual percentage rate of 15% but the  consumer will not be obligated to pay that interest if the balance is  paid in full on or before June 30. The billing cycles for this account  begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the  month. Each month from January through June, the consumer uses the  account to make $200 in purchases that are not subject to the deferred  interest program but are subject to the 15% rate.</p><p class="depth0">A. Each month from February through June, the consumer pays $400 in  excess of the required minimum periodic payment on the payment due date,  which is the twenty-fifth of the month. Any interest that accrues on the  purchases not subject to the deferred interest program is paid by the  required minimum periodic payment. The card issuer does not accept  requests from consumers regarding the allocation of excess payments  pursuant to Sec. 1026.53(b)(1)(ii). Thus, Sec. 1026.53(b)(1)(i)  requires the card issuer to allocate the $400 excess payments received  on February 25, March 25, and April 25 consistent with Sec. 1026.53(a).  In other words, the card issuer must allocate those payments as follows:  $200 to pay off the balance not subject to the deferred interest program  (which is subject to the 15% rate) and the remaining $200 to the  deferred interest balance (which is treated as a balance with a rate of  zero). However, Sec. 1026.53(b)(1)(i) requires the card issuer to  allocate the entire $400 excess payment received on May 25 to the  deferred interest balance. Similarly, Sec. 1026.53(b)(1)(i) requires  the card issuer to allocate the $400 excess payment received on June 25  as follows: $200 to the deferred interest balance (which pays that  balance in full) and the remaining $200 to the balance not subject to  the deferred interest program.</p><p class="depth0">B. Same facts as above, except that the card issuer does accept  requests from consumers regarding the allocation of excess payments  pursuant to Sec. 1026.53(b)(1)(ii). In addition, on April 25, the card  issuer receives an excess payment of $800, which the consumer requests  be allocated to pay off the $800 balance subject to the deferred  interest program. Section 1026.53(b)(1)(ii) permits the card issuer to  allocate the $800 excess payment in the manner requested by the  consumer.</p><p class="depth0">53(b) Special Rules</p><p class="depth0">1. Deferred interest and similar programs. Section 1026.53(b)(1)  applies to deferred interest or similar programs under which the  consumer is not obligated to pay interest that accrues on a balance if  that balance is paid in full prior to the expiration of a specified  period of time. For purposes of Sec. 1026.53(b)(1), ``deferred  interest'' has the same meaning as in Sec. 1026.16(h)(2) and associated  commentary. Section 1026.53(b)(1) applies regardless of whether the  consumer is required to make payments with respect to that balance  during the specified period. However, a grace period during which any  credit extended may be repaid without incurring a finance charge due to  a periodic interest rate is not a deferred interest or similar program  for purposes of Sec. 1026.53(b)(1). Similarly, a temporary annual  percentage rate of zero percent that applies for a specified period of  time consistent with Sec. 1026.55(b)(1) is not a deferred interest or  similar program for purposes of Sec. 1026.53(b)(1) unless the consumer  may be obligated to pay interest that accrues during the period if a  balance is not paid in full prior to expiration of the period.</p><p class="depth0">2. Expiration of deferred interest or similar program during billing  cycle. For purposes of   Sec. 1026.53(b)(1)(i), a billing cycle does not constitute one of the  two billing cycles immediately preceding expiration of a deferred  interest or similar program if the expiration date for the program  precedes the payment due date in that billing cycle. For example, assume  that a credit card account has a balance subject to a deferred interest  program that expires on June 15. Assume also that the billing cycles for  the account begin on the first day of the month and end on the last day  of the month and that the required minimum periodic payment is due on  the twenty-fifth day of the month. The card issuer does not accept  requests from consumers regarding the allocation of excess payments  pursuant to Sec. 1026.53(b)(1)(ii). Because the expiration date for the  deferred interest program (June 15) precedes the due date in the June  billing cycle (June 25), Sec. 1026.53(b)(1)(i) requires the card issuer  to allocate first to the deferred interest balance any amount paid by  the consumer in excess of the required minimum periodic payment during  the April and May billing cycles (as well as any amount paid by the  consumer before June 15). However, if the deferred interest program  expired on June 25 or on June 30 (or on any day in between), Sec.  1026.53(b)(1)(i) would apply only to the May and June billing cycles.</p><p class="depth0">3. Consumer requests. i. Generally. Section 1026.53(b) does not  require a card issuer to allocate amounts paid by the consumer in excess  of the required minimum periodic payment in the manner requested by the  consumer, provided that the card issuer instead allocates such amounts  consistent with Sec. 1026.53(a) or (b)(1)(i), as applicable. For  example, a card issuer may decline consumer requests regarding payment  allocation as a general matter or may decline such requests when a  consumer does not comply with requirements set by the card issuer (such  as submitting the request in writing or submitting the request prior to  or contemporaneously with submission of the payment), provided that  amounts paid by the consumer in excess of the required minimum periodic  payment are allocated consistent with Sec. 1026.53(a) or (b)(1)(i), as  applicable. Similarly, a card issuer that accepts requests pursuant to  Sec. 1026.53(b)(1)(ii) or (b)(2) must allocate amounts paid by a  consumer in excess of the required minimum periodic payment consistent  with Sec. 1026.53(a) or (b)(1)(i), as applicable, if the consumer does  not submit a request. Furthermore, a card issuer that accepts requests  pursuant to Sec. 1026.53(b)(1)(ii) or (b)(2) must allocate consistent  with Sec. 1026.53(a) or (b)(1)(i), as applicable, if the consumer  submits a request with which the card issuer cannot comply (such as a  request that contains a mathematical error), unless the consumer submits  an additional request with which the card issuer can comply.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Examples of consumer requests that satisfy Sec.  1026.53(b)(1)(ii) or (b)(2). A consumer has made a request for purposes  of Sec. 1026.53(b)(1)(ii) or (b)(2) if:</p><p class="depth0">A.

Eligibility for grace period. Section 1026.54 prohibits the  imposition of finance charges as a result of the loss of a grace period  in certain specified circumstances. Section 1026.54 does not require the  card issuer to provide a grace period. Furthermore, Sec. 1026.54 does  not prohibit the card issuer from placing limitations and conditions on  a grace period (such as limiting application of the grace period to  certain types of transactions or conditioning eligibility for the grace  period on certain transactions being paid in full by a particular date),  provided that such limitations and conditions are consistent with Sec.  1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(B) and Sec. 1026.54. Finally, Sec. 1026.54 does not  limit the imposition of finance charges with respect to a transaction  when the consumer is not eligible for a grace period on that transaction  at the end of the billing cycle in which the transaction occurred. For  example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that the billing cycles for a credit card account begin on  the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month and that  the payment due date is the twenty-fifth day of the month. Assume also  that, for purchases made during the current billing cycle (for purposes  of this example, the June billing cycle), the grace period applies from  the date of the purchase until the payment due date in the following  billing cycle (July 25), subject to two conditions. First, the purchase  balance at the end of the preceding billing cycle (the May billing  cycle) must have been paid in full by the payment due date in the  current billing cycle (June 25). Second, the purchase balance at the end  of the current billing cycle (the June billing cycle) must be paid in  full by the following payment due date (July 25). Finally, assume that  the consumer was eligible for a grace period at the start of the June  billing cycle (in other words, assume that the purchase balance for the  April billing cycle was paid in full by May 25).</p><p class="depth0">A. If the consumer pays the purchase balance for the May billing  cycle in full by June 25, then at the end of the June billing cycle the  consumer is eligible for a grace period with respect to purchases made  during that billing cycle. Therefore, Sec. 1026.54 limits the  imposition of finance charges with respect to purchases made during the  June billing cycle if the consumer does not pay the purchase balance for  the June billing cycle in full by July 25. Specifically, Sec.  1026.54(a)(1)(i) prohibits the card issuer from imposing finance charges  based on the purchase balance at the end of the June billing cycle for  days that precede the July billing cycle. Furthermore, Sec.  1026.54(a)(1)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing finance  charges based on any portion of the balance at the end of the June  billing cycle that was paid on or before July 25.</p><p class="depth0">B. If the consumer does not pay the purchase balance for the May  billing cycle in full by June 25, then the consumer is not eligible for  a grace period with respect to purchases made during the June billing  cycle at the end of that cycle. Therefore, Sec. 1026.54 does not limit  the imposition of finance charges with respect to purchases made during  the June billing cycle regardless of whether the consumer pays the  purchase balance for the June billing cycle in full by July 25.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Same facts as above except that the card issuer places only one  condition on the provision of a grace period for purchases made during  the current billing cycle (the June billing cycle): that the purchase  balance at the end of the current billing cycle (the June billing cycle)  be paid in full by the following payment due date (July 25). In these  circumstances, Sec. 1026.54 applies to the same extent as discussed in  paragraphs i.A and i.B above regardless of whether the purchase balance  for the April billing cycle was paid in full by May 25.</p><p class="depth0">2. Definition of grace period. For purposes of Sec. Sec.  1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(B) and 1026.54, a grace period is a period within which  any credit extended may be repaid without incurring a finance charge due  to a periodic interest rate. The following are not grace periods for  purposes of Sec. 1026.54:</p><p class="depth0">i. Deferred interest and similar programs. A deferred interest or  similar promotional program under which a consumer will not be obligated  to pay interest that accrues on a balance if that balance is paid in  full prior to the expiration of a specified period of time is not a  grace period for purposes of Sec. 1026.54. Thus, Sec. 1026.54 does not  prohibit the card issuer from charging accrued interest to an account  upon expiration of a deferred interest or similar program if the balance  was not paid in full prior to expiration (to the extent consistent with  Sec. 1026.55 and other applicable law and regulatory guidance).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Waivers or rebates of interest. As a general matter, a card  issuer has not provided a grace period with respect to transactions for  purposes of Sec. 1026.54 if, on an individualized basis (such as in  response to a consumer's request), the card issuer waives or rebates  finance charges that have accrued on transactions. In addition, when a  balance at the end of the preceding billing cycle is paid in full on or  before the payment due date in the current billing cycle, a card issuer  that waives or rebates trailing or residual interest accrued on that  balance or any other transactions during the current billing cycle has  not provided a grace period with respect to that balance or any other  transactions for   purposes of Sec. 1026.54. However, if the terms of the account provide  that all interest accrued on transactions will be waived or rebated if  the balance for those transactions at the end of the billing cycle  during which the transactions occurred is paid in full by the following  payment due date, the card issuer is providing a grace period with  respect to those transactions for purposes of Sec. 1026.54. For  example:</p><p class="depth0">A. Assume that the billing cycles for a credit card account begin on  the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month and that  the payment due date is the twenty-fifth day of the month. On March 31,  the balance on the account is $1,000 and the consumer is not eligible  for a grace period with respect to that balance because the balance at  the end of the prior billing cycle was not paid in full on March 25. On  April 15, the consumer uses the account for a $500 purchase. On April  25, the card issuer receives a payment of $1,000. On May 3, the card  issuer mails or delivers a periodic statement reflecting trailing or  residual interest that accrued on the $1,000 balance from April 1  through April 24 as well as interest that accrued on the $500 purchase  from April 15 through April 30. On May 10, the consumer requests that  the trailing or residual interest charges be waived and the card issuer  complies. By waiving these interest charges, the card issuer has not  provided a grace period with respect to the $1,000 balance or the $500  purchase.</p><p class="depth0">B. Same facts as in paragraph ii.A above except that the terms of  the account state that trailing or residual interest will be waived in  these circumstances or it is the card issuer's practice to waive  trailing or residual interest in these circumstances. By waiving these  interest charges, the card issuer has not provided a grace period with  respect to the $1,000 balance or the $500 purchase.</p><p class="depth0">C. Assume that the billing cycles for a credit card account begin on  the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month and that  the payment due date is the twenty-fifth day of the month. Assume also  that, for purchases made during the current billing cycle (for purposes  of this example, the June billing cycle), the terms of the account  provide that interest accrued on those purchases from the date of the  purchase until the payment due date in the following billing cycle (July  25) will be waived or rebated, subject to two conditions. First, the  purchase balance at the end of the preceding billing cycle (the May  billing cycle) must have been paid in full by the payment due date in  the current billing cycle (June 25). Second, the purchase balance at the  end of the current billing cycle (the June billing cycle) must be paid  in full by the following payment due date (July 25). Under these  circumstances, the card issuer is providing a grace period on purchases  for purposes of Sec. 1026.54. Therefore, assuming that the consumer was  eligible for this grace period at the start of the June billing cycle  (in other words, assuming that the purchase balance for the April  billing cycle was paid in full by May 25) and assuming that the consumer  pays the purchase balance for the May billing cycle in full by June 25,  Sec. 1026.54 applies to the imposition of finance charges with respect  to purchases made during the June billing cycle. Specifically, Sec.  1026.54(a)(1)(i) prohibits the card issuer from imposing finance charges  based on the purchase balance at the end of the June billing cycle for  days that precede the July billing cycle. Furthermore, Sec.  1026.54(a)(1)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing finance  charges based on any portion of the balance at the end of the June  billing cycle that was paid on or before July 25.</p><p class="depth0">3. Relationship to payment allocation requirements in Sec. 1026.53.  Card issuers must comply with the payment allocation requirements in  Sec. 1026.53 even if doing so will result in the loss of a grace  period.</p><p class="depth0">4. Prohibition on two-cycle balance computation method. When a  consumer ceases to be eligible for a grace period, Sec.  1026.54(a)(1)(i) prohibits the card issuer from computing the finance  charge using the two-cycle average daily balance computation method.  This method calculates the finance charge using a balance that is the  sum of the average daily balances for two billing cycles. The first  balance is for the current billing cycle, and is calculated by adding  the total balance (including or excluding new purchases and deducting  payments and credits) for each day in the billing cycle, and then  dividing by the number of days in the billing cycle. The second balance  is for the preceding billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">5. Prohibition on imposing finance charges on amounts paid within  grace period. When a balance on a credit card account is eligible for a  grace period and the card issuer receives payment for some but not all  of that balance prior to the expiration of the grace period, Sec.  1026.54(a)(1)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from imposing finance  charges on the portion of the balance paid. Card issuers are not  required to use a particular method to comply with Sec.  1026.54(a)(1)(ii). However, when Sec. 1026.54(a)(1)(ii) applies, a card  issuer is in compliance if, for example, it applies the consumer's  payment to the balance subject to the grace period at the end of the  preceding billing cycle (in a manner consistent with the payment  allocation requirements in Sec. 1026.53) and then calculates interest  charges based on the amount of the balance that remains unpaid.</p><p class="depth0">6. Examples. Assume that the annual percentage rate for purchases on  a credit card account is 15%. The billing cycle starts on the first day  of the month and ends on the   last day of the month. The payment due date for the account is the  twenty-fifth day of the month. For purchases made during the current  billing cycle, the card issuer provides a grace period from the date of  the purchase until the payment due date in the following billing cycle,  provided that the purchase balance at the end of the current billing  cycle is paid in full by the following payment due date. For purposes of  this example, assume that none of the required minimum periodic payment  is allocated to the balances discussed. During the March billing cycle,  the following transactions are charged to the account: A $100 purchase  on March 10, a $200 purchase on March 15, and a $300 purchase on March  20. On March 25, the purchase balance for the February billing cycle is  paid in full. Thus, for purposes of Sec. 1026.54, the consumer is  eligible for a grace period on the March purchases. At the end of the  March billing cycle (March 31), the consumer's total purchase balance is  $600 and the consumer will not be charged interest on that balance if it  is paid in full by the following due date (April 25).</p><p class="depth0">i. On April 10, a $150 purchase is charged to the account. On April  25, the card issuer receives $500 in excess of the required minimum  periodic payment. Section 1026.54(a)(1)(i) prohibits the card issuer  from reaching back and charging interest on any of the March  transactions from the date of the transaction through the end of the  March billing cycle (March 31). In these circumstances, the card issuer  may comply with Sec. 1026.54(a)(1)(ii) by applying the $500 excess  payment to the $600 purchase balance and then charging interest only on  the portion of the $600 purchase balance that remains unpaid ($100) from  the start of the April billing cycle (April 1) through the end of the  April billing cycle (April 30). In addition, the card issuer may charge  interest on the $150 purchase from the date of the transaction (April  10) through the end of the April billing cycle (April 31).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Same facts as in paragraph 6 above except that, on March 18, a  $250 cash advance is charged to the account at an annual percentage rate  of 25%. The card issuer's grace period does not apply to cash advances,  but the card issuer does provide a grace period on the March purchases  because the purchase balance for the February billing cycle is paid in  full on March 25. On April 25, the card issuer receives $600 in excess  of the required minimum periodic payment. As required by Sec. 1026.53,  the card issuer allocates the $600 excess payment first to the balance  with the highest annual percentage rate (the $250 cash advance balance).  Although Sec. 1026.54(a)(1)(i) prohibits the card issuer from charging  interest on the March purchases based on days in the March billing  cycle, the card issuer may charge interest on the $250 cash advance from  the date of the transaction (March 18) through April 24. In these  circumstances, the card issuer may comply with Sec. 1026.54(a)(1)(ii)  by applying the remainder of the excess payment ($350) to the $600  purchase balance and then charging interest only on the portion of the  $600 purchase balance that remains unpaid ($250) from the start of the  April billing cycle (April 1) through the end of the April billing cycle  (April 30).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Same facts as in paragraph 6 above except that the consumer  does not pay the balance for the February billing cycle in full on March  25 and therefore is not eligible for a grace period on the March  purchases. Under these circumstances, Sec. 1026.54 does not apply and  the card issuer may charge interest from the date of each transaction  through April 24 and interest on the remaining $100 from April 25  through the end of the April billing cycle (April 25).</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.55--Limitations on Increasing Annual Percentage Rates,</p><p class="depth0">Fees, and Charges</p><p class="depth0">55(a) General Rule</p><p class="depth0">1. Increase in rate, fee, or charge. Section 1026.55(a) prohibits  card issuers from increasing an annual percentage rate or any fee or  charge required to be disclosed under Sec. 1026.6(b)(2)(ii),  (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) on a credit card account unless specifically  permitted by one of the exceptions in Sec. 1026.55(b). Except as  specifically provided in Sec. 1026.55(b), this prohibition applies even  if the circumstances under which an increase will occur are disclosed in  advance. The following examples illustrate the general application of  Sec. 1026.55(a) and (b). Additional examples illustrating specific  aspects of the exceptions in Sec. 1026.55(b) are provided in the  commentary to those exceptions.</p><p class="depth0">i. Account-opening disclosure of non-variable rate for six months,  then variable rate. Assume that, at account opening on January 1 of year  one, a card issuer discloses that the annual percentage rate for  purchases is a non-variable rate of 15% and will apply for six months.  The card issuer also discloses that, after six months, the annual  percentage rate for purchases will be a variable rate that is currently  18% and will be adjusted quarterly by adding a margin of 8 percentage  points to a publicly-available index not under the card issuer's  control. Furthermore, the card issuer discloses that the annual  percentage rate for cash advances is the same variable rate that will  apply to purchases after six months. Finally, the card issuer discloses  that, to the extent consistent with Sec. 1026.55 and other applicable  law, a non-variable penalty rate of 30% may apply if the consumer makes  a late payment. The payment due date for the account is the twenty-fifth  day of the month and the required minimum periodic payments are applied  to accrued interest and fees but do not reduce the purchase and cash  advance balances.</p><p class="depth0">A. Change-in-terms rate increase for new transactions after first  year. On January 15 of year one, the consumer uses the account to make a  $2,000 purchase and a $500 cash advance. No other transactions are made  on the account. At the start of each quarter, the card issuer may adjust  the variable rate that applies to the $500 cash advance consistent with  changes in the index (pursuant to Sec. 1026.55(b)(2)). All required  minimum periodic payments are received on or before the payment due date  until May of year one, when the payment due on May 25 is received by the  creditor on May 28. At this time, the card issuer is prohibited by Sec.  1026.55 from increasing the rates that apply to the $2,000 purchase, the  $500 cash advance, or future purchases and cash advances. Six months  after account opening (July 1), the card issuer may begin to accrue  interest on the $2,000 purchase at the previously-disclosed variable  rate determined using an 8-point margin (pursuant to Sec.  1026.55(b)(1)). Because no other increases in rate were disclosed at  account opening, the card issuer may not subsequently increase the  variable rate that applies to the $2,000 purchase and the $500 cash  advance (except due to increases in the index pursuant to Sec.  1026.55(b)(2)). On November 16, the card issuer provides a notice  pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(c) informing the consumer of a new variable  rate that will apply on January 1 of year two (calculated using the same  index and an increased margin of 12 percentage points). On December 15,  the consumer makes a $100 purchase. On January 1 of year two, the card  issuer may increase the margin used to determine the variable rate that  applies to new purchases to 12 percentage points (pursuant to Sec.  1026.55(b)(3)). However, Sec. 1026.55(b)(3)(ii) does not permit the  card issuer to apply the variable rate determined using the 12-point  margin to the $2,000 purchase balance. Furthermore, although the $100  purchase occurred more than 14 days after provision of the Sec.  1026.9(c) notice, Sec. 1026.55(b)(3)(iii) does not permit the card  issuer to apply the variable rate determined using the 12-point margin  to that purchase because it occurred during the first year after account  opening. On January 15 of year two, the consumer makes a $300 purchase.  The card issuer may apply the variable rate determined using the 12- point margin to the $300 purchase.</p><p class="depth0">B. Account becomes more than 60 days delinquent during first year.  Same facts as above except that the required minimum periodic payment  due on May 25 of year one is not received by the card issuer until July  30 of year one. Because the card issuer received the required minimum  periodic payment more than 60 days after the payment due date, Sec.  1026.55(b)(4) permits the card issuer to increase the annual percentage  rate applicable to the $2,000 purchase, the $500 cash advance, and  future purchases and cash advances. However, Sec. 1026.55(b)(4)(i)  requires the card issuer to first comply with the notice requirements in  Sec. 1026.9(g). Thus, if the card issuer provided a Sec. 1026.9(g)  notice on July 25 stating that all rates on the account would be  increased to the 30% penalty rate, the card issuer could apply that rate  beginning on September 8 to all balances and to future transactions.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Account-opening disclosure of non-variable rate for six months,  then increased non-variable rate for six months, then variable rate;  change-in-terms rate increase for new transactions after first year.  Assume that, at account opening on January 1 of year one, a card issuer  discloses that the annual percentage rate for purchases will increase as  follows: A non-variable rate of 5% for six months; a non-variable rate  of 10% for an additional six months; and thereafter a variable rate that  is currently 15% and will be adjusted monthly by adding a margin of 5  percentage points to a publicly-available index not under the card  issuer's control. The payment due date for the account is the fifteenth  day of the month and the required minimum periodic payments are applied  to accrued interest and fees but do not reduce the purchase balance. On  January 15 of year one, the consumer uses the account to make a $1,500  purchase. Six months after account opening (July 1), the card issuer may  begin to accrue interest on the $1,500 purchase at the previously- disclosed 10% non-variable rate (pursuant to Sec. 1026.55(b)(1)). On  September 15, the consumer uses the account for a $700 purchase. On  November 16, the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to Sec.  1026.9(c) informing the consumer of a new variable rate that will apply  on January 1 of year two (calculated using the same index and an  increased margin of 8 percentage points). One year after account opening  (January 1 of year two), the card issuer may begin accruing interest on  the $2,200 purchase balance at the previously-disclosed variable rate  determined using a 5-point margin (pursuant to Sec. 1026.55(b)(1)).  Section 1026.55 does not permit the card issuer to apply the variable  rate determined using the 8-point margin to the $2,200 purchase balance.  Furthermore, Sec. 1026.55 does not permit the card issuer to  subsequently increase the variable rate determined using the 5-point  margin that applies to the $2,200 purchase balance (except due to  increases in the index pursuant to Sec. 1026.55(b)(2)). The card issuer  may, however, apply the variable rate determined using the 8-point  margin to purchases made on or after January 1 of year two (pursuant to  Sec. 1026.55(b)(3)).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Change-in-terms rate increase for new transactions after first  year; penalty rate increase after first year. Assume that, at account  opening on January 1 of year one, a card issuer discloses that the  annual percentage rate for purchases is a variable rate   determined by adding a margin of 6 percentage points to a publicly- available index outside of the card issuer's control. The card issuer  also discloses that, to the extent consistent with Sec. 1026.55 and  other applicable law, a non-variable penalty rate of 28% may apply if  the consumer makes a late payment. The due date for the account is the  fifteenth of the month. On May 30 of year two, the account has a  purchase balance of $1,000. On May 31, the card issuer provides a notice  pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(c) informing the consumer of a new variable  rate that will apply on July 16 for all purchases made on or after June  15 (calculated by using the same index and an increased margin of 8  percentage points). On June 14, the consumer makes a $500 purchase. On  June 15, the consumer makes a $200 purchase. On July 1, the card issuer  has not received the payment due on June 15 and provides the consumer  with a notice pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(g) stating that the 28% penalty  rate will apply as of August 15 to all transactions made on or after  July 16 and that, if the consumer becomes more than 60 days late, the  penalty rate will apply to all balances on the account. On July 17, the  consumer makes a $300 purchase.</p><p class="depth0">A. Account does not become more than 60 days delinquent. The payment  due on June 15 of year two is received on July 2. On July 16, Sec.  1026.55(b)(3)(ii) permits the card issuer to apply the variable rate  determined using the 8-point margin disclosed in the Sec. 1026.9(c)  notice to the $200 purchase made on June 15 but does not permit the card  issuer to apply this rate to the $1,500 purchase balance. On August 15,  Sec. 1026.55(b)(3)(ii) permits the card issuer to apply the 28% penalty  rate disclosed at account opening and in the Sec. 1026.9(g) notice to  the $300 purchase made on July 17 but does not permit the card issuer to  apply this rate to the $1,500 purchase balance (which remains at the  variable rate determined using the 6-point margin) or the $200 purchase  (which remains at the variable rate determined using the 8-point  margin).</p><p class="depth0">B. Account becomes more than 60 days delinquent after provision of  Sec. 1026.9(g) notice. Same facts as above except the payment due on  June 15 of year two has not been received by August 15. Section  1026.55(b)(4) permits the card issuer to apply the 28% penalty rate to  the $1,500 purchase balance and the $200 purchase because it has not  received the June 15 payment within 60 days after the due date. However,  in order to do so, Sec. 1026.55(b)(4)(i) requires the card issuer to  first provide an additional notice pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(g). This  notice must be sent no earlier than August 15, which is the first day  the account became more than 60 days' delinquent. If the notice is sent  on August 15, the card issuer may begin accruing interest on the $1,500  purchase balance and the $200 purchase at the 28% penalty rate beginning  on September 29.</p><p class="depth0">2. Relationship to grace period. Nothing in Sec. 1026.55 prohibits  a card issuer from assessing interest due to the loss of a grace period  to the extent consistent with Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(B) and Sec.  1026.54. In addition, a card issuer has not reduced an annual percentage  rate on a credit card account for purposes of Sec. 1026.55 if the card  issuer does not charge interest on a balance or a portion thereof based  on a payment received prior to the expiration of a grace period. For  example, if the annual percentage rate for purchases on an account is  15% but the card issuer does not charge any interest on a $500 purchase  balance because that balance was paid in full prior to the expiration of  the grace period, the card issuer has not reduced the 15% purchase rate  to 0% for purposes of Sec. 1026.55.</p><p class="depth0">55(b) Exceptions</p><p class="depth0">1. Exceptions not mutually exclusive. A card issuer generally may  increase an annual percentage rate or a fee or charge required to be  disclosed under Sec. 1026.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii)  pursuant to an exception set forth in Sec. 1026.55(b) even if that  increase would not be permitted under a different exception. For  example, although a card issuer cannot increase an annual percentage  rate pursuant to Sec. 1026.55(b)(1) unless that rate is provided for a  specified period of at least six months, the card issuer may increase an  annual percentage rate during a specified period due to an increase in  an index consistent with Sec. 1026.55(b)(2). Similarly, although Sec.  1026.55(b)(3) does not permit a card issuer to increase an annual  percentage rate during the first year after account opening, the card  issuer may increase the rate during the first year after account opening  pursuant to Sec. 1026.55(b)(4) if the required minimum periodic payment  is not received within 60 days after the due date. However, if Sec.  1026.55(b)(4)(ii) requires a card issuer to decrease the rate, fee, or  charge that applies to a balance while the account is subject to a  workout or temporary hardship arrangement or subject to 50 U.S.C. app.  527 or a similar Federal or state statute or regulation, the card issuer  may not impose a higher rate, fee, or charge on that balance pursuant to  Sec. 1026.55(b)(5) or (b)(6) upon completion or failure of the  arrangement or once 50 U.S.C. app. 527 or the similar Federal or state  statute or regulation no longer applies. For example, assume that, on  January 1, the annual percentage rate that applies to a $1,000 balance  is increased from 12% to 30% pursuant to Sec. 1026.55(b)(4). On  February 1, the rate on that balance is decreased from 30% to 15%  consistent with Sec. 1026.55(b)(5) as a part of a workout or temporary  hardship arrangement. On July 1, Sec. 1026.55(b)(4)(ii) requires the  card issuer to reduce the rate that applies to any remaining portion of  the $1,000 balance   from 15% to 12%. If the consumer subsequently completes or fails to  comply with the terms of the workout or temporary hardship arrangement,  the card issuer may not increase the 12% rate that applies to any  remaining portion of the $1,000 balance pursuant to Sec. 1026.55(b)(5).</p><p class="depth0">2. Relationship between exceptions in Sec. 1026.55(b) and notice  requirements in Sec. 1026.9. Nothing in Sec. 1026.55 alters the  requirements in Sec. 1026.9(c) and (g) that creditors provide written  notice at least 45 days prior to the effective date of certain increases  in annual percentage rates, fees, and charges.</p><p class="depth0">i. 14-day rule in Sec. 1026.55(b)(3)(ii). Although Sec.  1026.55(b)(3)(ii) permits a card issuer that discloses an increased rate  pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(c) or (g) to apply that rate to transactions  that occur more than 14 days after provision of the notice, the card  issuer cannot begin to accrue interest at the increased rate until that  increase goes into effect, consistent with Sec. 1026.9(c) or (g). For  example, if on May 1 a card issuer provides a notice pursuant to Sec.  1026.9(c) stating that a rate will increase from 15% to 18% on June 15,  Sec. 1026.55(b)(3)(ii) permits the card issuer to apply the 18% rate to  transactions that occur on or after May 16. However, neither Sec.  1026.55 nor Sec. 1026.9(c) permits the card issuer to begin accruing  interest at the 18% rate on those transactions until June 15. See  additional examples in comment 55(b)(3)-4.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Mid-cycle increases; application of balance computation methods.  Once an increased rate has gone into effect, the card issuer cannot  calculate interest charges based on that increased rate for days prior  to the effective date. Assume that, in the example in paragraph i above,  the billing cycles for the account begin on the first day of the month  and end on the last day of the month. If, for example, the card issuer  uses the average daily balance computation method, it cannot apply the  18% rate to the average daily balance for the entire June billing cycle  because that rate did not become effective until June 15. However, the  card issuer could apply the 15% rate to the average daily balance from  June 1 through June 14 and the 18% rate to the average daily balance  from June 15 through June 30. Similarly, if the card issuer that uses  the daily balance computation method, it could apply the 15% rate to the  daily balance for each day from June 1 through June 14 and the 18% rate  to the daily balance for each day from June 15 through June 30.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Mid-cycle increases; delayed implementation of increase. If  Sec. 1026.55(b) and Sec. 1026.9(b), (c), or (g) permit a card issuer  to apply an increased annual percentage rate, fee, or charge on a date  that is not the first day of a billing cycle, the card issuer may delay  application of the increased rate, fee, or charge until the first day of  the following billing cycle without relinquishing the ability to apply  that rate, fee, or charge. Thus, in the example in paragraphs i and ii  above, the card issuer could delay application of the 18% rate until the  start of the next billing cycle (April 1) without relinquishing its  ability to apply that rate under Sec. 1026.55(b)(3). Similarly, assume  that, at account opening on January 1, a card issuer discloses that a  non-variable annual percentage rate of 10% will apply to purchases for  six months and a non-variable rate of 15% will apply thereafter. The  first day of each billing cycle for the account is the fifteenth of the  month. If the six-month period expires on July 1, the card issuer may  delay application of the 15% rate until the start of the next billing  cycle (July 15) without relinquishing its ability to apply that rate  under Sec. 1026.55(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0">3. Application of a lower rate, fee, or charge. Nothing in Sec.  1026.55 prohibits a card issuer from lowering an annual percentage rate  or a fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec.  1026.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii). However, a card issuer  that does so cannot subsequently increase the rate, fee, or charge  unless permitted by one of the exceptions in Sec. 1026.55(b). The  following examples illustrate the application of the rule:</p><p class="depth0">i. Application of lower rate during first year. Assume that a card  issuer discloses at account opening on January 1 of year one that a non- variable annual percentage rate of 15% will apply to purchases. The card  issuer also discloses that, to the extent consistent with Sec. 1026.55  and other applicable law, a non-variable penalty rate of 30% may apply  if the consumer's required minimum periodic payment is received after  the payment due date, which is the tenth of the month. The required  minimum periodic payments are applied to accrued interest and fees but  do not reduce the purchase balance.</p><p class="depth0">A. Temporary rate returns to standard rate at expiration. On  September 30 of year one, the account has a purchase balance of $1,400  at the 15% rate. On October 1, the card issuer provides a notice  pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(c) informing the consumer that the rate for new  purchases will decrease to a non-variable rate of 5% for six months  (from October 1 through March 31 of year two) and that, beginning on  April 1 of year two, the rate for purchases will increase to the 15%  non-variable rate disclosed at account opening. The card issuer does not  apply the 5% rate to the $1,400 purchase balance. On October 14 of year  one, the consumer makes a $300 purchase at the 5% rate. On January 15 of  year two, the consumer makes a $150 purchase at the 5% rate. On April 1  of year two, the card issuer may begin accruing interest on the $300  purchase and the $150 purchase at 15% as disclosed in the Sec.  1026.9(c) notice (pursuant to Sec. 1026.55(b)(1)).</p><p class="depth0">B. Penalty rate increase. Same facts as above except that the  required minimum periodic payment due on November 10 of year   one is not received until November 15. Section 1026.55 does not permit  the card issuer to increase any annual percentage rate on the account at  this time. The card issuer may apply the 30% penalty rate to new  transactions beginning on April 1 of year two pursuant to Sec.  1026.55(b)(3) by providing a Sec. 1026.9(g) notice informing the  consumer of this increase no later than February 14 of year two. The  card issuer may not, however, apply the 30% penalty rate to the $1,400  purchase balance as of September 30 of year one, the $300 purchase on  October 15 of year one, or the $150 purchase on January 15 of year two.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Application of lower rate at end of first year. Assume that, at  account opening on January 1 of year one, a card issuer discloses that a  non-variable annual percentage rate of 15% will apply to purchases for  one year and discloses that, after the first year, the card issuer will  apply a variable rate that is currently 20% and is determined by adding  a margin of 10 percentage points to a publicly-available index not under  the card issuer's control. On December 31 of year one, the account has a  purchase balance of $3,000.</p><p class="depth0">A. Notice of extension of existing temporary rate provided  consistent with Sec. 1026.55(b)(1)(i). On December 15 of year one, the  card issuer provides a notice pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(c) informing the  consumer that the existing 15% rate will continue to apply until July 1  of year two. The notice further states that, on July 1 of year two, the  variable rate disclosed at account opening will apply. On July 1 of year  two, Sec. 1026.55(b)(1) permits the card issuer to apply that variable  rate to any remaining portion of the $3,000 balance and to new  transactions.</p><p class="depth0">B. Notice of new temporary rate provided consistent with Sec.  1026.55(b)(1)(i). On December 15 of year one, the card issuer provides a  notice pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(c) informing the consumer of a new  variable rate that will apply on January 1 of year two that is lower  than the variable rate disclosed at account opening. The new variable  rate is calculated using the same index and a reduced margin of 8  percentage points. The notice further states that, on July 1 of year  two, the margin will increase to the margin disclosed at account opening  (10 percentage points). On July 1 of year two, Sec. 1026.55(b)(1)  permits the card issuer to increase the margin used to determine the  variable rate that applies to new purchases to 10 percentage points and  to apply that rate to any remaining portion of the $3,000 purchase  balance.</p><p class="depth0">C. No notice provided. Same facts as in paragraph ii.B above except  that the card issuer does not send a notice on December 15 of year one.  Instead, on January 1 of year two, the card issuer lowers the margin  used to determine the variable rate to 8 percentage points and applies  that rate to the $3,000 purchase balance and to new purchases. Section  1026.9 does not require advance notice in these circumstances. However,  unless the account becomes more than 60 days' delinquent, Sec. 1026.55  does not permit the card issuer to subsequently increase the rate that  applies to the $3,000 purchase balance except due to increases in the  index (pursuant to Sec. 1026.55(b)(2)).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Application of lower rate after first year. Assume that a card  issuer discloses at account opening on January 1 of year one that a non- variable annual percentage rate of 10% will apply to purchases for one  year, after which that rate will increase to a non-variable rate of 15%.  The card issuer also discloses that, to the extent consistent with Sec.  1026.55 and other applicable law, a non-variable penalty rate of 30% may  apply if the consumer's required minimum periodic payment is received  after the payment due date, which is the tenth of the month. The  required minimum periodic payments are applied to accrued interest and  fees but do not reduce the purchase balance.</p><p class="depth0">A. Effect of 14-day period. On June 30 of year two, the account has  a purchase balance of $1,000 at the 15% rate. On July 1, the card issuer  provides a notice pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(c) informing the consumer  that the rate for new purchases will decrease to a non-variable rate of  5% for six months (from July 1 through December 31 of year two) and  that, beginning on January 1 of year three, the rate for purchases will  increase to a non-variable rate of 17%. On July 15 of year two, the  consumer makes a $200 purchase. On July 16, the consumer makes a $100  purchase. On January 1 of year three, the card issuer may begin accruing  interest on the $100 purchase at 17% (pursuant to Sec. 1026.55(b)(1)).  However, Sec. 1026.55(b)(1)(ii)(B) does not permit the card issuer to  apply the 17% rate to the $200 purchase because that transaction  occurred within 14 days after provision of the Sec. 1026.9(c) notice.  Instead, the card issuer may apply the 15% rate that applied to  purchases prior to provision of the Sec. 1026.9(c) notice. In addition,  if the card issuer applied the 5% rate to the $1,000 purchase balance,  Sec. 1026.55(b)(ii)(A) would not permit the card issuer to increase the  rate that applies to that balance on January 1 of year three to a rate  that is higher than 15% that previously applied to the balance.</p><p class="depth0">B. Penalty rate increase. Same facts as above except that the  required minimum periodic payment due on August 25 is received on August  30. At this time, Sec. 1026.55 does not permit the card issuer to  increase the annual percentage rates that apply to the $1,000 purchase  balance, the $200 purchase, or the $100 purchase. Instead, those rates  can only be increased as discussed in paragraph iii.A above. However, if  the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(c) or (g) on  September 1, Sec. 1026.55(b)(3) permits the card issuer to apply an  increased   rate (such as the 17% purchase rate or the 30% penalty rate) to  transactions that occur on or after September 16 beginning on October  16.</p><p class="depth0">C. Application of lower temporary rate during specified period. Same  facts as in paragraph iii above. On June 30 of year two, the account has  a purchase balance of $1,000 at the 15% non-variable rate. On July 1,  the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(c) informing  the consumer that the rate for the $1,000 balance and new purchases will  decrease to a non-variable rate of 12% for six months (from July 1  through December 31 of year two) and that, beginning on January 1 of  year three, the rate for purchases will increase to a variable rate that  is currently 20% and is determined by adding a margin of 10 percentage  points to a publicly-available index not under the card issuer's  control. On August 15 of year two, the consumer makes a $500 purchase.  On October 1, the card issuer provides another notice pursuant to Sec.  1026.9(c) informing the consumer that the rate for the $1,000 balance,  the $500 purchase, and new purchases will decrease to a non-variable  rate of 5% for six months (from October 1 of year two through March 31  of year three) and that, beginning on April 1 of year three, the rate  for purchases will increase to a variable rate that is currently 23% and  is determined by adding a margin of 13 percentage points to the  previously-disclosed index. On November 15 of year two, the consumer  makes a $300 purchase. On April 1 of year three, Sec. 1026.55 permits  the card issuer to begin accruing interest using the following rates for  any remaining portion of the following balances: The 15% non-variable  rate for the $1,000 balance; the variable rate determined using the 10- point margin for the $500 purchase; and the variable rate determined  using the 13-point margin for the $300 purchase.</p><p class="depth0">4. Date on which transaction occurred. When a transaction occurred  for purposes of Sec. 1026.55 is generally determined by the date of the  transaction. However, if a transaction that occurred within 14 days  after provision of a Sec. 1026.9(c) or (g) notice is not charged to the  account prior to the effective date of the change or increase, the card  issuer may treat the transaction as occurring more than 14 days after  provision of the notice for purposes of Sec. 1026.55. See example in  comment 55(b)(3)-4.iii.B. In addition, when a merchant places a ``hold''  on the available credit on an account for an estimated transaction  amount because the actual transaction amount will not be known until a  later date, the date of the transaction for purposes of Sec. 1026.55 is  the date on which the card issuer receives the actual transaction amount  from the merchant. See example in comment 55(b)(3)-4.iii.A.</p><p class="depth0">5. Category of transactions. For purposes of Sec. 1026.55, a  ``category of transactions'' is a type or group of transactions to which  an annual percentage rate applies that is different than the annual  percentage rate that applies to other transactions. Similarly, a type or  group of transactions is a ``category of transactions'' for purposes of  Sec. 1026.55 if a fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec.  1026.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) applies to those  transactions that is different than the fee or charge that applies to  other transactions. For example, purchase transactions, cash advance  transactions, and balance transfer transactions are separate categories  of transactions for purposes of Sec. 1026.55 if a card issuer applies  different annual percentage rates to each. Furthermore, if, for example,  the card issuer applies different annual percentage rates to different  types of purchase transactions (such as one rate for purchases of  gasoline or purchases over $100 and a different rate for all other  purchases), each type constitutes a separate category of transactions  for purposes of Sec. 1026.55.</p><p class="depth0">55(b)(1) Temporary rate, fee, or charge exception</p><p class="depth0">1. Relationship to Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(B). A card issuer that has  complied with the disclosure requirements in Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(B)  has also complied with the disclosure requirements in Sec.  1026.55(b)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">2. Period of six months or longer. A temporary annual percentage  rate, fee, or charge must apply for a specified period of six months or  longer before a card issuer can increase that rate, fee, or charge  pursuant to Sec. 1026.55(b)(1). The specified period must expire no  less than six months after the date on which the card issuer provides  the consumer with the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.55(b)(1)(i) or,  if later, the date on which the account can be used for transactions to  which the temporary rate, fee, or charge applies. Section 1026.55(b)(1)  does not prohibit a card issuer from limiting the application of a  temporary annual percentage rate, fee, or charge to a particular  category of transactions (such as to balance transfers or to purchases  over $100). However, in circumstances where the card issuer limits  application of the temporary rate, fee, or charge to a single  transaction, the specified period must expire no less than six months  after the date on which that transaction occurred. The following  examples illustrate the application of Sec. 1026.55(b)(1):</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that on January 1 a card issuer offers a consumer a 5%  annual percentage rate on purchases made during the months of January  through June. A 15% rate will apply thereafter. On February 15, a $500  purchase is charged to the account. On June 15, a $200 purchase is  charged to the account. On July   1, the card issuer may begin accruing interest at the 15% rate on the  $500 purchase and the $200 purchase (pursuant to Sec. 1026.55(b)(1)).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Same facts as above except that on January 1 the card issuer  offered the 5% rate on purchases beginning in the month of February.  Section 1026.55(b)(1) would not permit the card issuer to begin accruing  interest at the 15% rate on the $500 purchase and the $200 purchase  until August 1.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Assume that on October 31 of year one the annual percentage  rate for purchases is 17%. On November 1, the card issuer offers the  consumer a 0% rate for six months on purchases made during the months of  November and December. The 17% rate will apply thereafter. On November  15, a $500 purchase is charged to the account. On December 15, a $300  purchase is charged to the account. On January 15 of year two, a $150  purchase is charged to the account. Section 1026.55(b)(1) would not  permit the card issuer to begin accruing interest at the 17% rate on the  $500 purchase and the $300 purchase until May 1 of year two. However,  the card issuer may accrue interest at the 17% rate on the $150 purchase  beginning on January 15 of year two.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Assume that on June 1 of year one a card issuer offers a  consumer a 0% annual percentage rate for six months on the purchase of  an appliance. An 18% rate will apply thereafter. On September 1, a  $5,000 transaction is charged to the account for the purchase of an  appliance. Section 1026.55(b)(1) would not permit the card issuer to  begin accruing interest at the 18% rate on the $5,000 transaction until  March 1 of year two.</p><p class="depth0">v. Assume that on May 31 of year one the annual percentage rate for  purchases is 15%. On June 1, the card issuer offers the consumer a 5%  rate for six months on a balance transfer of at least $1,000. The 15%  rate will apply thereafter. On June 15, a $3,000 balance is transferred  to the account. On July 15, a $200 purchase is charged to the account.  Section 1026.55(b)(1) would not permit the card issuer to begin accruing  interest at the 15% rate on the $3,000 transferred balance until  December 15. However, the card issuer may accrue interest at the 15%  rate on the $200 purchase beginning on July 15.</p><p class="depth0">vi. Same facts as in paragraph v above except that the card issuer  offers the 5% rate for six months on all balance transfers of at least  $1,000 during the month of June and a $2,000 balance is transferred to  the account on June 30 (in addition to the $3,000 balance transfer on  June 15). Because the 5% rate is not limited to a particular  transaction, Sec. 1026.55(b)(1) permits the card issuer to begin  accruing interest on the $3,000 and $2,000 transferred balances on  December 1.</p><p class="depth0">vii. Assume that a card issuer discloses at account opening on  January 1 of year one that the annual fee for the account is $0 until  January 1 of year two, when the fee will increase to $50. On January 1  of year two, the card issuer may impose the $50 annual fee. However, the  issuer must also comply with the notice requirements in Sec. 1026.9(e).</p><p class="depth0">viii. Assume that a card issuer discloses at account opening on  January 1 of year one that the monthly maintenance fee for the account  is $0 until July 1 of year one, when the fee will increase to $10.  Beginning on July 1 of year one, the card issuer may impose the $10  monthly maintenance fee (to the extent consistent with Sec.  1026.52(a)).</p><p class="depth0">3. Deferred interest and similar promotional programs. i.  Application of Sec. 1026.55. The general prohibition in Sec.  1026.55(a) applies to the imposition of accrued interest upon the  expiration of a deferred interest or similar promotional program under  which the consumer is not obligated to pay interest that accrues on a  balance if that balance is paid in full prior to the expiration of a  specified period of time. However, the exception in Sec. 1026.55(b)(1)  also applies to these programs, provided that the specified period is  six months or longer and that, prior to the commencement of the period,  the card issuer discloses the length of the period and the rate at which  interest will accrue on the balance subject to the deferred interest or  similar program if that balance is not paid in full prior to expiration  of the period. See comment 9(c)(2)(v)-9. For purposes of Sec. 1026.55,  ``deferred interest'' has the same meaning as in Sec. 1026.16(h)(2) and  associated commentary.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Examples. A. Deferred interest offer at account opening. Assume  that, at account opening on January 1 of year one, the card issuer  discloses the following with respect to a deferred interest program:  ``No interest on purchases made in January of year one if paid in full  by December 31 of year one. If the balance is not paid in full by that  date, interest will be imposed from the transaction date at a rate of  20%.'' On January 15 of year one, the consumer makes a purchase of  $2,000. No other transactions are made on the account. The terms of the  deferred interest program require the consumer to make minimum periodic  payments with respect to the deferred interest balance, and the payment  due on April 1 is not received until April 10. Section 1026.55 does not  permit the card issuer to charge to the account interest that has  accrued on the $2,000 purchase at this time. Furthermore, if the  consumer pays the $2,000 purchase in full on or before December 31 of  year one, Sec. 1026.55 does not permit the card issuer to charge to the  account any interest that has accrued on that purchase. If, however, the  $2,000 purchase has not been paid in full by January 1 of year two,  Sec. 1026.55(b)(1) permits the card issuer to charge to the account the  interest accrued on that purchase at the 20% rate during year one (to  the extent consistent with other applicable law).</p><p class="depth0">B. Deferred interest offer after account opening. Assume that a card  issuer discloses at account opening on January 1 of year one that the  rate that applies to purchases is a variable annual percentage rate that  is currently 18% and will be adjusted quarterly by adding a margin of 8  percentage points to a publicly-available index not under the card  issuer's control. The card issuer also discloses that, to the extent  consistent with Sec. 1026.55 and other applicable law, a non-variable  penalty rate of 30% may apply if the consumer's required minimum  periodic payment is received after the payment due date, which is the  first of the month. On June 30 of year two, the consumer uses the  account for a $1,000 purchase in response to an offer of a deferred  interest program. Under the terms of this program, interest on the  purchase will accrue at the variable rate for purchases but the consumer  will not be obligated to pay that interest if the purchase is paid in  full by December 31 of year three. The terms of the deferred interest  program require the consumer to make minimum periodic payments with  respect to the deferred interest balance, and the payment due on  September 1 of year two is not received until September 6. Section  1026.55 does not permit the card issuer to charge to the account  interest that has accrued on the $1,000 purchase at this time.  Furthermore, if the consumer pays the $1,000 purchase in full on or  before December 31 of year three, Sec. 1026.55 does not permit the card  issuer to charge to the account any interest that has accrued on that  purchase. On December 31 of year three, the $1,000 purchase has been  paid in full. Under these circumstances, the card issuer may not charge  any interest accrued on the $1,000 purchase.</p><p class="depth0">C. Application of Sec. 1026.55(b)(4) to deferred interest programs.  Same facts as in paragraph ii.B above except that, on November 2 of year  two, the card issuer has not received the required minimum periodic  payments due on September 1, October 1, or November 1 of year two and  sends a Sec. 1026.9(c) or (g) notice stating that interest accrued on  the $1,000 purchase since June 30 of year two will be charged to the  account on December 17 of year two and thereafter interest will be  charged on the $1,000 purchase consistent with the variable rate for  purchases. On December 17 of year two, Sec. 1026.55(b)(4) permits the  card issuer to charge to the account interest accrued on the $1,000  purchase since June 30 of year two and Sec. 1026.55(b)(3) permits the  card issuer to begin charging interest on the $1,000 purchase consistent  with the variable rate for purchases. However, if the card issuer  receives the required minimum periodic payments due on January 1,  February 1, March 1, April 1, May 1, and June 1 of year three, Sec.  1026.55(b)(4)(ii) requires the card issuer to cease charging the account  for interest on the $1,000 purchase no later than the first day of the  next billing cycle. See comment 55(b)(4)-3.iii. However, Sec.  1026.55(b)(4)(ii) does not require the card issuer to waive or credit  the account for interest accrued on the $1,000 purchase since June 30 of  year two. If the $1,000 purchase is paid in full on December 31 of year  three, the card issuer is not permitted to charge to the account  interest accrued on the $1,000 purchase after June 1 of year three.</p><p class="depth0">4. Contingent or discretionary increases. Section 1026.55(b)(1)  permits a card issuer to increase a temporary annual percentage rate,  fee, or charge upon the expiration of a specified period of time.  However, Sec. 1026.55(b)(1) does not permit a card issuer to apply an  increased rate, fee, or charge that is contingent on a particular event  or occurrence or that may be applied at the card issuer's discretion.  The following examples illustrate rate increases that are not permitted  by Sec. 1026.55:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that a card issuer discloses at account opening on January  1 of year one that a non-variable annual percentage rate of 15% applies  to purchases but that all rates on an account may be increased to a non- variable penalty rate of 30% if a consumer's required minimum periodic  payment is received after the payment due date, which is the fifteenth  of the month. On March 1, the account has a $2,000 purchase balance. The  payment due on March 15 is not received until March 20. Section 1026.55  does not permit the card issuer to apply the 30% penalty rate to the  $2,000 purchase balance. However, pursuant to Sec. 1026.55(b)(3), the  card issuer could provide a Sec. 1026.9(c) or (g) notice on or before  November 16 informing the consumer that, on January 1 of year two, the  30% rate (or a different rate) will apply to new transactions.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume that a card issuer discloses at account opening on  January 1 of year one that a non-variable annual percentage rate of 5%  applies to transferred balances but that this rate will increase to a  non-variable rate of 18% if the consumer does not use the account for at  least $200 in purchases each billing cycle. On July 1, the consumer  transfers a balance of $4,000 to the account. During the October billing  cycle, the consumer uses the account for $150 in purchases. Section  1026.55 does not permit the card issuer to apply the 18% rate to the  $4,000 transferred balance or the $150 in purchases. However, pursuant  to Sec. 1026.55(b)(3), the card issuer could provide a Sec. 1026.9(c)  or (g) notice on or before November 16 informing the consumer that, on  January 1 of year two, the 18% rate (or a different rate) will apply to  new transactions.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Assume that a card issuer discloses at account opening on  January 1 of year one that the annual fee for the account is $10 but   may be increased to $50 if a consumer's required minimum periodic  payment is received after the payment due date, which is the fifteenth  of the month. The payment due on July 15 is not received until July 23.  Section 1026.55 does not permit the card issuer to impose the $50 annual  fee at this time. Furthermore, Sec. 1026.55(b)(3) does not permit the  card issuer to increase the $10 annual fee during the first year after  account opening. However, Sec. 1026.55(b)(3) does permit the card  issuer to impose the $50 fee (or a different fee) on January 1 of year  two if, on or before November 16 of year one, the issuer informs the  consumer of the increased fee consistent with Sec. 1026.9(c) and the  consumer does not reject that increase pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(h).</p><p class="depth0">iv. Assume that a card issuer discloses at account opening on  January 1 of year one that the annual fee for a credit card account  under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan is $0 but may  be increased to $100 if the consumer's balance in a deposit account  provided by the card issuer or its affiliate or subsidiary falls below  $5,000. On June 1 of year one, the balance on the deposit account is  $4,500. Section 1026.55 does not permit the card issuer to impose the  $100 annual fee at this time. Furthermore, Sec. 1026.55(b)(3) does not  permit the card issuer to increase the $0 annual fee during the first  year after account opening. However, Sec. 1026.55(b)(3) does permit the  card issuer to impose the $100 fee (or a different fee) on January 1 of  year two if, on or before November 16 of year one, the issuer informs  the consumer of the increased fee consistent with Sec. 1026.9(c) and  the consumer does not reject that increase pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(h).</p><p class="depth0">5. Application of increased fees and charges. Section  1026.55(b)(1)(ii) limits the ability of a card issuer to apply an  increased fee or charge to certain transactions. However, to the extent  consistent with Sec. 1026.55(b)(3), (c), and (d), a card issuer  generally is not prohibited from increasing a fee or charge that applies  to the account as a whole. See comments 55(c)(1)-3 and 55(d)-1.</p><p class="depth0">55(b)(2) Variable rate exception</p><p class="depth0">1. Increases due to increase in index. Section 1026.55(b)(2)  provides that an annual percentage rate that varies according to an  index that is not under the card issuer's control and is available to  the general public may be increased due to an increase in the index.  This section does not permit a card issuer to increase the rate by  changing the method used to determine a rate that varies with an index  (such as by increasing the margin), even if that change will not result  in an immediate increase. However, from time to time, a card issuer may  change the day on which index values are measured to determine changes  to the rate.</p><p class="depth0">2. Index not under card issuer's control. A card issuer may increase  a variable annual percentage rate pursuant to Sec. 1026.55(b)(2) only  if the increase is based on an index or indices outside the card  issuer's control. For purposes of Sec. 1026.55(b)(2), an index is under  the card issuer's control if:</p><p class="depth0">i. The index is the card issuer's own prime rate or cost of funds. A  card issuer is permitted, however, to use a published prime rate, such  as that in the Wall Street Journal, even if the card issuer's own prime  rate is one of several rates used to establish the published rate.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The variable rate is subject to a fixed minimum rate or similar  requirement that does not permit the variable rate to decrease  consistent with reductions in the index. A card issuer is permitted,  however, to establish a fixed maximum rate that does not permit the  variable rate to increase consistent with increases in an index. For  example, assume that, under the terms of an account, a variable rate  will be adjusted monthly by adding a margin of 5 percentage points to a  publicly-available index. When the account is opened, the index is 10%  and therefore the variable rate is 15%. If the terms of the account  provide that the variable rate will not decrease below 15% even if the  index decreases below 10%, the card issuer cannot increase that rate  pursuant to Sec. 1026.55(b)(2). However, Sec. 1026.55(b)(2) does not  prohibit the card issuer from providing in the terms of the account that  the variable rate will not increase above a certain amount (such as  20%).</p><p class="depth0">iii. The variable rate can be calculated based on any index value  during a period of time (such as the 90 days preceding the last day of a  billing cycle). A card issuer is permitted, however, to provide in the  terms of the account that the variable rate will be calculated based on  the average index value during a specified period. In the alternative,  the card issuer is permitted to provide in the terms of the account that  the variable rate will be calculated based on the index value on a  specific day (such as the last day of a billing cycle). For example,  assume that the terms of an account provide that a variable rate will be  adjusted at the beginning of each quarter by adding a margin of 7  percentage points to a publicly-available index. At account opening at  the beginning of the first quarter, the variable rate is 17% (based on  an index value of 10%). During the first quarter, the index varies  between 9.8% and 10.5% with an average value of 10.1%. On the last day  of the first quarter, the index value is 10.2%. At the beginning of the  second quarter, Sec. 1026.55(b)(2) does not permit the card issuer to  increase the variable rate to 17.5% based on the first quarter's maximum  index value of 10.5%. However, if the terms of the account provide that  the variable rate will be calculated based on the average index value  during the prior quarter, Sec. 1026.55(b)(2) permits the card issuer to  increase the variable   rate to 17.1% (based on the average index value of 10.1% during the  first quarter). In the alternative, if the terms of the account provide  that the variable rate will be calculated based on the index value on  the last day of the prior quarter, Sec. 1026.55(b)(2) permits the card  issuer to increase the variable rate to 17.2% (based on the index value  of 10.2% on the last day of the first quarter).</p><p class="depth0">3. Publicly available. The index or indices must be available to the  public. A publicly-available index need not be published in a newspaper,  but it must be one the consumer can independently obtain (by telephone,  for example) and use to verify the annual percentage rate applied to the  account.</p><p class="depth0">4. Changing a non-variable rate to a variable rate. Section 1026.55  generally prohibits a card issuer from changing a non-variable annual  percentage rate to a variable annual percentage rate because such a  change can result in an increase. However, a card issuer may change a  non-variable rate to a variable rate to the extent permitted by one of  the exceptions in Sec. 1026.55(b). For example, Sec. 1026.55(b)(1)  permits a card issuer to change a non-variable rate to a variable rate  upon expiration of a specified period of time. Similarly, following the  first year after the account is opened, Sec. 1026.55(b)(3) permits a  card issuer to change a non-variable rate to a variable rate with  respect to new transactions (after complying with the notice  requirements in Sec. 1026.9(b), (c) or (g)).</p><p class="depth0">5. Changing a variable rate to a non-variable rate. Nothing in Sec.  1026.55 prohibits a card issuer from changing a variable annual  percentage rate to an equal or lower non-variable rate. Whether the non- variable rate is equal to or lower than the variable rate is determined  at the time the card issuer provides the notice required by Sec.  1026.9(c). For example, assume that on March 1 a variable annual  percentage rate that is currently 15% applies to a balance of $2,000 and  the card issuer sends a notice pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(c) informing the  consumer that the variable rate will be converted to a non-variable rate  of 14% effective April 15. On April 15, the card issuer may apply the  14% non-variable rate to the $2,000 balance and to new transactions even  if the variable rate on March 2 or a later date was less than 14%.</p><p class="depth0">6. Substitution of index. A card issuer may change the index and  margin used to determine the annual percentage rate under Sec.  1026.55(b)(2) if the original index becomes unavailable, as long as  historical fluctuations in the original and replacement indices were  substantially similar, and as long as the replacement index and margin  will produce a rate similar to the rate that was in effect at the time  the original index became unavailable. If the replacement index is newly  established and therefore does not have any rate history, it may be used  if it produces a rate substantially similar to the rate in effect when  the original index became unavailable.</p><p class="depth0">55(b)(3) Advance notice exception</p><p class="depth0">1. Relationship to Sec. 1026.9(h). A card issuer may not increase a  fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec. 1026.6(b)(2)(ii),  (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) pursuant to Sec. 1026.55(b)(3) if the  consumer has rejected the increased fee or charge pursuant to Sec.  1026.9(h).</p><p class="depth0">2. Notice provided pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(b) and (c). If an  increased annual percentage rate, fee, or charge is disclosed pursuant  to both Sec. 1026.9(b) and (c), that rate, fee, or charge may only be  applied to transactions that occur more than 14 days after provision of  the Sec. 1026.9(c) notice as provided in Sec. 1026.55(b)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">3. Account opening. i. Multiple accounts with same card issuer. When  a consumer has a credit card account with a card issuer and the consumer  opens a new credit card account with the same card issuer (or its  affiliate or subsidiary), the opening of the new account constitutes the  opening of a credit card account for purposes of Sec.  1026.55(b)(3)(iii) if, more than 30 days after the new account is  opened, the consumer has the option to obtain additional extensions of  credit on each account. For example, assume that, on January 1 of year  one, a consumer opens a credit card account with a card issuer. On July  1 of year one, the consumer opens a second credit card account with that  card issuer. On July 15, a $1,000 balance is transferred from the first  account to the second account. The opening of the second account  constitutes the opening of a credit card account for purposes of Sec.  1026.55(b)(3)(iii) so long as, on August 1, the consumer has the option  to engage in transactions using either account. Under these  circumstances, the card issuer could not increase an annual percentage  rate or a fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec.  1026.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) on the second account  pursuant to Sec. 1026.55(b)(3) until July 1 of year two (which is one  year after the second account was opened).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Substitution, replacement or consolidation. A. Generally. A  credit card account has not been opened for purposes of Sec.  1026.55(b)(3)(iii) when a credit card account issued by a card issuer is  substituted, replaced, or consolidated with another credit card account  issued by the same card issuer (or its affiliate or subsidiary).  Circumstances in which a credit card account has not been opened for  purposes of Sec. 1026.55(b)(3)(iii) include when:</p><p class="depth0">1. A retail credit card account is replaced with a cobranded general  purpose credit card account that can be used at a wider number of  merchants;</p><p class="depth0">2. A credit card account is replaced with another credit card  account offering different features;</p><p class="depth0">3. A credit card account is consolidated or combined with one or  more other credit card accounts into a single credit card account; or</p><p class="depth0">4. A credit card account acquired through merger or acquisition is  replaced with a credit card account issued by the acquiring card issuer.</p><p class="depth0">B. Limitation. A card issuer that replaces or consolidates a credit  card account with another credit card account issued by the card issuer  (or its affiliate or subsidiary) may not increase an annual percentage  rate or a fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec.  1026.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) in a manner otherwise  prohibited by Sec. 1026.55. For example, assume that, on January 1 of  year one, a consumer opens a credit card account with an annual  percentage rate of 15% for purchases. On July 1 of year one, the account  is replaced with a credit card account that offers different features  (such as rewards on purchases). Under these circumstances, Sec.  1026.55(b)(3)(iii) prohibits the card issuer from increasing the annual  percentage rate for new purchases to a rate that is higher than 15%  pursuant to Sec. 1026.55(b)(3) until January 1 of year two (which is  one year after the first account was opened).</p><p class="depth0">4. Examples. i. Change-in-terms rate increase; temporary rate  increase; 14-day period. Assume that an account is opened on January 1  of year one. On March 14 of year two, the account has a purchase balance  of $2,000 at a non-variable annual percentage rate of 15%. On March 15,  the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(c) informing  the consumer that the rate for new purchases will increase to a non- variable rate of 18% on May 1. The notice further states that the 18%  rate will apply for six months (until November 1) and that thereafter  the card issuer will apply a variable rate that is currently 22% and is  determined by adding a margin of 12 percentage points to a publicly- available index that is not under the card issuer's control. The  fourteenth day after provision of the notice is March 29 and, on that  date, the consumer makes a $200 purchase. On March 30, the consumer  makes a $1,000 purchase. On May 1, the card issuer may begin accruing  interest at 18% on the $1,000 purchase made on March 30 (pursuant to  Sec. 1026.55(b)(3)). Section 1026.55(b)(3)(ii) does not permit the card  issuer to apply the 18% rate to the $2,200 purchase balance as of March  29 because that balance reflects transactions that occurred prior to or  within 14 days after the provision of the Sec. 1026.9(c) notice. After  six months (November 2), the card issuer may begin accruing interest on  any remaining portion of the $1,000 purchase at the previously-disclosed  variable rate determined using the 12-point margin (pursuant to Sec.  1026.55(b)(1) and (b)(3)).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Checks that access an account. Assume that a card issuer  discloses at account opening on January 1 of year one that the annual  percentage rate that applies to cash advances is a variable rate that is  currently 24% and will be adjusted quarterly by adding a margin of 14  percentage points to a publicly available index not under the card  issuer's control. On July 1 of year two, the card issuer provides checks  that access the account and, pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(b)(3)(i)(A),  discloses that a promotional rate of 15% will apply to credit extended  by use of the checks until January 1 of year three, after which the cash  advance rate determined using the 14-point margin will apply. On July 9  of year two, the consumer uses one of the checks to pay for a $500  transaction. Beginning on January 1 of year three, the card issuer may  apply the cash advance rate determined using the 14-point margin to any  remaining portion of the $500 transaction (pursuant to Sec.  1026.55(b)(1) and (b)(3)).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Hold on available credit; 14-day period. Assume that an account  is opened on January 1 of year one. On September 14 of year two, the  account has a purchase balance of $2,000 at a non-variable annual  percentage rate of 17%. On September 15, the card issuer provides a  notice pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(c) informing the consumer that the rate  for new purchases will increase to a non-variable rate of 20% on October  30. The fourteenth day after provision of the notice is September 29. On  September 28, the consumer uses the credit card to check into a hotel  and the hotel obtains authorization for a $1,000 hold on the account to  ensure there is adequate available credit to cover the anticipated cost  of the stay.</p><p class="depth0">A. The consumer checks out of the hotel on October 2. The actual  cost of the stay is $1,100 because of additional incidental costs. On  October 2, the hotel charges the $1,100 transaction to the account. For  purposes of Sec. 1026.55(b)(3), the transaction occurred on October 2.  Therefore, on October 30, Sec. 1026.55(b)(3) permits the card issuer to  apply the 20% rate to new purchases and to the $1,100 transaction.  However, Sec. 1026.55(b)(3)(ii) does not permit the card issuer to  apply the 20% rate to any remaining portion of the $2,000 purchase  balance.</p><p class="depth0">B. Same facts as above except that the consumer checks out of the  hotel on September 29. The actual cost of the stay is $250, but the  hotel does not charge this amount to the account until November 1. For  purposes of Sec. 1026.55(b)(3), the card issuer may treat the  transaction as occurring more than 14 days after provision of the Sec.  1026.9(c) notice (i.e., after September 29). Accordingly, the card  issuer may apply the 20% rate to the $250 transaction.</p><p class="depth0">5. Application of increased fees and charges. See comment 55(c)(1)- 3.</p><p class="depth0">6. Delayed implementation of increase. Section 1026.55(b)(3)(iii)  does not prohibit a card issuer from notifying a consumer of an increase  in an annual percentage rate, fee, or charge consistent with Sec.  1026.9(b), (c), or (g).   However, Sec. 1026.55(b)(3)(iii) does prohibit application of an  increased rate, fee, or charge during the first year after the account  is opened, while the account is closed, or while the card issuer does  not permit the consumer to use the account for new transactions. If  Sec. 1026.9(b), (c), or (g) permits a card issuer to apply an increased  rate, fee, or charge on a particular date and the account is closed on  that date or the card issuer does not permit the consumer to use the  account for new transactions on that date, the card issuer may delay  application of the increased rate, fee, or charge until the first day of  the following billing cycle without relinquishing the ability to apply  that rate, fee, or charge (assuming the increase is otherwise consistent  with Sec. 1026.55). See examples in comment 55(b)-2.iii. However, if  the account is closed or the card issuer does not permit the consumer to  use the account for new transactions on the first day of the following  billing cycle, then the card issuer must provide a new notice of the  increased rate, fee, or charge consistent with Sec. 1026.9(b), (c), or  (g).</p><p class="depth0">7. Date on which account may first be used by consumer to engage in  transactions. For purposes of Sec. 1026.55(b)(3)(iii), an account is  considered open no earlier than the date on which the account may first  be used by the consumer to engage in transactions. An account is  considered open for purposes of Sec. 1026.55(b)(3)(iii) on any date  that the card issuer may consider the account open for purposes of Sec.  1026.52(a)(1). See comment 52(a)(1)-4.</p><p class="depth0">55(b)(4) Delinquency exception</p><p class="depth0">1. Receipt of required minimum periodic payment within 60 days of  due date. Section 1026.55(b)(4) applies when a card issuer has not  received the consumer's required minimum periodic payment within 60 days  after the due date for that payment. In order to satisfy this condition,  a card issuer that requires monthly minimum payments generally must not  have received two consecutive required minimum periodic payments.  Whether a required minimum periodic payment has been received for  purposes of Sec. 1026.55(b)(4) depends on whether the amount received  is equal to or more than the first outstanding required minimum periodic  payment. For example, assume that the required minimum periodic payments  for a credit card account are due on the fifteenth day of the month. On  May 13, the card issuer has not received the $50 required minimum  periodic payment due on March 15 or the $150 required minimum periodic  payment due on April 15. The sixtieth day after the March 15 payment due  date is May 14. If the card issuer receives a $50 payment on May 14,  Sec. 1026.55(b)(4) does not apply because the payment is equal to the  required minimum periodic payment due on March 15 and therefore the  account is not more than 60 days delinquent. However, if the card issuer  instead received a $40 payment on May 14, Sec. 1026.55(b)(4) would  apply beginning on May 15 because the payment is less than the required  minimum periodic payment due on March 15. Furthermore, if the card  issuer received the $50 payment on May 15, Sec. 1026.55(b)(4) would  apply because the card issuer did not receive the required minimum  periodic payment due on March 15 within 60 days after the due date for  that payment.</p><p class="depth0">2. Relationship to Sec. 1026.9(g)(3)(i)(B). A card issuer that has  complied with the disclosure requirements in Sec. 1026.9(g)(3)(i)(B)  has also complied with the disclosure requirements in Sec.  1026.55(b)(4)(i).</p><p class="depth0">3. Reduction in rate pursuant to Sec. 1026.55(b)(4)(ii). Section  1026.55(b)(4)(ii) provides that, if the card issuer receives six  consecutive required minimum periodic payments on or before the payment  due date beginning with the first payment due following the effective  date of the increase, the card issuer must reduce any annual percentage  rate, fee, or charge increased pursuant to Sec. 1026.55(b)(4) to the  annual percentage rate, fee, or charge that applied prior to the  increase with respect to transactions that occurred prior to or within  14 days after provision of the Sec. 1026.9(c) or (g) notice.</p><p class="depth0">i. Six consecutive payments immediately following effective date of  increase. Section 1026.55(b)(4)(ii) does not apply if the card issuer  does not receive six consecutive required minimum periodic payments on  or before the payment due date beginning with the payment due  immediately following the effective date of the increase, even if, at  some later point in time, the card issuer receives six consecutive  required minimum periodic payments on or before the payment due date.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Rate, fee, or charge that does not exceed rate, fee, or charge  that applied before increase. Although Sec. 1026.55(b)(4)(ii) requires  the card issuer to reduce an annual percentage rate, fee, or charge  increased pursuant to Sec. 1026.55(b)(4) to the annual percentage rate,  fee, or charge that applied prior to the increase, this provision does  not prohibit the card issuer from applying an increased annual  percentage rate, fee, or charge consistent with any of the other  exceptions in Sec. 1026.55(b). For example, if a temporary rate applied  prior to the Sec. 1026.55(b)(4) increase and the temporary rate expired  before a reduction in rate pursuant to Sec. 1026.55(b)(4)(ii), the card  issuer may apply an increased rate to the extent consistent with Sec.  1026.55(b)(1). Similarly, if a variable rate applied prior to the Sec.  1026.55(b)(4) increase, the card issuer may apply any increase in that  variable rate to the extent consistent with Sec. 1026.55(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Delayed implementation of reduction. If Sec. 1026.55(b)(4)(ii)  requires a card issuer to reduce an annual percentage rate, fee, or   charge on a date that is not the first day of a billing cycle, the card  issuer may delay application of the reduced rate, fee, or charge until  the first day of the following billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  Sec. 1026.55(b)(4)(ii):</p><p class="depth0">A. Assume that the billing cycles for an account begin on the first  day of the month and end on the last day of the month and that the  required minimum periodic payments are due on the fifteenth day of the  month. Assume also that the account has a $5,000 purchase balance to  which a non-variable annual percentage rate of 15% applies. On May 16 of  year one, the card issuer has not received the required minimum periodic  payments due on the fifteenth day of March, April, or May and sends a  Sec. 1026.9(c) or (g) notice stating that the annual percentage rate  applicable to the $5,000 balance and to new transactions will increase  to 28% effective July 1. On July 1, Sec. 1026.55(b)(4) permits the card  issuer to apply the 28% rate to the $5,000 balance and to new  transactions. The card issuer receives the required minimum periodic  payments due on the fifteenth day of July, August, September, October,  November, and December. On January 1 of year two, Sec.  1026.55(b)(4)(ii) requires the card issuer to reduce the rate that  applies to any remaining portion of the $5,000 balance to 15%. The card  issuer is not required to reduce the rate that applies to any  transactions that occurred on or after May 31 (which is the fifteenth  day after provision of the Sec. 1026.9(c) or (g) notice).</p><p class="depth0">B. Same facts as paragraph iv.A above except that the 15% rate that  applied to the $5,000 balance prior to the Sec. 1026.55(b)(4) increase  was scheduled to increase to 20% on August 1 of year one (pursuant to  Sec. 1026.55(b)(1)). On January 1 of year two, Sec. 1026.55(b)(4)(ii)  requires the card issuer to reduce the rate that applies to any  remaining portion of the $5,000 balance to 20%.</p><p class="depth0">C. Same facts as paragraph iv.A above except that the 15% rate that  applied to the $5,000 balance prior to the Sec. 1026.55(b)(4) increase  was scheduled to increase to 20% on March 1 of year two (pursuant to  Sec. 1026.55(b)(1)). On January 1 of year two, Sec. 1026.55(b)(4)(ii)  requires the card issuer to reduce the rate that applies to any  remaining portion of the $5,000 balance to 15%.</p><p class="depth0">D. Same facts as paragraph iv.A above except that the 15% rate that  applied to the $5,000 balance prior to the Sec. 1026.55(b)(4) increase  was a variable rate that was determined by adding a margin of 10  percentage points to a publicly-available index not under the card  issuer's control (consistent with Sec. 1026.55(b)(2)). On January 1 of  year two, Sec. 1026.55(b)(4)(ii) requires the card issuer to reduce the  rate that applies to any remaining portion of the $5,000 balance to the  variable rate determined using the 10-point margin.</p><p class="depth0">E.

Scope of exception. Nothing in Sec. 1026.55(b)(5) permits a card  issuer to alter the requirements of Sec. 1026.55 pursuant to a workout  or temporary hardship arrangement. For example, a card issuer cannot  increase an annual percentage rate or a fee or charge required to be  disclosed under Sec. 1026.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii)  pursuant to a workout or temporary hardship arrangement unless otherwise  permitted by Sec. 1026.55. In addition, a card issuer cannot require  the consumer to make payments with respect to a protected balance that  exceed the payments permitted under Sec. 1026.55(c).</p><p class="depth0">2. Relationship to Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(D). A card issuer that has  complied with the disclosure requirements in Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(D)  has also complied with the disclosure requirements in Sec.  1026.55(b)(5)(i). See comment 9(c)(2)(v)-10. Thus, although the  disclosures required by Sec. 1026.55(b)(5)(i) must generally be  provided in writing prior to commencement of the arrangement, a card  issuer may comply with Sec. 1026.55(b)(5)(i) by complying with Sec.  1026.9(c)(2)(v)(D), which states that the disclosure of the terms of the  arrangement may be made orally by telephone, provided that the card  issuer mails or delivers a written disclosure of the terms of the  arrangement to the consumer as soon as reasonably practicable after the  oral disclosure is provided.</p><p class="depth0">3. Rate, fee, or charge that does not exceed rate, fee, or charge  that applied before workout or temporary hardship arrangement. Upon the  completion or failure of a workout or temporary hardship arrangement,  Sec. 1026.55(b)(5)(ii) prohibits the card issuer from applying to any  transactions that occurred prior to commencement of the arrangement an  annual percentage rate, fee, or charge that exceeds the annual  percentage rate, fee, or charge that applied to those transactions prior  to commencement of the arrangement. However, this provision does not  prohibit the card issuer from applying an increased annual percentage  rate, fee, or charge upon completion or failure of the arrangement, to  the extent consistent with any of the other exceptions in Sec.  1026.55(b). For example, if a temporary rate applied prior to the  arrangement and that rate expired during the arrangement, the card  issuer may apply an increased rate upon completion or failure of the  arrangement to the extent consistent with Sec. 1026.55(b)(1).  Similarly, if a variable rate applied prior to the arrangement, the card  issuer may apply   any increase in that variable rate upon completion or failure of the  arrangement to the extent consistent with Sec. 1026.55(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">4. Examples. i. Assume that an account is subject to a $50 annual  fee and that, consistent with Sec. 1026.55(b)(4), the margin used to  determine a variable annual percentage rate that applies to a $5,000  balance is increased from 5 percentage points to 15 percentage points.  Assume also that the card issuer and the consumer subsequently agree to  a workout arrangement that reduces the annual fee to $0 and reduces the  margin back to 5 points on the condition that the consumer pay a  specified amount by the payment due date each month. If the consumer  does not pay the agreed-upon amount by the payment due date, Sec.  1026.55(b)(5) permits the card issuer to increase the annual fee to $50  and increase the margin for the variable rate that applies to the $5,000  balance up to 15 percentage points.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume that a consumer fails to make four consecutive monthly  minimum payments totaling $480 on a consumer credit card account with a  balance of $6,000 and that, consistent with Sec. 1026.55(b)(4), the  annual percentage rate that applies to that balance is increased from a  non-variable rate of 15% to a non-variable penalty rate of 30%. Assume  also that the card issuer and the consumer subsequently agree to a  temporary hardship arrangement that reduces all rates on the account to  0% on the condition that the consumer pay an amount by the payment due  date each month that is sufficient to cure the $480 delinquency within  six months. If the consumer pays the agreed-upon amount by the payment  due date during the six-month period and cures the delinquency, Sec.  1026.55(b)(5) permits the card issuer to increase the rate that applies  to any remaining portion of the $6,000 balance to 15% or any other rate  up to the 30% penalty rate.</p><p class="depth0">55(b)(6) Servicemembers Civil Relief Act exception</p><p class="depth0">1. Rate, fee, or charge that does not exceed rate, fee, or charge  that applied before decrease. When a rate or a fee or charge subject to  Sec. 1026.55 has been decreased pursuant to 50 U.S.C. app. 527 or a  similar Federal or state statute or regulation, Sec. 1026.55(b)(6)  permits the card issuer to increase the rate, fee, or charge once 50  U.S.C. app. 527 or the similar statute or regulation no longer applies.  However, Sec. 1026.55(b)(6) prohibits the card issuer from applying to  any transactions that occurred prior to the decrease a rate, fee, or  charge that exceeds the rate, fee, or charge that applied to those  transactions prior to the decrease (except to the extent permitted by  one of the other exceptions in Sec. 1026.55(b)). For example, if a  temporary rate applied prior to a decrease in rate pursuant to 50 U.S.C.  app. 527 and the temporary rate expired during the period that 50 U.S.C.  app. 527 applied to the account, the card issuer may apply an increased  rate once 50 U.S.C. app. 527 no longer applies to the extent consistent  with Sec. 1026.55(b)(1). Similarly, if a variable rate applied prior to  a decrease in rate pursuant to 50 U.S.C. app. 527, the card issuer may  apply any increase in that variable rate once 50 U.S.C. app. 527 no  longer applies to the extent consistent with Sec. 1026.55(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">2. Decreases in rates, fees, and charges to amounts consistent with  50 U.S.C. app. 527 or similar statute or regulation. If a card issuer  deceases an annual percentage rate or a fee or charge subject to Sec.  1026.55 pursuant to 50 U.S.C. app. 527 or a similar Federal or state  statute or regulation and if the card issuer also decreases other rates,  fees, or charges (such as the rate that applies to new transactions) to  amounts that are consistent with 50 U.S.C. app. 527 or a similar Federal  or state statute or regulation, the card issuer may increase those  rates, fees, and charges consistent with Sec. 1026.55(b)(6).</p><p class="depth0">3. Example. Assume that on December 31 of year one the annual  percentage rate that applies to a $5,000 balance on a credit card  account is a variable rate that is determined by adding a margin of 10  percentage points to a publicly-available index that is not under the  card issuer's control. The account is also subject to a monthly  maintenance fee of $10. On January 1 of year two, the card issuer  reduces the rate that applies to the $5,000 balance to a non-variable  rate of 6% and ceases to impose the $10 monthly maintenance fee and  other fees (including late payment fees) pursuant to 50 U.S.C. app. 527.  The card issuer also decreases the rate that applies to new transactions  to 6%. During year two, the consumer uses the account for $1,000 in new  transactions. On January 1 of year three, 50 U.S.C. app. 527 ceases to  apply and the card issuer provides a notice pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(c)  informing the consumer that on February 15 of year three the variable  rate determined using the 10-point margin will apply to any remaining  portion of the $5,000 balance and to any remaining portion of the $1,000  balance. The notice also states that the $10 monthly maintenance fee and  other fees (including late payment fees) will resume on February 15 of  year three. Consistent with Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(iv)(B), the card issuer  is not required to provide a right to reject in these circumstances. On  February 15 of year three, Sec. 1026.55(b)(6) permits the card issuer  to begin accruing interest on any remaining portion of the $5,000 and  $1,000 balances at the variable rate determined using the 10-point  margin and to resume imposing the $10 monthly maintenance fee and other  fees (including late payment fees).</p><p class="depth0">55(c) Treatment of protected balances</p><p class="depth0">55(c)(1) Definition of protected balance</p><p class="depth0">1. Example of protected balance. Assume that, on March 15 of year  two, an account has a purchase balance of $1,000 at a non-variable  annual percentage rate of 12% and that, on March 16, the card issuer  sends a notice pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(c) informing the consumer that  the annual percentage rate for new purchases will increase to a non- variable rate of 15% on May 1. The fourteenth day after provision of the  notice is March 29. On March 29, the consumer makes a $100 purchase. On  March 30, the consumer makes a $150 purchase. On May 1, Sec.  1026.55(b)(3)(ii) permits the card issuer to begin accruing interest at  15% on the $150 purchase made on March 30 but does not permit the card  issuer to apply that 15% rate to the $1,100 purchase balance as of March  29. Accordingly, the protected balance for purposes of Sec. 1026.55(c)  is the $1,100 purchase balance as of March 29. The $150 purchase made on  March 30 is not part of the protected balance.</p><p class="depth0">2. First year after account opening. Section 1026.55(c) applies to  amounts owed for a category of transactions to which an increased annual  percentage rate or an increased fee or charge cannot be applied after  the rate, fee, or charge for that category of transactions has been  increased pursuant to Sec. 1026.55(b)(3). Because Sec.  1026.55(b)(3)(iii) does not permit a card issuer to increase an annual  percentage rate or a fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec.  1026.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) during the first year  after account opening, Sec. 1026.55(c) does not apply to balances  during the first year after account opening.</p><p class="depth0">3. Increased fees and charges. Except as provided in Sec.  1026.55(b)(3)(iii), Sec. 1026.55(b)(3) permits a card issuer to  increase a fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec.  1026.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) after complying with the  applicable notice requirements in Sec. 1026.9(b) or (c), provided that  the increased fee or charge is not applied to a protected balance. To  the extent consistent with Sec. 1026.55(b)(3)(iii), a card issuer is  not prohibited from increasing a fee or charge that applies to the  account as a whole or to balances other than the protected balance. For  example, after the first year following account opening, a card issuer  generally may add or increase an annual or a monthly maintenance fee for  an account after complying with the notice requirements in Sec.  1026.9(c), including notifying the consumer of the right to reject the  new or increased fee under Sec. 1026.9(h). However, except as otherwise  provided in Sec. 1026.55(b), an increased fee or charge cannot be  applied to an account while the account is closed or while the card  issuer does not permit the consumer to use the account for new  transactions. See Sec. 1026.55(b)(3)(iii); see also Sec. Sec.  1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(3) and 1026.55(d)(1). Furthermore, if the consumer  rejects an increase in a fee or charge pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(h), the  card issuer is prohibited from applying the increased fee or charge to  the account and from imposing any other fee or charge solely as a result  of the rejection. See Sec. 1026.9(h)(2)(i) and (ii); comment  9(h)(2)(ii)-2.</p><p class="depth0">4. Changing balance computation method. Nothing in Sec. 1026.55  prohibits a card issuer from changing the balance computation method  that applies to new transactions as well as protected balances.</p><p class="depth0">55(c)(2) Repayment of protected balance</p><p class="depth0">1. No less beneficial to the consumer. A card issuer may provide a  method of repaying the protected balance that is different from the  methods listed in Sec. 1026.55(c)(2) so long as the method used is no  less beneficial to the consumer than one of the listed methods. A method  is no less beneficial to the consumer if the method results in a  required minimum periodic payment that is equal to or less than a  minimum payment calculated using the method for the account before the  effective date of the increase. Similarly, a method is no less  beneficial to the consumer if the method amortizes the balance in five  years or longer or if the method results in a required minimum periodic  payment that is equal to or less than a minimum payment calculated  consistent with Sec. 1026.55(c)(2)(iii). For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. If at account opening the cardholder agreement stated that the  required minimum periodic payment would be either the total of fees and  interest charges plus 1% of the total amount owed or $20 (whichever is  greater), the card issuer may require the consumer to make a minimum  payment of $20 even if doing so would pay off the balance in less than  five years or constitute more than 2% of the balance plus fees and  interest charges.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A card issuer could increase the percentage of the balance  included in the required minimum periodic payment from 2% to 5% so long  as doing so would not result in amortization of the balance in less than  five years.</p><p class="depth0">iii. A card issuer could require the consumer to make a required  minimum periodic payment that amortizes the balance in four years so  long as doing so would not more than double the percentage of the  balance included in the minimum payment prior to the date on which the  increased annual percentage rate, fee, or charge became effective.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 55(c)(2)(ii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Amortization period starting from effective date of increase.  Section 1026.55(c)(2)(ii) provides for an amortization period for the  protected balance of no less than five years,   starting from the date on which the increased annual percentage rate or  fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec. 1026.6(b)(2)(ii),  (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) became effective. A card issuer is not  required to recalculate the required minimum periodic payment for the  protected balance if, during the amortization period, that balance is  reduced as a result of the allocation of payments by the consumer in  excess of that minimum payment consistent with Sec. 1026.53 or any  other practice permitted by these rules and other applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">2. Amortization when applicable rate is variable. If the annual  percentage rate that applies to the protected balance varies with an  index, the card issuer may adjust the interest charges included in the  required minimum periodic payment for that balance accordingly in order  to ensure that the balance is amortized in five years. For example,  assume that a variable rate that is currently 15% applies to a protected  balance and that, in order to amortize that balance in five years, the  required minimum periodic payment must include a specific amount of  principal plus all accrued interest charges. If the 15% variable rate  increases due to an increase in the index, the creditor may increase the  required minimum periodic payment to include the additional interest  charges.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 55(c)(2)(iii)</p><p class="depth0">1. Portion of required minimum periodic payment on other balances.  Section 1026.55(c)(2)(iii) addresses the portion of the required minimum  periodic payment based on the protected balance. Section  1026.55(c)(2)(iii) does not limit or otherwise address the card issuer's  ability to determine the portion of the required minimum periodic  payment based on other balances on the account or the card issuer's  ability to apply that portion of the minimum payment to the balances on  the account.</p><p class="depth0">2. Example. Assume that the method used by a card issuer to  calculate the required minimum periodic payment for a credit card  account requires the consumer to pay either the total of fees and  accrued interest charges plus 2% of the total amount owed or $50,  whichever is greater. Assume also that the account has a purchase  balance of $2,000 at an annual percentage rate of 15% and a cash advance  balance of $500 at an annual percentage rate of 20% and that the card  issuer increases the rate for purchases to 18% but does not increase the  rate for cash advances. Under Sec. 1026.55(c)(2)(iii), the card issuer  may require the consumer to pay fees and interest plus 4% of the $2,000  purchase balance. Section 1026.55(c)(2)(iii) does not limit the card  issuer's ability to increase the portion of the required minimum  periodic payment that is based on the cash advance balance.</p><p class="depth0">55(d) Continuing application</p><p class="depth0">1. Closed accounts. If a credit card account under an open-end (not  home-secured) consumer credit plan with a balance is closed, Sec.  1026.55 continues to apply to that balance. For example, if a card  issuer or a consumer closes a credit card account with a balance, Sec.  1026.55(d)(1) prohibits the card issuer from increasing the annual  percentage rate that applies to that balance or imposing a periodic fee  based solely on that balance that was not charged before the account was  closed (such as a closed account fee) unless permitted by one of the  exceptions in Sec. 1026.55(b).</p><p class="depth0">2. Acquired accounts. If, through merger or acquisition (for  example), a card issuer acquires a credit card account under an open-end  (not home-secured) consumer credit plan with a balance, Sec. 1026.55  continues to apply to that balance. For example, if a credit card  account has a $1,000 purchase balance with an annual percentage rate of  15% and the card issuer that acquires that account applies an 18% rate  to purchases, Sec. 1026.55(d)(1) prohibits the card issuer from  applying the 18% rate to the $1,000 balance unless permitted by one of  the exceptions in Sec. 1026.55(b).</p><p class="depth0">3. Balance transfers. i. Between accounts issued by the same  creditor. If a balance is transferred from a credit card account under  an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan issued by a creditor  to another credit account issued by the same creditor or its affiliate  or subsidiary, Sec. 1026.55 continues to apply to that balance. For  example, if a credit card account has a $2,000 purchase balance with an  annual percentage rate of 15% and that balance is transferred to another  credit card account issued by the same creditor that applies an 18% rate  to purchases, Sec. 1026.55(d)(2) prohibits the creditor from applying  the 18% rate to the $2,000 balance unless permitted by one of the  exceptions in Sec. 1026.55(b). However, the creditor would not  generally be prohibited from charging a new periodic fee (such as an  annual fee) on the second account so long as the fee is not based solely  on the $2,000 balance and the creditor has notified the consumer of the  fee either by providing written notice 45 days before imposing the fee  pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(c) or by providing account-opening disclosures  pursuant to Sec. 1026.6(b). See also Sec. 1026.55(b)(3)(iii); comment  55(b)(3)-3; comment 5(b)(1)(i)-6. Additional circumstances in which a  balance is considered transferred for purposes of Sec. 1026.55(d)(2)  include when:</p><p class="depth0">A. A retail credit card account with a balance is replaced or  substituted with a cobranded general purpose credit card account that  can be used with a broader merchant base;</p><p class="depth0">B. A credit card account with a balance is replaced or substituted  with another credit card account offering different features;</p><p class="depth0">C. A credit card account with a balance is consolidated or combined  with one or more other credit card accounts into a single credit card  account; and</p><p class="depth0">D. A credit card account is replaced or substituted with a line of  credit that can be accessed solely by an account number.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Between accounts issued by different creditors. If a balance is  transferred to a credit card account under an open-end (not home- secured) consumer credit plan issued by a creditor from a credit card  account issued by a different creditor or an institution that is not an  affiliate or subsidiary of the creditor that issued the account to which  the balance is transferred, Sec. 1026.55(d)(2) does not prohibit the  creditor to which the balance is transferred from applying its account  terms to that balance, provided that those terms comply with this part.  For example, if a credit card account issued by creditor A has a $1,000  purchase balance at an annual percentage rate of 15% and the consumer  transfers that balance to a credit card account with a purchase rate of  17% issued by creditor B, creditor B may apply the 17% rate to the  $1,000 balance. However, creditor B may not subsequently increase the  rate on that balance unless permitted by one of the exceptions in Sec.  1026.55(b).</p><p class="depth0">55(e) Promotional waivers or rebates of interest, fees, and other</p><p class="depth0">charges</p><p class="depth0">1. Generally. Nothing in Sec. 1026.55 prohibits a card issuer from  waiving or rebating finance charges due to a periodic interest rate or a  fee or charge required to be disclosed under Sec. 1026.6(b)(2)(ii),  (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii). However, if a card issuer promotes and  applies the waiver or rebate to an account, the card issuer cannot  temporarily or permanently cease or terminate any portion of the waiver  or rebate on that account unless permitted by one of the exceptions in  Sec. 1026.55(b). For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. A card issuer applies an annual percentage rate of 15% to balance  transfers but promotes a program under which all of the interest accrued  on transferred balances will be waived or rebated for one year. If,  prior to the commencement of the one-year period, the card issuer  discloses the length of the period and the annual percentage rate that  will apply to transferred balances after expiration of that period  consistent with Sec. 1026.55(b)(1)(i), Sec. 1026.55(b)(1) permits the  card issuer to begin imposing interest charges on transferred balances  after one year. Furthermore, if, during the one-year period, a required  minimum periodic payment is not received within 60 days of the payment  due date, Sec. 1026.55(b)(4) permits the card issuer to begin imposing  interest charges on transferred balances (after providing a notice  consistent with Sec. 1026.9(g) and Sec. 1026.55(b)(4)(i)). However, if  a required minimum periodic payment is not more than 60 days delinquent  or if the consumer otherwise violates the terms or other requirements of  the account, Sec. 1026.55 does not permit the card issuer to begin  imposing interest charges on transferred balances until the expiration  of the one-year period.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A card issuer imposes a monthly maintenance fee of $10 but  promotes a program under which the fee will be waived or rebated for the  six months following account opening. If, prior to account opening, the  card issuer discloses the length of the period and the monthly  maintenance fee that will be imposed after expiration of that period  consistent with Sec. 1026.55(b)(1)(i), Sec. 1026.55(b)(1) permits the  card issuer to begin imposing the monthly maintenance fee six months  after account opening. Furthermore, if, during the six-month period, a  required minimum periodic payment is not received within 60 days of the  payment due date, Sec. 1026.55(b)(4) permits the card issuer to begin  imposing the monthly maintenance fee (after providing a notice  consistent with Sec. 1026.9(c) and Sec. 1026.55(b)(4)(i)). However, if  a required minimum periodic payment is not more than 60 days delinquent  or if the consumer otherwise violates the terms or other requirements of  the account, Sec. 1026.55 does not permit the card issuer to begin  imposing the monthly maintenance fee until the expiration of the six- month period.</p><p class="depth0">2. Promotion of waiver or rebate. For purposes of Sec. 1026.55(e),  a card issuer generally promotes a waiver or rebate if the card issuer  discloses the waiver or rebate in an advertisement (as defined in Sec.  1026.2(a)(2)). See comment 2(a)(2)-1. In addition, a card issuer  generally promotes a waiver or rebate for purposes of Sec. 1026.55(e)  if the card issuer discloses the waiver or rebate in communications  regarding existing accounts (such as communications regarding a  promotion that encourages additional or different uses of an existing  account). However, a card issuer does not promote a waiver or rebate for  purposes of Sec. 1026.55(e) if the advertisement or communication  relates to an inquiry or dispute about a specific charge or to interest,  fees, or charges that have already been waived or rebated.</p><p class="depth0">i. Examples of promotional communications. The following are  examples of circumstances in which a card issuer is promoting a waiver  or rebate for purposes of Sec. 1026.55(e):</p><p class="depth0">A. A card issuer discloses the waiver or rebate in a newspaper,  magazine, leaflet, promotional flyer, catalog, sign, or point-of-sale  display, unless the disclosure relates to interest, fees, or charges  that have already been waived.</p><p class="depth0">B. A card issuer discloses the waiver or rebate on radio or  television or through electronic advertisements (such as on the  Internet), unless the disclosure relates to interest, fees, or charges  that have already been waived or rebated.</p><p class="depth0">C. A card issuer discloses a waiver or rebate to individual  consumers, such as by telephone, letter, or electronic communication,  through direct mail literature, or on or with account statements, unless  the disclosure relates to an inquiry or dispute about a specific charge  or to interest, fees, or charges that have already been waived or  rebated.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Examples of non-promotional communications. The following are  examples of circumstances in which a card issuer is not promoting a  waiver or rebate for purposes of Sec. 1026.55(e):</p><p class="depth0">A. After a card issuer has waived or rebated interest, fees, or  other charges subject to Sec. 1026.55 with respect to an account, the  issuer discloses the waiver or rebate to the accountholder on the  periodic statement or by telephone, letter, or electronic communication.  However, if the card issuer also discloses prospective waivers or  rebates in the same communication, the issuer is promoting a waiver or  rebate for purposes of Sec. 1026.55(e).</p><p class="depth0">B. A card issuer communicates with a consumer about a waiver or  rebate of interest, fees, or other charges subject to Sec. 1026.55 in  relation to an inquiry or dispute about a specific charge, including a  dispute under Sec. Sec. 1026.12 or 1026.13.</p><p class="depth0">C. A card issuer waives or rebates interest, fees, or other charges  subject to Sec. 1026.55 in order to comply with a legal requirement  (such as the limitations in Sec. 1026.52(a)).</p><p class="depth0">D. A card issuer discloses a grace period, as defined in Sec.  1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(3).</p><p class="depth0">E. A card issuer provides a period after the payment due date during  which interest, fees, or other charges subject to Sec. 1026.55 are  waived or rebated even if a payment has not been received.</p><p class="depth0">F. A card issuer provides benefits (such as rewards points or cash  back on purchases or finance charges) that can be applied to the account  as credits, provided that the benefits are not promoted as reducing  interest, fees, or other charges subject to Sec. 1026.55.</p><p class="depth0">3. Relationship of Sec. 1026.55(e) to grace period. Section  1026.55(e) does not apply to the waiver of finance charges due to a  periodic rate consistent with a grace period, as defined in Sec.  1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(3).</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.56--Requirements for Over-the-Limit Transactions</p><p class="depth0">56(b) Opt-in requirement.</p><p class="depth0">1. Policy and practice of declining over-the-limit transactions.  Section 1026.56(b)(1)(i)-(v), including the requirements to provide  notice and obtain consumer consent, do not apply to any card issuer that  has a policy and practice of declining to pay any over-the-limit  transactions for the consumer's credit card account when the card issuer  has a reasonable belief that completing a transaction will cause the  consumer to exceed the consumer's credit limit for that account. For  example, if a card issuer only authorizes those transactions which, at  the time of authorization, would not cause the consumer to exceed a  credit limit, it is not subject to the requirement to provide consumers  notice and an opportunity to affirmatively consent to the card issuer's  payment of over-the-limit transactions. However, if an over-the-limit  transaction is paid without the consumer providing affirmative consent,  the card issuer may not charge a fee for paying the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">2. Over-the-limit transactions not required to be authorized or  paid. Section 1026.56 does not require a card issuer to authorize or pay  an over-the-limit transaction even if the consumer has affirmatively  consented to the card issuer's over-the-limit service.</p><p class="depth0">3. Examples of reasonable opportunity to provide affirmative  consent. A card issuer provides a reasonable opportunity for the  consumer to provide affirmative consent to the card issuer's payment of  over-the-limit transactions when, among other things, it provides  reasonable methods by which the consumer may affirmatively consent. A  card issuer provides such reasonable methods if:</p><p class="depth0">i. On the application. The card issuer provides the notice on the  application form that the consumer can fill out to request the service  as part of the application;</p><p class="depth0">ii. By mail. The card issuer provides a form with the account- opening disclosures or the periodic statement for the consumer to fill  out and mail to affirmatively request the service;</p><p class="depth0">iii. By telephone. The card issuer provides a readily available  telephone line that consumers may call to provide affirmative consent.</p><p class="depth0">iv. By electronic means. The card issuer provides an electronic  means for the consumer to affirmatively consent. For example, a card  issuer could provide a form that can be accessed and processed at its  Web site, where the consumer can check a box to opt in and confirm that  choice by clicking on a button that affirms the consumer's consent.</p><p class="depth0">4. Separate consent required. A consumer's affirmative consent, or  opt-in, to a card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions must  be obtained separately from other consents or acknowledgments obtained  by the card issuer. For example, a consumer's signature on a credit  application to request a credit card would not by itself sufficiently  evidence the consumer's consent to the card issuer's payment of over- the-limit   transactions. However, a card issuer may obtain a consumer's affirmative  consent by providing a blank signature line or a check box on the  application that the consumer can sign or select to request the over- the-limit service, provided that the signature line or check box is used  solely for purposes of evidencing the choice and not for any other  purpose, such as to also obtain consumer consents for other account  services or features or to receive disclosures electronically.</p><p class="depth0">5. Written confirmation. A card issuer may comply with the  requirement in Sec. 1026.56(b)(1)(iv) to provide written confirmation  of the consumer's decision to affirmatively consent, or opt in, to the  card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions by providing the  consumer a copy of the consumer's completed opt-in form or by sending a  letter or notice to the consumer acknowledging that the consumer has  elected to opt into the card issuer's service. A card issuer may also  satisfy the written confirmation requirement by providing the  confirmation on the first periodic statement sent after the consumer has  opted in. For example, a card issuer could provide a written notice  consistent with Sec. 1026.56(e)(2) on the periodic statement. A card  issuer may not, however, assess any over-the-limit fees or charges on  the consumer's credit card account unless and until the card issuer has  sent the written confirmation. Thus, if a card issuer elects to provide  written confirmation on the first periodic statement after the consumer  has opted in, it would not be permitted to assess any over-the-limit  fees or charges until the next statement cycle.</p><p class="depth0">56(b)(2) Completion of over-the-limit transactions without consumer</p><p class="depth0">consent</p><p class="depth0">1. Examples of over-the-limit transactions paid without consumer  consent. Section 1026.56(b)(2) provides that a card issuer may pay an  over-the-limit transaction even if the consumer has not provided  affirmative consent, so long as the card issuer does not impose a fee or  charge for paying the transaction. The prohibition on imposing fees for  paying an over-the-limit transaction applies even in circumstances where  the card issuer is unable to avoid paying a transaction that exceeds the  consumer's credit limit.</p><p class="depth0">i. Transactions not submitted for authorization. A consumer has not  affirmatively consented to a card issuer's payment of over-the-limit  transactions. The consumer purchases a $3 cup of coffee using his credit  card. Because of the small dollar amount of the transaction, the  merchant does not submit the transaction to the card issuer for  authorization. The transaction causes the consumer to exceed the credit  limit. Under these circumstances, the card issuer is prohibited from  imposing a fee or charge on the consumer's credit card account for  paying the over-the-limit transaction because the consumer has not opted  in to the card issuer's over-the-limit service.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Settlement amount exceeds authorization amount. A consumer has  not affirmatively consented to a card issuer's payment of over-the-limit  transactions. The consumer uses his credit card at a pay-at-the-pump  fuel dispenser to purchase $50 of fuel. Before permitting the consumer  to use the fuel pump, the merchant verifies the validity of the card by  requesting an authorization hold of $1. The subsequent $50 transaction  amount causes the consumer to exceed his credit limit. Under these  circumstances, the card issuer is prohibited from imposing a fee or  charge on the consumer's credit card account for paying the over-the- limit transaction because the consumer has not opted in to the card  issuer's over-the-limit service.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Intervening charges. A consumer has not affirmatively consented  to a card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions. The consumer  makes a $50 purchase using his credit card. However, before the $50  transaction is charged to the consumer's account, a separate recurring  charge is posted to the account. The $50 purchase then causes the  consumer to exceed his credit limit. Under these circumstances, the card  issuer is prohibited from imposing a fee or charge on the consumer's  credit card account for paying the over-the-limit transaction because  the consumer has not opted in to the card issuer's over-the-limit  service.</p><p class="depth0">2. Permissible fees or charges when a consumer has not consented.  Section 1026.56(b)(2) does not preclude a card issuer from assessing  fees or charges other than over-the-limit fees when an over-the-limit  transaction is completed. For example, if a consumer has not opted in,  the card issuer may assess a balance transfer fee in connection with a  balance transfer, provided such a fee is assessed whether or not the  transfer exceeds the credit limit. Section 1026.56(b)(2) does not limit  the card issuer's ability to debit the consumer's account for the amount  of the over-the-limit transaction if the card issuer is permitted to do  so under applicable law. The card issuer may also assess interest  charges in connection with the over-the-limit transaction.</p><p class="depth0">56(c) Method of election</p><p class="depth0">1. Card issuer-determined methods. A card issuer may determine the  means available to consumers to affirmatively consent, or opt in, to the  card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions. For example, a  card issuer may decide to obtain consents in writing, electronically, or  orally, or through some combination of these methods. Section 1026.56(c)  further requires, however, that such methods must be made equally  available for consumers to revoke a prior consent.   Thus, for example, if a card issuer allows a consumer to consent in  writing or electronically, it must also allow the consumer to revoke  that consent in writing or electronically.</p><p class="depth0">2. Electronic requests. A consumer consent or revocation request  submitted electronically is not considered a consumer disclosure for  purposes of the E-Sign Act.</p><p class="depth0">56(d) Timing and placement of notices</p><p class="depth0">1. Contemporaneous notice for oral or electronic consent. Under  Sec. 1026.56(d)(1)(ii), if a card issuer seeks to obtain consent from  the consumer orally or by electronic means, the card issuer must provide  a notice containing the disclosures in Sec. 1026.56(e)(1) prior to and  as part of the process of obtaining the consumer's consent.</p><p class="depth0">56(e) Content</p><p class="depth0">1. Amount of over-the-limit fee. See Model Forms G-25(A) and G-25(B)  for guidance on how to disclose the amount of the over-the-limit fee.</p><p class="depth0">2. Notice content. In describing the consumer's right to  affirmatively consent to a card issuer's payment of over-the-limit  transactions, the card issuer may explain that any transactions that  exceed the consumer's credit limit will be declined if the consumer does  not consent to the service. In addition, the card issuer should explain  that even if a consumer consents, the payment of over-the-limit  transactions is at the discretion of the card issuer. For example, the  card issuer may indicate that it may decline a transaction for any  reason, such as if the consumer is past due or significantly over the  limit. The card issuer may also disclose the consumer's right to revoke  consent.</p><p class="depth0">56(f) Joint relationships</p><p class="depth0">1. Authorized users. Section 1026.56(f) does not permit a card  issuer to treat a request to opt in to or to revoke a prior request for  the card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions from an  authorized user that is not jointly liable on a credit card account as a  consent or revocation request for that account.</p><p class="depth0">56(g) Continuing right to opt in or revoke opt-in</p><p class="depth0">1. Fees or charges for over-the-limit transactions incurred prior to  revocation. Section 1026.56(g) provides that a consumer may revoke his  or her prior consent at any time. If a consumer does so, this provision  does not require the card issuer to waive or reverse any over-the-limit  fees or charges assessed to the consumer's account for transactions that  occurred prior to the card issuer's implementation of the consumer's  revocation request. Nor does this requirement prevent the card issuer  from assessing over-the-limit fees in subsequent cycles if the  consumer's account balance continues to exceed the credit limit after  the payment due date as a result of an over-the-limit transaction that  occurred prior to the consumer's revocation of consent.</p><p class="depth0">56(h) Duration of opt-in</p><p class="depth0">1. Card issuer ability to stop paying over-the-limit transactions  after consumer consent. A card issuer may cease paying over-the-limit  transactions for consumers that have previously opted in at any time and  for any reason. For example, a card issuer may stop paying over-the- limit transactions for a consumer to respond to changes in the credit  risk presented by the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">56(j) Prohibited practices</p><p class="depth0">1. Periodic fees or charges. A card issuer may charge an over-the- limit fee or charge only if the consumer has exceeded the credit limit  during the billing cycle. Thus, a card issuer may not impose any  recurring or periodic fees for paying over-the-limit transactions (for  example, a monthly ``over-the-limit protection'' service fee), even if  the consumer has affirmatively consented to or opted in to the service,  unless the consumer has in fact exceeded the credit limit during that  cycle.</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples of limits on fees or charges imposed per billing cycle.  Section 1026.56(j)(1) generally prohibits a card issuer from assessing a  fee or charge due to the same over-the-limit transaction for more than  three billing cycles. The following examples illustrate the prohibition.</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that a consumer has opted into a card issuer's payment of  over-the-limit transactions. The consumer exceeds the credit limit  during the December billing cycle and does not make sufficient payment  to bring the account balance back under the limit for four consecutive  cycles. The consumer does not engage in any additional transactions  during this period. In this case, Sec. 1026.56(j)(1) would permit the  card issuer to charge a maximum of three over-the-limit fees for the  December over-the-limit transaction.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume the same facts as above except that the consumer makes  sufficient payment to reduce his account balance by the payment due date  during the February billing cycle. The card issuer may charge over-the- limit fees for the December and January billing cycles. However, because  the consumer's account balance was below the credit limit by the payment  due date for the February billing cycle, the card issuer may not charge  an over-the-limit fee for the February billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Assume the same facts as in paragraph i, except that the  consumer engages in another over-the-limit transaction during the   February billing cycle. Because the consumer has obtained an additional  extension of credit which causes the consumer to exceed his credit  limit, the card issuer may charge over-the-limit fees for the December  transaction on the January, February and March billing statements, and  additional over-the-limit fees for the February transaction on the April  and May billing statements. The card issuer may not charge an over-the- limit fee for each of the December and the February transactions on the  March billing statement because it is prohibited from imposing more than  one over-the-limit fee during a billing cycle.</p><p class="depth0">3. Replenishment of credit line. Section 1026.56(j)(2) does not  prevent a card issuer from delaying replenishment of a consumer's  available credit where appropriate, for example, where the card issuer  may suspect fraud on the credit card account. However, a card issuer may  not assess an over-the-limit fee or charge if the over-the-limit  transaction is caused by the card issuer's decision not to promptly  replenish the available credit after the consumer's payment is credited  to the consumer's account.</p><p class="depth0">4. Examples of conditioning. Section 1026.56(j)(3) prohibits a card  issuer from conditioning or otherwise tying the amount of a consumer's  credit limit on the consumer affirmatively consenting to the card  issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions where the card issuer  assesses an over-the-limit fee for the transaction. The following  examples illustrate the prohibition.</p><p class="depth0">i. Amount of credit limit. Assume that a card issuer offers a credit  card with a credit limit of $1,000. The consumer is informed that if the  consumer opts in to the payment of the card issuer's payment of over- the-limit transactions, the initial credit limit would be increased to  $1,300. If the card issuer would have offered the credit card with the  $1,300 credit limit but for the fact that the consumer did not consent  to the card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions, the card  issuer would not be in compliance with Sec. 1026.56(j)(3). Section  1026.56(j)(3) prohibits the card issuer from tying the consumer's opt-in  to the card issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions as a  condition of obtaining the credit card with the $1,300 credit limit.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Access to credit. Assume the same facts as above, except that  the card issuer declines the consumer's application altogether because  the consumer has not affirmatively consented or opted in to the card  issuer's payment of over-the-limit transactions. The card issuer is not  in compliance with Sec. 1026.56(j)(3) because the card issuer has  required the consumer's consent as a condition of obtaining credit.</p><p class="depth0">5. Over-the-limit fees caused by accrued fees or interest. Section  1026.56(j)(4) prohibits a card issuer from imposing any over-the-limit  fees or charges on a consumer's account if the consumer has exceeded the  credit limit solely because charges imposed as part of the plan as  described in Sec. 1026.6(b)(3) were charged to the consumer's account  during the billing cycle. For example, a card issuer may not assess an  over-the-limit fee or charge even if the credit limit was exceeded due  to fees for services requested by the consumer if such fees would  constitute charges imposed as part of the plan (such as fees for  voluntary debt cancellation or suspension coverage). Section  1026.56(j)(4) does not, however, restrict card issuers from assessing  over-the-limit fees or charges due to accrued finance charges or fees  from prior cycles that have subsequently been added to the account  balance. The following examples illustrate the prohibition.</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume that a consumer has opted in to a card issuer's payment of  over-the-limit transactions. The consumer's account has a credit limit  of $500. The billing cycles for the account begin on the first day of  the month and end on the last day of the month. The account is not  eligible for a grace period as defined in Sec. 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(B)(3).  On December 31, the only balance on the account is a purchase balance of  $475. On that same date, $50 in fees charged as part of the plan under  Sec. 1026.6(b)(3)(i) and interest charges are imposed on the account,  increasing the total balance at the end of the December billing cycle to  $525. Although the total balance exceeds the $500 credit limit, Sec.  1026.56(j)(4) prohibits the card issuer from imposing an over-the-limit  fee or charge for the December billing cycle in these circumstances  because the consumer's credit limit was exceeded solely because of the  imposition of fees and interest charges during that cycle.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Same facts as above except that, on December 31, the only  balance on the account is a purchase balance of $400. On that same date,  $50 in fees imposed as part of the plan under Sec. 1026.6(b)(3)(i),  including interest charges, are imposed on the account, increasing the  total balance at the end of the December billing cycle to $450. The  consumer makes a $25 payment by the January payment due date and the  remaining $25 in fees imposed as part of the plan in December is added  to the outstanding balance. On January 25, an $80 purchase is charged to  the account. At the close of the cycle on January 31, an additional $20  in fees imposed as part of the plan are imposed on the account,  increasing the total balance to $525. Because Sec. 1026.56(j)(4) does  not require the issuer to consider fees imposed as part of the plan for  the prior cycle in determining whether an over-the-limit fee may be  properly assessed for the current cycle, the issuer need not take into  account the remaining $25 in fees and interest charges from the December  cycle in determining whether fees imposed as part of the plan caused the  consumer to   exceed the credit limit during the January cycle. Thus, under these  circumstances, Sec. 1026.56(j)(4) does not prohibit the card issuer  from imposing an over-the-limit fee or charge for the January billing  cycle because the $20 in fees imposed as part of the plan for the  January billing cycle did not cause the consumer to exceed the credit  limit during that cycle.</p><p class="depth0">6. Additional restrictions on over-the-limit fees. See Sec.  1026.52(b).  Section 1026.57--Reporting and Marketing Rules for College Student Open-</p><p class="depth0">End Credit</p><p class="depth0">57(a) Definitions</p><p class="depth0">57(a)(1) College student credit card</p><p class="depth0">1. Definition. The definition of college student credit card  excludes home-equity lines of credit accessed by credit cards and  overdraft lines of credit accessed by debit cards. A college student  credit card includes a college affinity card within the meaning of TILA  section 127(r)(1)(A). In addition, a card may fall within the scope of  the definition regardless of the fact that it is not intentionally  targeted at or marketed to college students. For example, an agreement  between a college and a card issuer may provide for marketing of credit  cards to alumni, faculty, staff, and other non-student consumers who  have a relationship with the college, but also contain provisions that  contemplate the issuance of cards to students. A credit card issued to a  student at the college in connection with such an agreement qualifies as  a college student credit card.</p><p class="depth0">57(a)(5) College credit card agreement</p><p class="depth0">1. Definition. Section 1026.57(a)(5) defines ``college credit card  agreement'' to include any business, marketing or promotional agreement  between a card issuer and a college or university (or an affiliated  organization, such as an alumni club or a foundation) if the agreement  provides for the issuance of credit cards to full-time or part-time  students. Business, marketing or promotional agreements may include a  broad range of arrangements between a card issuer and an institution of  higher education or affiliated organization, including arrangements that  do not meet the criteria to be considered college affinity card  agreements as discussed in TILA section 127(r)(1)(A). For example, TILA  section 127(r)(1)(A) specifies that under a college affinity card  agreement, the card issuer has agreed to make a donation to the  institution or affiliated organization, the card issuer has agreed to  offer discounted terms to the consumer, or the credit card will display  pictures, symbols, or words identified with the institution or  affiliated organization; even if these conditions are not met, an  agreement may qualify as a college credit card agreement, if the  agreement is a business, marketing or promotional agreement that  contemplates the issuance of college student credit cards to college  students currently enrolled (either full-time or part-time) at the  institution. An agreement may qualify as a college credit card agreement  even if marketing of cards under the agreement is targeted at alumni,  faculty, staff, and other non-student consumers, as long as cards may  also be issued to students in connection with the agreement.</p><p class="depth0">57(b) Public disclosure of agreements</p><p class="depth0">1. Public disclosure. Section 1026.57(b) requires an institution of  higher education to publicly disclose any contract or other agreement  made with a card issuer or creditor for the purpose of marketing a  credit card. Examples of publicly disclosing such contracts or  agreements include, but are not limited to, posting such contracts or  agreements on the institution's Web site or making such contracts or  agreements available upon request, provided the procedures for  requesting the documents are reasonable and free of cost to the  requestor, and the requested contracts or agreements are provided within  a reasonable time frame.</p><p class="depth0">2. Redaction prohibited. An institution of higher education must  publicly disclose any contract or other agreement made with a card  issuer for the purpose of marketing a credit card in its entirety and  may not redact any portion of such contract or agreement. Any clause  existing in such contracts or agreements, providing for the  confidentiality of any portion of the contract or agreement, would be  invalid to the extent it restricts the ability of the institution of  higher education to publicly disclose the contract or agreement in its  entirety.</p><p class="depth0">57(c) Prohibited inducements</p><p class="depth0">1. Tangible item clarified. A tangible item includes any physical  item, such as a gift card, a t-shirt, or a magazine subscription, that a  card issuer or creditor offers to induce a college student to apply for  or open an open-end consumer credit plan offered by such card issuer or  creditor. Tangible items do not include non-physical inducements such as  discounts, rewards points, or promotional credit terms.</p><p class="depth0">2. Inducement clarified. If a tangible item is offered to a person  whether or not that person applies for or opens an open-end consumer  credit plan, the tangible item has not been offered to induce the person  to apply for or open the plan. For example, refreshments offered to a  college student on campus that are not conditioned on whether the  student has applied for or agreed to open an open-end consumer credit  plan would not violate Sec. 1026.57(c).</p><p class="depth0">3. Near campus clarified. A location that is within 1,000 feet of  the border of the campus   of an institution of higher education, as defined by the institution of  higher education, is considered near the campus of an institution of  higher education.</p><p class="depth0">4. Mailings included. The prohibition in Sec. 1026.57(c) on  offering a tangible item to a college student to induce such student to  apply for or open an open-end consumer credit plan offered by such card  issuer or creditor applies to any solicitation or application mailed to  a college student at an address on or near the campus of an institution  of higher education.</p><p class="depth0">5. Related event clarified. An event is related to an institution of  higher education if the marketing of such event uses the name, emblem,  mascot, or logo of an institution of higher education, or other words,  pictures, symbols identified with an institution of higher education in  a way that implies that the institution of higher education endorses or  otherwise sponsors the event.</p><p class="depth0">6. Reasonable procedures for determining if applicant is a student.  Section 1026.57(c) applies solely to offering a tangible item to a  college student. Therefore, a card issuer or creditor may offer any  person who is not a college student a tangible item to induce such  person to apply for or open an open-end consumer credit plan offered by  such card issuer or creditor, on campus, near campus, or at an event  sponsored by or related to an institution of higher education. The card  issuer or creditor must have reasonable procedures for determining  whether an applicant is a college student before giving the applicant  the tangible item. For example, a card issuer or creditor may ask  whether the applicant is a college student as part of the application  process. The card issuer or creditor may rely on the representations  made by the applicant.</p><p class="depth0">57(d) Annual report to the Bureau</p><p class="depth0">57(d)(2) Contents of report</p><p class="depth0">1. Memorandum of understanding. Section 1026.57(d)(2) requires that  the report to the Bureau include, among other items, a copy of any  memorandum of understanding between the card issuer and the institution  (or affiliated organization) that ``directly or indirectly relates to  the college credit card agreement or that controls or directs any  obligations or distribution of benefits between any such entities.''  Such a memorandum of understanding includes any document that amends the  college credit card agreement, or that constitutes a further agreement  between the parties as to the interpretation or administration of the  agreement. For example, a memorandum of understanding required to be  included in the report would include a document that provides details on  the dollar amounts of payments from the card issuer to the university,  to supplement the original agreement which only provided for payments in  general terms (e.g., as a percentage). A memorandum of understanding for  these purposes would not include email (or other) messages that merely  discuss matters such as the addresses to which payments should be sent  or the names of contact persons for carrying out the agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.58--Internet Posting of Credit Card Agreements</p><p class="depth0">58(b) Definitions</p><p class="depth0">58(b)(1) Agreement</p><p class="depth0">1. Inclusion of pricing information. For purposes of this section, a  credit card agreement is deemed to include certain information, such as  annual percentage rates and fees, even if the issuer does not otherwise  include this information in the basic credit contract. This information  is listed under the defined term ``pricing information'' in Sec.  1026.58(b)(7). For example, the basic credit contract may not specify  rates, fees and other information that constitutes pricing information  as defined in Sec. 1026.58(b)(7); instead, such information may be  provided to the cardholder in a separate document sent along with the  card. However, this information nevertheless constitutes part of the  agreement for purposes of Sec. 1026.58.</p><p class="depth0">2. Provisions contained in separate documents included. A credit  card agreement is defined as the written document or documents  evidencing the terms of the legal obligation, or the prospective legal  obligation, between a card issuer and a consumer for a credit card  account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan. An  agreement therefore may consist of several documents that, taken  together, define the legal obligation between the issuer and consumer.  For example, provisions that mandate arbitration or allow an issuer to  unilaterally alter the terms of the card issuer's or consumer's  obligation are part of the agreement even if they are provided to the  consumer in a document separate from the basic credit contract.</p><p class="depth0">58(b)(2) Amends</p><p class="depth0">1. Substantive changes. A change to an agreement is substantive, and  therefore is deemed an amendment of the agreement, if it alters the  rights or obligations of the parties. Section 1026.58(b)(2) provides  that any change in the pricing information, as defined in Sec.  1026.58(b)(7), is deemed to be substantive. Examples of other changes  that generally would be considered substantive include:</p><p class="depth0">i. Addition or deletion of a provision giving the issuer or consumer  a right under the agreement, such as a clause that allows an issuer to  unilaterally change the terms of an agreement.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Addition or deletion of a provision giving the issuer or  consumer an obligation   under the agreement, such as a clause requiring the consumer to pay an  additional fee.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Changes that may affect the cost of credit to the consumer,  such as changes in a provision describing how the minimum payment will  be calculated.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Changes that may affect how the terms of the agreement are  construed or applied, such as changes in a choice-of-law provision.</p><p class="depth0">v. Changes that may affect the parties to whom the agreement may  apply, such as provisions regarding authorized users or assignment of  the agreement.</p><p class="depth0">2. Non-substantive changes. Changes that generally would not be  considered substantive include, for example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Correction of typographical errors that do not affect the meaning  of any terms of the agreement.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Changes to the card issuer's corporate name, logo, or tagline.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Changes to the format of the agreement, such as conversion to a  booklet from a full-sheet format, changes in font, or changes in  margins.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Changes to the name of the credit card to which the program  applies.</p><p class="depth0">v. Reordering sections of the agreement without affecting the  meaning of any terms of the agreement.</p><p class="depth0">vi. Adding, removing, or modifying a table of contents or index.</p><p class="depth0">vii. Changes to titles, headings, section numbers, or captions.</p><p class="depth0">58(b)(4) Card issuer</p><p class="depth0">1. Card issuer clarified. Section 1026.58(b)(4) provides that, for  purposes of Sec. 1026.58, card issuer or issuer means the entity to  which a consumer is legally obligated, or would be legally obligated,  under the terms of a credit card agreement. For example, Bank X and Bank  Y work together to issue credit cards. A consumer that obtains a credit  card issued pursuant to this arrangement between Bank X and Bank Y is  subject to an agreement that states ``This is an agreement between you,  the consumer, and Bank X that governs the terms of your Bank Y Credit  Card.'' The card issuer in this example is Bank X, because the agreement  creates a legally enforceable obligation between the consumer and Bank  X. Bank X is the issuer even if the consumer applied for the card  through a link on Bank Y's Web site and the cards prominently feature  the Bank Y logo on the front of the card.</p><p class="depth0">2. Use of third-party service providers. An institution that is the  card issuer as defined in Sec. 1026.58(b)(4) has a legal obligation to  comply with the requirements of Sec. 1026.58. However, a card issuer  generally may use a third-party service provider to satisfy its  obligations under Sec. 1026.58, provided that the issuer acts in  accordance with regulatory guidance regarding use of third-party service  providers and other applicable regulatory guidance. In some cases, an  issuer may wish to arrange for the institution with which it partners to  issue credit cards to fulfill the requirements of Sec. 1026.58 on the  issuer's behalf. For example, Retailer and Bank work together to issue  credit cards. Under the Sec. 1026.58(b)(4) definition, Bank is the  issuer of these credit cards for purposes of Sec. 1026.58. However,  Retailer services the credit card accounts, including mailing account  opening materials and periodic statements to cardholders. While Bank is  responsible for ensuring compliance with Sec. 1026.58, Bank may arrange  for Retailer (or another appropriate third-party service provider) to  submit credit card agreements to the Bureau under Sec. 1026.58 on  Bank's behalf. Bank must comply with regulatory guidance regarding use  of third-party service providers and other applicable regulatory  guidance.</p><p class="depth0">3. Partner institution Web sites. i. As explained in comments 58(d)- 2 and 58(e)-3, if an issuer provides cardholders with access to specific  information about their individual accounts, such as balance information  or copies of statements, through a third-party Web site, the issuer is  deemed to maintain that Web site for purposes of Sec. 1026.58. Such a  Web site is deemed to be maintained by the issuer for purposes of Sec.  1026.58 even where, for example, an unaffiliated entity designs the Web  site and owns and maintains the information technology infrastructure  that supports the Web site, cardholders with credit cards from multiple  issuers can access individual account information through the same Web  site, and the Web site is not labeled, branded, or otherwise held out to  the public as belonging to the issuer. A partner institution's Web site  is an example of a third-party Web site that may be deemed to be  maintained by the issuer for purposes of Sec. 1026.58. For example,  Retailer and Bank work together to issue credit cards. Under the Sec.  1026.58(b)(4) definition, Bank is the issuer of these credit cards for  purposes of Sec. 1026.58. Bank does not have a Web site. However,  cardholders can access information about their individual accounts, such  as balance information and copies of statements, through a Web site  maintained by Retailer. Retailer designs the Web site and owns and  maintains the information technology infrastructure that supports the  Web site. The Web site is branded and held out to the public as  belonging to Retailer. Because cardholders can access information about  their individual accounts through this Web site, the Web site is deemed  to be maintained by Bank for purposes of Sec. 1026.58. Bank therefore  may comply with Sec. 1026.58(d) by ensuring that agreements offered to  the public are posted on Retailer's Web site in accordance with Sec.  1026.58(d). Bank may comply with Sec. 1026.58(e) by ensuring that  cardholders can request copies of their individual agreements   through Retailer's Web site in accordance with Sec. 1026.58(e)(1). Bank  need not create and maintain a Web site branded and held out to the  public as belonging to Bank in order to comply with Sec. Sec.  1026.58(d) and (e) as long as Bank ensures that Retailer's Web site  complies with these sections.</p><p class="depth0">ii. In addition, Sec. 1026.58(d)(1) provides that, with respect to  an agreement offered solely for accounts under one or more private label  credit card plans, an issuer may comply with Sec. 1026.58(d) by posting  the agreement on the publicly available Web site of at least one of the  merchants at which credit cards issued under each private label credit  card plan with 10,000 or more open accounts may be used. This rule is  not conditioned on cardholders' ability to access account-specific  information through the merchant's Web site.</p><p class="depth0">58(b)(5) Offers</p><p class="depth0">1. Cards offered to limited groups. A card issuer is deemed to offer  a credit card agreement to the public even if the issuer solicits, or  accepts applications from, only a limited group of persons. For example,  a card issuer may market affinity cards to students and alumni of a  particular educational institution, or may solicit only high-net-worth  individuals for a particular card; in these cases, the agreement would  be considered to be offered to the public. Similarly, agreements for  credit cards issued by a credit union are considered to be offered to  the public even though such cards are available only to credit union  members.</p><p class="depth0">2. Individualized agreements. A card issuer is deemed to offer a  credit card agreement to the public even if the terms of the agreement  are changed immediately upon opening of an account to terms not offered  to the public.</p><p class="depth0">58(b)(6) Open account</p><p class="depth0">1. Open account clarified. The definition of open account includes a  credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit  plan if either (i) the cardholder can obtain extensions of credit on the  account; or (ii) there is an outstanding balance on the account that has  not been charged off. Under this definition, an account that meets  either of these criteria is considered to be open even if the account is  inactive. Similarly, if an account has been closed for new activity (for  example, due to default by the cardholder), but the cardholder is still  making payments to pay off the outstanding balance, the account is  considered open.  58(b)(8) Private Label Credit Card Account and Private Label Credit Card</p><p class="depth0">Plan</p><p class="depth0">1. Private label credit card account. The term private label credit  card account means a credit card account under an open-end (not home- secured) consumer credit plan with a credit card that can be used to  make purchases only at a single merchant or an affiliated group of  merchants. This term applies to any such credit card account, regardless  of whether it is issued by the merchant or its affiliate or by an  unaffiliated third party.</p><p class="depth0">2. Co-branded credit cards. The term private label credit card  account does not include accounts with so-called co-branded credit  cards. Credit cards that display the name, mark, or logo of a merchant  or affiliated group of merchants as well as the mark, logo, or brand of  payment network are generally referred to as co-branded cards. While  these credit cards may display the brand of the merchant or affiliated  group of merchants as the dominant brand on the card, such credit cards  are usable at any merchant that participates in the payment network.  Because these credit cards can be used at multiple unaffiliated  merchants, accounts with such credit cards are not considered private  label credit card accounts under Sec. 1026.58(b)(8).</p><p class="depth0">3. Affiliated group of merchants. The term ``affiliated group of  merchants'' means two or more affiliated merchants or other persons that  are related by common ownership or common corporate control. For  example, the term would include franchisees that are subject to a common  set of corporate policies or practices under the terms of their  franchise licenses. The term also applies to two or more merchants or  other persons that agree among each other, by contract or otherwise, to  accept a credit card bearing the same name, mark, or logo (other than  the mark, logo, or brand of a payment network), for the purchase of  goods or services solely at such merchants or persons. For example,  several local clothing retailers jointly agree to issue credit cards  called the ``Main Street Fashion Card'' that can be used to make  purchases only at those retailers. For purposes of this section, these  retailers would be considered an affiliated group of merchants.</p><p class="depth0">4. Private label credit card plan. i. Which credit card accounts  issued by a particular issuer constitute a private label credit card  plan is determined by where the credit cards can be used. All of the  private label credit card accounts issued by a particular card issuer  with credit cards usable at the same merchant or affiliated group of  merchants constitute a single private label credit card plan, regardless  of whether the rates, fees, or other terms applicable to the individual  credit card accounts differ. For example, a card issuer has 3,000 open  private label credit card accounts with credit cards usable only at  Merchant A and 5,000 open private label credit card accounts with credit  cards usable only at Merchant B and its affiliates. The card issuer has  two separate private label credit card plans, as defined by Sec.  1026.58(b)(8)--one plan consisting of 3,000 open accounts with credit  cards usable only at Merchant A and another plan consisting   of 5,000 open accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant B and  its affiliates.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The example above remains the same regardless of whether (or the  extent to which) the terms applicable to the individual open accounts  differ. For example, assume that, with respect to the card issuer's  3,000 open accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant A in the  example above, 1,000 of the open accounts have a purchase APR of 12  percent, 1,000 of the open accounts have a purchase APR of 15 percent,  and 1,000 of the open accounts have a purchase APR of 18 percent. All of  the 5,000 open accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant B and  Merchant B's affiliates have the same 15 percent purchase APR. The card  issuer still has only two separate private label credit card plans, as  defined by Sec. 1026.58(b)(8). The open accounts with credit cards  usable only at Merchant A do not constitute three separate private label  credit card plans under Sec. 1026.58(b)(8), even though the accounts  are subject to different terms.</p><p class="depth0">58(c) Submission of Agreements to Bureau</p><p class="depth0">58(c)(1) Quarterly Submissions</p><p class="depth0">1. Quarterly submission requirement. Section 1026.58(c)(1) requires  card issuers to send quarterly submissions to the Bureau no later than  the first business day on or after January 31, April 30, July 31, and  October 31 of each year. For example, a card issuer has already  submitted three credit card agreements to the Bureau. On October 15, the  card issuer stops offering agreement A. On November 20, the card issuer  amends agreement B. On December 1, the issuer starts offering a new  agreement D. The card issuer must submit to the Bureau no later than the  first business day on or after January 31 (i) notification that the card  issuer is withdrawing agreement A, because it is no longer offered to  the public; (ii) the amended version of agreement B; and (iii) agreement  D.</p><p class="depth0">2. No quarterly submission required. i. Under Sec. 1026.58(c)(1), a  card issuer is not required to make any submission to the Bureau at a  particular quarterly submission deadline if, during the previous  calendar quarter, the card issuer did not take any of the following  actions:</p><p class="depth0">A. Offering a new credit card agreement that was not submitted to  the Bureau previously.</p><p class="depth0">B. Amending an agreement previously submitted to the Bureau.</p><p class="depth0">C. Ceasing to offer an agreement previously submitted to the Bureau.</p><p class="depth0">ii. For example, a card issuer offers five agreements to the public  as of September 30 and submits these to the Bureau by October 31, as  required by Sec. 1026.58(c)(1). Between September 30 and December 31,  the card issuer continues to offer all five of these agreements to the  public without amending them and does not begin offering any new  agreements. The card issuer is not required to make any submission to  the Bureau by the following January 31.</p><p class="depth0">3. Quarterly submission of complete set of updated agreements.  Section 1026.58(c)(1) permits a card issuer to submit to the Bureau on a  quarterly basis a complete, updated set of the credit card agreements  the card issuer offers to the public. For example, a card issuer offers  agreements A, B, and C to the public as of March 31. The card issuer  submits each of these agreements to the Bureau by April 30 as required  by Sec. 1026.58(c)(1). On May 15, the card issuer amends agreement A,  but does not make any changes to agreements B or C. As of June 30, the  card issuer continues to offer amended agreement A and agreements B and  C to the public. At the next quarterly submission deadline, July 31, the  card issuer must submit the entire amended agreement A and is not  required to make any submission with respect to agreements B and C. The  card issuer may either: (i) Submit the entire amended agreement A and  make no submission with respect to agreements B and C; or (ii) submit  the entire amended agreement A and also resubmit agreements B and C. A  card issuer may choose to resubmit to the Bureau all of the agreements  it offered to the public as of a particular quarterly submission  deadline even if the card issuer has not introduced any new agreements  or amended any agreements since its last submission and continues to  offer all previously submitted agreements.</p><p class="depth0">58(c)(3) Amended Agreements</p><p class="depth0">1. No requirement to resubmit agreements not amended. Under Sec.  1026.58(c)(3), if a credit card agreement has been submitted to the  Bureau, the agreement has not been amended, and the card issuer  continues to offer the agreement to the public, no additional submission  regarding that agreement is required. For example, a credit card issuer  begins offering an agreement in October and submits the agreement to the  Bureau the following January 31, as required by Sec. 1026.58(c)(1). As  of March 31, the card issuer has not amended the agreement and is still  offering the agreement to the public. The card issuer is not required to  submit anything to the Bureau regarding that agreement by April 30.</p><p class="depth0">2. Submission of amended agreements. If a card issuer amends a  credit card agreement previously submitted to the Bureau, Sec.  1026.58(c)(3) requires the card issuer to submit the entire amended  agreement to the Bureau. The issuer must submit the amended agreement to  the Bureau by the first quarterly submission deadline after the last day  of the calendar quarter in which the change   became effective. However, the issuer is required to submit the amended  agreement to the Bureau only if the issuer offered the amended agreement  to the public as of the last business day of the calendar quarter in  which the change became effective. For example, a card issuer submits an  agreement to the Bureau on October 31. On November 15, the issuer  changes the balance computation method used under the agreement. Because  an element of the pricing information has changed, the agreement has  been amended for purposes of Sec. 1026.58(c)(3). On December 31, the  last business day of the calendar quarter in which the change in the  balance computation method became effective, the issuer still offers the  agreement to the public as amended on November 15. The issuer must  submit the entire amended agreement to the Bureau no later than January  31.</p><p class="depth0">3. Agreements amended but no longer offered to the public. A card  issuer should submit an amended agreement to the Bureau under Sec.  1026.58(c)(3) only if the issuer offered the amended agreement to the  public as of the last business day of the calendar quarter in which the  amendment became effective. Agreements that are not offered to the  public as of the last day of the calendar quarter should not be  submitted to the Bureau. For example, on December 31 a card issuer  offers two agreements, Agreement A and Agreement B. The issuer submits  these agreements to the Bureau by January 31 as required by Sec.  1026.58. On February 15, the issuer amends both Agreement A and  Agreement B. On February 28, the issuer stops offering Agreement A to  the public. On March 15, the issuer amends Agreement B a second time. As  a result, on March 31, the last business day of the calendar quarter,  the issuer offers to the public one agreement--Agreement B as amended on  March 15. By the April 30 quarterly submission deadline, the issuer must  (i) notify the Bureau that it is withdrawing Agreement A because  Agreement A is no longer offered to the public; and (ii) submit to the  Bureau Agreement B as amended on March 15. The issuer should not submit  to the Bureau either Agreement A as amended on February 15 or the  earlier version of Agreement B (as amended on February 15), as neither  was offered to the public on March 31, the last business day of the  calendar quarter.</p><p class="depth0">4. Change-in-terms notices not permissible. Section 1026.58(c)(3)  requires that if an agreement previously submitted to the Bureau is  amended, the card issuer must submit the entire revised agreement to the  Bureau. A card issuer may not fulfill this requirement by submitting a  change-in-terms or similar notice covering only the terms that have  changed. In addition, amendments must be integrated into the text of the  agreement (or the addenda described in Sec. 1026.58(c)(8)), not  provided as separate riders. For example, a card issuer changes the  purchase APR associated with an agreement the issuer has previously  submitted to the Bureau. The purchase APR for that agreement was  included in the addendum of pricing information, as required by Sec.  1026.58(c)(8). The card issuer may not submit a change-in-terms or  similar notice reflecting the change in APR, either alone or accompanied  by the original text of the agreement and original pricing information  addendum. Instead, the card issuer must revise the pricing information  addendum to reflect the change in APR and submit to the Bureau the  entire text of the agreement and the entire revised addendum, even  though no changes have been made to the provisions of the agreement and  only one item on the pricing information addendum has changed.</p><p class="depth0">58(c)(4) Withdrawal of Agreements</p><p class="depth0">1. Notice of withdrawal of agreement. Section 1026.58(c)(4) requires  a card issuer to notify the Bureau if any agreement previously submitted  to the Bureau by that issuer is no longer offered to the public by the  first quarterly submission deadline after the last day of the calendar  quarter in which the card issuer ceased to offer the agreement. For  example, on January 5 a card issuer stops offering to the public an  agreement it previously submitted to the Bureau. The card issuer must  notify the Bureau that the agreement is being withdrawn by April 30, the  first quarterly submission deadline after March 31, the last day of the  calendar quarter in which the card issuer stopped offering the  agreement.</p><p class="depth0">58(c)(5) De Minimis Exception</p><p class="depth0">1. Relationship to other exceptions. The de minimis exception is  distinct from the private label credit card exception under Sec.  1026.58(c)(6) and the product testing exception under Sec.  1026.58(c)(7). The de minimis exception provides that a card issuer with  fewer than 10,000 open credit card accounts is not required to submit  any agreements to the Bureau, regardless of whether those agreements  qualify for the private label credit card exception or the product  testing exception. In contrast, the private label credit card exception  and the product testing exception provide that a card issuer is not  required to submit to the Bureau agreements offered solely in connection  with certain types of credit card plans with fewer than 10,000 open  accounts, regardless of the card issuer's total number of open accounts.</p><p class="depth0">2. De minimis exception. Under Sec. 1026.58(c)(5), a card issuer is  not required to submit any credit card agreements to the Bureau under  Sec. 1026.58(c)(1) if the card issuer has fewer than 10,000 open credit  card accounts as of the last business day of the calendar quarter. For  example, a card issuer offers five credit card agreements to the public  as of September 30.   However, the card issuer has only 2,000 open credit card accounts as of  September 30. The card issuer is not required to submit any agreements  to the Bureau by October 31 because the issuer qualifies for the de  minimis exception.</p><p class="depth0">3. Date for determining whether card issuer qualifies clarified.  Whether a card issuer qualifies for the de minimis exception is  determined as of the last business day of each calendar quarter. For  example, as of December 31, a card issuer offers three agreements to the  public and has 9,500 open credit card accounts. As of January 30, the  card issuer still offers three agreements, but has 10,100 open accounts.  As of March 31, the card issuer still offers three agreements, but has  only 9,700 open accounts. Even though the card issuer had 10,100 open  accounts at one time during the calendar quarter, the card issuer  qualifies for the de minimis exception because the number of open  accounts was less than 10,000 as of March 31. The card issuer therefore  is not required to submit any agreements to the Bureau under Sec.  1026.58(c)(1) by April 30.</p><p class="depth0">4. Date for determining whether card issuer ceases to qualify  clarified. Whether a card issuer has ceased to qualify for the de  minimis exception under Sec. 1026.58(c)(5) is determined as of the last  business day of the calendar quarter, For example, as of June 30, a card  issuer offers three agreements to the public and has 9,500 open credit  card accounts. The card issuer is not required to submit any agreements  to the Bureau under Sec. 1026.58(c)(1) because the card issuer  qualifies for the de minimis exception. As of July 15, the card issuer  still offers the same three agreements, but now has 10,000 open  accounts. The card issuer is not required to take any action at this  time, because whether a card issuer qualifies for the de minimis  exception under Sec. 1026.58(c)(5) is determined as of the last  business day of the calendar quarter. As of September 30, the card  issuer still offers the same three agreements and still has 10,000 open  accounts. Because the card issuer had 10,000 open accounts as of  September 30, the card issuer ceased to qualify for the de minimis  exception and must submit the three agreements it offers to the Bureau  by October 31, the next quarterly submission deadline.</p><p class="depth0">5. Option to withdraw agreements clarified. Section 1026.58(c)(5)  provides that if a card issuer that did not previously qualify for the  de minimis exception qualifies for the de minimis exception, the card  issuer must continue to make quarterly submissions to the Bureau as  required by Sec. 1026.58(c)(1) until the card issuer notifies the  Bureau that the issuer is withdrawing all agreements it previously  submitted to the Bureau. For example, a card issuer has 10,001 open  accounts and offers three agreements to the public as of December 31.  The card issuer has submitted each of the three agreements to the Bureau  as required under Sec. 1026.58(c)(1). As of March 31, the card issuer  has only 9,999 open accounts. The card issuer has two options. First,  the card issuer may notify the Bureau that the card issuer is  withdrawing each of the three agreements it previously submitted. Once  the card issuer has notified the Bureau, the card issuer is no longer  required to make quarterly submissions to the Bureau under Sec.  1026.58(c)(1). Alternatively, the card issuer may choose not to notify  the Bureau that it is withdrawing its agreements. In this case, the card  issuer must continue making quarterly submissions to the Bureau as  required by Sec. 1026.58(c)(1). The card issuer might choose not to  withdraw its agreements if, for example, the card issuer believes that  it likely will cease to qualify for the de minimis exception again in  the near future.</p><p class="depth0">58(c)(6) Private Label Credit Card Exception</p><p class="depth0">1. Private label credit card exception. i. Under Sec.  1026.58(c)(6)(i), a card issuer is not required to submit to the Bureau  a credit card agreement if, as of the last business day of the calendar  quarter, the agreement (A) is offered for accounts under one or more  private label credit card plans each of which has fewer than 10,000 open  accounts; and (B) is not offered to the public other than for accounts  under such a plan. For example, a card issuer offers to the public a  credit card agreement offered solely for private label credit card  accounts with credit cards that can be used only at Merchant A. The card  issuer has 8,000 open accounts with such credit cards usable only at  Merchant A. The card issuer is not required to submit this agreement to  the Bureau under Sec. 1026.58(c)(1) because the agreement is offered  for a private label credit card plan with fewer than 10,000 open  accounts, and the credit card agreement is not offered to the public  other than for accounts under that private label credit card plan.</p><p class="depth0">ii. In contrast, assume the same card issuer also offers to the  public a different credit card agreement that is offered solely for  private label credit card accounts with credit cards usable only at  Merchant B. The card issuer has 12,000 open accounts with such credit  cards usable only at Merchant B. The private label credit card exception  does not apply. Although this agreement is offered for a private label  credit card plan (i.e., the 12,000 private label credit card accounts  with credit cards usable only at Merchant B), and the agreement is not  offered to the public other than for accounts under that private label  credit card plan, the private label credit card plan has more than  10,000 open accounts. (The card issuer still is not required to submit  to the Bureau the agreement offered in connection with credit cards   usable only at Merchant A, as each agreement is evaluated separately  under the private label credit card exception.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Card issuers with small private label and other credit card  plans. Whether the private label credit card exception applies is  determined on an agreement-by-agreement basis. Therefore, some  agreements offered by a card issuer may qualify for the private label  credit card exception even though the card issuer also offers other  agreements that do not qualify, such as agreements offered for accounts  with cards usable at multiple unaffiliated merchants or agreements  offered for accounts under private label plans with 10,000 or more open  accounts.</p><p class="depth0">3. De minimis exception distinguished. The private label credit card  exception under Sec. 1026.58(c)(6) is distinct from the de minimis  exception under Sec. 1026.58(c)(5). The private label credit card  exception exempts card issuers from submitting certain agreements to the  Bureau regardless of the card issuer's overall size as measured by total  number of open accounts. In contrast, the de minimis exception exempts a  particular card issuer from submitting any credit card agreements to the  Bureau if the card issuer has fewer than 10,000 total open accounts. For  example, a card issuer offers to the public two credit card agreements.  Agreement A is offered solely for private label credit card accounts  with credit cards usable only at Merchant A. The card issuer has 5,000  open credit card accounts with such credit cards usable only at Merchant  A. Agreement B is offered solely for credit card accounts with cards  usable at multiple unaffiliated merchants that participate in a major  payment network. The card issuer has 40,000 open credit card accounts  with such payment network cards. The card issuer is not required to  submit agreement A to the Bureau under Sec. 1026.58(c)(1) because  agreement A qualifies for the private label credit card exception under  Sec. 1026.58(c)(6). Agreement A is offered for accounts under a private  label credit card plan with fewer than 10,000 open accounts (i.e., the  5,000 accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant A) and is not  otherwise offered to the public. The card issuer is required to submit  agreement B to the Bureau under Sec. 1026.58(c)(1). The card issuer  does not qualify for the de minimis exception under Sec. 1026.58(c)(5)  because it has more than 10,000 open accounts, and agreement B does not  qualify for the private label credit card exception under Sec.  1026.58(c)(6) because it is not offered solely for accounts under a  private label credit card plan with fewer than 10,000 open accounts.</p><p class="depth0">4. Agreement otherwise offered to the public. i. An agreement  qualifies for the private label exception only if it is offered for  accounts under one or more private label credit card plans with fewer  than 10,000 open accounts and is not offered to the public other than  for accounts under such a plan. For example, a card issuer offers a  single agreement to the public. The agreement is offered for private  label credit card accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant A.  The card issuer has 9,000 such open accounts with credit cards usable  only at Merchant A. The agreement also is offered for credit card  accounts with credit cards usable at multiple unaffiliated merchants  that participate in a major payment network. The agreement does not  qualify for the private label credit card exception. The agreement is  offered for accounts under a private label credit card plan with fewer  than 10,000 open accounts. However, the agreement also is offered to the  public for accounts that are not part of a private label credit card  plan and therefore does not qualify for the private label credit card  exception.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Similarly, an agreement does not qualify for the private label  credit card exception if it is offered in connection with one private  label credit card plan with fewer than 10,000 open accounts and one  private label credit card plan with 10,000 or more open accounts. For  example, a card issuer offers a single credit card agreement to the  public. The agreement is offered for two types of accounts. The first  type of account is a private label credit card account with a credit  card usable only at Merchant A. The second type of account is a private  label credit card account with a credit card usable only at Merchant B.  The card issuer has 10,000 such open accounts with credit cards usable  only at Merchant A and 5,000 such open accounts with credit cards usable  only at Merchant B. The agreement does not qualify for the private label  credit card exception. While the agreement is offered for accounts under  a private label credit card plan with fewer than 10,000 open accounts  (i.e., the 5,000 open accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant  B), the agreement is also offered for accounts not under such a plan  (i.e., the 10,000 open accounts with credit cards usable only at  Merchant A).</p><p class="depth0">5. Agreement used for multiple small private label plans. The  private label exception applies even if the same agreement is used for  more than one private label credit card plan with fewer than 10,000 open  accounts. For example, a card issuer has 15,000 total open private label  credit card accounts. Of these, 7,000 accounts have credit cards usable  only at Merchant A, 5,000 accounts have credit cards usable only at  Merchant B, and 3,000 accounts have credit cards usable only at Merchant  C. The card issuer offers to the public a single credit card agreement  that is offered for all three types of accounts and is not offered for  any other type of account. The card issuer is not required to submit the  agreement to the Bureau under Sec. 1026.58(c)(1).   The agreement is used for three different private label credit card  plans (i.e., the accounts with credit cards usable at Merchant A, the  accounts with credit cards usable at Merchant B, and the accounts with  credit cards usable at Merchant C), each of which has fewer than 10,000  open accounts, and the card issuer does not offer the agreement for any  other type of account. The agreement therefore qualifies for the private  label credit card exception under Sec. 1026.58(c)(6).</p><p class="depth0">6. Multiple agreements used for one private label credit card plan.  The private label credit card exception applies even if a card issuer  offers more than one agreement in connection with a particular private  label credit card plan. For example, a card issuer has 5,000 open  private label credit card accounts with credit cards usable only at  Merchant A. The card issuer offers to the public three different  agreements each of which may be used in connection with private label  credit card accounts with credit cards usable only at Merchant A. The  agreements are not offered for any other type of credit card account.  The card issuer is not required to submit any of the three agreements to  the Bureau under Sec. 1026.58(c)(1) because each of the agreements is  used for a private label credit card plan which has fewer than 10,000  open accounts and none of the three is offered to the public other than  for accounts under such a plan.</p><p class="depth0">58(c)(8) Form and content of agreements submitted to the Bureau</p><p class="depth0">1. ``As of'' date clarified. Agreements submitted to the Bureau must  contain the provisions of the agreement and pricing information in  effect as of the last business day of the preceding calendar quarter.  For example, on June 1, a card issuer decides to decrease the purchase  APR associated with one of the agreements it offers to the public. The  change in the APR will become effective on August 1. If the card issuer  submits the agreement to the Bureau on July 31 (for example, because the  agreement has been otherwise amended), the agreement submitted should  not include the new lower APR because that APR was not in effect on June  30, the last business day of the preceding calendar quarter.</p><p class="depth0">2. Pricing agreement addendum. Pricing information must be set forth  in the separate addendum described in Sec. 1026.58(c)(8)(ii)(A) even if  it is also stated elsewhere in the agreement.</p><p class="depth0">3. Pricing agreement variations do not constitute separate  agreements. Pricing information that may vary from one cardholder to  another depending on the cardholder's creditworthiness or state of  residence or other factors must be disclosed by setting forth all the  possible variations or by providing a range of possible variations. Two  agreements that differ only with respect to variations in the pricing  information do not constitute separate agreements for purposes of this  section. For example, a card issuer offers two types of credit card  accounts that differ only with respect to the purchase APR. The purchase  APR for one type of account is 15 percent, while the purchase APR for  the other type of account is 18 percent. The provisions of the agreement  and pricing information for the two types of accounts are otherwise  identical. The card issuer should not submit to the Bureau one agreement  with a pricing information addendum listing a 15 percent purchase APR  and another agreement with a pricing information addendum listing an 18  percent purchase APR. Instead, the card issuer should submit to the  Bureau one agreement with a pricing information addendum listing  possible purchase APRs of 15 or 18 percent.</p><p class="depth0">4. Optional variable terms addendum. Examples of provisions that  might be included in the variable terms addendum include a clause that  is required by law to be included in credit card agreements in a  particular state but not in other states (unless, for example, a clause  is included in the agreement used for all cardholders under a heading  such as ``For State X Residents''), the name of the credit card plan to  which the agreement applies (if this information is included in the  agreement), or the name of a charitable organization to which donations  will be made in connection with a particular card (if this information  is included in the agreement).</p><p class="depth0">5. Integrated agreement requirement. Card issuers may not provide  provisions of the agreement or pricing information in the form of  change-in-terms notices or riders. The only two addenda that may be  submitted as part of an agreement are the pricing information addendum  and optional variable terms addendum described in Sec. 1026.58(c)(8).  Changes in provisions or pricing information must be integrated into the  body of the agreement, pricing information addendum, or optional  variable terms addendum described in Sec. 1026.58(c)(8). For example,  it would be impermissible for a card issuer to submit to the Bureau an  agreement in the form of a terms and conditions document dated January  1, 2005, four subsequent change in terms notices, and 2 addenda showing  variations in pricing information. Instead, the card issuer must submit  a document that integrates the changes made by each of the change in  terms notices into the body of the original terms and conditions  document and a single addendum displaying variations in pricing  information.</p><p class="depth0">58(d) Posting of Agreements Offered to the Public</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirement applies only to agreements submitted to the Bureau.  Card issuers are only required to post and maintain on their publicly  available Web site the credit card   agreements that the card issuer must submit to the Bureau under Sec.  1026.58(c). If, for example, a card issuer is not required to submit any  agreements to the Bureau because the card issuer qualifies for the de  minimis exception under Sec. 1026.58(c)(5), the card issuer is not  required to post and maintain any agreements on its Web site under Sec.  1026.58(d). Similarly, if a card issuer is not required to submit a  specific agreement to the Bureau, such as an agreement that qualifies  for the private label exception under Sec. 1026.58(c)(6), the card  issuer is not required to post and maintain that agreement under Sec.  1026.58(d) (either on the card issuer's publicly available Web site or  on the publicly available Web sites of merchants at which private label  credit cards can be used). (The card issuer in both of these cases is  still required to provide each individual cardholder with access to his  or her specific credit card agreement under Sec. 1026.58(e) by posting  and maintaining the agreement on the card issuer's Web site or by  providing a copy of the agreement upon the cardholder's request.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Card issuers that do not otherwise maintain Web sites. Unlike  Sec. 1026.58(e), Sec. 1026.58(d) does not include a special rule for  card issuers that do not otherwise maintain a Web site. If a card issuer  is required to submit one or more agreements to the Bureau under Sec.  1026.58(c), that card issuer must post those agreements on a publicly  available Web site it maintains (or, with respect to an agreement for a  private label credit card, on the publicly available Web site of at  least one of the merchants at which the card may be used, as provided in  Sec. 1026.58(d)(1)). If an issuer provides cardholders with access to  specific information about their individual accounts, such as balance  information or copies of statements, through a third-party Web site, the  issuer is considered to maintain that Web site for purposes of Sec.  1026.58. Such a third-party Web site is deemed to be maintained by the  issuer for purposes of Sec. 1026.58(d) even where, for example, an  unaffiliated entity designs the Web site and owns and maintains the  information technology infrastructure that supports the Web site,  cardholders with credit cards from multiple issuers can access  individual account information through the same Web site, and the Web  site is not labeled, branded, or otherwise held out to the public as  belonging to the issuer. Therefore, issuers that provide cardholders  with access to account-specific information through a third-party Web  site can comply with Sec. 1026.58(d) by ensuring that the agreements  the issuer submits to the Bureau are posted on the third-party Web site  in accordance with Sec. 1026.58(d). (In contrast, the Sec.  1026.58(d)(1) rule regarding agreements for private label credit cards  is not conditioned on cardholders' ability to access account-specific  information through the merchant's Web site.)</p><p class="depth0">3. Private label credit card plans. i. Section 1026.58(d) provides  that, with respect to an agreement offered solely for accounts under one  or more private label credit card plans, a card issuer may comply by  posting and maintaining the agreement on the Web site of at least one of  the merchants at which the cards issued under each private label credit  card plan with 10,000 or more open accounts may be used. For example, a  card issuer has 100,000 open private label credit card accounts. Of  these, 75,000 open accounts have credit cards usable only at Merchant A  and 25,000 open accounts have credit cards usable only at Merchant B and  Merchant B's affiliates, Merchants C and D. The card issuer offers to  the public a single credit card agreement that is offered for both of  these types of accounts and is not offered for any other type of  account.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The card issuer is required to submit the agreement to the  Bureau under Sec. 1026.58(c)(1). (The card issuer has more than 10,000  open accounts, so the Sec. 1026.58(c)(5) de minimis exception does not  apply. The agreement is offered solely for two different private label  credit card plans (i.e., one plan consisting of the accounts with credit  cards usable at Merchant A and one plan consisting of the accounts with  credit cards usable at Merchant B and its affiliates, Merchants C and  D), but both of these plans have more than 10,000 open accounts, so the  Sec. 1026.58(c)(6) private label credit card exception does not apply.  Finally, the agreement is not offered solely in connection with a  product test by the card issuer, so the Sec. 1026.58(c)(7) product test  exception does not apply.)</p><p class="depth0">iii. Because the card issuer is required to submit the agreement to  the Bureau under Sec. 1026.58(c)(1), the card issuer is required to  post and maintain the agreement on the card issuer's publicly available  Web site under Sec. 1026.58(d). However, because the agreement is  offered solely for accounts under one or more private label credit card  plans, the card issuer may comply with Sec. 1026.58(d) in either of two  ways. First, the card issuer may comply by posting and maintaining the  agreement on the card issuer's own publicly available Web site.  Alternatively, the card issuer may comply by posting and maintaining the  agreement on the publicly available Web site of Merchant A and the  publicly available Web site of at least one of Merchants B, C and D. It  would not be sufficient for the card issuer to post the agreement on  Merchant A's Web site alone because Sec. 1026.58(d) requires the card  issuer to post the agreement on the publicly available Web site of ``at  least one of the merchants at which cards issued under each private  label credit card plan may be used'' (emphasis added).</p><p class="depth0">iv. In contrast, assume that a card issuer has 100,000 open private  label credit card accounts. Of these, 5,000 open accounts have   credit cards usable only at Merchant A and 95,000 open accounts have  credit cards usable only at Merchant B and Merchant B's affiliates,  Merchants C and D. The card issuer offers to the public a single credit  card agreement that is offered for both of these types of accounts and  is not offered for any other type of account.</p><p class="depth0">v. The card issuer is required to submit the agreement to the Bureau  under Sec. 1026.58(c)(1). (The card issuer has more than 10,000 open  accounts, so the Sec. 1026.58(c)(5) de minimis exception does not  apply. The agreement is offered solely for two different private label  credit card plans (i.e., one plan consisting of the accounts with credit  cards usable at Merchant A and one plan consisting of the accounts with  credit cards usable at Merchant B and its affiliates, Merchants C and  D), but one of these plans has more than 10,000 open accounts, so the  Sec. 1026.58(c)(6) private label credit card exception does not apply.  Finally, the agreement is not offered solely in connection with a  product test by the card issuer, so the Sec. 1026.58(c)(7) product test  exception does not apply.)</p><p class="depth0">vi. Because the card issuer is required to submit the agreement to  the Bureau under Sec. 1026.58(c)(1), the card issuer is required to  post and maintain the agreement on the card issuer's publicly available  Web site under Sec. 1026.58(d). However, because the agreement is  offered solely for accounts under one or more private label credit card  plans, the card issuer may comply with Sec. 1026.58(d) in either of two  ways. First, the card issuer may comply by posting and maintaining the  agreement on the card issuer's own publicly available Web site.  Alternatively, the card issuer may comply by posting and maintaining the  agreement on the publicly available Web site of at least one of  Merchants B, C and D. The card issuer is not required to post and  maintain the agreement on the publicly available Web site of Merchant A  because the card issuer's private label credit card plan consisting of  accounts with cards usable only at Merchant A has fewer than 10,000 open  accounts.</p><p class="depth0">58(e) Agreements for All Open Accounts</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirement applies to all open accounts. The requirement to  provide access to credit card agreements under Sec. 1026.58(e) applies  to all open credit card accounts, regardless of whether such agreements  are required to be submitted to the Bureau pursuant to Sec. 1026.58(c)  (or posted on the card issuer's Web site pursuant to Sec. 1026.58(d)).  For example, a card issuer that is not required to submit agreements to  the Bureau because it qualifies for the de minimis exception under Sec.  1026.58(c)(5)) would still be required to provide cardholders with  access to their specific agreements under Sec. 1026.58(e). Similarly,  an agreement that is no longer offered to the public would not be  required to be submitted to the Bureau under Sec. 1026.58(c), but would  still need to be provided to the cardholder to whom it applies under  Sec. 1026.58(e).</p><p class="depth0">2. Readily available telephone line. Section 1026.58(e) provides  that card issuers that provide copies of cardholder agreements upon  request must provide the cardholder with the ability to request a copy  of their agreement by calling a readily available telephone line. To  satisfy the readily available standard, the financial institution must  provide enough telephone lines so that consumers get a reasonably prompt  response. The institution need only provide telephone service during  normal business hours. Within its primary service area, an institution  must provide a local or toll-free telephone number. It need not provide  a toll-free number or accept collect long-distance calls from outside  the area where it normally conducts business.</p><p class="depth0">3. Issuers without interactive Web sites. Section 1026.58(e)(2)  provides that a card issuer that does not maintain a Web site from which  cardholders can access specific information about their individual  accounts is not required to provide a cardholder with the ability to  request a copy of the agreement by using the card issuer's Web site. A  card issuer without a Web site of any kind could comply by disclosing  the telephone number on each periodic statement; a card issuer with a  non-interactive Web site could comply in the same way, or alternatively  could comply by displaying the telephone number on the card issuer's Web  site. An issuer is considered to maintain an interactive Web site for  purposes of the Sec. 1026.58(e)(2) special rule if the issuer provide  cardholders with access to specific information about their individual  accounts, such as balance information or copies of statements, through a  third-party interactive Web site. Such a Web site is deemed to be  maintained by the issuer for purposes of Sec. 1026.58(e)(2) even where,  for example, an unaffiliated entity designs the Web site and owns and  maintains the information technology infrastructure that supports the  Web site, cardholders with credit cards from multiple issuers can access  individual account information through the same Web site, and the Web  site is not labeled, branded, or otherwise held out to the public as  belonging to the issuer. An issuer that provides cardholders with access  to specific information about their individual accounts through such a  Web site is not permitted to comply with the special rule in Sec.  1026.58(e)(2). Instead, such an issuer must comply with Sec.  1026.58(e)(1).</p><p class="depth0">4. Deadline for providing requested agreements clarified. Sections  1026.58(e)(1)(ii) and (e)(2) require that credit card agreements  provided upon request must be sent to the cardholder or otherwise made  available to the cardholder in electronic or paper form no   later than 30 days after the cardholder's request is received. For  example, if a card issuer chooses to respond to a cardholder's request  by mailing a paper copy of the cardholder's agreement, the card issuer  must mail the agreement no later than 30 days after receipt of the  cardholder's request. Alternatively, if a card issuer chooses to respond  to a cardholder's request by posting the cardholder's agreement on the  card issuer's Web site, the card issuer must post the agreement on its  Web site no later than 30 days after receipt of the cardholder's  request. Section 1026.58(e)(3)(v) provides that a card issuer may  provide cardholder agreements in either electronic or paper form  regardless of the form of the cardholder's request.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.59--Reevaluation of Rate Increases</p><p class="depth0">59(a) General Rule</p><p class="depth0">59(a)(1) Evaluation of Increased Rate</p><p class="depth0">1. Types of rate increases covered. Section 1026.59(a) applies both  to increases in annual percentage rates imposed on a consumer's account  based on that consumer's credit risk or other circumstances specific to  that consumer and to increases in annual percentage rates imposed based  on factors that are not specific to the consumer, such as changes in  market conditions or the issuer's cost of funds.</p><p class="depth0">2. Rate increases actually imposed. Under Sec. 1026.59(a), a card  issuer must review changes in factors only if the increased rate is  actually imposed on the consumer's account. For example, if a card  issuer increases the penalty rate for a credit card account under an  open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan and the consumer's  account has no balances that are currently subject to the penalty rate,  the card issuer is required to provide a notice pursuant to Sec.  1026.9(c) of the change in terms, but the requirements of Sec. 1026.59  do not apply. However, if the consumer's account later becomes subject  to the penalty rate, the card issuer is required to provide a notice  pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(g) and the requirements of Sec. 1026.59 begin  to apply upon imposition of the penalty rate. Similarly, if a card  issuer raises the cash advance rate applicable to a consumer's account  but the consumer engages in no cash advance transactions to which that  increased rate is applied, the card issuer is required to provide a  notice pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(c) of the change in terms, but the  requirements of Sec. 1026.59 do not apply. If the consumer subsequently  engages in a cash advance transaction, the requirements of Sec. 1026.59  begin to apply at that time.</p><p class="depth0">3. Change in type of rate. i. Generally. A change from a variable  rate to a non-variable rate or from a non-variable rate to a variable  rate is not a rate increase for purposes of Sec. 1026.59, if the rate  in effect immediately prior to the change in type of rate is equal to or  greater than the rate in effect immediately after the change. For  example, a change from a variable rate of 15.99% to a non-variable rate  of 15.99% is not a rate increase for purposes of Sec. 1026.59 at the  time of the change. See Sec. 1026.55 for limitations on the  permissibility of changing from a non-variable rate to a variable rate.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Change from non-variable rate to variable rate. A change from a  non-variable to a variable rate constitutes a rate increase for purposes  of Sec. 1026.59 if the variable rate exceeds the non-variable rate that  would have applied if the change in type of rate had not occurred. For  example, assume a new credit card account under an open-end (not home- secured) consumer credit plan is opened on January 1 of year 1 and that  a non-variable annual percentage rate of 12% applies to all transactions  on the account. On January 1 of year 2, upon 45 days' advance notice  pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(c)(2), the rate on all new transactions is  changed to a variable rate that is currently 12% and is determined by  adding a margin of 10 percentage points to a publicly-available index  not under the card issuer's control. The change from the 12% non- variable rate to the 12% variable rate on January 1 of year 2 is not a  rate increase for purposes of Sec. 1026.59(a). On April 1 of year 2,  the value of the variable rate increases to 12.5%. The increase in the  rate from 12% to 12.5% is a rate increase for purposes of Sec. 1026.59,  and the card issuer must begin periodically conducting reviews of the  account pursuant to Sec. 1026.59. The increase that must be evaluated  for purposes of Sec. 1026.59 is the increase from a non-variable rate  of 12% to a variable rate of 12.5%.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Change from variable rate to non-variable rate. A change from a  variable to a non-variable rate constitutes a rate increase for purposes  of Sec. 1026.59 if the non-variable rate exceeds the variable rate that  would have applied if the change in type of rate had not occurred. For  example, assume a new credit card account under an open-end (not home- secured) consumer credit plan is opened on January 1 of year 1 and that  a variable annual percentage rate that is currently 15% and is  determined by adding a margin of 10 percentage points to a publicly- available index not under the card issuer's control applies to all  transactions on the account. On January 1 of year 2, upon 45 days'  advance notice pursuant to Sec. 1026.9(c)(2), the rate on all existing  balances and new transactions is changed to a non-variable rate that is  currently 15%. The change from the 15% variable rate to the 15% non- variable rate on January 1 of year 2 is not a rate increase for purposes  of Sec. 1026.59(a). On April 1 of year 2, the value of the variable  rate that would have applied to the account decreases to 12.5%.  Accordingly, on April 1 of year 2, the   non-variable rate of 15% exceeds the 12.5% variable rate that would have  applied but for the change in type of rate. At this time, the change to  the non-variable rate of 15% constitutes a rate increase for purposes of  Sec. 1026.59, and the card issuer must begin periodically conducting  reviews of the account pursuant to Sec. 1026.59. The increase that must  be evaluated for purposes of Sec. 1026.59 is the increase from a  variable rate of 12.5% to a non-variable rate of 15%.</p><p class="depth0">4. Rate increases prior to effective date of rule. For increases in  annual percentage rates made on or after January 1, 2009, and prior to  August 22, 2010, Sec. 1026.59(a) requires the card issuer to review the  factors described in Sec. 1026.59(d) and reduce the rate, as  appropriate, if the rate increase is of a type for which 45 days'  advance notice would currently be required under Sec. 1026.9(c)(2) or  (g). For example, 45 days' notice is not required under Sec.  1026.9(c)(2) if the rate increase results from the increase in the index  by which a properly-disclosed variable rate is determined in accordance  with Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(C) or if the increase occurs upon expiration  of a specified period of time and disclosures complying with Sec.  1026.9(c)(2)(v)(B) have been provided. The requirements of Sec. 1026.59  do not apply to such rate increases.</p><p class="depth0">5. Amount of rate decrease. i. General. Even in circumstances where  a rate reduction is required, Sec. 1026.59 does not require that a card  issuer decrease the rate that applies to a credit card account to the  rate that was in effect prior to the rate increase subject to Sec.  1026.59(a). The amount of the rate decrease that is required must be  determined based upon the card issuer's reasonable policies and  procedures under Sec. 1026.59(b) for consideration of factors described  in Sec. 1026.59(a) and (d). For example, assume a consumer's rate on  new purchases is increased from a variable rate of 15.99% to a variable  rate of 23.99% based on the consumer's making a required minimum  periodic payment five days late. The consumer makes all of the payments  required on the account on time for the six months following the rate  increase. Assume that the card issuer evaluates the account by reviewing  the factors on which the increase in an annual percentage rate was  originally based, in accordance with Sec. 1026.59(d)(1)(i). The card  issuer is not required to decrease the consumer's rate to the 15.99%  that applied prior to the rate increase. However, the card issuer's  policies and procedures for performing the review required by Sec.  1026.59(a) must be reasonable, as required by Sec. 1026.59(b), and must  take into account any reduction in the consumer's credit risk based upon  the consumer's timely payments.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Change in type of rate. If the rate increase subject to Sec.  1026.59 involves a change from a variable rate to a non-variable rate or  from a non-variable rate to a variable rate, Sec. 1026.59 does not  require that the issuer reinstate the same type of rate that applied  prior to the change. However, the amount of any rate decrease that is  required must be determined based upon the card issuer's reasonable  policies and procedures under Sec. 1026.59(b) for consideration of  factors described in Sec. 1026.59(a) and (d).</p><p class="depth0">59(a)(2) Rate Reductions</p><p class="depth0">59(a)(2)(ii) Applicability of Rate Reduction</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicability of reduced rate to new transactions. Section  1026.59(a)(2)(ii) requires, in part, that any reduction in rate required  pursuant to Sec. 1026.59(a)(1) must apply to new transactions that  occur after the effective date of the rate reduction, if those  transactions would otherwise have been subject to the increased rate  described in Sec. 1026.59(a)(1). A credit card account may have  multiple types of balances, for example, purchases, cash advances, and  balance transfers, to which different rates apply. For example, assume a  new credit card account opened on January 1 of year one has a rate  applicable to purchases of 15% and a rate applicable to cash advances  and balance transfers of 20%. Effective March 1 of year two, consistent  with the limitations in Sec. 1026.55 and upon giving notice required by  Sec. 1026.9(c)(2), the card issuer raises the rate applicable to new  purchases to 18% based on market conditions. The only transaction in  which the consumer engages in year two is a $1,000 purchase made on July  1. The rate for cash advances and balance transfers remains at 20%.  Based on a subsequent review required by Sec. 1026.59(a)(1), the card  issuer determines that the rate on purchases must be reduced to 16%.  Section 1026.59(a)(2)(ii) requires that the 16% rate be applied to the  $1,000 purchase made on July 1 and to all new purchases. The rate for  new cash advances and balance transfers may remain at 20%, because there  was no rate increase applicable to those types of transactions and,  therefore, the requirements of Sec. 1026.59(a) do not apply.</p><p class="depth0">59(c) Timing</p><p class="depth0">1. In general. The issuer may review all of its accounts subject to  Sec. 1026.59(a) at the same time once every six months, may review each  account once each six months on a rolling basis based on the date on  which the rate was increased for that account, or may otherwise review  each account not less frequently than once every six months.</p><p class="depth0">2. Example. A card issuer increases the rates applicable to one half  of its credit card accounts on June 1, 2011. The card issuer increases  the rates applicable to the other half of its credit card accounts on  September 1, 2011. The card issuer may review the rate increases for all  of its credit card accounts on or before December 1, 2011, and at least  every   six months thereafter. In the alternative, the card issuer may first  review the rate increases for the accounts that were repriced on June 1,  2011 on or before December 1, 2011, and may first review the rate  increases for the accounts that were repriced on September 1, 2011 on or  before March 1, 2012.</p><p class="depth0">3. Rate increases prior to effective date of rule. For increases in  annual percentage rates applicable to a credit card account under an  open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan on or after January 1,  2009 and prior to August 22, 2010, Sec. 1026.59(c) requires that the  first review for such rate increases be conducted prior to February 22,  2011.</p><p class="depth0">59(d) Factors</p><p class="depth0">1. Change in factors. A creditor that complies with Sec. 1026.59(a)  by reviewing the factors it currently considers in determining the  annual percentage rates applicable to similar new credit card accounts  may change those factors from time to time. When a creditor changes the  factors it considers in determining the annual percentage rates  applicable to similar new credit card accounts from time to time, it may  comply with Sec. 1026.59(a) by reviewing the set of factors it  considered immediately prior to the change in factors for a brief  transition period, or may consider the new factors. For example, a  creditor changes the factors it uses to determine the rates applicable  to similar new credit card accounts on January 1, 2012. The creditor  reviews the rates applicable to its existing accounts that have been  subject to a rate increase pursuant to Sec. 1026.59(a) on January 25,  2012. The creditor complies with Sec. 1026.59(a) by reviewing, at its  option, either the factors that it considered on December 31, 2011 when  determining the rates applicable to similar new credit card accounts or  the factors that it considers as of January 25, 2012. For purposes of  compliance with Sec. 1026.59(d), a transition period of 60 days from  the change of factors constitutes a brief transition period.</p><p class="depth0">2. Comparison of existing account to factors used for similar new  accounts. Under Sec. 1026.59(a), if a creditor evaluates an existing  account using the same factors that it considers in determining the  rates applicable to similar new accounts, the review of factors need not  result in existing accounts being subject to exactly the same rates and  rate structure as a creditor imposes on similar new accounts. For  example, a creditor may offer variable rates on similar new accounts  that are computed by adding a margin that depends on various factors to  the value of the LIBOR index. The account that the creditor is required  to review pursuant to Sec. 1026.59(a) may have variable rates that were  determined by adding a different margin, depending on different factors,  to a published prime rate. In performing the review required by Sec.  1026.59(a), the creditor may review the factors it uses to determine the  rates applicable to similar new accounts. If a rate reduction is  required, however, the creditor need not base the variable rate for the  existing account on the LIBOR index but may continue to use the  published prime rate. Section 1026.59(a) requires, however, that the  rate on the existing account after the reduction, as determined by  adding the published prime rate and margin, be comparable to the rate,  as determined by adding the margin and LIBOR, charged on a new account  for which the factors are comparable.</p><p class="depth0">3. Similar new credit card accounts. A card issuer complying with  Sec. 1026.59(d)(1)(ii) is required to consider the factors that the  card issuer currently considers when determining the annual percentage  rates applicable to similar new credit card accounts under an open-end  (not home-secured) consumer credit plan. For example, a card issuer may  review different factors in determining the annual percentage rate that  applies to credit card plans for which the consumer pays an annual fee  and receives rewards points than it reviews in determining the rates for  credit card plans with no annual fee and no rewards points. Similarly, a  card issuer may review different factors in determining the annual  percentage rate that applies to private label credit cards than it  reviews in determining the rates applicable to credit cards that can be  used at a wider variety of merchants. In addition, a card issuer may  review different factors in determining the annual percentage rate that  applies to private label credit cards usable only at Merchant A than it  may review for private label credit cards usable only at Merchant B.  However, Sec. 1026.59(d)(1)(ii) requires a card issuer to review the  factors it considers when determining the rates for new credit card  accounts with similar features that are offered for similar purposes.</p><p class="depth0">4. No similar new credit card accounts. In some circumstances, a  card issuer that complies with Sec. 1026.59(a) by reviewing the factors  that it currently considers in determining the annual percentage rates  applicable to similar new accounts may not be able to identify a class  of new accounts that are similar to the existing accounts on which a  rate increase has been imposed. For example, consumers may have existing  credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer  credit plan but the card issuer may no longer offer a product to new  consumers with similar characteristics, such as the availability of  rewards, size of credit line, or other features. Similarly, some  consumers' accounts may have been closed and therefore cannot be used  for new transactions, while all new accounts can be used for new  transactions. In those circumstances, Sec. 1026.59 requires that the  card   issuer nonetheless perform a review of the rate increase on the existing  customers' accounts. A card issuer does not comply with Sec. 1026.59 by  maintaining an increased rate without performing such an evaluation. In  such circumstances, Sec. 1026.59(d)(1)(ii) requires that the card  issuer compare the existing accounts to the most closely comparable new  accounts that it offers.</p><p class="depth0">5. Consideration of consumer's conduct on existing account. A card  issuer that complies with Sec. 1026.59(a) by reviewing the factors that  it currently considers in determining the annual percentage rates  applicable to similar new accounts may consider the consumer's payment  or other account behavior on the existing account only to the same  extent and in the same manner that the issuer considers such information  when one of its current cardholders applies for a new account with the  card issuer. For example, a card issuer might obtain consumer reports  for all of its applicants. The consumer reports contain certain  information regarding the applicant's past performance on existing  credit card accounts. However, the card issuer may have additional  information about an existing cardholder's payment history or account  usage that does not appear in the consumer report and that, accordingly,  it would not generally have for all new applicants. For example, a  consumer may have made a payment that is five days late on his or her  account with the card issuer, but this information does not appear on  the consumer report. The card issuer may consider this additional  information in performing its review under Sec. 1026.59(a), but only to  the extent and in the manner that it considers such information if a  current cardholder applies for a new account with the issuer.</p><p class="depth0">6. Multiple rate increases between January 1, 2009 and February 21,  2010. i. General. Section 1026.59(d)(2) applies if an issuer increased  the rate applicable to a credit card account under an open-end (not  home-secured) consumer credit plan between January 1, 2009 and February  21, 2010, and the increase was not based solely upon factors specific to  the consumer. In some cases, a credit card account may have been subject  to multiple rate increases during the period from January 1, 2009 to  February 21, 2010. Some such rate increases may have been based solely  upon factors specific to the consumer, while others may have been based  on factors not specific to the consumer, such as the issuer's cost of  funds or market conditions. In such circumstances, when conducting the  first two reviews required under Sec. 1026.59, the card issuer may  separately review: (i) Rate increases imposed based on factors not  specific to the consumer, using the factors described in Sec.  1026.59(d)(1)(ii) (as required by Sec. 1026.59(d)(2)); and (ii) rate  increases imposed based on consumer-specific factors, using the factors  described in Sec. 1026.59(d)(1)(i). If the review of factors described  in Sec. 1026.59(d)(1)(i) indicates that it is appropriate to continue  to apply a penalty or other increased rate to the account as a result of  the consumer's payment history or other factors specific to the  consumer, Sec. 1026.59 permits the card issuer to continue to impose  the penalty or other increased rate, even if the review of the factors  described in Sec. 1026.59(d)(1)(ii) would otherwise require a rate  decrease.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Example. Assume a credit card account was subject to a rate of  15% on all transactions as of January 1, 2009. On May 1, 2009, the  issuer increased the rate on existing balances and new transactions to  18%, based upon market conditions or other factors not specific to the  consumer or the consumer's account. Subsequently, on September 1, 2009,  based on a payment that was received five days after the due date, the  issuer increased the applicable rate on existing balances and new  transactions from 18% to a penalty rate of 25%. When conducting the  first review required under Sec. 1026.59, the card issuer reviews the  rate increase from 15% to 18% using the factors described in Sec.  1026.59(d)(1)(ii) (as required by Sec. 1026.59(d)(2)), and separately  but concurrently reviews the rate increase from 18% to 25% using the  factors described in paragraph Sec. 1026.59(d)(1)(i). The review of the  rate increase from 15% to 18% based upon the factors described in Sec.  1026.59(d)(1)(ii) indicates that a similarly situated new consumer would  receive a rate of 17%. The review of the rate increase from 18% to 25%  based upon the factors described in Sec. 1026.59(d)(1)(i) indicates  that it is appropriate to continue to apply the 25% penalty rate based  upon the consumer's late payment. Section 1026.59 permits the rate on  the account to remain at 25%.</p><p class="depth0">59(f) Termination of Obligation to Review Factors</p><p class="depth0">1. Revocation of temporary rates. i. In general. If an annual  percentage rate is increased due to revocation of a temporary rate,  Sec. 1026.59(a) requires that the card issuer periodically review the  increased rate. In contrast, if the rate increase results from the  expiration of a temporary rate previously disclosed in accordance with  Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(B), the review requirements in Sec. 1026.59(a) do  not apply. If a temporary rate is revoked such that the requirements of  Sec. 1026.59(a) apply, Sec. 1026.59(f) permits an issuer to terminate  the review of the rate increase if and when the applicable rate is the  same as the rate that would have applied if the increase had not  occurred.ii. Examples. Assume that on January 1, 2011, a consumer opens  a new credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer  credit plan. The annual percentage rate applicable to purchases is 15%.  The card issuer offers the consumer a 10% rate on purchases   made between February 1, 2012 and August 1, 2013 and discloses pursuant  to Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(B) that on August 1, 2013 the rate on purchases  will revert to the original 15% rate. The consumer makes a payment that  is five days late in July 2012.</p><p class="depth0">A. Upon providing 45 days' advance notice and to the extent  permitted under Sec. 1026.55, the card issuer increases the rate  applicable to new purchases to 15%, effective on September 1, 2012. The  card issuer must review that rate increase under Sec. 1026.59(a) at  least once each six months during the period from September 1, 2012 to  August 1, 2013, unless and until the card issuer reduces the rate to  10%. The card issuer performs reviews of the rate increase on January 1,  2013 and July 1, 2013. Based on those reviews, the rate applicable to  purchases remains at 15%. Beginning on August 1, 2013, the card issuer  is not required to continue periodically reviewing the rate increase,  because if the temporary rate had expired in accordance with its  previously disclosed terms, the 15% rate would have applied to purchase  balances as of August 1, 2013 even if the rate increase had not occurred  on September 1, 2012.</p><p class="depth0">B. Same facts as above except that the review conducted on July 1,  2013 indicates that a reduction to the original temporary rate of 10% is  appropriate. Section 1026.59(a)(2)(i) requires that the rate be reduced  no later than 45 days after completion of the review, or no later than  August 15, 2013. Because the temporary rate would have expired prior to  the date on which the rate decrease is required to take effect, the card  issuer may, at its option, reduce the rate to 10% for any portion of the  period from July 1, 2013, to August 1, 2013, or may continue to impose  the 15% rate for that entire period. The card issuer is not required to  conduct further reviews of the 15% rate on purchases.</p><p class="depth0">C. Same facts as above except that on September 1, 2012 the card  issuer increases the rate applicable to new purchases to the penalty  rate on the consumer's account, which is 25%. The card issuer conducts  reviews of the increased rate in accordance with Sec. 1026.59 on  January 1, 2013 and July 1, 2013. Based on those reviews, the rate  applicable to purchases remains at 25%. The card issuer's obligation to  review the rate increase continues to apply after August 1, 2013,  because the 25% penalty rate exceeds the 15% rate that would have  applied if the temporary rate expired in accordance with its previously  disclosed terms. The card issuer's obligation to review the rate  terminates if and when the annual percentage rate applicable to  purchases is reduced to the 15% rate.</p><p class="depth0">2. Example--relationship to Sec. 1026.59(a). Assume that on January  1, 2011, a consumer opens a new credit card account under an open-end  (not home-secured) consumer credit plan. The annual percentage rate  applicable to purchases is 15%. Upon providing 45 days' advance notice  and to the extent permitted under Sec. 1026.55, the card issuer  increases the rate applicable to new purchases to 18%, effective on  September 1, 2012. The card issuer conducts reviews of the increased  rate in accordance with Sec. 1026.59 on January 1, 2013 and July 1,  2013, based on the factors described in Sec. 1026.59(d)(1)(ii). Based  on the January 1, 2013 review, the rate applicable to purchases remains  at 18%. In the review conducted on July 1, 2013, the card issuer  determines that, based on the relevant factors, the rate it would offer  on a comparable new account would be 14%. Consistent with Sec.  1026.59(f), Sec. 1026.59(a) requires that the card issuer reduce the  rate on the existing account to the 15% rate that was in effect prior to  the September 1, 2012 rate increase.</p><p class="depth0">59(g) Acquired Accounts</p><p class="depth0">59(g)(1) General</p><p class="depth0">1. Relationship to Sec. 1026.59(d)(2) for rate increases imposed  between January 1, 2009 and February 21, 2010. Section 1026.59(d)(2)  applies to acquired accounts. Accordingly, if a card issuer acquires  accounts on which a rate increase was imposed between January 1, 2009  and February 21, 2010 that was not based solely upon consumer-specific  factors, that acquiring card issuer must consider the factors that it  currently considers when determining the annual percentage rates  applicable to similar new credit card accounts, if it conducts either or  both of the first two reviews of such accounts that are required after  August 22, 2010 under Sec. 1026.59(a).</p><p class="depth0">59(g)(2) Review of Acquired Portfolio</p><p class="depth0">1. Example--general. A card issuer acquires a portfolio of accounts  that currently are subject to annual percentage rates of 12%, 15%, and  18%. Not later than six months after the acquisition of such accounts,  the card issuer reviews all of these accounts in accordance with the  factors that it currently uses in determining the rates applicable to  similar new credit card accounts. As a result of that review, the card  issuer decreases the rate on the accounts that are currently subject to  a 12% annual percentage rate to 10%, leaves the rate applicable to the  accounts currently subject to a 15% annual percentage rate at 15%, and  increases the rate applicable to the accounts currently subject to a  rate of 18% to 20%. Section 1026.59(g)(2) requires the card issuer to  review, no less frequently than once every six months, the accounts for  which the rate has been increased to 20%. The card issuer is not  required to review the accounts subject to 10% and 15% rates pursuant to  Sec. 1026.59(a), unless and until the card issuer makes a subsequent  rate increase applicable to those accounts.</p><p class="depth0">2. Example--penalty rates. A card issuer acquires a portfolio of  accounts that currently are subject to standard annual percentage rates  of 12% and 15%. In addition, several acquired accounts are subject to a  penalty rate of 24%. Not later than six months after the acquisition of  such accounts, the card issuer reviews all of these accounts in  accordance with the factors that it currently uses in determining the  rates applicable to similar new credit card accounts. As a result of  that review, the card issuer leaves the standard rates applicable to the  accounts at 12% and 15%, respectively. The card issuer decreases the  rate applicable to the accounts currently at 24% to its penalty rate of  23%. Section 1026.59(g)(2) requires the card issuer to review, no less  frequently than once every six months, the accounts that are subject to  a penalty rate of 23%. The card issuer is not required to review the  accounts subject to 12% and 15% rates pursuant to Sec. 1026.59(a),  unless and until the card issuer makes a subsequent rate increase  applicable to those accounts.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.60--Credit and Charge Card Applications and Solicitations</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Section 1026.60 generally requires that credit  disclosures be contained in application forms and solicitations  initiated by a card issuer to open a credit or charge card account. (See  Sec. 1026.60(a)(5) and (e)(2) for exceptions; see Sec. 1026.60(a)(1)  and accompanying commentary for the definition of solicitation; see also  Sec. 1026.2(a)(15) and accompanying commentary for the definition of  charge card.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Substitution of account-opening summary table for the disclosures  required by Sec. 1026.60. In complying with Sec. 1026.60(c), (e)(1) or  (f), a card issuer may provide the account-opening summary table  described in Sec. 1026.6(b)(1) in lieu of the disclosures required by  Sec. 1026.60, if the issuer provides the disclosures required by Sec.  1026.6 on or with the application or solicitation.</p><p class="depth0">3. Clear and conspicuous standard. See comment 5(a)(1)-1 for the  clear and conspicuous standard applicable to Sec. 1026.60 disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">60(a) General Rules</p><p class="depth0">60(a)(1) Definition of Solicitation</p><p class="depth0">1. Invitations to apply. A card issuer may contact a consumer who  has not been preapproved for a card account about opening an account  (whether by direct mail, telephone, or other means) and invite the  consumer to complete an application. Such a contact does not meet the  definition of solicitation, nor is it covered by this section, unless  the contact itself includes an application form in a direct mailing,  electronic communication or ``take-one''; an oral application in a  telephone contact initiated by the card issuer; or an application in an  in-person contact initiated by the card issuer.</p><p class="depth0">60(a)(2) Form of Disclosures; Tabular Format</p><p class="depth0">1. Location of table. i. General. Except for disclosures given  electronically, disclosures in Sec. 1026.60(b) that are required to be  provided in a table must be prominently located on or with the  application or solicitation. Disclosures are deemed to be prominently  located, for example, if the disclosures are on the same page as an  application or solicitation reply form. If the disclosures appear  elsewhere, they are deemed to be prominently located if the application  or solicitation reply form contains a clear and conspicuous reference to  the location of the disclosures and indicates that they contain rate,  fee, and other cost information, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Electronic disclosures. If the table is provided electronically,  the table must be provided in close proximity to the application or  solicitation. Card issuers have flexibility in satisfying this  requirement. Methods card issuers could use to satisfy the requirement  include, but are not limited to, the following examples (whatever method  is used, a card issuer need not confirm that the consumer has read the  disclosures):</p><p class="depth0">A. The disclosures could automatically appear on the screen when the  application or reply form appears;</p><p class="depth0">B. The disclosures could be located on the same Web page as the  application or reply form (whether or not they appear on the initial  screen), if the application or reply form contains a clear and  conspicuous reference to the location of the disclosures and indicates  that the disclosures contain rate, fee, and other cost information, as  applicable;</p><p class="depth0">C. Card issuers could provide a link to the electronic disclosures  on or with the application (or reply form) as long as consumers cannot  bypass the disclosures before submitting the application or reply form.  The link would take the consumer to the disclosures, but the consumer  need not be required to scroll completely through the disclosures; or</p><p class="depth0">D. The disclosures could be located on the same Web page as the  application or reply form without necessarily appearing on the initial  screen, immediately preceding the button that the consumer will click to  submit the application or reply.</p><p class="depth0">2. Multiple accounts. If a tabular format is required to be used,  card issuers offering several types of accounts may disclose the various  terms for the accounts in a single table or may provide a separate table  for each account.</p><p class="depth0">3. Information permitted in the table. See the commentary to Sec.  1026.60(b), (d), and (e)(1) for guidance on additional information  permitted in the table.</p><p class="depth0">4. Deletion of inapplicable disclosures. Generally, disclosures need  only be given as applicable. Card issuers may, therefore, omit   inapplicable headings and their corresponding boxes in the table. For  example, if no foreign transaction fee is imposed on the account, the  heading Foreign transaction and disclosure may be deleted from the table  or the disclosure form may contain the heading Foreign transaction and a  disclosure showing none. There is an exception for the grace period  disclosure; even if no grace period exists, that fact must be stated.</p><p class="depth0">5. Highlighting of annual percentage rates and fee amounts. i. In  general. See Samples G-10(B) and G-10(C) for guidance on providing the  disclosures described in Sec. 1026.60(a)(2)(iv) in bold text. Other  annual percentage rates or fee amounts disclosed in the table may not be  in bold text. Samples G-10(B) and G-10(C) also provide guidance to  issuers on how to disclose the rates and fees described in Sec.  1026.60(a)(2)(iv) in a clear and conspicuous manner, by including these  rates and fees generally as the first text in the applicable rows of the  table so that the highlighted rates and fees generally are aligned  vertically in the table.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Maximum limits on fees. Section 1026.60(a)(2)(iv) provides that  any maximum limits on fee amounts must be disclosed in bold text. For  example, assume that, consistent with Sec. 1026.52(b)(1)(ii), a card  issuer's late payment fee will not exceed $35. The maximum limit of $35  for the late payment fee must be highlighted in bold. Similarly, assume  an issuer will charge a cash advance fee of $5 or 3 percent of the cash  advance transaction amount, whichever is greater, but the fee will not  exceed $100. The maximum limit of $100 for the cash advance fee must be  highlighted in bold.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Periodic fees. Section 1026.60(a)(2)(iv) provides that any  periodic fee disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.60(b)(2) that is not an  annualized amount must not be disclosed in bold. For example, if an  issuer imposes a $10 monthly maintenance fee for a card account, the  issuer must disclose in the table that there is a $10 monthly  maintenance fee, and that the fee is $120 on an annual basis. In this  example, the $10 fee disclosure would not be disclosed in bold, but the  $120 annualized amount must be disclosed in bold. In addition, if an  issuer must disclose any annual fee in the table, the amount of the  annual fee must be disclosed in bold.</p><p class="depth0">6. Form of disclosures. Whether disclosures must be in electronic  form depends upon the following:</p><p class="depth0">i. If a consumer accesses a credit card application or solicitation  electronically (other than as described under ii. below), such as online  at a home computer, the card issuer must provide the disclosures in  electronic form (such as with the application or solicitation on its Web  site) in order to meet the requirement to provide disclosures in a  timely manner on or with the application or solicitation. If the issuer  instead mailed paper disclosures to the consumer, this requirement would  not be met.</p><p class="depth0">ii. In contrast, if a consumer is physically present in the card  issuer's office, and accesses a credit card application or solicitation  electronically, such as via a terminal or kiosk (or if the consumer uses  a terminal or kiosk located on the premises of an affiliate or third  party that has arranged with the card issuer to provide applications or  solicitations to consumers), the issuer may provide disclosures in  either electronic or paper form, provided the issuer complies with the  timing and delivery (``on or with'') requirements of the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">7. Terminology. Section 1026.60(a)(2)(i) generally requires that the  headings, content and format of the tabular disclosures be substantially  similar, but need not be identical, to the applicable tables in appendix  G-10 to part 1026; but see Sec. 1026.5(a)(2) for terminology  requirements applicable to Sec. 1026.60 disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">60(a)(4) Fees That Vary by State</p><p class="depth0">1. Manner of disclosing range. If the card issuer discloses a range  of fees instead of disclosing the amount of the specific fee applicable  to the consumer's account, the range may be stated as the lowest  authorized fee (zero, if there are one or more states where no fee  applies) to the highest authorized fee.</p><p class="depth0">60(a)(5) Exceptions</p><p class="depth0">1. Noncoverage of consumer-initiated requests. Applications provided  to a consumer upon request are not covered by Sec. 1026.60, even if the  request is made in response to the card issuer's invitation to apply for  a card account. To illustrate, if a card issuer invites consumers to  call a toll-free number or to return a response card to obtain an  application, the application sent in response to the consumer's request  need not contain the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.60.  Similarly, if the card issuer invites consumers to call and make an oral  application on the telephone, Sec. 1026.60 does not apply to the  application made by the consumer. If, however, the card issuer calls a  consumer or initiates a telephone discussion with a consumer about  opening a card account and contemporaneously takes an oral application,  such applications are subject to Sec. 1026.60, specifically Sec.  1026.60(d). Likewise, if the card issuer initiates an in-person  discussion with a consumer about opening a card account and  contemporaneously takes an application, such applications are subject to  Sec. 1026.60, specifically Sec. 1026.60(f).</p><p class="depth0">60(b) Required Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">1. Tabular format. Provisions in Sec. 1026.60(b) and its commentary  provide that certain information must appear or is permitted to appear  in a table. The tabular format is required for Sec. 1026.60(b)  disclosures given pursuant to Sec. 1026.60(c), (d)(2), (e)(1) and (f).  The tabular format does not apply to oral disclosures given pursuant to  Sec. 1026.60(d)(1). (See Sec. 1026.60(a)(2).)</p><p class="depth0">2. Accuracy. Rules concerning accuracy of the disclosures required  by Sec. 1026.60(b), including variable rate disclosures, are stated in  Sec. 1026.60(c)(2), (d)(3), and (e)(4), as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">60(b)(1) Annual Percentage Rate</p><p class="depth0">1. Variable-rate accounts--definition. For purposes of Sec.  1026.60(b)(1), a variable-rate account exists when rate changes are part  of the plan and are tied to an index or formula. (See the commentary to  Sec. 1026.6(b)(4)(ii) for examples of variable-rate plans.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Variable-rate accounts--fact that rate varies and how the rate  will be determined. In describing how the applicable rate will be  determined, the card issuer must identify in the table the type of index  or formula used, such as the prime rate. In describing the index, the  issuer may not include in the table details about the index. For  example, if the issuer uses a prime rate, the issuer must disclose the  rate as a ``prime rate'' and may not disclose in the table other details  about the prime rate, such as the fact that it is the highest prime rate  published in the Wall Street Journal two business days before the  closing date of the statement for each billing period. The issuer may  not disclose in the table the current value of the index (such as that  the prime rate is currently 7.5 percent) or the amount of the margin or  spread added to the index or formula in setting the applicable rate. A  card issuer may not disclose any applicable limitations on rate  increases or decreases in the table, such as describing that the rate  will not go below a certain rate or higher than a certain rate. (See  Samples G-10(B) and G-10(C) for guidance on how to disclose the fact  that the applicable rate varies and how it is determined.)</p><p class="depth0">3. Discounted initial rates. i. Immediate proximity. If the term  ``introductory'' is in the same phrase as the introductory rate, as that  term is defined in Sec. 1026.16(g)(2)(ii), it will be deemed to be in  immediate proximity of the listing. For example, an issuer that uses the  phrase ``introductory balance transfer APR X percent'' has used the word  ``introductory'' within the same phrase as the rate. (See Sample G-10(C)  for guidance on how to disclose clearly and conspicuously the expiration  date of the introductory rate and the rate that will apply after the  introductory rate expires, if an introductory rate is disclosed in the  table.)</p><p class="depth0">ii. Subsequent changes in terms. The fact that an issuer may reserve  the right to change a rate subsequent to account opening, pursuant to  the notice requirements of Sec. 1026.9(c) and the limitations in Sec.  1026.55, does not, by itself, make that rate an introductory rate. For  example, assume an issuer discloses an annual percentage rate for  purchases of 12.99% but does not specify a time period during which that  rate will be in effect. Even if that issuer subsequently increases the  annual percentage rate for purchases to 15.99%, pursuant to a change-in- terms notice provided under Sec. 1026.9(c), the 12.99% is not an  introductory rate.</p><p class="depth0">iii. More than one introductory rate. If more than one introductory  rate may apply to a particular balance in succeeding periods, the term  ``introductory'' need only be used to describe the first introductory  rate. For example, if an issuer offers a rate of 8.99% on purchases for  six months, 10.99% on purchases for the following six months, and 14.99%  on purchases after the first year, the term ``introductory'' need only  be used to describe the 8.99% rate.</p><p class="depth0">4. Premium initial rates--subsequent changes in terms. The fact that  an issuer may reserve the right to change a rate subsequent to account  opening, pursuant to the notice requirements of Sec. 1026.9(c) and the  limitations in Sec. 1026.55 (as applicable), does not, by itself, make  that rate a premium initial rate. For example, assume an issuer  discloses an annual percentage rate for purchases of 18.99% but does not  specify a time period during which that rate will be in effect. Even if  that issuer subsequently reduces the annual percentage rate for  purchases to 15.99%, the 18.99% is not a premium initial rate. If the  rate decrease is the result of a change from a non-variable rate to a  variable rate or from a variable rate to a non-variable rate, see  comments 9(c)(2)(v)-3 and 9(c)(2)(v)-4 for guidance on the notice  requirements under Sec. 1026.9(c).</p><p class="depth0">5. Increased penalty rates. i. In general. For rates that are not  introductory rates or employee preferential rates, if a rate may  increase as a penalty for one or more events specified in the account  agreement, such as a late payment or an extension of credit that exceeds  the credit limit, the card issuer must disclose the increased rate that  would apply, a brief description of the event or events that may result  in the increased rate, and a brief description of how long the increased  rate will remain in effect. The description of the specific event or  events that may result in an increased rate should be brief. For  example, if an issuer may increase a rate to the penalty rate because  the consumer does not make the minimum payment by 5 p.m., Eastern Time,  on its payment due date, the issuer should describe this circumstance in  the table as ``make a late payment.'' Similarly, if an issuer may  increase a rate that   applies to a particular balance because the account is more than 60 days  late, the issuer should describe this circumstance in the table as  ``make a late payment.'' An issuer may not distinguish between the  events that may result in an increased rate for existing balances and  the events that may result in an increased rate for new transactions.  (See Samples G-10(B) and G-10(C) (in the row labeled ``Penalty APR and  When it Applies'') for additional guidance on the level of detail in  which the specific event or events should be described.) The description  of how long the increased rate will remain in effect also should be  brief. If a card issuer reserves the right to apply the increased rate  to any balances indefinitely, to the extent permitted by Sec. Sec.  1026.55(b)(4) and 1026.59, the issuer should disclose that the penalty  rate may apply indefinitely. The card issuer may not disclose in the  table any limitations imposed by Sec. Sec. 1026.55(b)(4) and 1026.59 on  the duration of increased rates. For example, if the issuer generally  provides that the increased rate will apply until the consumer makes  twelve timely consecutive required minimum periodic payments, except to  the extent that Sec. Sec. 1026.55(b)(4) and 1026.59 apply, the issuer  should disclose that the penalty rate will apply until the consumer  makes twelve consecutive timely minimum payments. (See Samples G-10(B)  and G-10(C) (in the row labeled ``Penalty APR and When it Applies'') for  additional guidance on the level of detail which the issuer should use  to describe how long the increased rate will remain in effect.) A card  issuer will be deemed to meet the standard to clearly and conspicuously  disclose the information required by Sec. 1026.60(b)(1)(iv)(A) if the  issuer uses the format shown in Samples G-10(B) and G-10(C) (in the row  labeled ``Penalty APR and When it Applies'') to disclose this  information.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Introductory rates--general. An issuer is required to disclose  directly beneath the table the circumstances under which an introductory  rate, as that term is defined in Sec. 1026.16(g)(2)(ii), may be  revoked, and the rate that will apply after the revocation. This  information about revocation of an introductory rate and the rate that  will apply after revocation must be provided even if the rate that will  apply after the introductory rate is revoked is the rate that would have  applied at the end of the promotional period. In a variable-rate  account, the rate that would have applied at the end of the promotional  period is a rate based on the applicable index or formula in accordance  with the accuracy requirements set forth in Sec. 1026.60(c)(2) or  (e)(4). In describing the rate that will apply after revocation of the  introductory rate, if the rate that will apply after revocation of the  introductory rate is already disclosed in the table, the issuer is not  required to repeat the rate, but may refer to that rate in a clear and  conspicuous manner. For example, if the rate that will apply after  revocation of an introductory rate is the standard rate that applies to  that type of transaction (such as a purchase or balance transfer  transaction), and the standard rates are labeled in the table as  ``standard APRs,'' the issuer may refer to the ``standard APR'' when  describing the rate that will apply after revocation of an introductory  rate. (See Sample G-10(C) in the disclosure labeled ``Loss of  Introductory APR'' directly beneath the table.) The description of the  circumstances in which an introductory rate could be revoked should be  brief. For example, if an issuer may increase an introductory rate  because the account is more than 60 days late, the issuer should  describe this circumstance directly beneath the table as ``make a late  payment.'' In addition, if the circumstances in which an introductory  rate could be revoked are already listed elsewhere in the table, the  issuer is not required to repeat the circumstances again, but may refer  to those circumstances in a clear and conspicuous manner. For example,  if the circumstances in which an introductory rate could be revoked are  the same as the event or events that may trigger a ``penalty rate'' as  described in Sec. 1026.60(b)(1)(iv)(A), the issuer may refer to the  actions listed in the Penalty APR row, in describing the circumstances  in which the introductory rate could be revoked. (See Sample G-10(C) in  the disclosure labeled ``Loss of Introductory APR'' directly beneath the  table for additional guidance on the level of detail in which to  describe the circumstances in which an introductory rate could be  revoked.) A card issuer will be deemed to meet the standard to clearly  and conspicuously disclose the information required by Sec.  1026.60(b)(1)(iv)(B) if the issuer uses the format shown in Sample G- 10(C) to disclose this information.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Introductory rates--limitations on revocation. Issuers that are  disclosing an introductory rate are prohibited by Sec. 1026.55 from  increasing or revoking the introductory rate before it expires unless  the consumer fails to make a required minimum periodic payment within 60  days after the due date for the payment. In making the required  disclosure pursuant to Sec. 1026.60(b)(1)(iv)(B), issuers should  describe this circumstance directly beneath the table as ``make a late  payment.''</p><p class="depth0">iv. Employee preferential rates. An issuer is required to disclose  directly beneath the table the circumstances under which an employee  preferential rate may be revoked, and the rate that will apply after the  revocation. In describing the rate that will apply after revocation of  the employee preferential rate, if the rate that will apply after  revocation of the employee preferential rate is already disclosed in the  table, the issuer is not required to repeat the rate, but may refer to  that rate   in a clear and conspicuous manner. For example, if the rate that will  apply after revocation of an employee preferential rate is the standard  rate that applies to that type of transaction (such as a purchase or  balance transfer transaction), and the standard rates are labeled in the  table as ``standard APRs,'' the issuer may refer to the ``standard APR''  when describing the rate that will apply after revocation of an employee  preferential rate. The description of the circumstances in which an  employee preferential rate could be revoked should be brief. For  example, if an issuer may increase an employee preferential rate based  upon termination of the employee's employment relationship with the  issuer or a third party, issuers may describe this circumstance as ``if  your employment with [issuer or third party] ends.''</p><p class="depth0">6. Rates that depend on consumer's creditworthiness. i. In general.  The card issuer, at its option, may disclose the possible rates that may  apply as either specific rates, or a range of rates. For example, if  there are three possible rates that may apply (9.99, 12.99 or 17.99  percent), an issuer may disclose specific rates (9.99, 12.99 or 17.99  percent) or a range of rates (9.99 to 17.99 percent). The card issuer  may not disclose only the lowest, highest or median rate that could  apply. (See Samples G-10(B) and G-10(C) for guidance on how to disclose  a range of rates.)</p><p class="depth0">ii. Penalty rates. If the rate is a penalty rate, as described in  Sec. 1026.60(b)(1)(iv), the card issuer at its option may disclose the  highest rate that could apply, instead of disclosing the specific rates  or the range of rates that could apply. For example, if the penalty rate  could be up to 28.99 percent, but the issuer may impose a penalty rate  that is less than that rate depending on factors at the time the penalty  rate is imposed, the issuer may disclose the penalty rate as ``up to''  28.99 percent. The issuer also must include a statement that the penalty  rate for which the consumer may qualify will depend on the consumer's  creditworthiness, and other factors if applicable.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Other factors. Section 1026.60(b)(1)(v) applies even if other  factors are used in combination with a consumer's creditworthiness to  determine the rate for which a consumer may qualify at account opening.  For example, Sec. 1026.60(b)(1)(v) would apply if the issuer considers  the type of purchase the consumer is making at the time the consumer  opens the account, in combination with the consumer's creditworthiness,  to determine the rate for which the consumer may qualify at account  opening. If other factors are considered, the issuer should amend the  statement about creditworthiness, to indicate that the rate for which  the consumer may qualify at account opening will depend on the  consumer's creditworthiness and other factors. Nonetheless, Sec.  1026.60(b)(1)(v) does not apply if a consumer's creditworthiness is not  one of the factors that will determine the rate for which the consumer  may qualify at account opening (for example, if the rate is based solely  on the type of purchase that the consumer is making at the time the  consumer opens the account, or is based solely on whether the consumer  has other banking relationships with the card issuer).</p><p class="depth0">7. Rate based on another rate on the account. In some cases, one  rate may be based on another rate on the account. For example, assume  that a penalty rate as described in Sec. 1026.60(b)(1)(iv)(A) is  determined by adding 5 percentage points to the current purchase rate,  which is 10 percent. In this example, the card issuer in disclosing the  penalty rate must disclose 15 percent as the current penalty rate. If  the purchase rate is a variable rate, then the penalty rate also is a  variable rate. In that case, the card issuer also must disclose the fact  that the penalty rate may vary and how the rate is determined, such as  ``This APR may vary with the market based on the Prime Rate.'' In  describing the penalty rate, the issuer shall not disclose in the table  the amount of the margin or spread added to the current purchase rate to  determine the penalty rate, such as describing that the penalty rate is  determined by adding 5 percentage points to the purchase rate. (See  Sec. 1026.60(b)(1)(i) and comment 60(b)(1)-2 for further guidance on  describing a variable rate.)</p><p class="depth0">8. Rates. The only rates that shall be disclosed in the table are  annual percentage rates determined under Sec. 1026.14(b). Periodic  rates shall not be disclosed in the table.</p><p class="depth0">9. Deferred interest or similar transactions. An issuer offering a  deferred interest or similar plan, such as a promotional program that  provides that a consumer will not be obligated to pay interest that  accrues on a balance if that balance is paid in full prior to the  expiration of a specified period of time, may not disclose a 0% rate as  the rate applicable to deferred interest or similar transactions if  there are any circumstances under which the consumer will be obligated  for interest on such transactions for the deferred interest or similar  period.</p><p class="depth0">60(b)(2) Fees for Issuance or Availability</p><p class="depth0">1. Membership fees. Membership fees for opening an account must be  disclosed under this paragraph. A membership fee to join an organization  that provides a credit or charge card as a privilege of membership must  be disclosed only if the card is issued automatically upon membership.  Such a fee shall not be disclosed in the table if membership results  merely in eligibility to apply for an account.</p><p class="depth0">2. Enhancements. Fees for optional services in addition to basic  membership privileges in a credit or charge card account (for example,  travel insurance or card-registration services) shall not be disclosed  in the table if the   basic account may be opened without paying such fees. Issuing a card to  each primary cardholder (not authorized users) is considered a basic  membership privilege and fees for additional cards, beyond the first  card on the account, must be disclosed as a fee for issuance or  availability. Thus, a fee to obtain an additional card on the account  beyond the first card (so that each cardholder would have his or her own  card) must be disclosed in the table as a fee for issuance or  availability under Sec. 1026.60(b)(2). This fee must be disclosed even  if the fee is optional; that is, if the fee is charged only if the  cardholder requests one or more additional cards. (See the available  credit disclosure in Sec. 1026.60(b)(14).)</p><p class="depth0">3. One-time fees. Disclosure of non-periodic fees is limited to fees  related to opening the account, such as one-time membership or  participation fees, or an application fee that is excludable from the  finance charge under Sec. 1026.4(c)(1). The following are examples of  fees that shall not be disclosed in the table:</p><p class="depth0">i. Fees for reissuing a lost or stolen card.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Statement reproduction fees.</p><p class="depth0">4. Waived or reduced fees. If fees required to be disclosed are  waived or reduced for a limited time, the introductory fees or the fact  of fee waivers may be disclosed in the table in addition to the required  fees if the card issuer also discloses how long the reduced fees or  waivers will remain in effect in accordance with the requirements of  Sec. Sec. 1026.9(c)(2)(v)(B) and 1026.55(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0">5. Periodic fees and one-time fees. A card issuer disclosing a  periodic fee must disclose the amount of the fee, how frequently it will  be imposed, and the annualized amount of the fee. A card issuer  disclosing a non-periodic fee must disclose that the fee is a one-time  fee. (See Sample G-10(C) for guidance on how to meet these  requirements.)</p><p class="depth0">60(b)(3) Fixed Finance Charge; Minimum Interest Charge</p><p class="depth0">1. Example of brief statement. See Samples G-10(B) and G-10(C) for  guidance on how to provide a brief description of a minimum interest  charge.</p><p class="depth0">2. Adjustment of $1.00 threshold amount. Consistent with Sec.  1026.60(b)(3), the Bureau will publish adjustments to the $1.00  threshold amount, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">60(b)(4) Transaction Charges</p><p class="depth0">1. Charges imposed by person other than card issuer. Charges imposed  by a third party, such as a seller of goods, shall not be disclosed in  the table under this section; the third party would be responsible for  disclosing the charge under Sec. 1026.9(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0">2. Foreign transaction fees. A transaction charge imposed by the  card issuer for the use of the card for purchases includes any fee  imposed by the issuer for purchases in a foreign currency or that take  place outside the United States or with a foreign merchant. (See comment  4(a)-4 for guidance on when a foreign transaction fee is considered  charged by the card issuer.) If an issuer charges the same foreign  transaction fee for purchases and cash advances in a foreign currency,  or that take place outside the United States or with a foreign merchant,  the issuer may disclose this foreign transaction fee as shown in Samples  G-10(B) and G-10(C). Otherwise, the issuer must revise the foreign  transaction fee language shown in Samples G-10(B) and G-10(C) to  disclose clearly and conspicuously the amount of the foreign transaction  fee that applies to purchases and the amount of the foreign transaction  fee that applies to cash advances.</p><p class="depth0">60(b)(5) Grace Period</p><p class="depth0">1. How grace period disclosure is made. The card issuer must state  any conditions on the applicability of the grace period. An issuer,  however, may not disclose under Sec. 1026.60(b)(5) the limitations on  the imposition of finance charges as a result of a loss of a grace  period in Sec. 1026.54, or the impact of payment allocation on whether  interest is charged on purchases as a result of a loss of a grace  period. Some issuers may offer a grace period on all purchases under  which interest will not be charged on purchases if the consumer pays the  outstanding balance shown on a periodic statement in full by the due  date shown on that statement for one or more billing cycles. In these  circumstances, Sec. 1026.60(b)(5) requires that the issuer disclose the  grace period and the conditions for its applicability using the  following language, or substantially similar language, as applicable:  ``Your due date is [at least] ---- days after the close of each billing  cycle. We will not charge you any interest on purchases if you pay your  entire balance by the due date each month.'' However, other issuers may  offer a grace period on all purchases under which interest may be  charged on purchases even if the consumer pays the outstanding balance  shown on a periodic statement in full by the due date shown on that  statement each billing cycle. In these circumstances, Sec.  1026.60(b)(5) requires the issuer to amend the above disclosure language  to describe accurately the conditions on the applicability of the grace  period.</p><p class="depth0">2. No grace period. The issuer may use the following language to  describe that no grace period on any purchases is offered, as  applicable: ``We will begin charging interest on purchases on the  transaction date.''</p><p class="depth0">3. Grace period on some purchases. If the issuer provides a grace  period on some types of purchases but no grace period on others,   the issuer may combine and revise the language in comments 60(b)(5)-1  and -2 as appropriate to describe to which types of purchases a grace  period applies and to which types of purchases no grace period is  offered.</p><p class="depth0">60(b)(6) Balance Computation Method</p><p class="depth0">1. Form of disclosure. In cases where the card issuer uses a balance  computation method that is identified by name in Sec. 1026.60(g), the  card issuer must disclose below the table only the name of the method.  In cases where the card issuer uses a balance computation method that is  not identified by name in Sec. 1026.60(g), the disclosure below the  table must clearly explain the method in as much detail as set forth in  the descriptions of balance methods in Sec. 1026.60(g). The explanation  need not be as detailed as that required for the disclosures under Sec.  1026.6(b)(4)(i)(D).</p><p class="depth0">2. Determining the method. In determining which balance computation  method to disclose for purchases, the card issuer must assume that a  purchase balance will exist at the end of any grace period. Thus, for  example, if the average daily balance method will include new purchases  only if purchase balances are not paid within the grace period, the card  issuer would disclose the name of the average daily balance method that  includes new purchases. The card issuer must not assume the existence of  a purchase balance, however, in making other disclosures under Sec.  1026.60(b).</p><p class="depth0">60(b)(7) Statement on Charge Card Payments</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicability and content. The disclosure that charges are  payable upon receipt of the periodic statement is applicable only to  charge card accounts. In making this disclosure, the card issuer may  make such modifications as are necessary to more accurately reflect the  circumstances of repayment under the account. For example, the  disclosure might read, ``Charges are due and payable upon receipt of the  periodic statement and must be paid no later than 15 days after receipt  of such statement.''</p><p class="depth0">60(b)(8) Cash Advance Fee</p><p class="depth0">1. Content. See Samples G-10(B) and G-10(C) for guidance on how to  disclose clearly and conspicuously the cash advance fee.</p><p class="depth0">2. Foreign cash advances. Cash advance fees required to be disclosed  under Sec. 1026.60(b)(8) include any charge imposed by the card issuer  for cash advances in a foreign currency or that take place outside the  United States or with a foreign merchant. (See comment 4(a)-4 for  guidance on when a foreign transaction fee is considered charged by the  card issuer.) If an issuer charges the same foreign transaction fee for  purchases and cash advances in a foreign currency or that take place  outside the United States or with a foreign merchant, the issuer may  disclose this foreign transaction fee as shown in Samples G-10(B) and  (C). Otherwise, the issuer must revise the foreign transaction fee  language shown in Samples G-10(B) and (C) to disclose clearly and  conspicuously the amount of the foreign transaction fee that applies to  purchases and the amount of the foreign transaction fee that applies to  cash advances.</p><p class="depth0">3. ATM fees. An issuer is not required to disclose pursuant to Sec.  1026.60(b)(8) any charges imposed on a cardholder by an institution  other than the card issuer for the use of the other institution's ATM in  a shared or interchange system.</p><p class="depth0">60(b)(9) Late Payment Fee</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicability. The disclosure of the fee for a late payment  includes only those fees that will be imposed for actual, unanticipated  late payments. (See the commentary to Sec. 1026.4(c)(2) for additional  guidance on late payment fees. See Samples G-10(B) and G-10(C) for  guidance on how to disclose clearly and conspicuously the late payment  fee.)</p><p class="depth0">60(b)(10) Over-the-Limit Fee</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicability. The disclosure of fees for exceeding a credit  limit does not include fees for other types of default or for services  related to exceeding the limit. For example, no disclosure is required  of fees for reinstating credit privileges or fees for the dishonor of  checks on an account that, if paid, would cause the credit limit to be  exceeded. (See Samples G-10(B) and G-10(C) for guidance on how to  disclose clearly and conspicuously the over-the-limit fee.)</p><p class="depth0">60(b)(13) Required Insurance, Debt Cancellation or Debt Suspension</p><p class="depth0">Coverage</p><p class="depth0">1. Content. See Sample G-10(B) for guidance on how to comply with  the requirements in Sec. 1026.60(b)(13).</p><p class="depth0">60(b)(14) Available Credit</p><p class="depth0">1. Calculating available credit. If the 15 percent threshold test is  met, the issuer must disclose the available credit excluding optional  fees, and the available credit including optional fees. In calculating  the available credit to disclose in the table, the issuer must consider  all fees for the issuance or availability of credit described in Sec.  1026.60(b)(2), and any security deposit, that will be imposed and  charged to the account when the account is opened, such as one-time  issuance and set-up fees. For example, in calculating the available  credit, issuers must consider the first year's annual fee and the first  month's maintenance fee (as applicable) if they are charged to the  account on the first billing statement. In calculating the amount of the  available credit including optional fees, if optional fees could be   charged multiple times, the issuer shall assume that the optional fee is  only imposed once. For example, if an issuer charges a fee for each  additional card issued on the account, the issuer in calculating the  amount of the available credit including optional fees may assume that  the cardholder requests only one additional card. In disclosing the  available credit, the issuer shall round down the available credit  amount to the nearest whole dollar.</p><p class="depth0">2. Content.

Applications or solicitations contained in  generally available publications mailed to consumers (such as  subscription magazines) are subject to the requirements applicable to  take-ones in Sec. 1026.60(e), rather than the direct mail requirements  of Sec. 1026.60(c). However, if a primary purpose of a card issuer's  mailing is to offer credit or charge card accounts--for example, where a  card issuer ``prescreens'' a list of potential cardholders using credit  criteria, and then mails to the targeted group its catalog containing an  application or a solicitation for a card account--the direct mail rules  apply. In addition, a card issuer may use a single application form as a  take-one (in racks in public locations, for example) and for direct  mailings, if the card issuer complies with the requirements of Sec.  1026.60(c) even when the form is used as a take-one--that is, by  presenting the required Sec. 1026.60 disclosures in a tabular format.  When used in a direct mailing, the credit term disclosures must be  accurate as of the mailing date whether or not the Sec.  1026.60(e)(1)(ii) and (e)(1)(iii) disclosures are included; when used in  a take-one, the disclosures must be accurate for as long as the take-one  forms remain available to the public if the Sec. 1026.60(e)(1)(ii) and  (e)(1)(iii) disclosures are omitted. (If those disclosures are included  in the take-one, the credit term disclosures need only be accurate as of  the printing date.)</p><p class="depth0">60(d) Telephone Applications and Solicitations</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. i. This paragraph applies if:</p><p class="depth0">A. A telephone conversation between a card issuer and consumer may  result in the issuance of a card as a consequence of an issuer-initiated  offer to open an account for which the issuer does not require any  application (that is, a prescreened telephone solicitation).</p><p class="depth0">B. The card issuer initiates the contact and at the same time takes  application information over the telephone.</p><p class="depth0">ii. This paragraph does not apply to:</p><p class="depth0">A. Telephone applications initiated by the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">B. Situations where no card will be issued--because, for example,  the consumer indicates that he or she does not want the card, or the  card issuer decides either during the telephone conversation or later  not to issue the card.</p><p class="depth0">2. Right to reject the plan. The right to reject the plan referenced  in this paragraph is the same as the right to reject the plan described  in Sec. 1026.5(b)(1)(iv). If an issuer substitutes the account-opening  summary table described in Sec. 1026.6(b)(1) in lieu of the disclosures  specified in Sec. 1026.60(d)(2)(ii), the disclosure specified in Sec.  1026.60(d)(2)(ii)(B) must appear in the table, if the issuer is required  to do so pursuant to Sec. 1026.6(b)(2)(xiii). Otherwise, the disclosure  specified in Sec. 1026.60(d)(2)(ii)(B) may appear either in or outside  the table containing the required credit disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">3. Substituting account-opening table for alternative written  disclosures. An issuer may substitute the account-opening summary table  described in Sec. 1026.6(b)(1) in lieu of the disclosures specified in  Sec. 1026.60(d)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">60(e) Applications and Solicitations Made Available to General Public</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. Applications and solicitations made available to the  general public include what are commonly referred to as take-one  applications typically found at counters in banks and retail  establishments, as well as applications contained in catalogs, magazines  and other generally available publications. In the case of credit  unions, this paragraph applies to applications and solicitations to open  card accounts made available to those in the general field of  membership.</p><p class="depth0">2. In-person applications and solicitations. In-person applications  and solicitations initiated by a card issuer are subject to Sec.  1026.60(f), not Sec. 1026.60(e). (See Sec. 1026.60(f) and accompanying  commentary for rules relating to in-person applications and  solicitations.)</p><p class="depth0">3. Toll-free telephone number. If a card issuer, in complying with  any of the disclosure options of Sec. 1026.60(e), provides a telephone  number for consumers to call to obtain credit information, the number  must be toll-free for nonlocal calls made from an area code other than  the one used in the card issuer's dialing area. Alternatively, a card  issuer may provide any telephone number that allows a consumer to call  for information and reverse the telephone charges.</p><p class="depth0">60(e)(1) Disclosure of Required Credit Information</p><p class="depth0">1. Date of printing. Disclosure of the month and year fulfills the  requirement to disclose the date an application was printed.</p><p class="depth0">2. Form of disclosures. The disclosures specified in Sec.  1026.60(e)(1)(ii) and (e)(1)(iii) may appear either in or outside the  table containing the required credit disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">60(e)(2) No Disclosure of Credit Information</p><p class="depth0">1. When disclosure option available. A card issuer may use this  option only if the issuer does not include on or with the application or  solicitation any statement that refers to the credit disclosures  required by Sec. 1026.60(b). Statements such as no annual fee, low  interest rate, favorable rates, and low costs are deemed to refer to the  required credit disclosures and, therefore, may not be included on or  with the solicitation or application, if the card issuer chooses to use  this option.</p><p class="depth0">60(e)(3) Prompt Response to Requests for Information</p><p class="depth0">1. Prompt disclosure. Information is promptly disclosed if it is  given within 30 days of a consumer's request for information but in no  event later than delivery of the credit or charge card.</p><p class="depth0">2. Information disclosed. When a consumer requests credit  information, card issuers need not provide all the required credit  disclosures in all instances. For example, if disclosures have been  provided in accordance with Sec. 1026.60(e)(1) and a consumer calls or  writes a card issuer to obtain information about changes in the  disclosures, the issuer need only provide the items of information that  have changed from those previously disclosed on or with the application  or solicitation. If a consumer requests information about particular  items, the card issuer need only provide the requested information. If,  however, the card issuer has made disclosures in accordance with the  option in Sec. 1026.60(e)(2) and a consumer calls or writes the card  issuer requesting information about costs, all the required disclosure  information must be given.</p><p class="depth0">3. Manner of response. A card issuer's response to a consumer's  request for credit information may be provided orally or in writing,  regardless of the manner in which the consumer's request is received by  the issuer. Furthermore, the card issuer must provide the information  listed in Sec. 1026.60(e)(1). Information provided in writing need not  be in a tabular format.</p><p class="depth0">60(f) In-Person Applications and Solicitations</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. i. This paragraph applies if:</p><p class="depth0">A. An in-person conversation between a card issuer and a consumer  may result in the issuance of a card as a consequence of an issuer- initiated offer to open an account for which the issuer does not require  any application (that is, a preapproved in-person solicitation).</p><p class="depth0">B. The card issuer initiates the contact and at the same time takes  application information in person. For example, the following are  covered:</p><p class="depth0">1. A consumer applies in person for a car loan at a financial  institution and the loan officer invites the consumer to apply for a  credit or charge card account; the consumer accepts the invitation and  submits an application.</p><p class="depth0">2. An employee of a retail establishment, in the course of  processing a sales transaction using a bank credit card, asks a customer  if he or she would like to apply for the retailer's credit or charge  card; the customer responds affirmatively and submits an application.</p><p class="depth0">ii. This paragraph does not apply to:</p><p class="depth0">A. In-person applications initiated by the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">B. Situations where no card will be issued--because, for example,  the consumer indicates that he or she does not want the card, or the  card issuer decides during the in-person conversation not to issue the  card.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix A--Effect on State Laws</p><p class="depth0">1. Who may make requests. Appendix A sets forth the procedures for  preemption determinations. As discussed in Sec. 1026.28, which contains  the standards for preemption, a request for a determination of whether a  state law is inconsistent with the requirements of chapters 1, 2, or 3  may be made by creditors, states, or any interested party. However, only  states may request and receive determinations in connection with the  fair credit billing provisions of chapter 4.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix B--State Exemptions</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Appendix B sets forth the procedures for exemption  applications. The exemption standards are found in Sec. 1026.29 and are  discussed in the commentary to that section.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix C--Issuance of Official Interpretations</p><p class="depth0">1. General. This commentary is the vehicle for providing official  interpretations. Individual interpretations generally will not be issued  separately from the commentary.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix D--Multiple-Advance Construction Loans</p><p class="depth0">1. General rule. Appendix D provides a special procedure that  creditors may use, at their option, to estimate and disclose the terms  of multiple-advance construction loans when the amounts or timing of  advances is unknown at consummation of the   transaction. This appendix reflects the approach taken in Sec.  1026.17(c)(6)(ii), which permits creditors to provide separate or  combined disclosures for the construction period and for the permanent  financing, if any; i.e., the construction phase and the permanent phase  may be treated as one transaction or more than one transaction. appendix  D may also be used in multiple-advance transactions other than  construction loans, when the amounts or timing of advances is unknown at  consummation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Variable-rate multiple-advance loans. The hypothetical disclosure  required in variable-rate transactions by Sec. 1026.18(f)(1)(iv) is not  required for multiple-advance loans disclosed pursuant to appendix D,  part I.</p><p class="depth0">3. Calculation of the total of payments. When disclosures are made  pursuant to appendix D, the total of payments may reflect either the sum  of the payments or the sum of the amount financed and the finance  charge.</p><p class="depth0">4. Annual percentage rate. Appendix D does not require the use of  Volume I of the Bureau's Annual Percentage Rate Tables for calculation  of the annual percentage rate. Creditors utilizing appendix D in making  calculations and disclosures may use other computation tools to  determine the estimated annual percentage rate, based on the finance  charge and payment schedule obtained by use of the appendix.</p><p class="depth0">5. Interest reserves. In a multiple-advance construction loan, a  creditor may establish an ``interest reserve'' to ensure that interest  is paid as it accrues by designating a portion of the loan to be used  for paying the interest that accrues on the loan. An interest reserve is  not treated as a prepaid finance charge, whether the interest reserve is  the same as or different from the estimated interest figure calculated  under appendix D.</p><p class="depth0">i. If a creditor permits a consumer to make interest payments as  they become due, the interest reserve should be disregarded in the  disclosures and calculations under appendix D.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If a creditor requires the establishment of an interest reserve  and automatically deducts interest payments from the reserve amount  rather than allow the consumer to make interest payments as they become  due, the fact that interest will accrue on those interest payments as  well as the other loan proceeds must be reflected in the calculations  and disclosures. To reflect the effects of such compounding, a creditor  should first calculate interest on the commitment amount (exclusive of  the interest reserve) and then add the figure obtained by assuming that  one-half of that interest is outstanding at the contract interest rate  for the entire construction period. For example, using the example shown  under paragraph A, part I of appendix D, the estimated interest would be  $1,117.68 ($1093.75 plus an additional $23.93 calculated by assuming  half of $1093.75 is outstanding at the contract interest rate for the  entire construction period), and the estimated annual percentage rate  would be 21.18%.</p><p class="depth0">6. Relation to Sec. 1026.18(s). A creditor must disclose an  interest rate and payment summary table for transactions secured by real  property or a dwelling, pursuant to Sec. 1026.18(s), instead of the  general payment schedule required by Sec. 1026.18(g). Accordingly, home  construction loans that are secured by real property or a dwelling are  subject to Sec. 1026.18(s) and not Sec. 1026.18(g). Under Sec.  1026.176(c)(6)(ii), when a multiple-advance construction loan may be  permanently financed by the same creditor, the construction phase and  the permanent phase may be treated as either one transaction or more  than one transaction.</p><p class="depth0">i. If a creditor uses appendix D and elects pursuant to Sec.  1026.17(c)(6)(ii) to disclose the construction and permanent phases as  separate transactions, the construction phase must be disclosed  according to the rules in Sec. 1026.18(s). Under Sec. 1026.18(s), the  creditor must disclose the applicable interest rates and corresponding  periodic payments during the construction phase in an interest rate and  payment summary table. The provision in appendix D, Part I.A.3, which  allows the creditor to omit the number and amounts of any interest  payments ``in disclosing the payment schedule under Sec. 1026.18(g)''  does not apply because the transaction is governed by Sec. 1026.18(s)  rather than Sec. 1026.18(g). Also, because the construction phase is  being disclosed as a separate transaction and its terms do not repay all  principal, the creditor must disclose a balloon payment, pursuant to  Sec. 1026.18(s)(5).</p><p class="depth0">ii. On the other hand, if the creditor elects to disclose the  construction and permanent phases as a single transaction, the  construction phase must be disclosed pursuant to appendix D, Part II.C,  which provides that the creditor shall disclose the repayment schedule  without reflecting the number or amounts of payments of interest only  that are made during the construction phase. Appendix D also provides,  however, that creditors must disclose (outside of the table) the fact  that interest payments must be made and the timing of such payments. The  rate and payment summary table disclosed under Sec. 1026.18(s) must  reflect only the permanent phase of the transaction. Therefore, in  determining the rates and payments that must be disclosed in the columns  of the table, creditors should apply the requirements of Sec.  1026.18(s) to the permanent phase only. For example, under Sec.  1026.18(s)(2)(i)(A) or Sec. 1026.18(s)(2)(i)(B)(1), as applicable, the  creditor should disclose the interest rate corresponding to the first  installment due under the permanent phase and not any rate applicable  during the construction phase.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix F--Optional Annual Percentage Rate Computations for Creditors</p><p class="depth0">Offering Open-End Credit Plans Secured by a Consumer's Dwelling</p><p class="depth0">1.

Permissible changes. Although use of the model forms and clauses  is not required, creditors using them properly will be deemed to be in  compliance with the regulation with regard to those disclosures.  Creditors may make certain changes in the format or content of the forms  and clauses and may delete any disclosures that are inapplicable to a  transaction or a plan without losing the Act's protection from  liability, except formatting changes may not be made to model forms and  samples in H-18, H-19, H-20, H-21, H-22, H-23, G-2(A), G-3(A), G-4(A),  G-10(A)-(E), G-17(A)-(D), G-18(A) (except as permitted pursuant to Sec.  1026.7(b)(2)), G-18(B)-(C), G-19, G-20, and G-21, or to the model  clauses in H-4(E), H-4(F), H-4(G), and H-4(H). Creditors may modify the  heading of the second column shown in Model Clause H-4(H) to read  ``first adjustment'' or ``first increase,'' as applicable, pursuant to  Sec. 1026.18(s)(2)(i)(C). The rearrangement of the model forms and  clauses may not be so extensive as to affect the substance, clarity, or  meaningful sequence of the forms and clauses. Creditors making revisions  with that effect will lose their protection from civil liability. Except  as otherwise specifically required, acceptable changes include, for  example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Using the first person, instead of the second person, in  referring to the borrower.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Using ``borrower'' and ``creditor'' instead of pronouns.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Rearranging the sequences of the disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Not using bold type for headings.</p><p class="depth0">v. Incorporating certain state ``plain English'' requirements.</p><p class="depth0">vi. Deleting inapplicable disclosures by whiting out, blocking out,  filling in ``N/A'' (not applicable) or ``0,'' crossing out, leaving  blanks, checking a box for applicable items, or circling applicable  items. (This should permit use of multipurpose standard forms.)</p><p class="depth0">vii. Using a vertical, rather than a horizontal, format for the  boxes in the closed-end disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">2. Debt-cancellation coverage. This part does not authorize  creditors to characterize debt-cancellation fees as insurance premiums  for purposes of this part. Creditors may provide a disclosure that  refers to debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage whether or not  the coverage is considered insurance. Creditors may use the model credit  insurance disclosures only if the debt cancellation coverage constitutes  insurance under state law.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix G--Open-End Model Forms and Clauses</p><p class="depth0">1. Models G-1 and G-1(A). The model disclosures in G-1 and G-1(A)  (different balance computation methods) may be used in both the account- opening disclosures under Sec. 1026.6 and the periodic disclosures  under Sec. 1026.7. As is clear from the models given, ``shorthand''  descriptions of the balance computation methods are not sufficient,  except where Sec. 1026.7(b)(5) applies. For creditors using model G-1,  the phrase ``a portion of'' the finance charge should be included if the  total finance charge includes other amounts, such as transaction  charges, that are not due to the application of a periodic rate. If  unpaid interest or finance charges are subtracted in calculating the  balance, that fact must be stated so that the disclosure of the  computation method is accurate. Only model G-1(b) contains a final  sentence appearing in brackets, which reflects the total dollar amount  of payments and credits received during the billing cycle. The other  models do not contain this language because they reflect plans in which  payments and credits received during the billing cycle are subtracted.  If this is not the case, however, the language relating to payments and  credits should be changed, and the creditor should add either the  disclosure of the dollar amount as in model G-1(b) or an indication of  which credits (disclosed elsewhere on the periodic statement) will not  be deducted in determining the balance. (Such an indication may also  substitute for the bracketed sentence in model G-1(b).) (See the  commentary to Sec. 1026.7(a)(5) and (b)(5).) For open-end plans subject  to the requirements of Sec. 1026.40, creditors may, at their option,  use the clauses in G-1 or G-1(A).</p><p class="depth0">2. Models G-2 and G-2(A). These models contain the notice of  liability for unauthorized use of a credit card. For home-equity plans  subject to the requirements of Sec. 1026.40, at the creditor's option,  a creditor either may use G-2 or G-2(A). For open-end plans not subject  to the requirements of Sec. 1026.40, creditors properly use G-2(A).</p><p class="depth0">3. Models G-3, G-3(A), G-4 and G-4(A).</p><p class="depth0">i. These set out models for the long-form billing-error rights  statement (for use with the account-opening disclosures and as an annual  disclosure or, at the creditor's option, with each periodic statement)  and the alternative billing-error rights statement (for use with each  periodic statement), respectively. For home-equity plans subject to the  requirements of Sec. 1026.40, at the creditor's option, a creditor  either may use G-3 or G-3(A), and for creditors that use the short form,  G-4 or G-4(A). For open-end (not home-   secured) plans that are not subject to the requirements of Sec.  1026.40, creditors properly use G-3(A) and G-4(A). Creditors must  provide the billing-error rights statements in a form substantially  similar to the models in order to comply with the regulation. The model  billing-rights statements may be modified in any of the ways set forth  in the first paragraph to the commentary on Appendices G and H. The  models may, furthermore, be modified by deleting inapplicable  information, such as:</p><p class="depth0">A. The paragraph concerning stopping a debit in relation to a  disputed amount, if the creditor does not have the ability to debit  automatically the consumer's savings or checking account for payment.</p><p class="depth0">B. The rights stated in the special rule for credit card purchases  and any limitations on those rights.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The model billing rights statements also contain optional  language that creditors may use. For example, the creditor may:</p><p class="depth0">A. Include a statement to the effect that notice of a billing error  must be submitted on something other than the payment ticket or other  material accompanying the periodic disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">B. Insert its address or refer to the address that appears elsewhere  on the bill.</p><p class="depth0">C. Include instructions for consumers, at the consumer's option, to  communicate with the creditor electronically or in writing.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Additional information may be included on the statements as  long as it does not detract from the required disclosures. For instance,  information concerning the reporting of errors in connection with a  checking account may be included on a combined statement as long as the  disclosures required by the regulation remain clear and conspicuous.</p><p class="depth0">4. Models G-5 through G-9. These models set out notices of the right  to rescind that would be used at different times in an open-end plan.  The last paragraph of each of the rescission model forms contains a  blank for the date by which the consumer's notice of cancellation must  be sent or delivered. A parenthetical is included to address the  situation in which the consumer's right to rescind the transaction  exists beyond 3 business days following the date of the transaction, for  example, when the notice or material disclosures are delivered late or  when the date of the transaction in paragraph 1 of the notice is an  estimate. The language of the parenthetical is not optional. See the  commentary to Sec. 1026.2(a)(25) regarding the specificity of the  security interest disclosure for model form G-7.</p><p class="depth0">5. Model G-10(A), samples G-10(B) and G-10(C), model G-10(D), sample  G-10(E), model G-17(A), and samples G-17(B), 17(C) and 17(D). i. Model  G-10(A) and Samples G-10(B) and G-10(C) illustrate, in the tabular  format, the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.60 for applications  and solicitations for credit cards other than charge cards. Model G- 10(D) and Sample G-10(E) illustrate the tabular format disclosure for  charge card applications and solicitations and reflect the disclosures  in the table. Model G-17(A) and Samples G-17(B), G-17(C) and G-17(D)  illustrate, in the tabular format, the disclosures required under Sec.  1026.6(b)(2) for account-opening disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Except as otherwise permitted, disclosures must be substantially  similar in sequence and format to Models G-10(A), G-10(D) and G-17(A).  While proper use of the model forms will be deemed in compliance with  the regulation, card issuers and other creditors offering open-end (not  home-secured) plans are permitted to disclose the annual percentage  rates for purchases, cash advances, or balance transfers in the same row  in the table for any transaction types for which the issuer or creditor  charges the same annual percentage rate. Similarly, card issuer and  other creditors offering open-end (not home-secured) plans are permitted  to disclose fees of the same amount in the same row if the fees are in  the same category. Fees in different categories may not be disclosed in  the same row. For example, a transaction fee and a penalty fee that are  of the same amount may not be disclosed in the same row. Card issuers  and other creditors offering open-end (not home-secured) plans are also  permitted to use headings other than those in the forms if they are  clear and concise and are substantially similar to the headings  contained in model forms, with the following exceptions. The heading  ``penalty APR'' must be used when describing rates that may increase due  to default or delinquency or as a penalty, and in relation to required  insurance, or debt cancellation or suspension coverage, the term  ``required'' and the name of the product must be used. (See also  Sec. Sec. 1026.60(b)(5) and 1026.6(b)(2)(v) for guidance on headings  that must be used to describe the grace period, or lack of grace period,  in the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.60 for applications and  solicitations for credit cards other than charge cards, and the  disclosures required under Sec. 1026.6(b)(2) for account-opening  disclosures, respectively.)</p><p class="depth0">iii. Models G-10(A) and G-17(A) contain two alternative headings  (``Minimum Interest Charge'' and ``Minimum Charge'') for disclosing a  minimum interest or fixed finance charge under Sec. Sec. 1026.60(b)(3)  and 1026.6(b)(2)(iii). If a creditor imposes a minimum charge in lieu of  interest in those months where a consumer would otherwise incur an  interest charge but that interest charge is less than the minimum  charge, the creditor should disclose this charge under the heading  ``Minimum Interest Charge'' or a   substantially similar heading. Other minimum or fixed finance charges  should be disclosed under the heading ``Minimum Charge'' or a  substantially similar heading.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Models G-10(A), G-10(D) and G-17(A) contain two alternative  headings (``Annual Fees'' and ``Set-up and Maintenance Fees'') for  disclosing fees for issuance or availability of credit under Sec.  1026.60(b)(2) or Sec. 1026.6(b)(2)(ii). If the only fee for issuance or  availability of credit disclosed under Sec. 1026.60(b)(2) or Sec.  1026.6(b)(2)(ii) is an annual fee, a creditor should use the heading  ``Annual Fee'' or a substantially similar heading to disclose this fee.  If a creditor imposes fees for issuance or availability of credit  disclosed under Sec. 1026.60(b)(2) or Sec. 1026.6(b)(2)(ii) other  than, or in addition to, an annual fee, the creditor should use the  heading ``Set-up and Maintenance Fees'' or a substantially similar  heading to disclose fees for issuance or availability of credit,  including the annual fee.</p><p class="depth0">v. Although creditors are not required to use a certain paper size  in disclosing the Sec. Sec. 1026.60 or 1026.6(b)(1) and (2)  disclosures, samples G-10(B), G-10(C), G-17(B), G-17(C) and G-17(D) are  designed to be printed on an 8\1/2\ x 14 inch sheet of paper. A creditor  may use a smaller sheet of paper, such as 8\1/2\ x 11 inch sheet of  paper. If the table is not provided on a single side of a sheet of  paper, the creditor must include a reference or references, such as  ``SEE BACK OF PAGE for more important information about your account.''  at the bottom of each page indicating that the table continues onto an  additional page or pages. A creditor that splits the table onto two or  more pages must disclose the table on consecutive pages and may not  include any intervening information between portions of the table. In  addition, the following formatting techniques were used in presenting  the information in the sample tables to ensure that the information is  readable:</p><p class="depth0">A. A readable font style and font size (10-point Arial font style,  except for the purchase annual percentage rate which is shown in 16- point type).</p><p class="depth0">B. Sufficient spacing between lines of the text.</p><p class="depth0">C. Adequate spacing between paragraphs when several pieces of  information were included in the same row of the table, as appropriate.  For example, in the samples in the row of the tables with the heading  ``APR for Balance Transfers,'' the forms disclose two components: The  applicable balance transfer rate and a cross reference to the balance  transfer fee. The samples show these two components on separate lines  with adequate space between each component. On the other hand, in the  samples, in the disclosure of the late payment fee, the forms disclose  two components: The late payment fee, and the cross reference to the  penalty rate. Because the disclosure of both these components is short,  these components are disclosed on the same line in the tables.</p><p class="depth0">D. Standard spacing between words and characters. In other words,  the text was not compressed to appear smaller than 10-point type.</p><p class="depth0">E. Sufficient white space around the text of the information in each  row, by providing sufficient margins above, below and to the sides of  the text.</p><p class="depth0">F. Sufficient contrast between the text and the background.  Generally, black text was used on white paper.</p><p class="depth0">vi. While the Bureau is not requiring issuers to use the above  formatting techniques in presenting information in the table (except for  the 10-point and 16-point font requirement), the Bureau encourages  issuers to consider these techniques when deciding how to disclose  information in the table, to ensure that the information is presented in  a readable format.</p><p class="depth0">vii. Creditors are allowed to use color, shading and similar graphic  techniques with respect to the table, so long as the table remains  substantially similar to the model and sample forms in appendix G.</p><p class="depth0">viii. Models G-10(A) and G-17(A) contain rows in the table with the  prescribed language, ``For Credit Card Tips from the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau'' and calling for a ``[Reference to the Bureau's Web  site]'' next to that language. Until January 1, 2013, creditors may  substitute ``For Credit Card Tips from the Federal Reserve Board'' for  these two model forms' prescribed language and may provide a reference  to the Federal Reserve Board's Web site rather than the Bureau's Web  site.</p><p class="depth0">6. Model G-11. Model G-11 contains clauses that illustrate the  general disclosures required under Sec. 1026.60(e) in applications and  solicitations made available to the general public.</p><p class="depth0">7. Models G-13(A) and G-13(B). These model forms illustrate the  disclosures required under Sec. 1026.9(f) when the card issuer changes  the entity providing insurance on a credit card account. Model G-13(A)  contains the items set forth in Sec. 1026.9(f)(3) as examples of  significant terms of coverage that may be affected by the change in  insurance provider. The card issuer may either list all of these  potential changes in coverage and place a check mark by the applicable  changes, or list only the actual changes in coverage. Under either  approach, the card issuer must either explain the changes or refer to an  accompanying copy of the policy or group certificate for details of the  new terms of coverage. Model G-13(A) also illustrates the permissible  combination of the two notices required by Sec. 1026.9(f)--the notice  required for a planned change in provider and the notice required once a  change has occurred. This form may be modified for use in providing only   the disclosures required before the change if the card issuer chooses to  send two separate notices. Thus, for example, the references to the  attached policy or certificate would not be required in a separate  notice prior to a change in the insurance provider since the policy or  certificate need not be provided at that time. Model G-13(B) illustrates  the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.9(f)(2) when the insurance  provider is changed.</p><p class="depth0">8. Samples G-18(A)-(D). For home-equity plans subject to the  requirements of Sec. 1026.40, if a creditor chooses to comply with the  requirements in Sec. 1026.7(b), the creditor may use Samples G-18(A)  through G-18(D) to comply with these requirements, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">9. Samples G-18(D). Sample G-18(D) illustrates how credit card  issuers may comply with proximity requirements for payment information  on periodic statements. Creditors that offer card accounts with a charge  card feature and a revolving feature may change the disclosure to make  clear to which feature the disclosures apply.</p><p class="depth0">10. Forms G-18(F)-(G). Forms G-18(F) and G-18(G) are intended as a  compliance aid to illustrate front sides of a periodic statement, and  how a periodic statement for open-end (not home-secured) plans might be  designed to comply with the requirements of Sec. 1026.7. The samples  contain information that is not required by Regulation Z. The samples  also present information in additional formats that are not required by  Regulation Z.</p><p class="depth0">i. Creditors are not required to use a certain paper size in  disclosing the Sec. 1026.7 disclosures. However, Forms G-18(F) and G- 18(G) are designed to be printed on an 8 x 14 inch sheet of paper.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The due date for a payment, if a late payment fee or penalty  rate may be imposed, must appear on the front of the first page of the  statement. See Sample G-18(D) that illustrates how a creditor may comply  with proximity requirements for other disclosures. The payment  information disclosures appear in the upper right-hand corner on Samples  G-18(F) and G-18(G), but may be located elsewhere, as long as they  appear on the front of the first page of the periodic statement. The  summary of account activity presented on Samples G-18(F) and G-18(G) is  not itself a required disclosure, although the previous balance and the  new balance, presented in the summary, must be disclosed in a clear and  conspicuous manner on periodic statements.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Additional information not required by Regulation Z may be  presented on the statement. The information need not be located in any  particular place or be segregated from disclosures required by  Regulation Z, although the effect of proximity requirements for required  disclosures, such as the due date, may cause the additional information  to be segregated from those disclosures required to be disclosed in  close proximity to one another. Any additional information must be  presented consistent with the creditor's obligation to provide required  disclosures in a clear and conspicuous manner.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Model Forms G-18(F) and G-18(G) demonstrate two examples of ways  in which transactions could be presented on the periodic statement.  Model Form G-18(G) presents transactions grouped by type and Model Form  G-18(F) presents transactions in a list in chronological order. Neither  of these approaches to presenting transactions is required; a creditor  may present transactions differently, such as in a list grouped by  authorized user or other means.</p><p class="depth0">11. Model Form G-19. See Sec. 1026.9(b)(3) regarding the headings  required to be disclosed when describing in the tabular disclosure a  grace period (or lack of a grace period) offered on check transactions  that access a credit card account.</p><p class="depth0">12. Sample G-24. Sample G-24 includes two model clauses for use in  complying with Sec. 1026.16(h)(4). Model clause (a) is for use in  connection with credit card accounts under an open-end (not home- secured) consumer credit plan. Model clause (b) is for use in connection  with other open-end credit plans.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix H--Closed-End Model Forms and Clauses</p><p class="depth0">1. Models H-1 and H-2. i. Creditors may make several types of  changes to closed-end model forms H-1 (credit sale) and H-2 (loan) and  still be deemed to be in compliance with the regulation, provided that  the required disclosures are made clearly and conspicuously. Permissible  changes include the addition of the information permitted by Sec.  1026.17(a)(1) and ``directly related'' information as set forth in the  commentary to Sec. 1026.17(a).ii. The creditor may also delete or, on  multi-purpose forms, indicate inapplicable disclosures, such as:</p><p class="depth0">A. The itemization of the amount financed option. (See Samples H-12  through H-15.)</p><p class="depth0">B. The credit life and disability insurance disclosures. (See  Samples H-11 and H-12.)</p><p class="depth0">C. The property insurance disclosures. (See Samples H-10 through H- 12, and H-14.)</p><p class="depth0">D. The ``filing fees'' and ``non-filing insurance'' disclosures.  (See Samples H-11 and H-12.)</p><p class="depth0">E. The prepayment penalty or rebate disclosures. (See Samples H-12  and H-14.)</p><p class="depth0">F. The total sale price. (See Samples H-11 through H-15.)</p><p class="depth0">iii. Other permissible changes include:</p><p class="depth0">A. Adding the creditor's address or telephone number. (See the  commentary to Sec. 1026.18(a).)</p><p class="depth0">B. Combining required terms where several numerical disclosures are  the same, for instance, if the ``total of payments'' equals the ``total  sale price.'' (See the commentary to Sec. 1026.18.)</p><p class="depth0">C. Rearranging the sequence or location of the disclosures--for  instance, by placing the descriptive phrases outside the boxes  containing the corresponding disclosures, or by grouping the descriptors  together as a glossary of terms in a separate section of the segregated  disclosures; by placing the payment schedule at the top of the form; or  by changing the order of the disclosures in the boxes, including the  annual percentage rate and finance charge boxes.</p><p class="depth0">D. Using brackets, instead of checkboxes, to indicate inapplicable  disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">E. Using a line for the consumer to initial, rather than a checkbox,  to indicate an election to receive an itemization of the amount  financed.</p><p class="depth0">F. Deleting captions for disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">G. Using a symbol, such as an asterisk, for estimated disclosures,  instead of an ``e.''</p><p class="depth0">H. Adding a signature line to the insurance disclosures to reflect  joint policies.</p><p class="depth0">I. Separately itemizing the filing fees.</p><p class="depth0">J. Revising the late charge disclosure in accordance with the  commentary to Sec. 1026.18(l).</p><p class="depth0">2. Model H-3. Creditors have considerable flexibility in filling out  Model H-3 (itemization of the amount financed). Appropriate revisions,  such as those set out in the commentary to Sec. 1026.18(c), may be made  to this form without loss of protection from civil liability for proper  use of the model forms.</p><p class="depth0">3. Models H-4 through H-7. The model clauses are not included in the  model forms although they are mandatory for certain transactions.  Creditors using the model clauses when applicable to a transaction are  deemed to be in compliance with the regulation with regard to that  disclosure.</p><p class="depth0">4. Model H-4(A). This model contains the variable rate model clauses  applicable to transactions subject to Sec. 1026.18(f)(1) and is  intended to give creditors considerable flexibility in structuring  variable rate disclosures to fit individual plans. The information about  circumstances, limitations, and effects of an increase may be given in  terms of the contract interest rate or the annual percentage rate.  Clauses are shown for hypothetical examples based on the specific amount  of the transaction and based on a representative amount. Creditors may  preprint the variable rate disclosures based on a representative amount  for similar types of transactions, instead of constructing an  individualized example for each transaction. In both representative  examples and transaction-specific examples, creditors may refer either  to the incremental change in rate, payment amount, or number of  payments, or to the resulting rate, payment amount, or number of  payments. For example, creditors may state that the rate will increase  by 2%, with a corresponding $150 increase in the payment, or creditors  may state that the rate will increase to 16%, with a corresponding  payment of $850.</p><p class="depth0">5. Model H-4(B). This model clause illustrates the variable-rate  disclosure required under Sec. 1026.18(f)(2), which would alert  consumers to the fact that the transaction contains a variable-rate  feature and that disclosures were provided earlier.</p><p class="depth0">6. Model H-4(C). This model clause illustrates the early disclosures  required generally under Sec. 1026.19(b). It includes information on  how the consumer's interest rate is determined and how it can change  over the term of the loan, and explains changes that may occur in the  borrower's monthly payment. It contains an example of how to disclose  historical changes in the index or formula values used to compute  interest rates for the preceding 15 years. The model clause also  illustrates the disclosure of the initial and maximum interest rates and  payments based on an initial interest rate (index value plus margin,  adjusted by the amount of any discount or premium) in effect as of an  identified month and year for the loan program disclosure and  illustrates how to provide consumers with a method for calculating the  monthly payment for the loan amount to be borrowed.</p><p class="depth0">7. Models H-4(D) through H-4(J). These model clauses and sample and  model forms illustrate certain notices, statements, and other  disclosures required as follows:</p><p class="depth0">i. Model H-4(D)(1) illustrates the interest rate adjustment notice  required under Sec. 1026.20(c) and Model H-4(D)(2) provides an example  of a notice of interest rate adjustment with corresponding payment  change. Model H-4(D)(3) illustrates the interest rate adjustment notice  required under Sec. 1026.20(d) and Model H-4(D)(4) provides an example  of a notice of initial interest rate adjustment.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Model H-4(E) illustrates the interest rate and payment summary  table required under Sec. 1026.18(s) for a fixed-rate mortgage  transaction.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Model H-4(F) illustrates the interest rate and payment summary  table required under Sec. 1026.18(s) for an adjustable-rate or a step- rate mortgage transaction.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Model H-4(G) illustrates the interest rate and payment summary  table required under Sec. 1026.18(s) for a mortgage transaction with  negative amortization.</p><p class="depth0">v. Model H-4(H) illustrates the interest rate and payment summary  table required under Sec. 1026.18(s) for a fixed-rate, interest-only  mortgage transaction.</p><p class="depth0">vi. Model H-4(I) illustrates the introductory rate disclosure  required by Sec. 1026.18(s)(2)(iii) for an adjustable-rate mortgage  transaction with an introductory rate.</p><p class="depth0">vii. Model H-4(J) illustrates the balloon payment disclosure  required by Sec. 1026.18(s)(5) for a mortgage transaction with a  balloon payment term.</p><p class="depth0">viii. Model H-4(K) illustrates the no-guarantee-to-refinance  statement required by Sec. 1026.18(t) for a mortgage transaction.</p><p class="depth0">8. Model H-5. This contains the demand feature clause.</p><p class="depth0">9. Model H-6. This contains the assumption clause.</p><p class="depth0">10. Model H-7. This contains the required deposit clause.</p><p class="depth0">11. Models H-8 and H-9. These models contain the rescission notices  for a typical closed-end transaction and a refinancing, respectively.  The last paragraph of each model form contains a blank for the date by  which the consumer's notice of cancellation must be sent or delivered. A  parenthetical is included to address the situation in which the  consumer's right to rescind the transaction exists beyond 3 business  days following the date of the transaction, for example, where the  notice or material disclosures are delivered late or where the date of  the transaction in paragraph 1 of the notice is an estimate. The  language of the parenthetical is not optional. See the commentary to  Sec. 1026.2(a)(25) regarding the specificity of the security interest  disclosure for model form H-9. The prior version of model form H-9 is  substantially similar to the current version and creditors may continue  to use it, as appropriate. Creditors are encouraged, however, to use the  current version when reordering or reprinting forms.</p><p class="depth0">12. Sample forms. The sample forms (H-10 through H-15) serve a  different purpose than the model forms. The samples illustrate various  ways of adapting the model forms to the individual transactions  described in the commentary to appendix H. The deletions and  rearrangements shown relate only to the specific transactions described.  As a result, the samples do not provide the general protection from  civil liability provided by the model forms and clauses.</p><p class="depth0">13. Sample H-10. This sample illustrates an automobile credit sale.  The cash price is $7,500 with a downpayment of $1,500. There is an 8%  add-on interest rate and a term of 3 years, with 36 equal monthly  payments. The credit life insurance premium and the filing fees are  financed by the creditor. There is a $25 credit report fee paid by the  consumer before consummation, which is a prepaid finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">14. Sample H-11. This sample illustrates an installment loan. The  amount of the loan is $5,000. There is a 12% simple interest rate and a  term of 2 years. The date of the transaction is expected to be April 15,  1981, with the first payment due on June 1, 1981. The first payment  amount is labeled as an estimate since the transaction date is  uncertain. The odd days' interest ($26.67) is collected with the first  payment. The remaining 23 monthly payments are equal.</p><p class="depth0">15. Sample H-12. This sample illustrates a refinancing and  consolidation loan. The amount of the loan is $5,000. There is a 15%  simple interest rate and a term of 3 years. The date of the transaction  is April 1, 1981, with the first payment due on May 1, 1981. The first  35 monthly payments are equal, with an odd final payment. The credit  disability insurance premium is financed. In calculating the annual  percentage rate, the U.S. Rule has been used. Since an itemization of  the amount financed is included with the disclosures, the statement  regarding the consumer's option to receive an itemization is deleted.</p><p class="depth0">16. Samples H-13 through H-15. These samples illustrate various  mortgage transactions. They assume that the mortgages are subject to the  Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA). As a result, no option  regarding the itemization of the amount financed has been included in  the samples, because providing the good faith estimates of settlement  costs required by RESPA satisfies Truth in Lending's amount financed  itemization requirement. (See Sec. 1026.18(c).)</p><p class="depth0">17. Sample H-13. This sample illustrates a mortgage with a demand  feature. The loan amount is $44,900, payable in 360 monthly installments  at a simple interest rate of 14.75%. The 15 days of interim interest  ($294.34) is collected as a prepaid finance charge at the time of  consummation of the loan (April 15, 1981). In calculating the disclosure  amounts, the minor irregularities provision in Sec. 1026.17(c)(4) has  been used. The property insurance premiums are not included in the  payment schedule. This disclosure statement could be used for notes with  the 7-year call option required by the Federal National Mortgage  Association (FNMA) in states where due-on-sale clauses are prohibited.</p><p class="depth0">18. Sample H-14. This sample disclosure form illustrates the  disclosures under Sec. 1026.19(b) for a variable-rate transaction  secured by the consumer's principal dwelling with a term greater than  one year. The sample form shows a creditor how to adapt the model  clauses in appendix H-4(C) to the creditor's own particular variable- rate program. The sample disclosure form describes the features of a  specific variable-rate mortgage program and alerts the consumer to the  fact that information on the creditor's other closed-end variable-rate  programs is available upon request. It includes information on how the  interest rate is determined and how it can change over time. Section  1026.19(b)(2)(viii) permits creditors the option to provide either a  historical example or an initial and maximum interest rates and payments  disclosure; both are illustrated in the sample disclosure. The  historical example explains how the monthly payment can change based on  a $10,000 loan amount, payable in 360 monthly installments, based on  historical changes in the values for the   weekly average yield on U.S. Treasury Securities adjusted to a constant  maturity of one year. Index values are measured for 15 years, as of the  first week ending in July. This reflects the requirement that the index  history be based on values for the same date or period each year in the  example. The sample disclosure also illustrates the alternative  disclosure under Sec. 1026.19(b)(2)(viii)(B) that the initial and the  maximum interest rates and payments be shown for a $10,000 loan  originated at an initial interest rate of 12.41 percent (which was in  effect July 1996) and to have 2 percentage point annual (and 5  percentage point overall) interest rate limitations or caps. Thus, the  maximum amount that the interest rate could rise under this program is 5  percentage points higher than the 12.41 percent initial rate to 17.41  percent, and the monthly payment could rise from $106.03 to a maximum of  $145.34. The loan would not reach the maximum interest rate until its  fourth year because of the 2 percentage point annual rate limitations,  and the maximum payment disclosed reflects the amortization of the loan  during that period. The sample form also illustrates how to provide  consumers with a method for calculating their actual monthly payment for  a loan amount other than $10,000.</p><p class="depth0">19. Sample H-15. This sample illustrates a graduated payment  mortgage with a 5-year graduation period and a 7\1/2\ percent yearly  increase in payments. The loan amount is $44,900, payable in 360 monthly  installments at a simple interest rate of 14.75%. Two points ($898), as  well as an initial mortgage guarantee insurance premium of $225.00, are  included in the prepaid finance charge. The mortgage guarantee insurance  premiums are calculated on the basis of \1/4\ of 1% of the outstanding  principal balance under an annual reduction plan. The abbreviated  disclosure permitted under Sec. 1026.18(g)(2) is used for the payment  schedule for years 6 through 30. The prepayment disclosure refers to  both penalties and rebates because information about penalties is  required for the simple interest portion of the obligation and  information about rebates is required for the mortgage insurance portion  of the obligation.</p><p class="depth0">20. Sample H-16. This sample illustrates the disclosures required  under Sec. 1026.32(c). The sample illustrates the amount borrowed and  the disclosures about optional insurance that are required for mortgage  refinancings under Sec. 1026.32(c)(5). Creditors may, at their option,  include these disclosures for all loans subject to Sec. 1026.32. The  sample also includes disclosures required under Sec. 1026.32(c)(3) when  the legal obligation includes a balloon payment.</p><p class="depth0">21. HRSA-500-1 9-82. Pursuant to section 113(a) of the Truth in  Lending Act, Form HRSA-500-1 9-82 issued by the U.S. Department of  Health and Human Services for certain student loans has been approved  for use for loans made prior to the mandatory compliance date of the  disclosures required under Subpart F.

Models H-18, H-19, H-20. i. These model forms illustrate  disclosures required under Sec. 1026.47 on or with an application or  solicitation, at approval, and after acceptance of a private education  loan. Although use of the model forms is not required, creditors using  them properly will be deemed to be in compliance with the regulation  with regard to private education loan disclosures. Creditors may make  certain types of changes to private education loan model forms H-18  (application and solicitation), H-19 (approval), and H-20 (final) and  still be deemed to be in compliance with the regulation, provided that  the required disclosures are made clearly and conspicuously. The model  forms aggregate disclosures into groups under specific headings. Changes  may not include rearranging the sequence of disclosures, for instance,  by rearranging which disclosures are provided under each heading or by  rearranging the sequence of the headings and grouping of disclosures.  Changes to the model forms may not be so extensive as to affect the  substance or clarity of the forms.   Creditors making revisions with that effect will lose their protection  from civil liability.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The creditor may delete inapplicable disclosures, such as:</p><p class="depth0">A. The Federal student financial assistance alternatives  disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">B. The self-certification disclosure.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Other permissible changes include, for example:</p><p class="depth0">A. Adding the creditor's address, telephone number, or Web site.</p><p class="depth0">B. Adding loan identification information, such as a loan  identification number.</p><p class="depth0">C. Adding the date on which the form was printed or produced.</p><p class="depth0">D. Placing the notice of the right to cancel in the top left or top  right of the disclosure to accommodate a window envelope.</p><p class="depth0">E. Combining required terms where several numerical disclosures are  the same. For instance, if the itemization of the amount financed is  provided, the amount financed need not be separately disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">F. Combining the disclosure of loan term and payment deferral  options required in Sec. 1026.47(a)(3) with the disclosure of cost  estimates required in Sec. 1026.47(a)(4) in the same chart or table  (See comment 47(a)(3)-4.)</p><p class="depth0">G. Using the first person, instead of the second person, in  referring to the borrower.</p><p class="depth0">H. Using ``borrower'' and ``creditor'' instead of pronouns.</p><p class="depth0">I. Incorporating certain state ``plain English'' requirements.</p><p class="depth0">J. Deleting inapplicable disclosures by whiting out, blocking out,  filling in ``N/A'' (not applicable) or ``0,'' crossing out, leaving  blanks, checking a box for applicable items, or circling applicable  items.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Although creditors are not required to use a certain paper size  in disclosing the Sec. Sec. 1026.47(a), (b) and (c) disclosures,  samples H-21, H-22, and H-23 are designed to be printed on two 8\1/2\ x  11 inch sheets of paper. A creditor may use a larger sheet of paper,  such as 8\1/2\ x 14 inch sheets of paper, or may use multiple pages. If  the disclosures are provided on two sides of a single sheet of paper,  the creditor must include a reference or references, such as ``SEE BACK  OF PAGE'' at the bottom of each page indicating that the disclosures  continue onto the back of the page. If the disclosures are on two or  more pages, a creditor may not include any intervening information  between portions of the disclosure. In addition, the following  formatting techniques were used in presenting the information in the  sample tables to ensure that the information is readable:</p><p class="depth0">A. A readable font style and font size (10-point Helvetica font  style for body text).</p><p class="depth0">B. Sufficient spacing between lines of the text.</p><p class="depth0">C.

Creditors are allowed to use color, shading and similar graphic  techniques in the disclosures, so long as the disclosures remain  substantially similar to the model and sample forms in appendix H.</p><p class="depth0">26. Sample H-21. This sample illustrates a disclosure required under  Sec. 1026.47(a). The sample assumes a range of interest rates between  7.375% and 17.375%. The sample assumes a variable interest rate that  will never exceed 25% over the life of the loan. The term of the sample  loan is 20 years for an amount up to $20,000 and 30 years for an amount  more than $20,000. The repayment options and sample costs have been  combined into a single table, as permitted in the commentary to Sec.  1026.47(a)(3). It demonstrates the loan amount, interest rate, and total  paid when a consumer makes loan payments while in school, pays only  interest while in school, and defers all payments while in school.</p><p class="depth0">27. Sample H-22. This sample illustrates a disclosure required under  Sec. 1026.47(b). The sample assumes the consumer financed $10,000 at an  8.23% annual percentage rate. The sample assumes a variable interest  rate that will never exceed 25% over the life of the loan. The payment  schedule and terms assumes a 20-year loan term and that the consumer  elected to defer payments while enrolled in school. This includes a  sample disclosure of a total loan amount of $10,600 and prepaid finance  charges totaling $600, for a total amount financed of $10,000.</p><p class="depth0">28. Sample H-22. This sample illustrates a disclosure required under  Sec. 1026.47(c). The sample assumes the consumer financed $10,000 at an  8.23% annual percentage rate. The sample assumes a variable annual  percentage rate in an instance where there is no maximum interest rate.  The sample demonstrates disclosure of an assumed maximum rate, and the  statement that the consumer's actual maximum rate and payment amount  could be higher. The payment schedule and terms assumes a 20-year loan  term, the assumed maximum interest rate, and that the consumer elected  to defer payments while enrolled in school. This includes a sample  disclosure of a total loan amount of $10,600   and prepaid finance charges totaling $600, for a total amount financed  of $10,000.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix J--Annual Percentage Rate Computations for Closed-End Credit</p><p class="depth0">Transactions</p><p class="depth0">1. Use of appendix J. Appendix J sets forth the actuarial equations  and instructions for calculating the annual percentage rate in closed- end credit transactions. While the formulas contained in this appendix  may be directly applied to calculate the annual percentage rate for an  individual transaction, they may also be utilized to program calculators  and computers to perform the calculations.</p><p class="depth0">2. Relation to Bureau tables. The Bureau's Annual Percentage Rate  Tables also provide creditors with a calculation tool that applies the  technical information in appendix J. An annual percentage rate computed  in accordance with the instructions in the tables is deemed to comply  with the regulation. Volume I of the tables may be used for credit  transactions involving equal payment amounts and periods, as well as for  transactions involving any of the following irregularities: odd first  period, odd first payment and odd last payment. Volume II of the tables  may be used for transactions that involve any type of irregularities.  These tables may be obtained from the Bureau, 1700 G Street, NW.,  Washington, DC 20006, upon request.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix K--Total Annual Loan Cost Rate Computations for Reverse</p><p class="depth0">Mortgage Transactions</p><p class="depth0">1. General. The calculation of total annual loan cost rates under  appendix K is based on the principles set forth and the estimation or  ``iteration'' procedure used to compute annual percentage rates under  appendix J. Rather than restate this iteration process in full, the  regulation cross-references the procedures found in appendix J. In other  aspects the appendix reflects the special nature of reverse mortgage  transactions. Special definitions and instructions are included where  appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Instructions and equations for the total annual loan cost rate</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Number of unit-periods between two given dates</p><p class="depth0">1. Assumption as to when transaction begins. The computation of the  total annual loan cost rate is based on the assumption that the reverse  mortgage transaction begins on the first day of the month in which  consummation is estimated to occur. Therefore, fractional unit-periods  (used under appendix J for calculating annual percentage rates) are not  used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Assumption for discretionary cash advances</p><p class="depth0">1. Amount of credit. Creditors should compute the total annual loan  cost rates for transactions involving discretionary cash advances by  assuming that 50 percent of the initial amount of the credit available  under the transaction is advanced at closing or, in an open-end  transaction, when the consumer becomes obligated under the plan. (For  the purposes of this assumption, the initial amount of the credit is the  principal loan amount less any costs to the consumer under Sec.  1026.33(c)(1).)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Assumption for variable-rate reverse mortgage transactions</p><p class="depth0">1. Initial discount or premium rate. Where a variable-rate reverse  mortgage transaction includes an initial discount or premium rate, the  creditor should apply the same rules for calculating the total annual  loan cost rate as are applied when calculating the annual percentage  rate for a loan with an initial discount or premium rate (see the  commentary to Sec. 1026.17(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Reverse mortgage model form and sample form</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sample form</p><p class="depth0">1.

The life expectancy figures used in appendix L are those  found in the U.S. Decennial Life Tables for women, as rounded to the  nearest whole year and as published by the U.S. Department of Health and  Human Services. The figures contained in appendix L must be used by  creditors for all consumers (men and women).

The ``title commitment report'' is a  document from a title insurance company describing the property interest  and status of its title, parties with interests in the title and the  nature of their   claims, issues with the title that must be resolved prior to closing of  the transaction between the parties to the transfer, amount and  disposition of the premiums, and endorsements on the title policy. This  document is issued by the title insurance company prior to the company's  issuance of an actual title insurance policy to the property's  transferee and/or creditor financing the transaction.

Secured by new manufactured home and land--physical visit of the  interior. A transaction secured by a new manufactured home and land is  subject to the requirements of Sec. 1026.35(c)(3) through (6) except  for the requirement in Sec. 1026.35(c)(3)(i) that the appraiser conduct  a physical inspection of the interior of the property. Thus, for  example, a creditor of a loan secured by a new manufactured home and  land could comply with Sec. 1026.35(c)(3)(i) by obtaining an appraisal  conducted by a state-certified or -licensed appraiser based on plans and  specifications for the new manufactured home and an inspection of the  land on which the property will be sited, as well as any other  information necessary for the appraiser to complete the appraisal  assignment in conformity with the Uniform Standards of Professional  Appraisal Practice and the requirements of FIRREA and any implementing  regulations.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 35(c)(2)(viii)(B)</p><p class="depth0">1.

Independent. A cost service provider from which the creditor  obtains a manufactured home unit cost estimate under Sec.  1026.35(c)(2)(viii)(B)(2) is ``independent'' if that person is not  affiliated with the creditor in the transaction, such as by common  corporate ownership, and receives no direct or indirect financial  benefits based on whether the transaction is consummated.</p><p class="depth0">2. Adjustments. The requirement that the cost estimate be from an  independent cost service provider does not prohibit a creditor from  providing a cost estimate that reflects adjustments to account for  factors such as special features, condition or location. However, the  requirement that the estimate be obtained from an independent cost  service provider means that any adjustments to the estimate must be  based on adjustment factors available as part of the independent cost  service used, with associated values that are determined by the  independent cost service.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 35(c)(2)(viii)(C)(3)</p><p class="depth0">1.

To illustrate,  a person who seeks a loan to purchase the manufactured home to be valued  has a reasonably foreseeable ownership interest in the property.</p><p class="depth0">2. Interest in the transaction. A person has a direct or indirect  interest in the transaction if, for example, the person or an affiliate  of that person also serves as a loan officer of the creditor or  otherwise arranges the credit transaction, or is the retail dealer of  the   manufactured home. A person also has a prohibited interest in the  transaction if the person is compensated or otherwise receives financial  or other benefits based on whether the transaction is consummated.</p><p class="depth0">3.

Effective date. The Bureau's revisions to Regulation X and  Regulation Z published on December 31, 2013 (the TILA-RESPA Final Rule),  apply to covered loans (closed-end credit transactions secured by real  property) for which the creditor or mortgage broker receives an  application on or after August 1, 2015 (the ``effective date''), except  that new Sec. 1026.19(e)(2), the amendments to Sec. 1026.28(a)(1), and  the amendments to the commentary to Sec. 1026.29, become effective on  August 1, 2015 without respect to whether an application has been  received. The provisions of Sec. 1026.19(e)(2) apply prior to a  consumer's receipt of the disclosures required by   Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i), and therefore, restrict activity that may occur  prior to receipt of an application by a creditor or mortgage broker  under Sec. 1026.19(e). These provisions include Sec. 1026.19(e)(2)(i),  which restricts the fees that may be imposed on a consumer, Sec.  1026.19(e)(2)(ii), which requires a statement to be included on written  estimates of terms or costs specific to a consumer, and Sec.  1026.19(e)(2)(iii), which prohibits creditors from requiring the  submission of documents verifying information related to the consumer's  application. Accordingly, the provisions under Sec. 1026.19(e)(2) are  effective on August 1, 2015, without respect to whether an application  has been received on that date. In addition, the amendments to Sec.  1026.28 and the commentary to Sec. 1026.29 govern the preemption of  State laws and thus, the amendments to those provisions and associated  commentary made by the TILA-RESPA Final Rule are effective on August 1,  2015, without respect to whether an application has been received on  that date. The following examples illustrate the application of the  effective date for the TILA-RESPA Final Rule.</p><p class="depth0">i. General. Assume a creditor receives an application, as defined  under Sec. 1026.2(a)(3) of the TILA-RESPA Final Rule, for a transaction  subject to Sec. 1026.19(e) and (f) on August 1, 2015, and that  consummation of the transaction occurs on August 31, 2015. The  amendments of the TILA-RESPA Final Rule, including the requirements to  provide the Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure under Sec. 1026.19(e)  and (f), apply to the transaction. The creditor would also be required  to provide the special information booklet under Sec. 1026.19(g) of the  TILA-RESPA Final Rule, as applicable. Assume a creditor receives an  application, as defined under Sec. 1026.2(a)(3) of the TILA-RESPA Final  Rule, for a transaction subject to Sec. 1026.19(e) and (f) on July 31,  2015, and that consummation of the transaction occurs on August 30,  2015. The amendments of the TILA-RESPA Final Rule, including the  requirements to provide the Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure under  Sec. 1026.19(e) and (f), do not apply to the transaction, except that  the provisions of Sec. 1026.19(e)(2), specifically Sec.  1026.19(e)(2)(i), (e)(2)(ii), and (e)(2)(iii), do apply to the  transaction beginning on August 1, 2015 because they become effective on  August 1, 2015, without respect to whether an application, as defined  under Sec. 1026.2(a)(3) of the TILA-RESPA Final Rule, has been received  by the creditor or mortgage broker on that date. The creditor does not  provide the Closing Disclosure so that it is received by the consumer at  least three business days before consummation; instead, the creditor and  the settlement agent provide the disclosures under Sec.  1026.19(a)(2)(ii) and Sec. 1024.8, as applicable, under the Truth in  Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, respectively.  The requirement to provide the special information booklet under Sec.  1026.19(g) of the TILA-RESPA Final Rule would also not apply to the  transaction. But the creditor would provide the special information  booklet under Sec. 1024.6, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Predisclosure written estimates. Assume a creditor receives a  request from a consumer for a written estimate of terms or costs  specific to the consumer on August 1, 2015, before the consumer submits  an application to the creditor, and thus, before the consumer has  received the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i). The  creditor, if it provides such written estimate to the consumer, must  comply with the requirements of Sec. 1026.19(e)(2)(ii) and provide the  required statement on the written estimate, even though the creditor has  not received an application for a transaction subject to Sec.  1026.19(e) and (f) on that date.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Request for preemption determination. Assume a creditor submits  a request to the Bureau under Sec. 1026.28(a)(1) for a determination of  whether a State law is inconsistent with the disclosure requirements of  the TILA-RESPA Final Rule on August 1, 2015. Because the amendments to  Sec. 1026.28(a)(1) are effective on that date and do not depend on  whether the creditor has received an application as defined under Sec.  1026.2(a)(3) of the TILA-RESPA Final Rule, Sec. 1026.28(a)(1), as  amended by the TILA-RESPA Final Rule, is applicable to the request on  that date and the Bureau would make a determination based on the  amendments of the TILA-RESPA Final Rule, including, for example, the  requirements of Sec. 1026.37.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.2--Definitions and Rules of Construction</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(3) Application.</p><p class="depth0">1. In general. An application means the submission of a consumer's  financial information for purposes of obtaining an extension of credit.  For transactions subject to Sec. 1026.19(e), (f), or (g) of this part,  the term consists of the consumer's name, the consumer's income, the  consumer's social security number to obtain a credit report, the  property address, an estimate of the value of the property, and the  mortgage loan amount sought. This definition does not prevent a creditor  from collecting whatever additional information it deems necessary in  connection with the request for the extension of credit. However, once a  creditor has received these six pieces of information, it has an  application for purposes of the requirements of Regulation Z. A  submission may be in written or electronic format and includes a written  record of an oral application. The following examples for a transaction  subject to   Sec. 1026.19(e), (f), or (g) are illustrative of this provision:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume a creditor provides a consumer with an application form  containing 20 questions about the consumer's credit history and the  collateral value. The consumer submits answers to nine of the questions  and informs the creditor that the consumer will contact the creditor the  next day with answers to the other 11 questions. Although the consumer  provided nine pieces of information, the consumer did not provide a  social security number. The creditor has not yet received an application  for purposes of Sec. 1026.2(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume a creditor requires all applicants to submit 20 pieces of  information. The consumer submits only six pieces of information and  informs the creditor that the consumer will contact the creditor the  next day with answers to the other 14 questions. The six pieces of  information provided by the consumer were the consumer's name, income,  social security number, property address, estimate of the value of the  property, and the mortgage loan amount sought. Even though the creditor  requires 14 additional pieces of information to process the consumer's  request for a mortgage loan, the creditor has received an application  for the purposes of Sec. 1026.2(a)(3) and therefore must comply with  the relevant requirements under Sec. 1026.19.</p><p class="depth0">2. Social security number to obtain a credit report. If a consumer  does not have a social security number, the creditor may substitute  whatever unique identifier the creditor uses to obtain a credit report  on the consumer. For example, a creditor has obtained a social security  number to obtain a credit report for purposes of Sec. 1026.2(a)(3)(ii)  if the creditor collects a Tax Identification Number from a consumer who  does not have a social security number, such as a foreign national.</p><p class="depth0">3. Receipt of credit report fees. Section 1026.19(a)(1)(iii) permits  the imposition of a fee to obtain the consumer's credit history prior to  the delivery of the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(a)(1)(i).  Section 1026.19(e)(2)(i)(B) permits the imposition of a fee to obtain  the consumer's credit report prior to the delivery of the disclosures  required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i). Whether, or when, such fees are  received does not affect whether an application has been received for  the purposes of the definition in Sec. 1026.2(a)(3) and the timing  requirements in Sec. 1026.19(a)(1)(i) and (e)(1)(iii). For example, if,  in a transaction subject to Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i), a creditor receives  the six pieces of information identified under Sec. 1026.2(a)(3)(ii) on  Monday, June 1, but does not receive a credit report fee from the  consumer until Tuesday, June 2, the creditor does not comply with Sec.  1026.19(e)(1)(iii) if it provides the disclosures required under Sec.  1026.19(e)(1)(i) after Thursday, June 4. The three-business-day period  beings on Monday, June 1, the date the creditor received the six pieces  of information. The waiting period does not begin on Tuesday, June 2,  the date the creditor received the credit report fee.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(6) Business day.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">2.

Four Federal legal holidays are identified in 5 U.S.C. 6103(a)  by a specific date: New Year's Day, January 1; Independence Day, July 4;  Veterans Day, November 11; and Christmas Day, December 25. When one of  these holidays (July 4, for example) falls on a Saturday, Federal  offices and other entities might observe the holiday on the preceding  Friday (July 3). In cases where the more precise rule applies, the  observed holiday (in the example, July 3) is a business day.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">2(a)(25) Security interest.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">2. Exclusions. The general definition of security interest excludes  three groups of interests: incidental interests, interests in after- acquired property, and interests that arise solely by operation of law.  These interests may not be disclosed with the disclosures required under  Sec. Sec. 1026.18, 1026.19(e) and (f), and 1026.38(l)(6), but the  creditor is not precluded from preserving these rights elsewhere in the  contract documents, or invoking and enforcing such rights, if it is  otherwise lawful to do so. If the creditor is unsure whether a  particular interest is one of the excluded interests, the creditor may,  at its option, consider such interests as security interests for  purposes of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) and  Regulation Z.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.3--Exempt Transactions</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">3(a) Business, commercial, agricultural, or organizational credit.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">9. Organizational credit. The exemption for transactions in which  the borrower is not a natural person applies, for example, to loans to  corporations, partnerships, associations, churches, unions, and  fraternal organizations. The exemption applies regardless of the purpose  of the credit extension and regardless of the fact that a natural person  may guarantee or provide security for the credit. But see comment 3(a)- 10 concerning credit extended to trusts.</p><p class="depth0">10. Trusts. Credit extended for consumer purposes to certain trusts  is considered to be credit extended to a natural person rather than  credit extended to an organization. Specifically:</p><p class="depth0">i. Trusts for tax or estate planning purposes. In some instances, a  creditor may extend credit for consumer purposes to a trust that a  consumer has created for tax or estate planning purposes (or both).  Consumers sometimes place their assets in trust, with themselves or  themselves and their families or other prospective heirs as  beneficiaries, to obtain certain tax benefits and to facilitate the  future administration of their estates. During their lifetimes, however,  such consumers may continue to use the assets and/or income of such  trusts as their property. A creditor extending credit to finance the  acquisition of, for example, a consumer's dwelling that is held in such  a trust, or to refinance existing debt secured by such a dwelling, may  prepare the note, security instrument, and similar loan documents for  execution by a trustee, rather than the beneficiaries of the trust.  Regardless of the capacity or capacities in which the loan documents are  executed, assuming the transaction is primarily for personal, family, or  household purposes, the transaction is subject to the regulation because  in substance (if not form) consumer credit is being extended.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Land trusts. In some jurisdictions, a financial institution  financing a residential real estate transaction for an individual uses a  land trust mechanism. Title to the property is conveyed to the land  trust for which the financial institution itself is trustee. The  underlying installment note is executed by the financial institution in  its capacity as trustee and payment is secured by a trust deed,  reflecting title in the financial institution as trustee. In some  instances, the consumer executes a personal guaranty of the  indebtedness. The note provides that it is payable only out of the  property specifically described in the trust deed and that the trustee  has no personal liability on the note. Assuming the transactions are  primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, these  transactions are subject to the regulation because in substance (if not  form) consumer credit is being extended.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">3(h) Partial exemption for certain mortgage loans.</p><p class="depth0">1. Partial exemption. Section 1026.3(h) exempts certain transactions  from only the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(e), (f), and (g),  and not from any of the other applicable requirements of this part. As  provided by Sec. 1026.3(h)(6), creditors must comply with all other  applicable requirements of this part. In addition, the creditor must  provide the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.18, even if the creditor  would not otherwise be subject to the disclosure requirements of Sec.  1026.18. The consumer also has the right to rescind the transaction  under Sec. 1026.23, to the extent that provision is applicable.</p><p class="depth0">2. Requirements of exemption. The conditions that the transaction  not require the payment of interest under Sec. 1026.3(h)(3) and that  repayment of the amount of credit extended be forgiven or deferred in  accordance with Sec. 1026.3(h)(4) is determined by the terms of the  credit contract. The other requirements of Sec. 1026.3(h) need not be  reflected in the credit contract, but the creditor must retain evidence  of compliance with those provisions, as required by Sec. 1026.25(a). In  particular, because the exemption from Sec. 1026.19(e), (f), and (g)  means the consumer will not receive the disclosures of closing costs  under Sec. 1026.37 or Sec. 1026.38, the creditor must have information  reflecting that the total of closing costs imposed in connection with  the transaction is less than one percent of the amount of credit  extended and include no charges other than recordation, application, and  housing counseling fees, in accordance with Sec. 1026.3(h)(5). Unless  an itemization of the amount financed sufficiently details this  requirement, the creditor must establish compliance with Sec.  1026.3(h)(5) by some other written document and retain it in accordance  with Sec. 1026.25(a).</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">Subpart C--Closed End Credit</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.17--General Disclosure Requirements</p><p class="depth0">1.

Balloon payment financing with leasing characteristics. In  certain credit sale or loan transactions, a consumer may reduce the  dollar amount of the payments to be made during the course of the  transaction by agreeing to make, at the end of the loan term, a large  final payment based on the expected residual value of the property. The  consumer may have a number of options with respect to the final payment,  including, among other things, retaining the property and making the  final payment, refinancing the final payment, or transferring the  property to the creditor in lieu of the final payment. Such transactions  may have some of the characteristics of lease transactions subject to  Regulation M (12 CFR Part 1013), but are considered credit transactions  where the consumer assumes the indicia of ownership, including the  risks, burdens and benefits of ownership, upon consummation. These  transactions are governed by the disclosure requirements of this part  instead of Regulation M. Creditors should not include in the segregated  Truth in Lending disclosures additional information. Thus, disclosures  should show the large final payment in the payment schedule or interest  rate and payment summary table under Sec. 1026.18(g) or (s), as  applicable, and should not, for example, reflect the other options  available to the consumer at maturity.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">17(c) Basis of disclosures and use of estimates.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 17(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Legal obligation. The disclosures shall reflect the terms to  which the consumer and creditor are legally bound as of the outset of  the transaction. In the case of disclosures required under Sec.  1026.20(c), (d), and (e), the disclosures shall reflect the credit terms  to which the consumer and creditor are legally bound when the  disclosures are provided. The legal obligation is determined by  applicable State law or other law. Disclosures based on the assumption  that the consumer will abide by the terms of the legal obligation  throughout the term of the transaction comply with Sec. 1026.17(c)(1).  (Certain transactions are specifically addressed in this commentary.  See, for example, the discussion of buydown transactions elsewhere in  the commentary to Sec. 1026.17(c).) The fact that a term or contract  may later be deemed unenforceable by a court on the basis of equity or  other grounds does not, by itself, mean that disclosures based on that  term or contract did not reflect the legal obligation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Modification of obligation. The legal obligation normally is  presumed to be contained in the note or contract that evidences the  agreement between the consumer and the creditor. But this presumption is  rebutted if another agreement between the consumer and creditor legally  modifies that note or contract. If the consumer and creditor informally  agree to a modification of the legal obligation, the modification should  not be reflected in the disclosures unless it rises to the level of a  change in the terms of the legal obligation. For example:</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">3. Third-party buydowns. In certain transactions, a seller or other  third party may pay an amount, either to the creditor or to the  consumer, in order to reduce the consumer's payments for all or a  portion of the credit term. For example, a consumer and a bank agree to  a mortgage with an interest rate of 15% and level payments over 25  years. By a separate agreement, the seller of the property agrees to  subsidize the consumer's payments for the first two years of the  mortgage, giving the consumer an effective rate of 12% for that period.</p><p class="depth0">i. If the third-party buydown is reflected in the credit contract  between the consumer and the bank, the finance charge and all other  disclosures affected by it must take the buydown into account as an  amendment to the contract's interest rate provision. For example, the  annual percentage rate must be a composite rate that takes account of  both the lower initial rate and the higher subsequent rate, and the  disclosures required under Sec. Sec. 1026.18(g), 1026.18(s),  1026.37(c), and 1026.38(c), as applicable, must reflect the two payment  levels, except as otherwise provided in those paragraphs. However, the  amount paid by the seller would not be specifically reflected in the  disclosure of the finance charge and other disclosures affected by it  given by the bank, since that amount constitutes seller's points and  thus is not part of the finance charge. The seller-paid amount is  disclosed, however, as a credit from the seller in the summaries of  transactions disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.38(j) and (k).</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the third-party buydown is not reflected in the credit  contract between the consumer and the bank and the consumer is legally  bound to the 15% rate from the outset, the disclosure of the finance  charge and other disclosures affected by it given by the bank must not  reflect the seller buydown in any way. For example, the annual  percentage rate and disclosures required under Sec. Sec. 1026.18(g),  1026.18(s), 1026.37(c), and 1026.38(c), as applicable, would not take  into account the reduction in the interest rate   and payment level for the first two years resulting from the buydown.  The seller-paid amount is, however, disclosed as a credit from the  seller in the summaries of transactions disclosed pursuant to Sec.  1026.38(j) and (k).</p><p class="depth0">4. Consumer buydowns. In certain transactions, the consumer may pay  an amount to the creditor to reduce the payments on the transaction.  Consumer buydowns must be reflected as an amendment to the contract's  interest rate provision in the disclosure of the finance charge and  other disclosures affected by it given for that transaction. To  illustrate, in a mortgage transaction, the creditor and consumer agree  to a note specifying a 14 percent interest rate. However, in a separate  document, the consumer agrees to pay an amount to the creditor at  consummation in return for lower payments for a portion of the mortgage  term. The amount paid by the consumer may be deposited in an escrow  account or may be retained by the creditor. Depending upon the buydown  plan, the consumer's prepayment of the obligation may or may not result  in a portion of the amount being credited or refunded to the consumer.  In the disclosure of the finance charge and other disclosures affected  by it given for the mortgage, the creditor must reflect the terms of the  buydown agreement.</p><p class="depth0">i. For example:</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">C. The disclosures under Sec. Sec. 1026.18(g) and (s), 1026.37(c),  and 1026.38(c), as applicable, must reflect the multiple rate and  payment levels resulting from the buydown, except as otherwise provided  in those sections. Further, for example, the disclosures must reflect  that the transaction is a step rate product under Sec. Sec.  1026.37(a)(10)(B) and 1026.38(a)(5)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">ii. The rules regarding consumer buydowns do not apply to  transactions known as ``lender buydowns.'' In lender buydowns, a  creditor pays an amount (either into an account or to the party to whom  the obligation is sold) to reduce the consumer's payments or interest  rate for all or a portion of the credit term. Typically, these  transactions are structured as a buydown of the interest rate during an  initial period of the transaction with a higher than usual rate for the  remainder of the term. The disclosure of the finance charge and other  disclosures affected by it for lender buydowns should be based on the  terms of the legal obligation between the consumer and the creditor. See  comment 17(c)(1)-3 for the analogous rules concerning third-party  buydowns.</p><p class="depth0">5. Split buydowns. In certain transactions, a third party (such as a  seller) and a consumer both pay an amount to the creditor to reduce the  interest rate. The creditor must include the portion paid by the  consumer in the finance charge and disclose the corresponding multiple  payment levels, except as otherwise provided in Sec. Sec. 1026.18(s),  1026.37(c), and 1026.38(c), and composite annual percentage rate. The  portion paid by the third party and the corresponding reduction in  interest rate, however, should not be reflected in the disclosure of the  finance charge and other disclosures affected by it unless the lower  rate is reflected in the credit contract. See the discussion on third- party and consumer buydown transactions elsewhere in the commentary to  Sec. 1026.17(c).</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">8. Basis of disclosures in variable-rate transactions. Except as  otherwise provided in Sec. Sec. 1026.18(s), 1026.37 and 1026.38, as  applicable, the disclosures for a variable-rate transaction must be  given for the full term of the transaction and must be based on the  terms in effect at the time of consummation. Creditors should base the  disclosures only on the initial rate and should not assume that this  rate will increase, except as otherwise provided in Sec. Sec.  1026.18(s), 1026.37 and 1026.38. For example, in a loan with an initial  rate of 10 percent and a 5 percentage points rate cap, creditors should  base the disclosures on the initial rate and should not assume that this  rate will increase 5 percentage points. However, in a variable-rate  transaction with a seller buydown that is reflected in the credit  contract, a consumer buydown, or a discounted or premium rate,  disclosures should not be based solely on the initial terms. In those  transactions, the disclosed annual percentage rate should be a composite  rate based on the rate in effect during the initial period and the rate  that is the basis of the variable-rate feature for the remainder of the  term. See the commentary to Sec. 1026.17(c) for a discussion of  buydown, discounted, and premium transactions and the commentary to  Sec. 1026.19(a)(2), (e), and (f) for a discussion of the redisclosure  in certain mortgage transactions with a variable-rate feature. See  Sec. Sec. 1026.37(c) and 1026.38(c) for rules regarding disclosure of  variable-rate transactions in the projected payments table for  transactions subject to Sec. 1026.19(e) and (f).</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">10. Discounted and premium variable-rate transactions. * * *</p><p class="depth0">i. When creditors use an initial interest rate that is not  calculated using the index or formula for later rate adjustments, the  disclosures should reflect a composite annual percentage rate based on  the initial rate for as long as it is charged and, for the remainder of  the term, the rate that would have been applied using the index or  formula at the time of consummation. The rate at consummation need not  be used if a contract   provides for a delay in the implementation of changes in an index value.  For example, if the contract specifies that rate changes are based on  the index value in effect 45 days before the change date, creditors may  use any index value in effect during the 45 day period before  consummation in calculating a composite annual percentage rate.</p><p class="depth0">ii.

The disclosures should reflect a composite annual  percentage rate of 11.63 percent based on 9 percent for one year and 12  percent for 29 years.

The disclosures required by Sec. 1026.18(g) and (s) reflect the  amount of any scheduled initial payments followed by an adjusted level  of payments based on the initial interest rate. Since some mortgage  plans contain limits on the amount of the payment adjustment, the  disclosures required by Sec. 1026.18(g) and (s) may require several  different levels of payments, even with the assumption that the original  interest rate does not increase. For transactions subject to Sec.  1026.19(e) and (f), see Sec. 1026.37(c) and its commentary for a  discussion of different rules for graduated payment adjustable rate  mortgages.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">19. Rebates and loan premiums. In a loan transaction, the creditor  may offer a premium in the form of cash or merchandise to   prospective borrowers. Similarly, in a credit sale transaction, a  seller's or manufacturer's rebate may be offered to prospective  purchasers of the creditor's goods or services. Such premiums and  rebates must be reflected in accordance with the terms of the legal  obligation between the consumer and the creditor. Thus, if the creditor  is legally obligated to provide the premium or rebate to the consumer as  part of the credit transaction, the disclosures should reflect its value  in the manner and at the time the creditor is obligated to provide it.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 17(c)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Basis for estimates. Except as otherwise provided in Sec. Sec.  1026.19, 1026.37, and 1026.38, disclosures may be estimated when the  exact information is unknown at the time disclosures are made.  Information is unknown if it is not reasonably available to the creditor  at the time the disclosures are made. The ``reasonably available''  standard requires that the creditor, acting in good faith, exercise due  diligence in obtaining information. For example, the creditor must at a  minimum utilize generally accepted calculation tools, but need not  invest in the most sophisticated computer program to make a particular  type of calculation. The creditor normally may rely on the  representations of other parties in obtaining information. For example,  the creditor might look to the consumer for the time of consummation, to  insurance companies for the cost of insurance, or to realtors for taxes  and escrow fees. The creditor may utilize estimates in making  disclosures even though the creditor knows that more precise information  will be available by the point of consummation. However, new disclosures  may be required under Sec. 1026.17(f) or Sec. 1026.19. For purposes of  Sec. 1026.17(c)(2)(i), creditors must provide the actual amounts of the  information required to be disclosed under Sec. Sec. 1026.37 and  1026.38, pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e) and (f), subject to the estimation  and redisclosure rules in those provisions.</p><p class="depth0">2. Labeling estimates. Estimates must be designated as such in the  segregated disclosures. For the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(e)  and (f), use of the Loan Estimate form H-24 of appendix H to this part  pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(o) or the Closing Disclosure form H-25 of  appendix H to this part pursuant to Sec. 1026.38(t), respectively,  satisfies the requirement that the disclosure state clearly that the  disclosure is an estimate. For all other disclosures, even though they  are based on the same assumption on which a specific estimated  disclosure was based, the creditor has flexibility in labeling the  estimates. Generally, only the particular disclosure for which the exact  information is unknown is labeled as an estimate. However, when several  disclosures are affected because of the unknown information, the  creditor has the option of labeling either every affected disclosure or  only the disclosure primarily affected. For example, when the finance  charge is unknown because the date of consummation is unknown, the  creditor must label the finance charge as an estimate and may also label  as estimates the total of payments and the payment schedule. When many  disclosures are estimates, the creditor may use a general statement,  such as ``all numerical disclosures except the late payment disclosure  are estimates,'' as a method to label those disclosures as estimates.</p><p class="depth0">3. Simple-interest transactions. If consumers do not make timely  payments in a simple-interest transaction, some of the amounts  calculated for Truth in Lending disclosures will differ from amounts  that consumers will actually pay over the term of the transaction.  Creditors may label disclosures as estimates in these transactions,  except as otherwise provided by Sec. 1026.19. For example, because the  finance charge and total of payments may be larger than disclosed if  consumers make late payments, creditors may label the finance charge and  total of payments as estimates. On the other hand, creditors may choose  not to label disclosures as estimates. In all cases, creditors comply  with Sec. 1026.17(c)(2)(i) by basing disclosures on the assumption that  payments will be made on time and in the amounts required by the terms  of the legal obligation, disregarding any possible differences resulting  from consumers' payment patterns.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 17(c)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Per-diem interest. Section 1026.17(c)(2)(ii) applies to any  numerical amount (such as the finance charge, annual percentage rate, or  payment amount) that is affected by the amount of the per-diem interest  charge that will be collected at consummation. If the amount of per-diem  interest used in preparing the disclosures for consummation is based on  the information known to the creditor at the time the disclosure  document is prepared, the disclosures are considered accurate under this  rule, and affected disclosures are also considered accurate, even if the  disclosures are not labeled as estimates. For example, if the amount of  per-diem interest used to prepare disclosures is less than the amount of  per-diem interest charged at consummation, and as a result the finance  charge is understated by $200, the disclosed finance charge is  considered accurate even though the understatement is not within the  $100 tolerance of Sec. 1026.18(d)(1), and the finance charge was not  labeled as an estimate. In this example, if in addition to the  understatement related to the per-diem interest, a $90 fee is  incorrectly omitted from the finance charge, causing it to be  understated by a total of $290, the finance charge is considered  accurate because the $90 fee is within the tolerance in Sec.  1026.18(d)(1). For purposes of transactions subject to Sec. 1026.19(e)  and (f), the creditor shall disclose the actual amount of per diem  interest that will be collected at   consummation, subject only to the disclosure rules in those sections.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 17(c)(4).</p><p class="depth0">1. Payment schedule irregularities. When one or more payments in a  transaction differ from the others because of a long or short first  period, the variations may be ignored in disclosing the payment schedule  pursuant to Sec. 1026.18(g), the disclosures required pursuant to  Sec. Sec. 1026.18(s), 1026.37(c), or 1026.38(c), or the finance charge,  annual percentage rate, and other terms. For example:</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 17(c)(5).</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">2. Future event as maturity date. An obligation whose maturity date  is determined solely by a future event, as for example, a loan payable  only on the sale of property, is not a demand obligation. Because no  demand feature is contained in the obligation, demand disclosures under  Sec. 1026.18(i) are inapplicable and demand disclosures under Sec.  1026.38(l)(2) are answered in the negative. The disclosures should be  based on the creditor's estimate of the time at which the specified  event will occur and, except as otherwise provided in Sec. 1026.19(e)  and (f), may indicate the basis for the creditor's estimate, as noted in  the commentary to Sec. 1026.17(a).</p><p class="depth0">3. Demand after stated period. Most demand transactions contain a  demand feature that may be exercised at any point during the term, but  certain transactions convert to demand status only after a fixed period.  The disclosures for a transaction that converts to demand status after a  fixed period should be based upon the legally agreed-upon maturity date.  Thus, for example, if a mortgage containing a call option that the  creditor may exercise during the first 30 days of the eighth year after  loan origination is written as a 20-year obligation, the disclosures  should be based on the 20-year term, with the demand feature disclosed  under Sec. 1026.18(i) or Sec. 1026.38(l)(2), as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">4. Balloon mortgages. Balloon payment mortgages, with payments based  on a long-term amortization schedule and a large final payment due after  a shorter term, are not demand obligations unless a demand feature is  specifically contained in the contract. For example, a mortgage with a  term of five years and a payment schedule based on 20 years would not be  treated as a mortgage with a demand feature, in the absence of any  contractual demand provisions. In this type of mortgage, disclosures  should be based on the five-year term. See Sec. Sec. 1026.37(c) and  1026.38(c) and their commentary for projected payment disclosures for  balloon payment mortgages.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">17(d) Multiple creditors; multiple consumers.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">2. Multiple consumers. When two consumers are joint obligors with  primary liability on an obligation, the disclosures may be given to  either one of them. If one consumer is merely a surety or guarantor, the  disclosures must be given to the principal debtor. In rescindable  transactions, however, separate disclosures must be given to each  consumer who has the right to rescind under Sec. 1026.23, although the  disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(b) need only be provided to the  consumer who expresses an interest in a variable-rate loan program. When  two consumers are joint obligors with primary liability on an  obligation, the early disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(a), (e), or  (g), as applicable, may be provided to any one of them. In rescindable  transactions, the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(f) must be given  separately to each consumer who has the right to rescind under Sec.  1026.23. In transactions that are not rescindable, the disclosures  required by Sec. 1026.19(f) may be provided to any consumer with  primary liability on the obligation. See Sec. Sec. 1026.2(a)(11),  1026.17(b), 1026.19(a), 1026.19(f), and 1026.23(b).</p><p class="depth0">17(e) Effect of subsequent events.</p><p class="depth0">1. Events causing inaccuracies. Subject to Sec. 1026.19(e) and (f),  inaccuracies in disclosures are not violations if attributable to events  occurring after the disclosures are made. For example, when the consumer  fails to fulfill a prior commitment to keep the collateral insured and  the creditor then provides the coverage and charges the consumer for it,  such a change does not make the original disclosures inaccurate. The  creditor may, however, be required to make new disclosures under Sec.  1026.17(f) or Sec. 1026.19 if the events occurred between disclosure  and consummation, in some cases after consummation under Sec.  1026.19(f), or under Sec. 1026.20 if the events occurred after  consummation. For rules regarding permissible changes to the information  required to be disclosed by Sec. 1026.19(e) and (f), see Sec.  1026.19(e)(3) and (f)(2) and their commentary.</p><p class="depth0">17(f) Early disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">1. Change in rate or other terms. Redisclosure is required for  changes that occur between the time disclosures are made and  consummation if the annual percentage rate in the consummated  transaction exceeds the limits prescribed in Sec. 1026.17(f) even if  the prior disclosures would be considered accurate under the tolerances  in Sec. 1026.18(d) or 1026.22(a). To illustrate:</p><p class="depth0">i. Transactions not secured by real property. A. For transactions  not secured by real property, if disclosures are made in a regular  transaction on July 1, the transaction is consummated on July 15, and  the actual annual percentage rate varies by more than 1/8 of 1  percentage point from the disclosed annual percentage rate, the creditor  must either redisclose the changed terms or furnish a complete set of  new disclosures before consummation. Redisclosure is required even if  the disclosures made on July 1 are based on estimates and marked as  such.</p><p class="depth0">B. In a regular transaction not secured by real property, if early  disclosures are marked as estimates and the disclosed annual percentage  rate is within 1/8 of 1 percentage point of the rate at consummation,  the creditor need not redisclose the changed terms (including the annual  percentage rate).</p><p class="depth0">C. If disclosures for transactions not secured by real property are  made on July 1, the transaction is consummated on July 15, and the  finance charge increased by $35 but the disclosed annual percentage rate  is within the permitted tolerance, the creditor must at least redisclose  the changed terms that were not marked as estimates. See Sec.  1026.18(d)(2).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Reverse mortgages. In a transaction subject to Sec. 1026.19(a)  and not Sec. 1026.19(e) and (f), assume that, at the time the  disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(a) are prepared in July, the loan  closing is scheduled for July 31 and the creditor does not plan to  collect per-diem interest at consummation. Assume further that  consummation actually occurs on August 5, and per-diem interest for the  remainder of August is collected as a prepaid finance charge. The  creditor may rely on the disclosures prepared in July that were accurate  when they were prepared. However, if the creditor prepares new  disclosures in August that will be provided at consummation, the new  disclosures must take into account the amount of the per-diem interest  known to the creditor at that time.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Mortgages other than reverse mortgages and mortgage loans not  secured by real property. For transactions secured by real property  other than reverse mortgages, assume that, at the time the disclosures  required by Sec. 1026.19(e) are prepared in July, the loan closing is  scheduled for July 31 and the creditor does not plan to collect per-diem  interest at consummation. Assume further that consummation actually  occurs on August 5, and per-diem interest for the remainder of August is  collected as a prepaid finance charge. The creditor must make the  disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(f) three days before consummation,  and the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(f) must take into account  the amount of per-diem interest that will be collected at consummation.</p><p class="depth0">2. Variable rate. The addition of a variable rate feature to the  credit terms, after early disclosures are given, requires new  disclosures. See Sec. 1026.19(e) and (f) to determine when new  disclosures are required for transactions secured by real property,  other than reverse mortgages.</p><p class="depth0">3. Content of new disclosures. Except as provided by Sec.  1026.19(e) and (f), if redisclosure is required, the creditor has the  option of either providing a complete set of new disclosures, or  providing disclosures of only the terms that vary from those originally  disclosed. See the commentary to Sec. 1026.19(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0">4. Special rules. In mortgage transactions subject to Sec.  1026.19(a), the creditor must redisclose if, between the delivery of the  required early disclosures and consummation, the annual percentage rate  changes by more than a stated tolerance. When subsequent events occur  after consummation, new disclosures are required only if there is a  refinancing or an assumption within the meaning of Sec. 1026.20.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">17(g) Mail or telephone orders--delay in disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">1.

Mortgage transactions. Section 1026.18(g) applies to closed-end  transactions, other than transactions that are subject to Sec.  1026.18(s) or Sec. 1026.19(e) and (f). Section 1026.18(s) applies to  closed-end transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, unless  they are subject to Sec. 1026.19(e) and (f). Section 1026.19(e) and (f)  applies to closed-end transactions secured by real property, other than  reverse mortgages. Thus, if a closed-end consumer credit transaction is  secured by real property or a dwelling and the transaction is a reverse  mortgage or the dwelling is personal property, the creditor   discloses an interest rate and payment summary table in accordance with  Sec. 1026.18(s). See comment 18(s)-4. If a closed-end consumer credit  transaction is secured by real property and is not a reverse mortgage,  the creditor discloses a projected payments table in accordance with  Sec. Sec. 1026.37(c) and 1026.38(c), as required by Sec. 1026.19(e)  and (f). In all such cases, the creditor is not subject to the  requirements of Sec. 1026.18(g). On the other hand, if a closed-end  consumer credit transaction is not secured by real property or a  dwelling (for example, if it is unsecured or secured by an automobile),  the creditor discloses a payment schedule in accordance with Sec.  1026.18(g) and is not subject to the requirements of Sec. 1026.18(s) or  Sec.

The creditor may disclose an abbreviated  payment schedule when the amount of each regularly scheduled payment  (other than the first or last payment) includes an equal amount to be  applied on principal and a finance charge computed by application of a  rate to the decreasing unpaid balance. In addition, in transactions  where payments vary because interest and principal are paid at different  intervals, the two series of payments may be disclosed separately and  the abbreviated payment schedule may be used for the interest payments.  For example, in transactions with fixed quarterly principal payments and  monthly interest payments based on the outstanding principal balance,  the amount of the interest payments will change quarterly as principal  declines. In such cases the creditor may treat the interest and  principal payments as two separate series of payments, separately  disclosing the number, amount, and due dates of principal payments, and,  using the abbreviated payment schedule, the number, amount, and due  dates of interest payments. This option may be used when interest and  principal are scheduled to be paid on the same date of the month as well  as on different dates of the month. The creditor using this alternative  must disclose the dollar amount of the highest and lowest payments and  make reference to the variation in payments.</p><p class="depth0">2.

Creditors may combine the  option in Sec. 1026.18(g)(2) with the general payment schedule  requirements in transactions where only a portion of the payment  schedule meets the conditions of Sec. 1026.18(g)(2). For example, in a  transaction where payments rise sharply for five years and then decline  over the next 25 years, the first five years would be disclosed under  the general rule in Sec. 1026.18(g) and the next 25 years according to  the abbreviated schedule in Sec. 1026.18(g)(2).</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">18(k) Prepayment.</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure required. The creditor must give a definitive  statement of whether or not a prepayment penalty will be imposed or a  prepayment rebate will be given.</p><p class="depth0">i. The fact that no prepayment penalty will be imposed may not  simply be inferred from the absence of a prepayment penalty disclosure;  the creditor must indicate that prepayment will not result in a  prepayment penalty.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If a prepayment penalty or prepayment rebate is possible for one  type of prepayment, even though not for all, a positive disclosure is  required. This applies to any type of prepayment, whether voluntary or  involuntary as in the case of prepayments resulting from acceleration.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Any difference in prepayment rebate or prepayment penalty  policy, depending on whether prepayment is voluntary or not, must not be  disclosed with the segregated disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">2. Rebate-penalty disclosure. A single transaction may involve both  a precomputed finance charge and a finance charge computed by  application of a rate to the unpaid balance (for example, mortgages with  mortgage-guarantee insurance). In these cases, disclosures about both  prepayment rebates and prepayment penalties are required. Sample form H- 15 in appendix H to this part illustrates a mortgage transaction in  which both rebate and penalty disclosures are necessary.</p><p class="depth0">3. Prepaid finance charge. The existence of a prepaid finance charge  in a transaction does not, by itself, require a disclosure under Sec.  1026.18(k). A prepaid finance charge is not considered a prepayment  penalty under Sec. 1026.18(k)(1), nor does it require a disclosure  under Sec. 1026.18(k)(2). At its option, however, a creditor may  consider a prepaid finance charge to be under Sec. 1026.18(k)(2). If a  disclosure is made under Sec. 1026.18(k)(2) with respect to a prepaid  finance charge or other finance charge, the creditor may further  identify that finance charge. For example, the disclosure may state that  the borrower ``will not be entitled to a refund of the prepaid finance  charge'' or some other term that describes the finance charge.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(k)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Examples of prepayment penalties. For purposes of Sec.  1026.18(k)(1), the following are examples of prepayment penalties:</p><p class="depth0">i. A charge determined by treating the loan balance as outstanding  for a period of time after prepayment in full and applying the interest  rate to such ``balance,'' even if the charge results from interest  accrual amortization used for other payments in the   transaction under the terms of the loan contract. ``Interest accrual  amortization'' refers to the method by which the amount of interest due  for each period (e.g., month) in a transaction's term is determined. For  example, ``monthly interest accrual amortization'' treats each payment  as made on the scheduled, monthly due date even if it is actually paid  early or late (until the expiration of any grace period). Thus, under  the terms of a loan contract providing for monthly interest accrual  amortization, if the amount of interest due on May 1 for the preceding  month of April is $3,000, the loan contract will require payment of  $3,000 in interest for the month of April whether the payment is made on  April 20, on May 1, or on May 10. In this example, if the consumer  prepays the loan in full on April 20 and if the accrued interest as of  that date is $2,000, then assessment of a charge of $3,000 constitutes a  prepayment penalty of $1,000 because the amount of interest actually  earned through April 20 is only $2,000.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A fee, such as an origination or other loan closing cost, that  is waived by the creditor on the condition that the consumer does not  prepay the loan. However, the term prepayment penalty does not include a  waived bona fide third-party charge imposed by the creditor if the  consumer pays all of a covered transaction's principal before the date  on which the principal is due sooner than 36 months after consummation.  For example, assume that at consummation, the creditor waives $3,000 in  closing costs to cover bona fide third-party charges but the terms of  the loan agreement provide that the creditor may recoup the $3,000 in  waived charges if the consumer repays the entire loan balance sooner  than 36 months after consummation. The $3,000 charge is not a prepayment  penalty. In contrast, for example, assume that at consummation, the  creditor waives $3,000 in closing costs to cover bona fide third-party  charges but the terms of the loan agreement provide that the creditor  may recoup $4,500 in part to recoup waived charges, if the consumer  repays the entire loan balance sooner than 36 months after consummation.  The $3,000 that the creditor may impose to cover the waived bona fide  third-party charges is not a prepayment penalty, but the additional  $1,500 charge is a prepayment penalty and must be disclosed pursuant to  Sec. 1026.37(k)(1).</p><p class="depth0">iii.

This includes  computing a refund of an unearned finance charge, such as precomputed  interest, by a method that is less favorable to the consumer than the  actuarial method, as defined by section 933(d) of the Housing and  Community Development Act of 1992, 15 U.S.C. 1615(d). For purposes of  computing a refund of unearned interest, if using the actuarial method  defined by applicable State law results in a refund that is greater than  the refund calculated by using the method described in section 933(d) of  the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, creditors should use  the State law definition in determining if a refund is a prepayment  penalty.</p><p class="depth0">B.

Section 1026.18(s) prescribes format and content for  disclosure of interest rates and monthly (or other periodic) payments  for reverse mortgages and certain   transactions secured by dwellings that are personal property. The  information in Sec. 1026.18(s)(2) through (4) is required to be in the  form of a table, except as otherwise provided, with headings and format  substantially similar to model clause H-4(E), H-4(F), H-4(G), or H-4(H)  in appendix H to this part. A disclosure that does not include the  shading shown in a model clause but otherwise follows the model clause's  headings and format is substantially similar to that model clause. Where  Sec. 1026.18(s)(2) through (4) or the applicable model clause requires  that a column or row of the table be labeled using the word ``monthly''  but the periodic payments are not due monthly, the creditor should use  the appropriate term, such as ``bi-weekly'' or ``quarterly.'' In all  cases, the table should have no more than five vertical columns  corresponding to applicable interest rates at various times during the  loan's term; corresponding payments would be shown in horizontal rows.  Certain loan types and terms are defined for purposes of Sec.  1026.18(s) in Sec. 1026.18(s)(7).</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">4. Scope of coverage in relation to Sec. 1026.19(e) and (f).  Section 1026.18(s) applies to transactions secured by real property or a  dwelling, other than transactions that are subject to Sec. 1026.19(e)  and (f). Those provisions apply to closed-end transactions secured by  real property, other than reverse mortgages. Accordingly, Sec.  1026.18(s) governs only closed-end reverse mortgages and closed-end  transactions secured by a dwelling that is personal property (such as a  mobile home that is not deemed real property under State or other  applicable law).</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">18(s)(3) Payments for amortizing loans.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 18(s)(3)(i)(C).</p><p class="depth0">1. Taxes and insurance. An estimated payment amount for taxes and  insurance must be disclosed if the creditor will establish an escrow  account for such amounts. If the escrow account will include amounts for  items other than taxes and insurance, such as homeowners association  dues, the creditor may but is not required to include such items in the  estimate. When such estimated escrow payments must be disclosed in  multiple columns of the table, such as for adjustable- and step-rate  transactions, each column should use the same estimate for taxes and  insurance except that the estimate should reflect changes in periodic  mortgage insurance premiums or any functionally equivalent fee that are  known to the creditor at the time the disclosure is made. The estimated  amounts of mortgage insurance premiums or any functionally equivalent  fee should be based on the declining principal balance that will occur  as a result of changes to the interest rate that are assumed for  purposes of disclosing those rates under Sec. 1026.18(s)(2) and  accompanying commentary. The payment amount must include estimated  amounts for property taxes and premiums for mortgage-related insurance  required by the creditor, such as insurance against loss of or damage to  property, or against liability arising out of the ownership or use of  the property, or insurance protecting the creditor against the  consumer's default or other credit loss. Premiums for credit insurance,  debt suspension and debt cancellation agreements, however, should not be  included. Except for periodic mortgage insurance premiums or any  functionally equivalent fee included in the escrow payment under Sec.  1026.18(s)(3)(i)(C), amounts included in the escrow payment disclosure  such as property taxes and homeowner's insurance generally are not  finance charges under Sec. 1026.4 and, therefore, do not affect other  disclosures, including the finance charge and annual percentage rate.</p><p class="depth0">2. Mortgage insurance or any functional equivalent. For purposes of  Sec. 1026.18(s), ``mortgage insurance or any functional equivalent''  means the amounts identified in Sec. 1026.4(b)(5). ``Mortgage  guarantees'' (such as a United States Department of Veterans Affairs or  United States Department of Agriculture guarantee) provide coverage  similar to mortgage insurance, even if not technically considered  insurance under State or other applicable law. For purposes of Sec.  1026.18(s), ``mortgage insurance or any functional equivalent'' includes  any mortgage guarantee. Payment amounts under Sec. 1026.18(s)(3)(i)  should reflect the consumer's mortgage insurance payments or any  functionally equivalent fee until the date on which the creditor must  automatically terminate coverage under applicable law, even though the  consumer may have a right to request that the insurance be cancelled  earlier. The payment amount must reflect the terms of the legal  obligation, as determined by applicable State or other law. For example,  assume that under applicable law, mortgage insurance must terminate  after the 130th scheduled monthly payment, and the creditor collects at  closing and places in escrow two months of premiums. If, under the legal  obligation, the creditor will include mortgage insurance premiums in 130  payments and refund the escrowed payments when the insurance is  terminated, payment amounts disclosed through the 130th payment should  reflect premium payments. If, under the legal obligation, the creditor  will apply the amount escrowed to the two final insurance payments,  payments disclosed through the   128th payment should reflect premium payments. The escrow amount  reflected on the disclosure should include mortgage insurance premiums  even if they are not escrowed and even if there is no escrow account  established for the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">18(s)(6) Special disclosures for loans with negative amortization.</p><p class="depth0">1. Escrows. See the commentary under Sec. 1026.18(s)(3)(i)(C) for  guidance on escrows for purposes of Sec. 1026.18(s)(6). Under that  guidance, because mortgage insurance payments and functionally  equivalent fees decline over a loan's term, the payment amounts shown in  the table should reflect the mortgage insurance payment and functionally  equivalent fees that will be applicable at the time each disclosed  periodic payment will be in effect. Accordingly, the disclosed mortgage  insurance payment or functionally equivalent fee will be zero if it  corresponds to a periodic payment that will occur after the creditor  will be legally required to terminate mortgage insurance or any  functional equivalent. On the other hand, because only one escrow amount  is disclosed under Sec. 1026.18(s)(6) for negative amortization loans  and escrows that are not itemized in the payment amounts, the single  escrow amount disclosed should reflect the mortgage insurance amount or  any functionally equivalent fee that will be collected at the outset of  the loan's term, even though that amount will decline in the future and  ultimately will be discontinued pursuant to the terms of the mortgage  insurance policy.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.19--Certain Mortgage and Variable-Rate Transactions</p><p class="depth0">19(a)(1)(i) Time of disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">1.

To be covered by Sec. 1026.19(a), a transaction must be a Federally  related mortgage loan under RESPA. ``Federally related mortgage loan''  is defined under RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2602) and Regulation X (12 CFR  1024.2(b)), and is subject to any interpretations by the Bureau.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">19(e) Mortgage loans secured by real property--Early disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">1.

Requirements. Section 1026.19(e)(1)(i) requires early disclosure  of credit terms in closed-end credit transactions that are secured by  real property, other than reverse mortgages. These disclosures must be  provided in good faith. Except as otherwise provided in Sec.  1026.19(e), a disclosure is in good faith if it is consistent with Sec.  1026.17(c)(2)(i). Section 1026.17(c)(2)(i) provides that if any  information necessary for an accurate disclosure is unknown to the  creditor, the creditor shall make the disclosure based on the best  information reasonably available to the creditor at the time the  disclosure is provided to the consumer. The ``reasonably available''  standard requires that the creditor, acting in good faith, exercise due  diligence in obtaining information. See comment 17(c)(2)(i)-1 for an  explanation of the standard set forth in Sec. 1026.17(c)(2)(i). See  comment 17(c)(2)(i)-2 for labeling disclosures required under Sec.  1026.19(e) that are estimates.</p><p class="depth0">19(e)(1)(ii) Mortgage broker.</p><p class="depth0">1. Mortgage broker responsibilities. Section 1026.19(e)(1)(ii)(A)  provides that if a mortgage broker receives a consumer's application,  either the creditor or the mortgage broker must provide the consumer  with the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) in accordance  with Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(iii). Section 1026.19(e)(1)(ii)(A) also  provides that if the mortgage broker provides the required disclosures,  it must comply with all relevant requirements of Sec. 1026.19(e). This  means that ``mortgage broker'' should be read in the place of  ``creditor'' for all provisions of Sec. 1026.19(e), except to the  extent that such a reading would create responsibility for mortgage  brokers under Sec. 1026.19(f). To illustrate, comment 19(e)(4)(ii)-1  states that creditors comply with the requirements of Sec.  1026.19(e)(4) if the revised disclosures are reflected in the  disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i). ``Mortgage broker''  could not be read in place of ``creditor'' in comment 19(e)(4)(ii)-1  because mortgage brokers are not responsible for the disclosures  required under Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i). In addition, Sec.  1026.19(e)(1)(ii)(A) provides that the creditor must ensure that  disclosures provided by mortgage brokers comply with all requirements of  Sec. 1026.19(e), and that disclosures provided by mortgage brokers that  do comply with all such requirements satisfy the creditor's obligation  under Sec. 1026.19(e). The term ``mortgage broker,'' as used in Sec.  1026.19(e)(1)(ii), has the same meaning as in Sec. 1026.36(a)(2). See  also comment 36(a)-2. Section 1026.19(e)(1)(ii)(B) provides that if a  mortgage broker provides any disclosure required under Sec. 1026.19(e),  the mortgage broker must also comply with the requirements of Sec.  1026.25(c). For example, if a mortgage broker provides the disclosures  required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i), it must maintain   records for three years, in compliance with Sec. 1026.25(c)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">2. Creditor responsibilities. If a mortgage broker issues any  disclosure required under Sec. 1026.19(e) in the creditor's place, the  creditor remains responsible under Sec. 1026.19(e) for ensuring that  the requirements of Sec. 1026.19(e) have been satisfied. For example,  if a mortgage broker receives a consumer's application and provides the  consumer with the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i), the  creditor does not satisfy the requirements of Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) if  it provides duplicative disclosures to the consumer. In the same  example, even if the broker provides an erroneous disclosure, the  creditor is responsible and may not issue a revised disclosure  correcting the error. The creditor is expected to maintain communication  with the broker to ensure that the broker is acting in place of the  creditor.</p><p class="depth0">19(e)(1)(iii) Timing.</p><p class="depth0">1. Timing and use of estimates. The disclosures required by Sec.  1026.19(e)(1)(i) must be delivered not later than three business days  after the creditor receives the consumer's application. For example, if  an application is received on Monday, the creditor satisfies this  requirement by either hand delivering the disclosures on or before  Thursday, or placing them in the mail on or before Thursday, assuming  each weekday is a business day. For purposes of Sec.  1026.19(e)(1)(iii)(A), the term ``business day'' means a day on which  the creditor's offices are open to the public for carrying out  substantially all of its business functions. See Sec. 1026.2(a)(6).</p><p class="depth0">2. Waiting period. The seven-business-day waiting period begins when  the creditor delivers the disclosures or places them in the mail, not  when the consumer receives or is considered to have received the  disclosures. For example, if a creditor delivers the early disclosures  to the consumer in person or places them in the mail on Monday, June 1,  consummation may occur on or after Tuesday, June 9, the seventh business  day following delivery or mailing of the early disclosures, because, for  the purposes of Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(iii)(B), Saturday is a business day,  pursuant to Sec. 1026.2(a)(6).</p><p class="depth0">3. Denied or withdrawn applications. The creditor may determine  within the three-business-day period that the application will not or  cannot be approved on the terms requested, such as when a consumer's  credit score is lower than the minimum score required for the terms the  consumer applied for, or the consumer applies for a type or amount of  credit that the creditor does not offer. In that case, or if the  consumer withdraws the application within the three-business-day period  by, for instance, informing the creditor that he intends to take out a  loan from another creditor within the three-business-day period, the  creditor need not make the disclosures required under Sec.  1026.19(e)(1)(i). If the creditor fails to provide early disclosures and  the transaction is later consummated on the terms originally applied  for, then the creditor does not comply with Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i). If,  however, the consumer amends the application because of the creditor's  unwillingness to approve it on the terms originally applied for, no  violation occurs for not providing disclosures based on those original  terms. But the amended application is a new application subject to Sec.  1026.19(e)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">4. Timeshares. If consummation occurs within three business days  after a creditor's receipt of an application for a transaction that is  secured by a consumer's interest in a timeshare plan described in 11  U.S.C. 101(53D), a creditor complies with Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(iii) by  providing the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) instead  of the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">19(e)(1)(iv) Receipt of early disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">1. Mail delivery. Section 1026.19(e)(1)(iv) provides that, if any  disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) are not provided to  the consumer in person, the consumer is considered to have received the  disclosures three business days after they are delivered or placed in  the mail. The creditor may, alternatively, rely on evidence that the  consumer received the disclosures earlier than three business days. For  example, if the creditor sends the disclosures via overnight mail on  Monday, and the consumer signs for receipt of the overnight delivery on  Tuesday, the creditor could demonstrate that the disclosures were  received on Tuesday.</p><p class="depth0">2. Electronic delivery. The three-business-day period provided in  Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(iv) applies to methods of electronic delivery, such  as email. For example, if a creditor sends the disclosures required  under Sec. 1026.19(e) via email on Monday, pursuant to Sec.  1026.19(e)(1)(iv) the consumer is considered to have received the  disclosures on Thursday, three business days later. The creditor may,  alternatively, rely on evidence that the consumer received the emailed  disclosures earlier. For example, if the creditor emails the disclosures  at 1 p.m. on Tuesday, the consumer emails the creditor with an  acknowledgement of receipt of the disclosures at 5 p.m. on the same day,  the creditor could demonstrate that the disclosures were received on the  same day. Creditors using electronic delivery methods, such as email,  must also comply with Sec. 1026.37(o)(3)(iii), which provides that the  disclosures in Sec. 1026.37 may be provided to the consumer in  electronic form, subject to compliance with the consumer consent and  other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act. For example, if a  creditor delivers the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i)  to a consumer via email, but the creditor did not obtain the consumer's  consent to receive disclosures via email prior to delivering the  disclosures,   then the creditor does not comply with Sec. 1026.37(o)(3)(iii), and the  creditor does not comply with Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i), assuming the  disclosures were not provided in a different manner in accordance with  the timing requirements of Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">19(e)(1)(v) Consumer's waiver of waiting period before consummation.</p><p class="depth0">1. Modification or waiver. A consumer may modify or waive the right  to the seven-business-day waiting period required by Sec.  1026.19(e)(1)(iii) only after the creditor makes the disclosures  required by Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i). The consumer must have a bona fide  personal financial emergency that necessitates consummating the credit  transaction before the end of the waiting period. Whether these  conditions are met is determined by the circumstances of the individual  situation. The imminent sale of the consumer's home at foreclosure,  where the foreclosure sale will proceed unless loan proceeds are made  available to the consumer during the waiting period, is one example of a  bona fide personal financial emergency. Each consumer who is primarily  liable on the legal obligation must sign the written statement for the  waiver to be effective.</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples of waivers within the seven-business-day waiting period.  If the early disclosures are delivered to the consumer in person on  Monday, June 1, the seven-business-day waiting period ends on Tuesday,  June 9. If on Monday, June 1, the consumer executes a waiver of the  seven-business-day waiting period, the final disclosures required by  Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) could then be delivered three business days  before consummation, as required by Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(ii), on Tuesday,  June 2, and the loan could be consummated on Friday, June 5. See Sec.  1026.19(f)(1)(iv) for waiver of the three-business-day waiting period  under Sec. 1026.19(f).</p><p class="depth0">19(e)(1)(vi) Shopping for settlement service providers.</p><p class="depth0">1. Permission to shop. Section 1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(A) permits  creditors to impose reasonable requirements regarding the qualifications  of the provider. For example, the creditor may require that a settlement  agent chosen by the consumer must be appropriately licensed in the  relevant jurisdiction. In contrast, a creditor does not permit a  consumer to shop for purposes of Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(vi) if the creditor  requires the consumer to choose a provider from a list provided by  creditor. The requirements of Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(B) and (C) do not  apply if the creditor does not permit the consumer to shop consistent  with Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(A).</p><p class="depth0">2. Disclosure of services for which the consumer may shop. Section  1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(B) requires the creditor to identify the services for  which the consumer is permitted to shop in the disclosures provided  pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i). See Sec. 1026.37(f)(3) regarding  the content and format for disclosure of services for which the consumer  may shop.</p><p class="depth0">3. Written list of providers. If the creditor permits the consumer  to shop for a settlement service, Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(C) requires  the creditor to provide the consumer with a written list identifying at  least one available provider of that service and stating that the  consumer may choose a different provider for that service. The  settlement service providers identified on the written list required by  Sec. 1026.19(e)(vi)(C) must correspond to the settlement services for  which the consumer may shop, disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(f)(3).  See form H-27 of appendix H to this part for a model list.</p><p class="depth0">4. Identification of available providers. Section  1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(C) provides that the creditor must identify settlement  service providers that are available to the consumer. A creditor does  not comply with the identification requirement in Sec.  1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(C) unless it provides sufficient information to allow  the consumer to contact the provider, such as the name under which the  provider does business and the provider's address and telephone number.  Similarly, a creditor does not comply with the availability requirement  in Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(C) if it provides a written list consisting  of only settlement service providers that are no longer in business or  that do not provide services where the consumer or property is located.</p><p class="depth0">5. Statement that consumer may choose different provider. Section  1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(C) requires the creditor to include on the written  list a statement that the consumer may choose a provider that is not  included on that list. See form H-27 of appendix H to this part for a  model of such a statement.</p><p class="depth0">6. Additional information on written list. The creditor may include  a statement on the written list that the listing of a settlement service  provider does not constitute an endorsement of that service provider.  The creditor may also identify on the written list providers of services  for which the consumer is not permitted to shop, provided that the  creditor clearly and conspicuously distinguishes those services from the  services for which the consumer is permitted to shop. This may be  accomplished by placing the services under different headings. For  example, if the list provided pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(C)  identifies providers of pest inspections and surveys, but the consumer  may select a provider, other than those identified on the list, for only  the survey, then the list must specifically inform the consumer that the  consumer is permitted to select a provider, other than a provider  identified on the list, for only the survey.</p><p class="depth0">7. Relation to RESPA and Regulation X. Section 1026.19 does not  prohibit creditors from including affiliates on the written list  required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(C). However, a   creditor that includes affiliates on the written list must also comply  with 12 CFR 1024.15. Furthermore, the written list is a ``referral''  under 12 CFR 1024.14(f).</p><p class="depth0">19(e)(2) Predisclosure activity.</p><p class="depth0">19(e)(2)(i) Imposition of fees on consumer.</p><p class="depth0">19(e)(2)(i)(A) Fee restriction.</p><p class="depth0">1. Fees restricted. A creditor or other person may not impose any  fee, such as for an application, appraisal, or underwriting, until the  consumer has received the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i)  and indicated an intent to proceed with the transaction. The only  exception to the fee restriction allows the creditor or other person to  impose a bona fide and reasonable fee for obtaining a consumer's credit  report, pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e)(2)(i)(B).</p><p class="depth0">2. Intent to proceed. Section 1026.19(e)(2)(i)(A) provides that a  consumer may indicate an intent to proceed with a transaction in any  manner the consumer chooses, unless a particular manner of communication  is required by the creditor. The creditor must document this  communication to satisfy the requirements of Sec. 1026.25. For example,  oral communication in person immediately upon delivery of the  disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) is sufficiently  indicative of intent. Oral communication over the phone, written  communication via email, or signing a pre-printed form are also  sufficiently indicative of intent if such actions occur after receipt of  the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i). However, a  consumer's silence is not indicative of intent because it cannot be  documented to satisfy the requirements of Sec. 1026.25. For example, a  creditor or third party may not deliver the disclosures, wait for some  period of time for the consumer to respond, and then charge the consumer  a fee for an appraisal if the consumer does not respond, even if the  creditor or third party disclosed that it would do so.</p><p class="depth0">3. Timing of fees. At any time prior to delivery of the disclosures  required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i), a creditor or other person may  impose a credit report fee in connection with the consumer's application  for a mortgage loan that is subject to Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) as  provided in Sec. 1026.19(e)(2)(i)(B). The consumer must have received  the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) and indicated an  intent to proceed with the transaction described by those disclosures  before paying or incurring any other fee imposed by a creditor or other  person in connection with the consumer's application for a mortgage loan  that is subject to Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">4. Collection of fees. A creditor or other person complies with  Sec. 1026.19(e)(2)(i)(A) if:</p><p class="depth0">i. A creditor receives a consumer's application directly from the  consumer and does not impose any fee, other than a bona fide and  reasonable fee for obtaining a consumer's credit report, until the  consumer receives the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i)  and indicates an intent to proceed with the transaction described by  those disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A third party submits a consumer's application to a creditor and  neither the creditor nor the third party imposes any fee, other than a  bona fide and reasonable fee for obtaining a consumer's credit report,  until the consumer receives the disclosures required under Sec.  1026.19(e)(1)(i) and indicates an intent to proceed with the transaction  described by those disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">iii. A third party submits a consumer's application to a creditor  following a different creditor's denial of the consumer's application  (or following the consumer's withdrawal of that application), and if a  fee already has been assessed for obtaining the credit report, the new  creditor or third party does not impose any additional fee until the  consumer receives disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) from  the new creditor and indicates an intent to proceed with the transaction  described by those disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">5. Fees ``imposed by'' a person. For purposes of Sec. 1026.19(e), a  fee is ``imposed by'' a person if the person requires a consumer to  provide a method for payment, even if the payment is not made at that  time. For example, if a creditor or other person requires the consumer  to provide a $500 check to pay for a ``processing fee'' before the  consumer receives the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i),  the creditor or other person does not comply with Sec.  1026.19(e)(2)(i), even if the creditor or other person had stated that  the check will not be cashed until after the disclosures required by  Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) are received by the consumer and waited until  after the consumer subsequently indicated an intent to proceed to cash  the check. Similarly, a creditor or other person does not comply with  the requirements of Sec. 1026.19(e)(2)(i) if the creditor or other  person requires the consumer to provide a credit card number before the  consumer receives the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i),  even if the creditor or other person had promised not to charge the  consumer's credit card for the $500 processing fee until after the  disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) are received by the  consumer and waited until after the consumer subsequently indicated an  intent to proceed. In contrast, a creditor or other person complies with  Sec. 1026.19(e)(2)(i) if the creditor or other person requires the  consumer to provide a credit card number before the consumer receives  the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) and subsequently  indicates an intent to proceed, provided that the consumer's  authorization is only to pay for the cost of a credit report and the  creditor or other person only charges a reasonable and bona fide fee for  obtaining the consumer's credit report. This is   so even if the creditor or other person maintains the consumer's credit  card number on file and charges the consumer a $500 processing fee after  the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) are received and the  consumer subsequently indicates an intent to proceed with the  transaction described by those disclosures, provided that the creditor  or other person requested and received a separate authorization from the  consumer for the processing fee after the consumer received the  disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) and indicated an intent  to proceed with the transaction described by those disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">19(e)(2)(i)(B) Exception to fee restriction.</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirements. A creditor or other person may impose a fee before  the consumer receives the required disclosures if the fee is for  purchasing a credit report on the consumer. The fee also must be bona  fide and reasonable in amount. For example, a creditor or other person  may collect a fee for obtaining a credit report if it is in the  creditor's or other person's ordinary course of business to obtain a  credit report. If the criteria in Sec. 1026.19(e)(2)(i)(B) are met, the  creditor or other person must accurately describe or refer to this fee,  for example, as a ``credit report fee.''</p><p class="depth0">19(e)(2)(ii) Written information provided to consumer.</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirements. Section 1026.19(e)(2)(ii) requires the creditor or  other person to include a clear and conspicuous statement on the top of  the front of the first page of a written estimate of terms or costs  specific to the consumer if it is provided to the consumer before the  consumer receives the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i).  For example, if the creditor provides a document showing the estimated  monthly payment for a mortgage loan, and the estimate was based on the  estimated loan amount and the consumer's estimated credit score, then  the creditor must include the statement on the document. In contrast, if  the creditor provides the consumer with a preprinted list of closing  costs common in the consumer's area, the creditor need not include the  statement. Similarly, the statement would not be required on a  preprinted list of available rates for different loan products. This  requirement does not apply to an advertisement, as defined in Sec.  1026.2(a)(2). Section 1026.19(e)(2)(ii) requires that the notice must be  in a font size that is no smaller than 12-point font, and must state:  ``Your actual rate, payment, and costs could be higher. Get an official  Loan Estimate before choosing a loan.'' See form H-26 of appendix H to  this part for a model statement. Section 1026.19(e)(2)(ii) also  prohibits the creditor or other person from making these written  estimates with headings, content, and format substantially similar to  form H-24 or H-25 of appendix H to this part.</p><p class="depth0">19(e)(2)(iii) Verification of information.</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirements. The creditor or other person may collect from the  consumer any information that it requires prior to providing the early  disclosures before or at the same time as collecting the information  listed in Sec. 1026.2(a)(3)(ii). However, the creditor or other person  is not permitted to require, before providing the disclosures required  by Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i), that the consumer submit documentation to  verify the information collected from the consumer. See also Sec.  1026.2(a)(3) and the related commentary regarding the definition of  application. To illustrate:</p><p class="depth0">i. A creditor may ask for the sale price and address of the  property, but the creditor may not require the consumer to provide a  purchase and sale agreement to support the information the consumer  provides orally before the creditor provides the disclosures required by  Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">ii. A mortgage broker may ask for the names, account numbers, and  balances of the consumer's checking and savings accounts, but the  mortgage broker may not require the consumer to provide bank statements,  or similar documentation, to support the information the consumer  provides orally before the mortgage broker provides the disclosures  required by Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">19(e)(3) Good faith determination for estimates of closing costs.</p><p class="depth0">19(e)(3)(i) General rule.</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirement. Section 1026.19(e)(3)(i) provides the general rule  that an estimated closing cost disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e) is  not in good faith if the charge paid by or imposed on the consumer  exceeds the amount originally disclosed under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i).  Although Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(ii) and (iii) provide exceptions to the  general rule, the charges that remain subject to Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(i)  include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth0">i. Fees paid to the creditor.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Fees paid to a mortgage broker.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Fees paid to an affiliate of the creditor or a mortgage broker.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Fees paid to an unaffiliated third party if the creditor did not  permit the consumer to shop for a third party service provider for a  settlement service.</p><p class="depth0">v. Transfer taxes.</p><p class="depth0">2. Charges ``paid by or imposed on the consumer.'' For purposes of  Sec. 1026.19(e), a charge ``paid by or imposed on the consumer'' refers  to the final amount for the charge paid by or imposed on the consumer at  consummation or settlement, whichever is later. ``Consummation'' is  defined in Sec. 1026.2(a)(13). ``Settlement'' is defined in Regulation  X, 12 CFR 1024.2(b). For example, at consummation, the consumer pays the  creditor $100 for recording fees. Settlement of the transaction  concludes five days after consummation, and   the actual recording fees are $70. The creditor refunds the consumer $30  immediately after recording. The recording fee paid by the consumer is  $70.</p><p class="depth0">3. Fees ``paid to'' a person. For purposes of Sec. 1026.19(e), a  fee is not considered ``paid to'' a person if the person does not retain  the fee. For example, if a consumer pays the creditor transfer taxes and  recording fees at the real estate closing and the creditor subsequently  uses those funds to pay the county that imposed these charges, then the  transfer taxes and recording fees are not ``paid to'' the creditor for  purposes of Sec. 1026.19(e). Similarly, if a consumer pays the creditor  an appraisal fee in advance of the real estate closing and the creditor  subsequently uses those funds to pay another party for an appraisal,  then the appraisal fee is not ``paid to'' the creditor for the purposes  of Sec. 1026.19(e). A fee is also not considered ``paid to'' a person,  for purposes of Sec. 1026.19(e), if the person retains the fee as  reimbursement for an amount it has already paid to another party. If a  creditor pays for an appraisal in advance of the real estate closing and  the consumer pays the creditor an appraisal fee at the real estate  closing, then the fee is not ``paid to'' the creditor for the purposes  of Sec. 1026.19(e), even though the creditor retains the fee, because  the payment is a reimbursement for an amount already paid.</p><p class="depth0">4. Transfer taxes and recording fees. See comments 37(g)(1)-1, -2,  and -3 for a discussion of the difference between transfer taxes and  recording fees.</p><p class="depth0">5. Lender credits. The disclosure of ``lender credits,'' as  identified in Sec. 1026.37(g)(6)(ii), is required by Sec.  1026.19(e)(1)(i). ``Lender credits,'' as identified in Sec.  1026.37(g)(6)(ii), represents the sum of non-specific lender credits and  specific lender credits. Non-specific lender credits are generalized  payments from the creditor to the consumer that do not pay for a  particular fee on the disclosures provided pursuant to Sec.  1026.19(e)(1). Specific lender credits are specific payments, such as a  credit, rebate, or reimbursement, from a creditor to the consumer to pay  for a specific fee. Non-specific lender credits and specific lender  credits are negative charges to the consumer. The actual total amount of  lender credits, whether specific or non-specific, provided by the  creditor that is less than the estimated ``lender credits'' identified  in Sec. 1026.37(g)(6)(ii) and disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e) is  an increased charge to the consumer for purposes of determining good  faith under Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(i). For example, if the creditor  discloses a $750 estimate for ``lender credits'' pursuant to Sec.  1026.19(e), but only $500 of lender credits is actually provided to the  consumer, the creditor has not complied with Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(i)  because the actual amount of lender credits provided is less than the  estimated ``lender credits'' disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e), and  is therefore, an increased charge to the consumer for purposes of  determining good faith under Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(i). However, if the  creditor discloses a $750 estimate for ``lender credits'' identified in  Sec. 1026.37(g)(6)(ii) to cover the cost of a $750 appraisal fee, and  the appraisal fee subsequently increases by $150, and the creditor  increases the amount of the lender credit by $150 to pay for the  increase, the credit is not being revised in a way that violates the  requirements of Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(i) because, although the credit  increased from the amount disclosed, the amount paid by the consumer did  not. However, if the creditor discloses a $750 estimate for ``lender  credits'' to cover the cost of a $750 appraisal fee, but subsequently  reduces the credit by $50 because the appraisal fee decreased by $50,  then the requirements of Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(i) have been violated  because, although the amount of the appraisal fee decreased, the amount  of the lender credit decreased. See also Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(D) and  comment 19(e)(3)(iv)(D)-1 for a discussion of lender credits in the  context of interest rate dependent charges.</p><p class="depth0">6. Good faith analysis for lender credits. For purposes of  conducting the good faith analysis required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(i)  for lender credits, the total amount of lender credits, whether specific  or non-specific, actually provided to the consumer is compared to the  amount of the ``lender credits'' identified in Sec. 1026.37(g)(6)(ii).  The total amount of lender credits actually provided to the consumer is  determined by aggregating the amount of the ``lender credits''  identified in Sec. 1026.38(h)(3) with the amounts paid by the creditor  that are attributable to a specific loan cost or other cost, disclosed  pursuant to Sec. 1026.38(f) and (g).</p><p class="depth0">7. Use of unrounded numbers. Sections 1026.37(o)(4) and  1026.38(t)(4) require that the dollar amounts of certain charges  disclosed on the Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure, respectively, to  be rounded to the nearest whole dollar. However, to conduct the good  faith analysis required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(i) and (ii), the  creditor should use unrounded numbers to compare the actual charge paid  by or imposed on the consumer for a settlement service with the  estimated cost of the service.</p><p class="depth0">19(e)(3)(ii) Limited increases permitted for certain charges.</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirements. Section 1026.19(e)(3)(ii) provides that certain  estimated charges are in good faith if the sum of all such charges paid  by or imposed on the consumer does not exceed the sum of all such  charges disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e) by more than 10 percent.  Section 1026.19(e)(3)(ii) permits this limited increase for only the  following items:</p><p class="depth0">i. Fees paid to an unaffiliated third party if the creditor  permitted the consumer to select a settlement service provider that is  not   on the list provided pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(vi) and discloses  that the consumer may do so on that list.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Recording fees.</p><p class="depth0">2. Aggregate increase limited to ten percent. Pursuant to Sec.  1026.19(e)(3)(ii), whether an individual estimated charge subject to  Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(ii) is in good faith depends on whether the sum of  all charges subject to Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(ii) increases by more than 10  percent, even if a particular charge does not increase by more than 10  percent. For example, if, in the disclosures provided pursuant to Sec.  1026.19(e)(1)(i), the creditor includes a $300 estimated fee for a  settlement agent, the settlement agent fee is included in the category  of charges subject to Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(ii), and the sum of all  charges subject to Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(ii) (including the settlement  agent fee) equals $1,000 then the creditor does not violate Sec.  1026.19(e)(3)(ii) if the actual settlement agent fee exceeds 10 percent  (i.e., exceeds $330), provided that the sum of all such charges does not  exceed 10 percent (i.e., $1,100). Section 1026.19(e)(3)(ii) also  provides flexibility in disclosing individual fees by focusing on  aggregate amounts. For example, assume that, in the disclosures provided  pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i), the sum of all estimated charges  subject to Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(ii) equals $1,000. If the creditor does  not include an estimated charge for a notary fee but a $10 notary fee is  charged to the consumer, and the notary fee is subject to Sec.  1026.19(e)(3)(ii), then the creditor does not violate Sec.  1026.19(e)(1)(i) if the sum of all amounts charged to the consumer  subject to Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(ii) does not exceed $1,100, even though  an individual notary fee was not included in the estimated disclosures  provided pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">3. Services for which the consumer may, but does not, select a  settlement service provider. Good faith is determined pursuant to Sec.  1026.19(e)(3)(ii), instead of Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(i), if the creditor  permits the consumer to shop for a settlement service provider,  consistent with Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(A). Section 1026.19(e)(3)(ii)  provides that if the creditor requires a service in connection with the  mortgage loan transaction, and permits the consumer to shop for that  service consistent with Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(vi), but the consumer either  does not select a settlement service provider or chooses a settlement  service provider identified by the creditor on the list, then good faith  is determined pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(ii), instead of Sec.  1026.19(e)(3)(i). For example, if, in the disclosures provided pursuant  to Sec. Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) and 1026.37(f)(3), a creditor discloses  an estimated fee for an unaffiliated settlement agent and permits the  consumer to shop for that service, but the consumer either does not  choose a provider, or chooses a provider identified by the creditor on  the written list provided pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(C), then  the estimated settlement agent fee is included with the fees that may,  in aggregate, increase by no more than 10 percent for the purposes of  Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(ii). If, however, the consumer chooses a provider  that is not on the written list, then good faith is determined according  to Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">4. Recording fees. Section 1026.19(e)(3)(ii) provides that an  estimate of a charge for a third-party service or recording fees is in  good faith if the conditions specified in Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(ii)(A),  (B), and (C) are satisfied. Recording fees are not charges for third- party services because recording fees are paid to the applicable  government entity where the documents related to the mortgage  transaction are recorded, and thus, the condition specified in Sec.  1026.19(e)(3)(ii)(B) that the charge for third-party service not be paid  to an affiliate of the creditor is inapplicable for recording fees. The  condition specified in Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(ii)(C), that the creditor  permits the consumer to shop for the third-party service, is similarly  inapplicable. Therefore, estimates of recording fees need only satisfy  the condition specified in Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(ii)(A) to meet the  requirements of Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">5. Calculating the aggregate amount of estimated charges. In  calculating the aggregate amount of estimated charges for purposes of  conducting the good faith analysis pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(ii),  the aggregate amount of estimated charges must reflect charges for  services that are actually performed. For example, assume that the  creditor included a $100 estimated fee for a pest inspection in the  disclosures provided pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i), and the fee is  included in the category of charges subject to Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(ii),  but a pest inspection was not obtained in connection with the  transaction, then for purposes of the good faith analysis required under  Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(ii), the sum of all charges subject to Sec.  1026.19(e)(3)(ii) paid by or imposed on the consumer is compared to the  sum of all such charges disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e), minus  the $100 estimated pest inspection fee.</p><p class="depth0">19(e)(3)(iii) Variations permitted for certain charges.</p><p class="depth0">1. Good faith requirement for prepaid interest, property insurance  premiums, and escrowed amounts. Estimates of prepaid interest, property  insurance premiums, and amounts placed into an escrow, impound, reserve  or similar account must be consistent with the best information  reasonably available to the creditor at the time the disclosures are  provided. Differences between the amounts of such charges disclosed  under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) and the amounts of such charges paid by or  imposed on the consumer do not constitute a lack of good faith, so long  as the original estimated charge, or lack of an estimated charge for a  particular service, was based on the best information reasonably  available to   the creditor at the time the disclosure was provided. This means that  the estimate disclosed under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) was obtained by the  creditor through due diligence, acting in good faith. See comments  17(c)(2)(i)-1 and 19(e)(1)(i)-1. For example, if the creditor requires  homeowner's insurance but fails to include a homeowner's insurance  premium on the estimates provided pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i),  then the creditor's failure to disclose does not comply with Sec.  1026.19(e)(3)(iii). However, if the creditor does not require flood  insurance and the subject property is located in an area where floods  frequently occur, but not specifically located in a zone where flood  insurance is required, failure to include flood insurance on the  original estimates provided pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) does not  constitute a lack of good faith under Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(iii). Or, if  the creditor knows that the loan must close on the 15th of the month but  estimates prepaid interest to be paid from the 30th of that month, then  the under-disclosure does not comply with Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(iii). If,  however, the creditor estimates consistent with the best information  reasonably available that the loan will close on the 30th of the month  and bases the estimate of prepaid interest accordingly, but the loan  actually closed on the 1st of the next month instead, the creditor  complies with Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">2. Good faith requirement for required services chosen by the  consumer. If a service is required by the creditor, the creditor permits  the consumer to shop for that service consistent with Sec.  1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(A), the creditor provides the list required by Sec.  1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(C), and the consumer chooses a service provider that  is not on that list to perform that service, then the actual amounts of  such fees need not be compared to the original estimates for such fees  to perform the good faith analysis required by Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(i) or  (ii). Differences between the amounts of such charges disclosed pursuant  to Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) and the amounts of such charges paid by or  imposed on the consumer do not constitute a lack of good faith, so long  as the original estimated charge, or lack of an estimated charge for a  particular service, was based on the best information reasonably  available to the creditor at the time the disclosure was provided. For  example, if the consumer informs the creditor that the consumer will  choose a settlement agent not identified by the creditor on the written  list provided pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(C), and the creditor  subsequently discloses an unreasonably low estimated settlement agent  fee, then the under-disclosure does not comply with Sec.  1026.19(e)(3)(iii). If the creditor permits the consumer to shop  consistent with Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(A) but fails to provide the list  required by Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(C), good faith is determined  pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(ii) instead of Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(iii)  regardless of the provider selected by the consumer, unless the provider  is an affiliate of the creditor in which case good faith is determined  pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(i).</p><p class="depth0">3. Good faith requirement for non-required services chosen by the  consumer. Differences between the amounts of estimated charges for  services not required by the creditor disclosed pursuant to Sec.  1026.19(e)(1)(i) and the amounts of such charges paid by or imposed on  the consumer do not constitute a lack of good faith, so long as the  original estimated charge, or lack of an estimated charge for a  particular service, was based on the best information reasonably  available to the creditor at the time the disclosure was provided. For  example, if the consumer informs the creditor that the consumer will  obtain a type of inspection not required by the creditor, the creditor  must include the charge for that item in the disclosures provided  pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i), but the actual amount of the  inspection fee need not be compared to the original estimate for the  inspection fee to perform the good faith analysis required by Sec.  1026.19(e)(3)(iii). The original estimated charge, or lack of an  estimated charge for a particular service, complies with Sec.  1026.19(e)(3)(iii) if it is made based on the best information  reasonably available to the creditor at the time that the estimate was  provided. But, for example, if the subject property is located in a  jurisdiction where consumers are customarily represented at closing by  their own attorney, even though it is not a requirement, and the  creditor fails to include a fee for the consumer's attorney, or includes  an unreasonably low estimate for such fee, on the original estimates  provided pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i), then the creditor's failure  to disclose, or under-estimation, does not comply with Sec.  1026.19(e)(3)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">19(e)(3)(iv) Revised estimates.</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirement. Pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(i) and (ii), good  faith is determined by calculating the difference between the estimated  charges originally provided pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) and the  actual charges paid by or imposed on the consumer. Section  1026.19(e)(3)(iv) provides the exception to this rule. Pursuant to Sec.  1026.19(e)(3)(iv), for purposes of determining good faith under Sec.  1026.19(e)(3)(i) and (ii), the creditor may use a revised estimate of a  charge instead of the amount originally disclosed under Sec.  1026.19(e)(1)(i) if the revision is due to one of the reasons set forth  in Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(A) through (F).</p><p class="depth0">2. Actual increase. The revised disclosures may reflect increased  charges only to the extent that the reason for revision, as identified  in Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(A) through (F), actually increased the  particular charge. For example, if a consumer requests a rate lock  extension, then the revised disclosures may reflect a new rate lock  extension fee, but the   fee may be no more than the rate lock extension fee charged by the  creditor in its usual course of business, and other charges unrelated to  the rate lock extension may not change.</p><p class="depth0">3. Documentation requirement. In order to comply with Sec. 1026.25,  creditors must retain records demonstrating compliance with the  requirements of Sec. 1026.19(e). For example, if revised disclosures  are provided because of a changed circumstance under Sec.  1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(A) affecting settlement costs, the creditor must be  able to show compliance with Sec. 1026.19(e) by documenting the  original estimate of the cost at issue, explaining the reason for  revision and how it affected settlement costs, showing that the  corrected disclosure increased the estimate only to the extent that the  reason for revision actually increased the cost, and showing that the  timing requirements of Sec. 1026.19(e)(4) were satisfied. However, the  documentation requirement does not require separate corrected  disclosures for each change. A creditor may provide corrected  disclosures reflecting multiple changed circumstances, provided that the  creditor's documentation demonstrates that each correction complies with  the requirements of Sec. 1026.19(e).</p><p class="depth0">19(e)(3)(iv)(A) Changed circumstance affecting settlement charges.</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirement. For the purpose of determining good faith under  Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(i) and (ii), revised charges are compared to actual  charges if the revision was caused by a changed circumstance. See also  comment 19(e)(3)(iv)(A)-2 regarding the definition of a changed  circumstance. The following examples illustrate the application of this  provision:</p><p class="depth0">i. Charges subject to the zero percent tolerance category. Assume a  creditor provides a $200 estimated appraisal fee pursuant to Sec.  1026.19(e)(1)(i), which will be paid to an affiliated appraiser and  therefore may not increase for purposes of determining good faith under  Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(i), except as provided in Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(iv).  The estimate was based on information provided by the consumer at  application, which included information indicating that the subject  property was a single-family dwelling. Upon arrival at the subject  property, the appraiser discovers that the property is actually a  single-family dwelling located on a farm. A different schedule of  appraisal fees applies to residences located on farms. A changed  circumstance has occurred (i.e., information provided by the consumer is  found to be inaccurate after the disclosures required under Sec.  1026.19(e)(1)(i) were provided), which caused an increase in the cost of  the appraisal. Therefore, if the creditor issues revised disclosures  with the corrected appraisal fee, the actual appraisal fee of $400 paid  at the real estate closing by the consumer will be compared to the  revised appraisal fee of $400 to determine if the actual fee has  increased above the estimated fee. However, if the creditor failed to  provide revised disclosures, then the actual appraisal fee of $400 must  be compared to the originally disclosed estimated appraisal fee of $200.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Charges subject to the ten percent tolerance category. Assume a  creditor provides a $400 estimate of title fees, which are included in  the category of fees which may not increase by more than 10 percent for  the purposes of determining good faith under Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(ii),  except as provided in Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(iv). An unreleased lien is  discovered and the title company must perform additional work to release  the lien. However, the additional costs amount to only a five percent  increase over the sum of all fees included in the category of fees which  may not increase by more than 10 percent. A changed circumstance has  occurred (i.e., new information), but the sum of all costs subject to  the 10 percent tolerance category has not increased by more than 10  percent. Section 1026.19(e)(3)(iv) does not prohibit the creditor from  issuing revised disclosures, but if the creditor issues revised  disclosures in this scenario, when the disclosures required by Sec.  1026.19(f)(1)(i) are delivered, the actual title fees of $500 may not be  compared to the revised title fees of $500; they must be compared to the  originally estimated title fees of $400 because the changed circumstance  did not cause the sum of all costs subject to the 10 percent tolerance  category to increase by more than 10 percent.</p><p class="depth0">2. Changed circumstance. A changed circumstance may be an  extraordinary event beyond the control of any interested party. For  example, a war or a natural disaster would be an extraordinary event  beyond the control of an interested party. A changed circumstance may  also be an unexpected event specific to the consumer or the transaction.  For example, if the creditor provided an estimate of title insurance on  the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i), but the title  insurer goes out of business during underwriting, then this unexpected  event specific to the transaction is a changed circumstance. A changed  circumstance may also be information specific to the consumer or  transaction that the creditor relied upon when providing the disclosures  required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) and that was inaccurate or changed  after the disclosures were provided. For example, if the creditor relied  on the consumer's income when providing the disclosures required under  Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i), and the consumer represented to the creditor  that the consumer had an annual income of $90,000, but underwriting  determines that the consumer's annual income is only $80,000, then this  inaccuracy in information relied upon is a changed circumstance. Or,  assume two co-applicants applied for a mortgage loan. One applicant's   income was $30,000, while the other applicant's income was $50,000. If  the creditor relied on the combined income of $80,000 when providing the  disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i), but the applicant  earning $30,000 becomes unemployed during underwriting, thereby reducing  the combined income to $50,000, then this change in information relied  upon is a changed circumstance. A changed circumstance may also be the  discovery of new information specific to the consumer or transaction  that the creditor did not rely on when providing the original  disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i). For example, if the  creditor relied upon the value of the property in providing the  disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i), but during  underwriting a neighbor of the seller, upon learning of the impending  sale of the property, files a claim contesting the boundary of the  property to be sold, then this new information specific to the  transaction is a changed circumstance.</p><p class="depth0">3. Six pieces of information presumed collected, but not required.  Section 1026.19(e)(1)(iii) requires creditors to deliver the disclosures  not later than the third business day after the creditor receives the  consumer's application, which consists of the six pieces of information  identified in Sec. 1026.2(a)(3)(ii). A creditor is not required to  collect the consumer's name, monthly income, social security number to  obtain a credit report, the property address, an estimate of the value  of the property, or the mortgage loan amount sought. However, for  purposes of determining whether an estimate is provided in good faith  under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i), a creditor is presumed to have collected  these six pieces of information. For example, if a creditor provides the  disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) prior to receiving the  property address from the consumer, the creditor cannot subsequently  claim that the receipt of the property address is a changed circumstance  pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(A) or (B).</p><p class="depth0">19(e)(3)(iv)(B) Changed circumstance affecting eligibility.</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirement. If changed circumstances cause a change in the  consumer's eligibility for specific loan terms disclosed pursuant to  Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) and revised disclosures are provided because the  change in eligibility resulted in increased cost for a settlement  service beyond the applicable tolerance threshold, the charge paid by or  imposed on the consumer for the settlement service for which cost  increased due to the change in eligibility is compared to the revised  estimated cost for the settlement service to determine if the actual fee  has increased above the estimated fee. For example, assume that, prior  to providing the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i), the  creditor believed that the consumer was eligible for a loan program that  did not require an appraisal. The creditor then provides the estimated  disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i), which do not include an  estimated charge for an appraisal. During underwriting it is discovered  that the consumer was delinquent on mortgage loan payments in the past,  making the consumer ineligible for the loan program originally  identified on the estimated disclosures, but the consumer remains  eligible for a different program that requires an appraisal. If the  creditor provides revised disclosures reflecting the new program and  including the appraisal fee, then the actual appraisal fee will be  compared to the appraisal fee included in the revised disclosures to  determine if the actual fee has increased above the estimated fee.  However, if the revised disclosures also include increased estimates for  title fees, the actual title fees must be compared to the original  estimates assuming that the increased title fees do not stem from the  change in eligibility or any other change warranting a revised  disclosure. See also Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(A) and comment  19(e)(3)(iv)(A)-2 regarding the definition of changed circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">19(e)(3)(iv)(C) Revisions requested by the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirement. If the consumer requests revisions to the  transaction that affect items disclosed pursuant to Sec.  1026.19(e)(1)(i), and the creditor provides revised disclosures  reflecting the consumer's requested changes, the final disclosures are  compared to the revised disclosures to determine whether the actual fee  has increased above the estimated fee. For example, assume that the  consumer decides to grant a power of attorney authorizing a family  member to consummate the transaction on the consumer's behalf after the  disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) are provided. If the  creditor provides revised disclosures reflecting the fee to record the  power of attorney, then the actual charges will be compared to the  revised charges to determine if the fees have increased.</p><p class="depth0">19(e)(3)(iv)(D) Interest rate dependent charges.</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirements. If the interest rate is not locked when the  disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) are provided, a valid  reason for revision exists when the interest rate is subsequently  locked. On the date the interest rate is locked, Sec.  1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(D) requires the creditor to provide a revised version  of the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) reflecting the  revised interest rate, the points disclosed pursuant to Sec.  1026.37(f)(1), lender credits, and any other interest rate dependent  charges and terms. The following examples illustrate this requirement:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume a creditor sets the interest rate by executing a rate lock  agreement with the consumer. If such an agreement exists when the  original disclosures required under   Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) are provided, then the actual points and lender  credits are compared to the estimated points disclosed pursuant to Sec.  1026.37(f)(1) and lender credits included in the original disclosures  provided under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) for the purpose of determining  good faith pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(i). If the consumer enters  into a rate lock agreement with the creditor after the disclosures  required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) were provided, then Sec.  1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(D) requires the creditor to provide, on the date that  the consumer and the creditor enters into a rate lock agreement, a  revised version of the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i)  reflecting the revised interest rate, the points disclosed pursuant to  Sec. 1026.37(f)(1), lender credits, and any other interest rate  dependent charges and terms. Provided that the revised version of the  disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) reflect any revised  points disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(f)(1) and lender credits, the  actual points and lender credits are compared to the revised points and  lender credits for the purpose of determining good faith pursuant to  Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(i).</p><p class="depth0">19(e)(3)(iv)(E) Expiration.</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirements. If the consumer indicates an intent to proceed with  the transaction more than ten business days after the disclosures were  originally provided pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(iii), for the  purpose of determining good faith under Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(i) and (ii),  a creditor may use a revised estimate of a charge instead of the amount  originally disclosed under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i). Section  1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(E) requires no justification for the change to the  original estimate other than the lapse of ten business days. For  example, assume a creditor includes a $500 underwriting fee on the  disclosures provided pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) and the creditor  delivers those disclosures on a Monday. If the consumer indicates intent  to proceed 11 business days later, the creditor may provide new  disclosures with a $700 underwriting fee. In this example, Sec.  1026.19(e) and Sec. 1026.25 require the creditor to document that a new  disclosure was provided pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(E), but do  not require the creditor to document a reason for the increase in the  underwriting fee.</p><p class="depth0">19(e)(3)(iv)(F) Delayed settlement date on a construction loan.</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirements. A loan for the purchase of a home that has yet to  be constructed, or a loan to purchase a home under construction (i.e.,  construction is currently underway), is a construction loan to build a  home for the purposes of Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(F). However, if a use  and occupancy permit has been issued for the home prior to the issuance  of the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i), then the home  is not considered to be under construction and the transaction would not  be a construction loan to build a home for the purposes of Sec.  1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(F).</p><p class="depth0">19(e)(4) Provision and receipt of revised disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">19(e)(4)(i) General rule.</p><p class="depth0">1. Three-business-day requirement. Section 1026.19(e)(4)(i) provides  that subject to the requirements of Sec. 1026.19(e)(4)(ii), if a  creditor uses a revised estimate pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(iv) for  the purpose of determining good faith under Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(i) and  (ii), the creditor shall provide a revised version of the disclosures  required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) reflecting the revised estimate  within three business days of receiving information sufficient to  establish that one of the reasons for revision provided under Sec.  1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(A) through (C), (E) and (F) has occurred. The  following examples illustrate these requirements:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume a creditor requires a pest inspection. The unaffiliated  pest inspection company informs the creditor on Monday that the subject  property contains evidence of termite damage, requiring a further  inspection, the cost of which will cause an increase in estimated  settlement charges subject to Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(ii) by more than 10  percent. The creditor must provide revised disclosures by Thursday to  comply with Sec. 1026.19(e)(4)(i).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume a creditor receives information on Monday that, because  of a changed circumstance under Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(A), the title  fees will increase by an amount totaling six percent of the originally  estimated settlement charges subject to Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(ii). The  creditor had received information three weeks before that, because of a  changed circumstance under Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(A), the pest  inspection fees increased by an amount totaling five percent of the  originally estimated settlement charges subject to Sec.  1026.19(e)(3)(ii). Thus, on Monday, the creditor has received sufficient  information to establish a valid reason for revision and must provide  revised disclosures reflecting the 11 percent increase by Thursday to  comply with Sec. 1026.19(e)(4)(i).</p><p class="depth0">iii. Assume a creditor requires an appraisal. The creditor receives  the appraisal report, which indicates that the value of the home is  significantly lower than expected. However, the creditor has reason to  doubt the validity of the appraisal report. A reason for revision has  not been established because the creditor reasonably believes that the  appraisal report is incorrect. The creditor then chooses to send a  different appraiser for a second opinion, but the second appraiser  returns a similar report. At this point, the creditor has received  information sufficient to establish that a reason for revision has, in  fact, occurred, and must provide corrected disclosures within three  business days of receiving the second appraisal report. In this example,  in order to comply with Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(iv) and Sec. 1026.25, the  creditor   must maintain records documenting the creditor's doubts regarding the  validity of the appraisal to demonstrate that the reason for revision  did not occur upon receipt of the first appraisal report.</p><p class="depth0">2. Relationship to Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(D). If the reason for the  revision is provided under Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(D), notwithstanding  the three-business-day rule set forth in Sec. 1026.19(e)(4)(i), Sec.  1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(D) requires the creditor to provide a revised version  of the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) on the date the  interest rate is locked. See comment 19(e)(3)(iv)(D)-1.</p><p class="depth0">19(e)(4)(ii) Relationship to disclosures required under Sec.  1026.19(f)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Revised disclosures may not be delivered at the same time as the  Closing Disclosure. Section 1026.19(e)(4)(ii) prohibits a creditor from  providing a revised version of the disclosures required under Sec.  1026.19(e)(1)(i) on or after the date on which the creditor provides the  disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i). Section  1026.19(e)(4)(ii) also requires that the consumer must receive a revised  version of the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) no  later than four business days prior to consummation, and provides that  if the revised version of the disclosures are not provided to the  consumer in person, the consumer is considered to have received the  revised version of the disclosures three business days after the  creditor delivers or places in the mail the revised version of the  disclosures. See also comments 19(e)(1)(iv)-1 and -2. If, however, there  are less than four business days between the time the revised version of  the disclosures is required to be provided pursuant to Sec.  1026.19(e)(4)(i) and consummation, creditors comply with the  requirements of Sec. 1026.19(e)(4) if the revised disclosures are  reflected in the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i). See  below for illustrative examples:</p><p class="depth0">i. If the creditor is scheduled to meet with the consumer and  provide the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) on Wednesday,  and the APR becomes inaccurate on Tuesday, the creditor complies with  the requirements of Sec. 1026.19(e)(4) by providing the disclosures  required under Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) reflecting the revised APR on  Wednesday. However, the creditor does not comply with the requirements  of Sec. 1026.19(e)(4) if it provided both a revised version of the  disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) reflecting the revised  APR on Wednesday, and also provides the disclosures required under Sec.  1026.19(f)(1)(i) on Wednesday.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the creditor is scheduled to email the disclosures required  under Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) to the consumer on Wednesday, and the  consumer requests a change to the loan that would result in revised  disclosures pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(C) on Tuesday, the  creditor complies with the requirements of Sec. 1026.19(e)(4) by  providing the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i)  reflecting the consumer-requested changes on Wednesday. However, the  creditor does not comply if it provides both the revised version of the  disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) reflecting consumer  requested changes, and also the disclosures required under Sec.  1026.19(f)(1)(i) on Wednesday.</p><p class="depth0">19(f) Mortgage loans secured by real property--Final disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">19(f)(1) Provision of disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">19(f)(1)(i) Scope.</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirements. Section 1026.19(f)(1)(i) requires disclosure of the  actual terms of the credit transaction, and the actual costs associated  with the settlement of that transaction, for closed-end credit  transactions that are secured by real property, other than reverse  mortgages subject to Sec. 1026.33. For example, if the creditor  requires the consumer to pay money into a reserve account for the future  payment of taxes, the creditor must disclose to the consumer the exact  amount that the consumer is required to pay into the reserve account. If  the disclosures provided pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) do not  contain the actual terms of the transaction, the creditor does not  violate Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) if the creditor provides corrected  disclosures that contain the actual terms of the transaction and  complies with the other requirements of Sec. 1026.19(f), including the  timing requirements in Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(ii) and (f)(2). For example,  if the creditor provides the disclosures required by Sec.  1026.19(f)(1)(i) on Monday, June 1, but the consumer adds a mobile  notary service to the terms of the transaction on Tuesday, June 2, the  creditor complies with Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) if it provides disclosures  reflecting the revised terms of the transaction on or after Tuesday,  June 2, assuming that the corrected disclosures are also provided at or  before consummation, pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(f)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0">2. Best information reasonably available. Creditors may estimate  disclosures provided under Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(A) and (f)(2)(ii)  using the best information reasonably available when the actual term is  unknown to the creditor at the time disclosures are made, consistent  with Sec. 1026.17(c)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0">i. Actual term unknown. An actual term is unknown if it is not  reasonably available to the creditor at the time the disclosures are  made. The ``reasonably available'' standard requires that the creditor,  acting in good faith, exercise due diligence in obtaining the  information. For example, the creditor must at a minimum utilize  generally accepted calculation tools, but need not invest in the most  sophisticated computer program to make a particular type of calculation.  The creditor normally may rely on the representations of other parties  in obtaining information. For example, the creditor might look to the  consumer for the time of consummation, to insurance companies for the  cost of insurance, to realtors for taxes and   escrow fees, or to a settlement agent for homeowner's association dues  or other information in connection with a real estate settlement. The  following examples illustrate the reasonably available standard for  purposes of Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">A. Assume a creditor provides the disclosure under Sec.  1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(A) for a transaction in which the title insurance  company that is providing the title insurance policies is acting as the  settlement agent in connection with the transaction, but the creditor  does not request the actual cost of the lender's title insurance policy  that the consumer is purchasing from the title insurance company and  instead discloses an estimate based on information from a different  transaction. The creditor has not exercised due diligence in obtaining  the information about the cost of the lender's title insurance policy  required under the ``reasonably available'' standard in connection with  the estimate disclosed for the lender's title insurance policy.</p><p class="depth0">B. Assume that in the prior example the creditor obtained  information about the terms of the consumer's transaction from the  settlement agent regarding the amounts disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(j)  and (k). The creditor has exercised due diligence in obtaining the  information about the costs under Sec. 1026.38(j) and (k) for purposes  of the ``reasonably available'' standard in connection with such  disclosures under Sec. 1026.38(j) and (k).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Estimates. If an actual term is unknown, the creditor may  utilize estimates using the best information reasonably available in  making disclosures even though the creditor knows that more precise  information will be available at or before consummation. However, the  creditor may not utilize an estimate without exercising due diligence to  obtain the actual term for the consumer's transaction. See comment  19(f)(1)(i)-2.i. The creditor is required to provide corrected  disclosures containing the actual terms of the transaction at or before  consummation under Sec. 1026.19(f)(2), subject to the exceptions  provided for in that paragraph. Disclosures under Sec. 1026.19(f) are  subject to the labeling rules set forth in Sec. 1026.38. See comment  17(c)(2)(i)-2 for guidance on labeling estimates.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Settlement agent. If a settlement agent provides disclosures  required by Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) three business days before  consummation pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(v), the ``best information  reasonably available'' standard applies to terms for which the actual  term is unknown to the settlement agent at the time the disclosures are  provided. The settlement agent normally may rely on the representations  of other parties in obtaining information, but if information about  actual terms is not reasonably available, the settlement agent also must  satisfy the ``best information reasonably available'' standard.  Accordingly, the settlement agent is required to exercise due diligence  to obtain information if it is providing the Closing Disclosure pursuant  to Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(v). For example, for the loan terms table  required to be disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(b), the settlement agent  would be considered to have exercised due diligence if it obtained such  information from the creditor. Because the creditor remains responsible  under Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(v) for ensuring that the Closing Disclosure is  provided in accordance with Sec. 1026.19(f), the creditor is expected  to maintain communication with the settlement agent to ensure that the  settlement agent is acting in place of the creditor. See comment  19(f)(1)(v)-3 for guidance on a creditor's responsibilities where a  settlement agent provides disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">3. Denied or withdrawn applications. The creditor is not required to  provide the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) if, before  the time the creditor is required to provide the disclosures under Sec.  1026.19(f), the creditor determines the consumer's application will not  or cannot be approved on the terms requested, or the consumer has  withdrawn the application, and, as such, the transaction will not be  consummated. For transactions covered by Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i), the  creditor may rely on comment 19(e)(1)(iii)-3 in determining that  disclosures are not required by Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) because the  consumer's application will not or cannot be approved on the terms  requested or the consumer has withdrawn the application.</p><p class="depth0">19(f)(1)(ii) Timing.</p><p class="depth0">1. Timing. Except as provided in Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(B),  (f)(2)(i), (f)(2)(iii), (f)(2)(iv), and (f)(2)(v), the disclosures  required by Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) must be received by the consumer no  later than three business days before consummation. For example, if  consummation is scheduled for Thursday, the creditor satisfies this  requirement by hand delivering the disclosures on Monday, assuming each  weekday is a business day. For purposes of Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(ii), the  term ``business day'' means all calendar days except Sundays and legal  public holidays referred to in Sec. 1026.2(a)(6). See comment 2(a)(6)- 2.</p><p class="depth0">2. Receipt of disclosures three business days before consummation.  Section 1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(A) provides that the consumer must receive the  disclosures no later than three business days before consummation. To  comply with this requirement, the creditor must arrange for delivery  accordingly. Section 1026.19(f)(1)(iii) provides that, if any  disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) are not provided to  the consumer in person, the consumer is considered to have received the  disclosures three business days after they are delivered or placed in  the mail. Thus, for example, if consummation is scheduled for   Thursday, a creditor would satisfy the requirements of Sec.  1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(A) if the creditor places the disclosures in the mail  on Thursday of the previous week, because, for the purposes of Sec.  1026.19(f)(1)(ii), Saturday is a business day, pursuant to Sec.  1026.2(a)(6), and, pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(iii), the consumer  would be considered to have received the disclosures on the Monday  before consummation is scheduled. See comment 19(f)(1)(iii)-1. A  creditor would not satisfy the requirements of Sec.  1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(A) in this example if the creditor places the  disclosures in the mail on the Monday before consummation. However, the  creditor in this example could satisfy the requirements of Sec.  1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(A) by delivering the disclosures on Monday, for  instance, by way of electronic mail, provided the requirements of Sec.  1026.38(t)(3)(iii) relating to disclosures in electronic form are  satisfied and assuming that each weekday is a business day, and provided  that the creditor obtains evidence that the consumer received the  emailed disclosures on Monday. See comment 19(f)(1)(iii)-2.</p><p class="depth0">3. Timeshares. For transactions secured by a consumer's interest in  a timeshare plan described in 11 U.S.C. 101(53D), Sec.  1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(B) requires a creditor to ensure that the consumer  receives the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) no later  than consummation. Timeshare transactions covered by Sec.  1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(B) may be consummated at the time or any time after  the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) are received by the  consumer. For example, if a consumer provides the creditor with an  application, as defined by Sec. 1026.2(a)(3), for a mortgage loan  secured by a timeshare on Monday, June 1, and consummation of the  timeshare transaction is scheduled for Friday, June 5, the creditor  complies with Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(B) by ensuring that the consumer  receives the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) no later  than consummation on Friday, June 5. If a consumer provides the creditor  with an application for a mortgage loan secured by a timeshare on  Monday, June 1 and consummation of the timeshare transaction is  scheduled for Tuesday, June 2, then the creditor complies with Sec.  1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(B) by ensuring that the consumer receives the  disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) no later than  consummation on Tuesday, June 2. In some cases, a Loan Estimate must be  provided under Sec. 1026.19(e) before provision of the Closing  Disclosure. See comment 19(e)(1)(iii)-4 for guidance on providing the  Loan Estimate for transactions secured by a consumer's interest in a  timeshare plan.</p><p class="depth0">19(f)(1)(iii) Receipt of disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">1. Mail delivery. Section 1026.19(f)(1)(iii) provides that, if any  disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) are not provided to  the consumer in person, the consumer is considered to have received the  disclosures three business days after they are delivered or placed in  the mail. If the creditor delivers the disclosures required under Sec.  1026.19(f)(1)(i) in person, consummation may occur any time on the third  business day following delivery. If the creditor provides the  disclosures by mail, the consumer is considered to have received them  three business days after they are placed in the mail, for purposes of  determining when the three-business-day waiting period required under  Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(A) begins. The creditor may, alternatively, rely  on evidence that the consumer received the disclosures earlier than  three business days after mailing. See comment 19(e)(1)(iv)-1 for an  example in which the creditor sends disclosures via overnight mail.</p><p class="depth0">2. Other forms of delivery. Creditors that use electronic mail or a  courier other than the United States Postal Service also may follow the  approach for disclosures provided by mail described in comment  19(f)(1)(iii)-1. For example, if a creditor sends a disclosure required  under Sec. 1026.19(f) via email on Monday, pursuant to Sec.  1026.19(f)(1)(iii) the consumer is considered to have received the  disclosure on Thursday, three business days later. The creditor may,  alternatively, rely on evidence that the consumer received the emailed  disclosures earlier after delivery. See comment 19(e)(1)(iv)-2 for an  example in which the creditor emails disclosures and receives an  acknowledgment from the consumer on the same day. Creditors using  electronic delivery methods, such as email, must also comply with Sec.  1026.38(t)(3)(iii). For example, if a creditor delivers the disclosures  required by Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) to a consumer via email, but the  creditor did not obtain the consumer's consent to receive disclosures  via email prior to delivering the disclosures, then the creditor does  not comply with Sec. 1026.38(t)(3)(iii), and the creditor does not  comply with Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i), assuming the disclosures were not  provided in a different manner in accordance with the timing  requirements of Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">19(f)(1)(iv) Consumer's waiver of waiting period before  consummation.</p><p class="depth0">1. Modification or waiver. A consumer may modify or waive the right  to the three-business-day waiting periods required by Sec.  1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(A) or (f)(2)(ii) only after the creditor makes the  disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i). The consumer must have a  bona fide personal financial emergency that necessitates consummating  the credit transaction before the end of the waiting period. Whether  these conditions are met is determined by the facts surrounding  individual situations. The imminent sale of the consumer's home at  foreclosure, where the foreclosure sale will proceed unless loan  proceeds are made available to the consumer during the waiting period,  is one example of a bona fide personal financial emergency.   Each consumer who is primarily liable on the legal obligation must sign  the written statement for the waiver to be effective.</p><p class="depth0">19(f)(1)(v) Settlement agent.</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirements. For purposes of Sec. 1026.19(f), a settlement  agent is the person conducting the settlement. A settlement agent may  provide the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) instead of  the creditor. By assuming this responsibility, the settlement agent  becomes responsible for complying with all of the relevant requirements  of Sec. 1026.19(f), meaning that ``settlement agent'' should be read in  the place of ``creditor'' for all the relevant provisions of Sec.  1026.19(f), except where such a reading would create responsibility for  settlement agents under Sec. 1026.19(e). For example, comment  19(f)(1)(ii)-3 explains that, in some cases involving transactions  secured by a consumer's interest in a timeshare plan, a Loan Estimate  must be provided under Sec. 1026.19(e). ``Settlement agent'' could not  be read in place of ``creditor'' in comment 19(f)(1)(ii)-3 because  settlement agents are not responsible for the disclosures required by  Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i). To ensure timely and accurate compliance with  the requirements of Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(v), the creditor and settlement  agent need to communicate effectively.</p><p class="depth0">2. Settlement agent responsibilities. If a settlement agent provides  any disclosure under Sec. 1026.19(f), the settlement agent must comply  with the relevant requirements of Sec. 1026.19(f). For example, if the  creditor and settlement agent agree that the creditor will deliver the  disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) to be received by the  consumer three business days before consummation, pursuant to Sec.  1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(A), and that the settlement agent will deliver any  corrected disclosures at or before consummation, including disclosures  provided so that they are received by the consumer three business days  before consummation under Sec. 1026.19(f)(2)(ii), and will permit the  consumer to inspect the disclosures during the business day before  consummation, the settlement agent must ensure that the consumer  receives the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) at or  before consummation and is able to inspect the disclosures during the  business day before consummation, if the consumer so requests, in  accordance with Sec. 1026.19(f)(2)(i). See comment 19(f)(1)(v)-3 below  for additional guidance regarding the creditor's responsibilities where  the settlement agent provides disclosures. The settlement agent may  assume the responsibility to provide some or all of the disclosures  required by Sec. 1026.19(f). See comment 19(f)(1)(v)-4 for guidance on  how creditors and settlement agents may divide responsibilities for  completing the disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">3. Creditor responsibilities. If a settlement agent provides  disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(f) in the creditor's place, the  creditor remains responsible under Sec. 1026.19(f) for ensuring that  the requirements of Sec. 1026.19(f) have been satisfied. For example,  if the settlement agent assumes the responsibility for providing all of  the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i), the creditor does  not comply with Sec. 1026.19(f) if the settlement agent does not  provide these disclosures at all, or if the consumer receives the  disclosures later than three business days before consummation, as  required by Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(A) and, as applicable, (f)(2)(ii).  The creditor does not satisfy the requirements of Sec. 1026.19(f) if it  provides duplicative disclosures. For example, a creditor does not  satisfy its obligation by issuing disclosures required under Sec.  1026.19(f) that mirror ones already issued by the settlement agent for  the purpose of demonstrating that the consumer received timely  disclosures. The creditor is expected to maintain communication with the  settlement agent to ensure that the settlement agent is acting in place  of the creditor. Disclosures provided by a settlement agent in  accordance with Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(v) satisfy the creditor's obligation  under Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">4. Shared responsibilities permitted--completing the disclosures.  Creditors and settlement agents may agree to divide responsibility with  respect to completing any of the disclosures under Sec. 1026.38 for the  disclosures provided under Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i). The settlement agent  may assume the responsibility to complete some or all of the disclosures  required by Sec. 1026.19(f). For example, the creditor complies with  the requirements of Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) and the settlement agent  complies with the requirements of Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(v) if the  settlement agent agrees to complete only the portion of the disclosures  required by Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) related to closing costs for taxes,  title fees, and insurance premiums, and the creditor agrees to complete  the remainder of the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i), and  either the settlement agent or the creditor provides the consumer with  one single disclosure form containing all of the information required to  be disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i), in accordance with the  other requirements in Sec. 1026.19(f), such as requirements related to  timing and delivery.</p><p class="depth0">19(f)(2) Subsequent changes.</p><p class="depth0">19(f)(2)(i) Changes before consummation not requiring a new waiting  period.</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirements. Under Sec. 1026.19(f)(2)(i), if the disclosures  provided under Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) become inaccurate before  consummation, other than as provided under Sec. 1026.19(f)(2)(ii), the  creditor shall provide corrected disclosures reflecting any changed  terms to the consumer so that the consumer receives the corrected  disclosures at or before consummation. The creditor need not comply with  the timing requirements in Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(ii) if an event other  than one   identified in Sec. 1026.19(f)(2)(ii) occurs, and such changes occur  after the creditor provides the consumer with the disclosures required  by Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i). For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume consummation is scheduled for Thursday, the consumer  received the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) on  Monday, and a walk-through inspection occurs on Wednesday morning.  During the walk-through the consumer discovers damage to the dishwasher.  The seller agrees to credit the consumer $500 towards a new dishwasher.  The creditor complies with the requirements of Sec. 1026.19(f) if the  creditor provides corrected disclosures so that the consumer receives  them at or before consummation on Thursday.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume consummation is scheduled for Friday and on Monday  morning the creditor sends the disclosures via overnight delivery to the  consumer, ensuring that the consumer receives the disclosures on  Tuesday. On Monday night, the seller agrees to sell certain household  furnishings to the consumer for an additional $1,000, to be paid at the  real estate closing, and the consumer immediately informs the creditor  of the change. The creditor must provide corrected disclosures so that  the consumer receives them at or before consummation. The creditor does  not violate Sec. 1026.19(f) because the change to the transaction  resulting from negotiations between the seller and consumer occurred  after the creditor provided the final disclosures, regardless of the  fact that the change occurred before the consumer had received the final  disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Assume consummation is scheduled for Thursday, the consumer  received the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) on  Monday, and a walk-through inspection occurs on Wednesday morning. As a  result of consumer and seller negotiations, the total amount due from  the buyer increases by $500. Also on Wednesday, the creditor discovers  that the homeowner's insurance premium that was disclosed as $800 is  actually $850. The new $500 amount due and the $50 insurance premium  understatements are not violations of Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i), and the  creditor complies with Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) by providing corrected  disclosures reflecting the $550 increase so that the consumer receives  them at or before consummation, pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(f)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">2. Inspection. A settlement agent may satisfy the requirement to  permit the consumer to inspect the disclosures under Sec.  1026.19(f)(2)(i), subject to Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(v).</p><p class="depth0">19(f)(2)(ii) Changes before consummation requiring a new waiting  period.</p><p class="depth0">1. Conditions for corrected disclosures. Pursuant to Sec.  1026.19(f)(2)(ii), if, at the time of consummation, the annual  percentage rate becomes inaccurate, the loan product changes, or a  prepayment penalty is added to the transaction, the creditor must  provide corrected disclosures with all changed terms so that the  consumer receives them not later than the third business day before  consummation. Requirements for annual percentage rate disclosures are  set forth in Sec. 1026.38(o)(4), and requirements determining whether  an annual percentage rate is accurate are set forth in Sec. 1026.22.  Requirements for loan product disclosures are set forth in Sec.  1026.38(a)(5)(iii) and Sec. 1026.37(a)(10). Requirements for prepayment  penalty disclosures are set forth in Sec. 1026.38(b) and Sec.  1026.37(b)(4).</p><p class="depth0">i. Example--APR becomes inaccurate. Assume consummation is scheduled  for Thursday, June 11 and the disclosure for a regular mortgage  transaction received by the consumer on Monday, June 8 under Sec.  1026.19(f)(1)(i) discloses an annual percentage rate of 7.00 percent:</p><p class="depth0">A. On Thursday, June 11, the annual percentage rate will be 7.10  percent. The creditor is not required to delay consummation to provide  corrected disclosures under Sec. 1026.19(f)(2)(ii) because the annual  percentage rate is accurate pursuant to Sec. 1026.22, but the creditor  is required under Sec. 1026.19(f)(2)(i) to provide corrected  disclosures, including any other changed terms, so that the consumer  receives them on or before Thursday, June 11.</p><p class="depth0">B. On Thursday, June 11, the annual percentage rate will be 7.15  percent and corrected disclosures were not received by the consumer on  or before Monday, June 8 because the annual percentage rate is  inaccurate pursuant to Sec. 1026.22. The creditor is required to delay  consummation and provide corrected disclosures, including any other  changed terms, so that the consumer receives them at least three  business days before consummation under Sec. 1026.19(f)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Example--loan product changes. Assume consummation is scheduled  for Thursday, June 11 and the disclosures provided under Sec.  1026.19(f)(1)(i) disclose a product required to be disclosed as a  ``Fixed Rate'' that contains no features that may change the periodic  payment.</p><p class="depth0">A. On Thursday, June 11, the loan product required to be disclosed  changes to a ``5/1 Adjustable Rate.'' The creditor is required to  provide corrected disclosures and delay consummation until the consumer  has received the corrected disclosures provided under Sec.  1026.19(f)(1)(i) reflecting the change in the product disclosure, and  any other changed terms, at least three business days before  consummation. If, after the corrected disclosures in this example are  provided, the loan product subsequently changes before consummation to a  ``3/1 Adjustable Rate,'' the creditor is required to provide additional  corrected disclosures and again delay consummation until the consumer  has received the corrected disclosures provided under Sec.  1026.19(f)(1)(i) reflecting the change in the product disclosure, and  any other changed   terms, at least three business days before consummation.</p><p class="depth0">B. On Thursday, June 11, the loan product required to be disclosed  has changed to a ``Fixed Rate'' with a ``Negative Amortization''  feature. The creditor is required to provide corrected disclosures and  delay consummation until the consumer has received the corrected  disclosures provided under Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) reflecting the change  in the product disclosure, and any other changed terms, at least three  business days before consummation.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Example--prepayment penalty is added. Assume consummation is  scheduled for Thursday, June 11 and the disclosure provided under Sec.  1026.19(f)(1)(i) did not disclose a prepayment penalty. On Wednesday,  June 10, a prepayment penalty is added to the transaction such that the  disclosure required by Sec. 1026.38(b) becomes inaccurate. The creditor  is required to provide corrected disclosures and delay consummation  until the consumer has received the corrected disclosures provided under  Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) reflecting the change in the disclosure of the  loan terms, and any other changed terms, at least three business days  before consummation. If, after the revised disclosures in this example  are provided but before consummation, the prepayment penalty is removed  such that the description of the prepayment penalty again becomes  inaccurate, and no other changes to the transaction occur, the creditor  is required to provide corrected disclosures so that the consumer  receives them at or before consummation under Sec. 1026.19(f)(2)(i),  but the creditor is not required to delay consummation because Sec.  1026.19(f)(2)(ii)(C) applies only when a prepayment penalty is added.</p><p class="depth0">19(f)(2)(iii) Changes due to events occurring after consummation.</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirements. Under Sec. 1026.19(f)(2)(iii), if during the 30- day period following consummation, an event in connection with the  settlement of the transaction occurs that causes the disclosures to  become inaccurate, and such inaccuracy results in a change to an amount  actually paid by the consumer from that amount disclosed under Sec.  1026.19(f)(1)(i), the creditor shall deliver or place in the mail  corrected disclosures not later than 30 days after receiving information  sufficient to establish that such event has occurred. The following  examples illustrate this requirement. (See also comment 19(e)(4)(i)-1  for further guidance on when sufficient information has been received to  establish an event has occurred.)</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume consummation occurs on a Monday and the security  instrument is recorded on Tuesday, the day after consummation. If the  creditor learns on Tuesday that the fee charged by the recorder's office  differs from that previously disclosed pursuant to Sec.  1026.19(f)(1)(i), and the changed fee results in a change in the amount  actually paid by the consumer, the creditor complies with Sec.  1026.19(f)(1)(i) and (f)(2)(iii) by revising the disclosures accordingly  and delivering or placing them in the mail no later than 30 days after  Tuesday.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume consummation occurs on a Tuesday, October 1 and the  security instrument is not recorded until 15 days after October 1 on  Thursday, October 16. The creditor learns on Monday, November 4 that the  transfer taxes owed to the State differ from those previously disclosed  pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i), resulting in an increase in the  amount actually paid by the consumer. The creditor complies with Sec.  1026.19(f)(1)(i) and Sec. 1026.19(f)(2)(iii) by revising the  disclosures accordingly and delivering or placing them in the mail no  later than 30 days after Monday, November 4. Assume further that the  increase in transfer taxes paid by the consumer also exceeds the amount  originally disclosed under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) above the limitations  prescribed by Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(i). Pursuant to Sec.  1026.19(f)(2)(v), the creditor does not violate Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i)  if the creditor refunds the excess to the consumer no later than 60 days  after consummation, and the creditor does not violate Sec.  1026.19(f)(1)(i) if the creditor delivers disclosures corrected to  reflect the refund of such excess no later than 60 days after  consummation. The creditor satisfies these requirements under Sec.  1026.19(f)(2)(v) if it revises the disclosures accordingly and delivers  or places them in the mail by November 30.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Assume consummation occurs on a Monday and the security  instrument is recorded on Tuesday, the day after consummation. During  the recording process on Tuesday the settlement agent and the creditor  discover that the property is subject to an unpaid $500 nuisance  abatement assessment, which was not disclosed pursuant to Sec.  1026.19(f)(1)(i), and learns that pursuant to an agreement with the  seller, the $500 assessment will be paid by the seller rather than the  consumer. Because the $500 assessment does not result in a change to an  amount actually paid by the consumer, the creditor is not required to  provide a corrected disclosure pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(f)(2)(iii).  However, the assessment will result in a change to an amount actually  paid by the seller from the amount disclosed under Sec.  1026.19(f)(4)(i). Pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(f)(4)(ii), the settlement  agent must deliver or place in the mail corrected disclosures to the  seller no later than 30 days after Tuesday and provide a copy to the  creditor pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(f)(4)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">iv. Assume consummation occurs on a Monday and the security  instrument is recorded on Tuesday, the day after consummation. Assume  further that ten days after consummation the municipality in which the  property is located raises property tax rates effective after the date  on which settlement concludes. Section 1026.19(f)(2)(iii) does not   require the creditor to provide the consumer with corrected disclosures  because the increase in property tax rates is not in connection with the  settlement of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">19(f)(2)(iv) Changes due to clerical errors.</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirements. Section 1026.19(f)(2)(iv) requires the creditor to  deliver or place in the mail corrected disclosures if the disclosures  provided pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) contain non-numeric clerical  errors. An error is considered clerical if it does not affect a  numerical disclosure and does not affect requirements imposed by Sec.  1026.19(e) or (f). For example, if the disclosure identifies the  incorrect settlement service provider as the recipient of a payment,  then Sec. 1026.19(f)(2)(iv) requires the creditor to deliver or place  in the mail corrected disclosures reflecting the corrected non-numeric  disclosure no later than 60 days after consummation. However, if, for  example, the disclosure lists the wrong property address, which affects  the delivery requirement imposed by Sec. 1026.19(e) or (f), the error  would not be considered clerical.</p><p class="depth0">19(f)(2)(v) Refunds related to the good faith analysis.</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirements. Section 1026.19(f)(2)(v) provides that, if amounts  paid at closing exceed the amounts specified under Sec.  1026.19(e)(3)(i) or (ii), the creditor does not violate Sec.  1026.19(e)(1)(i) if the creditor refunds the excess to the consumer no  later than 60 days after consummation, and the creditor does not violate  Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) if the creditor delivers or places in the mail  disclosures corrected to reflect the refund of such excess no later than  60 days after consummation. For example, assume that at consummation the  consumer must pay four itemized charges that are subject to the good  faith determination under Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(i). If the actual amounts  paid by the consumer for the four itemized charges subject to Sec.  1026.19(e)(3)(i) exceeded their respective estimates on the disclosures  required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) by $30, $25, $25, and $10, then  there would be a $90 excess amount above the limitations prescribed by  Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(i). If, further, the amounts paid by the consumer  for services that are subject to the good faith determination under  Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(ii) totaled $1,190, but the respective estimates on  the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) totaled only  $1,000, then there would be a $90 excess amount above the limitations  prescribed by Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(ii). The creditor does not violate  Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) if the creditor refunds the excess to the  consumer no later than 60 days after consummation. The creditor does not  violate Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) if the creditor delivers or places in the  mail corrected disclosures reflecting the $180 refund of the excess  amount collected no later than 60 days after consummation. See comment  38(h)(3)-2 for additional guidance on disclosing refunds such as these.</p><p class="depth0">19(f)(3) Charges disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">19(f)(3)(i) Actual charge.</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirements. Section 1026.19(f)(3)(i) provides the general rule  that the amount imposed on the consumer for any settlement service shall  not exceed the amount actually received by the settlement service  provider for that service. Except as otherwise provided in Sec.  1026.19(f)(3)(ii), a creditor violates Sec. 1026.19(f)(3)(i) if the  amount imposed upon the consumer exceeds the amount actually received by  the service provider for that service.</p><p class="depth0">19(f)(3)(ii) Average charge.</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirements. Average-charge pricing is the exception to the rule  in Sec. 1026.19(f)(3)(i) that consumers shall not pay more than the  exact amount charged by a settlement service provider for the  performance of that service. See comment 19(f)(3)(i)-1. If the creditor  develops representative samples of specific settlement costs for a  particular class of transactions, the creditor may charge the average  cost for that settlement service instead of the actual cost for such  transactions. An average-charge program may not be used in a way that  inflates the cost for settlement services overall.</p><p class="depth0">2. Defining the class of transactions. Section 1026.19(f)(3)(ii)(B)  requires a creditor to use an appropriate period of time, appropriate  geographic area, and appropriate type of loan to define a particular  class of transactions. For purposes of Sec. 1026.19(f)(3)(ii)(B), a  period of time is appropriate if the sample size is sufficient to  calculate average costs with reasonable precision, provided that the  period of time is not less than 30 days and not more than six months.  For purposes of Sec. 1026.19(f)(3)(ii)(B), a geographic area and loan  type are appropriate if the sample size is sufficient to calculate  average costs with reasonable precision, provided that the area and loan  type are not defined in a way that pools costs between dissimilar  populations. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume a creditor defines a geographic area that contains two  subdivisions, one with a median appraisal cost of $200, and the other  with a median appraisal cost of $1,000. This geographic area would not  satisfy the requirements of Sec. 1026.19(f)(3)(ii) because the cost  characteristics of the two populations are dissimilar. However, a  geographic area would be appropriately defined if both subdivisions had  a relatively normal distribution of appraisal costs, even if the  distribution for each subdivision ranges from below $200 to above  $1,000.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume a creditor defines a type of loan that includes two  distinct rate products. The median recording fee for one product is $80,  while the median recording fee for the other product is $130. This  definition of loan type would not satisfy the requirements of Sec.  1026.19(f)(3)(ii) because the cost characteristics of the two products  are dissimilar. However, a type of loan would be appropriately   defined if both products had a relatively normal distribution of  recording fees, even if the distribution for each product ranges from  below $80 to above $130.</p><p class="depth0">3. Uniform use. If a creditor chooses to use an average charge for a  settlement service for a particular loan within a class, Sec.  1026.19(f)(3)(ii)(C) requires the creditor to use that average charge  for that service on all loans within the class. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume a creditor elects to use an average charge for appraisal  fees. The creditor defines a class of transactions as all fixed rate  loans originated between January 1 and April 30 secured by real property  located within a particular metropolitan statistical area. The creditor  must then charge the average appraisal charge to all consumers obtaining  fixed rate loans originated between May 1 and August 30 secured by real  property located within the same metropolitan statistical area.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The example in paragraph i of this comment assumes that a  consumer would not be required to pay the average appraisal charge  unless an appraisal was required on that particular loan. Using the  example above, if a consumer applies for a loan within the defined  class, but already has an appraisal report acceptable to the creditor  from a prior loan application, the creditor may not charge the consumer  the average appraisal fee because an acceptable appraisal report has  already been obtained for the consumer's application. Similarly,  although the creditor defined the class broadly to include all fixed  rate loans, the creditor may not require the consumer to pay the average  appraisal charge if the particular fixed rate loan program the consumer  applied for does not require an appraisal.</p><p class="depth0">4. Average amount paid. The average charge must correspond to the  average amount paid by or imposed on consumers and sellers during the  prior defined time period. For example, assume a creditor calculates an  average tax certification fee based on four-month periods starting  January 1 of each year. The tax certification fees charged to a consumer  on May 20 may not exceed the average tax certification fee paid from  January 1 through April 30. A creditor may delay the period by a  reasonable amount of time if such delay is needed to perform the  necessary analysis and update the affected systems, provided that each  subsequent period is scheduled accordingly. For example, a creditor may  define a four-month period from January 1 to April 30 and begin using  the average charge from that period on May 15, provided the average  charge is used until September 15, at which time the average charge for  the period from May 1 to August 31 becomes effective.</p><p class="depth0">5. Adjustments based on retrospective analysis required. Creditors  using average charges must ensure that the total amount paid by or  imposed on consumers for a service does not exceed the total amount paid  to the providers of that service for the particular class of  transactions. A creditor may find that, even though it developed an  average-cost pricing program in accordance with the requirements of  Sec. 1026.19(f)(3)(ii), over time it has collected more from consumers  than it has paid to settlement service providers. For example, assume a  creditor defines a class of transactions and uses that class to develop  an average charge of $135 for pest inspections. The creditor then  charges $135 per transaction for 100 transactions from January 1 through  April 30, but the actual average cost to the creditor of pest  inspections during this period is $115. The creditor then decreases the  average charge for the May to August period to account for the lower  average cost during the January to April period. At this point, the  creditor has collected $2,000 more than it has paid to settlement  service providers for pest inspections. The creditor then charges $115  per transaction for 70 transactions from May 1 to August 30, but the  actual average cost to the creditor of pest inspections during this  period is $125. Based on the average cost to the creditor from the May  to August period, the average charge to the consumer for the September  to December period should be $125. However, while the creditor spent  $700 more than it collected during the May to August period, it  collected $1,300 more than it spent from January to August. In cases  such as these, the creditor remains responsible for ensuring that the  amount collected from consumers does not exceed the total amounts paid  for the corresponding settlement services over time. The creditor may  develop a variety of methods that achieve this outcome. For example, the  creditor may choose to refund the proportional overage paid to the  affected consumers. Or the creditor may choose to factor in the excess  amount collected to decrease the average charge for an upcoming period.  Although any method may comply with this requirement, a creditor is  deemed to have complied if it defines a six-month time period and  establishes a rolling monthly period of reevaluation. For example,  assume a creditor defines a six-month time period from January 1 to June  30 and the creditor uses the average charge starting July 1. If, at the  end of July, the creditor recalculates the average cost from February 1  to July 31, and then uses the recalculated average cost for transactions  starting August 1, the creditor complies with the requirements of Sec.  1026.19(f)(3)(ii), even if the creditor actually collected more from  consumers than was paid to providers over time.</p><p class="depth0">6. Adjustments based on prospective analysis permitted, but not  required. A creditor may prospectively adjust average charges if it  develops a statistically reliable and accurate method for doing so. For  example, assume a   creditor calculates average charges based on two time periods: winter  (October 1 to March 31), and summer (April 1 to September 30). If the  creditor can demonstrate that the average cost of a particular  settlement service is always at least 15 percent more expensive during  the winter period than the summer period, the creditor may increase the  average charge for the next winter period by 15 percent over the average  cost for the current summer period, provided, however, that the creditor  performs retrospective periodic adjustments, as explained in comment  19(f)(3)(ii)-5.</p><p class="depth0">7. Charges that vary with loan amount or property value. An average  charge may not be used for any charge that varies according to the loan  amount or property value. For example, an average charge may not be used  for a transfer tax if the transfer tax is calculated as a percentage of  the loan amount or property value. Average charges also may not be used  for any insurance premium. For example, average charges may not be used  for title insurance or for either the upfront premium or initial escrow  deposit for hazard insurance.</p><p class="depth0">8. Prohibited by law. An average charge may not be used where  prohibited by any applicable State or local law. For example, a creditor  may not impose an average charge for an appraisal if applicable law  prohibits creditors from collecting any amount in excess of the actual  cost of the appraisal.</p><p class="depth0">9. Documentation required. To comply with Sec. 1026.25, a creditor  must retain all documentation used to calculate the average charge for a  particular class of transactions for at least three years after any  settlement for which that average charge was used. The documentation  must support the components and methods of calculation. For example, if  a creditor calculates an average charge for a particular county  recording fee by simply averaging all of the relevant fees paid in the  prior month, the creditor need only retain the receipts for the  individual recording fees, a ledger demonstrating that the total amount  received did not exceed the total amount paid over time, and a document  detailing the calculation. However, if a creditor develops complex  algorithms for determining averages, not only must the creditor maintain  the underlying receipts and ledgers, but the creditor must maintain  documentation sufficiently detailed to allow an examiner to verify the  accuracy of the calculations.</p><p class="depth0">19(f)(4) Transactions involving a seller.</p><p class="depth0">19(f)(4)(i) Provision to seller.</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirement. Section 1026.19(f)(4)(i) provides that, in a closed- end consumer credit transaction secured by real property that involves a  seller, other than a reverse mortgage subject to Sec. 1026.33, the  settlement agent shall provide the seller with the disclosures in Sec.  1026.38 that relate to the seller's transaction reflecting the actual  terms of the seller's transaction. The settlement agent complies with  this provision by providing a copy of the Closing Disclosure provided to  the consumer, if it also contains the information under Sec. 1026.38  relating to the seller's transaction, or alternatively providing the  disclosures under Sec. 1026.38(t)(5)(v) or (vi), as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">19(f)(4)(ii) Timing.</p><p class="depth0">1. Requirement. Section 1026.19(f)(4)(ii) provides that the  settlement agent shall provide the disclosures required under Sec.  1026.19(f)(4)(i) no later than the day of consummation. If during the  30-day period following consummation, an event in connection with the  settlement of the transaction occurs that causes such disclosures to  become inaccurate and such inaccuracy results in a change to the amount  actually paid by the seller from that amount disclosed under Sec.  1026.19(f)(4)(i), the settlement agent shall deliver or place in the  mail corrected disclosures not later than 30 days after receiving  information sufficient to establish that such event has occurred.  Section 1026.19(f)(4)(i) requires disclosure of the items that relate to  the seller's transaction. Thus, the settlement agent need only  redisclose if an item related to the seller's transaction becomes  inaccurate and such inaccuracy results in a change to the amount  actually paid by the seller. For example, assume a transaction where the  seller pays the transfer tax, the consummation occurs on Monday, and the  security instrument is recorded on Tuesday, the day after consummation.  If the settlement agent receives information on Tuesday sufficient to  establish that transfer taxes owed to the State differ from those  disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(f)(4)(i), the settlement agent  complies with Sec. 1026.19(f)(4)(ii) by revising the disclosures  accordingly and delivering or placing them in the mail not later than 30  days after Tuesday. See comment 19(e)(4)(i)-1 for guidance on when  sufficient information has been received to establish an event has  occurred.

If the creditor or servicer provides the disclosures required  by Sec. 1026.20(e)(2) by mail, the consumer is considered to have  received them three business days after they are placed in the mail for  purposes of determining when the waiting periods required by Sec.  1026.20(e)(5)(i) and (ii) begins.

Repayment terms may be expressed in  a variety of ways in addition to an exact repayment schedule; this is  particularly true for advertisements that do not contemplate a single  specific transaction. Repayment terms, however, must reflect the  consumer's repayment obligations over the full term of the loan,  including any balloon payment, see comment 24(d)(2)-3, not just the  repayment terms that will apply for a limited period of time.

The creditor  making the disclosures, however, must be identified as the creditor for  purposes of Sec. 1026.37(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0">2. Mortgage broker as loan originator. In transactions involving a  mortgage broker, the name and address of the creditor must be disclosed,  if known, even if the mortgage broker provides the disclosures to the  consumer under Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(ii). As required by Sec.  1026.19(e)(1)(i), the mortgage broker must make a good faith effort to  disclose the name and address of the creditor, but if the name of the  creditor is not yet known, the disclosure required by Sec.  1026.37(a)(3) may be left blank. See comment 37-1.</p><p class="depth0">37(a)(4) Date issued.</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicable date. Section 1026.37(a)(4) requires disclosure of the  date the creditor mails or delivers the Loan Estimate to the consumer.  The creditor's method of delivery does not affect the date issued. For  example, if the creditor hand delivers the Loan Estimate to the consumer  on August 14, or if the creditor places the Loan Estimate in the mail on  August 14, the date disclosed under Sec. 1026.37(a)(4) is August 14.</p><p class="depth0">2. Mortgage broker as loan originator. In transactions involving a  mortgage broker, the date disclosed is the date the mortgage broker  mails or delivers the Loan Estimate to the consumer, because pursuant to  Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(ii), the mortgage broker is required to comply with  all relevant requirements of Sec. 1026.19(e).</p><p class="depth0">37(a)(5) Applicants.</p><p class="depth0">1. Multiple consumers. If there is more than one consumer applying  for the credit, Sec. 1026.37(a)(5) requires disclosure of the name and  the mailing address of each consumer to whom the Loan Estimate will be  delivered. If the names and mailing addresses of all consumers applying  for the credit do not fit in the space allocated on the Loan Estimate,  an additional page with that information may be appended to the end of  the form. For additional information on permissible changes, see Sec.  1026.37(o)(5) and its commentary.</p><p class="depth0">37(a)(6) Property.</p><p class="depth0">1. Alternate property address. Section 1026.37(a)(6) requires  disclosure of the address including the zip code of the property that  secures or will secure the transaction. A creditor complies with Sec.  1026.37(a)(6) by disclosing a complete address for purposes of the U.S.  Postal Service. If the address is unavailable, a creditor complies with  Sec. 1026.37(a)(6) by disclosing the location of such property  including a zip code, which is   required in all instances. Location of the property under Sec.  1026.37(a)(6) includes location information, such as a lot number. The  disclosure of multiple zip codes is permitted if the consumer is  investigating home purchase opportunities in multiple zip codes.</p><p class="depth0">2. Personal property. Where personal property also secures the  credit transaction, a description of that property may be disclosed, at  the creditor's option pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(a)(6), if a description  fits in the space provided on form H-24 for the disclosure required by  Sec. 1026.37(a)(6). An additional page may not be appended to the form  to disclose a description of personal property.</p><p class="depth0">3. Multiple properties. Where more than one property secures the  credit transaction, Sec. 1026.37(a)(6) requires disclosure of all  properties. If the addresses of all properties securing the transaction  do not fit in the space allocated on the Loan Estimate, an additional  page with that information with respect to real properties may be  appended to the end of the form.</p><p class="depth0">37(a)(7) Sale price.</p><p class="depth0">1. Estimated property value. In transactions where there is no  seller, such as in a refinancing, Sec. 1026.37(a)(7)(ii) requires the  creditor to disclose the estimated value of the property identified in  Sec. 1026.37(a)(6) at the time the disclosure is issued to the  consumer. The creditor may use the estimate provided by the consumer at  application, or if it has performed its own estimate of the property  value by the time the disclosure is provided to the consumer, use that  estimate. If the creditor has obtained any appraisals or valuations of  the property for the application at the time the disclosure is issued to  the consumer, the value determined by the appraisal or valuation to be  used during underwriting for the application is disclosed as the  estimated property value. If the creditor has obtained multiple  appraisals or valuations and has not yet determined which one will be  used during underwriting, it may disclose the value from any appraisal  or valuation it reasonably believes it may use in underwriting the  transaction. In a transaction that involves a seller, if the sale price  is not yet known, the creditor complies with Sec. 1026.37(a)(7) if it  discloses the estimated value of the property that it used as the basis  for the disclosures in the Loan Estimate.</p><p class="depth0">2. Personal property. In transactions involving personal property  that is separately valued from real property, only the value of the real  property is disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(a)(7). Where personal  property is included in the sale price of the real property (for  example, if the consumer is purchasing the furniture inside the  dwelling), however, Sec. 1026.37(a)(7) permits disclosure of the  aggregate price without any reduction for the appraised or estimated  value of the personal property.</p><p class="depth0">37(a)(8) Loan term.</p><p class="depth0">1. Partial years.</p><p class="depth0">i. Terms to maturity of 24 months or more. Section 1026.37(a)(8)  requires disclosure of the term to maturity in years, or months, or  both, as applicable. Where the term exceeds 24 months and equals a whole  number of years, a creditor complies with Sec. 1026.37(a)(8) by  disclosing the number of years, followed by the designation ``years.''  Where the term exceeds 24 months but does not equal a whole number of  years, a creditor complies with Sec. 1026.37(a)(8) by disclosing the  term to maturity as the number of years followed by the designation  ``yr.'' and the remaining number of months, followed by the designation  ``mo.'' For example, if the term to maturity of the transaction is 185  months, the correct disclosure would be ``15 yr. 5 mo.''</p><p class="depth0">ii. Terms to maturity of less than 24 months. If the term to  maturity is less than 24 months and does not equal a whole number of  years, a creditor complies with Sec. 1026.37(a)(8) by disclosing the  number of months only, followed by the designation ``mo.'' For example,  if the term to maturity of a transaction is six months or 16 months, it  would be disclosed as ``6 mo.'' or ``16 mo.,'' respectively. If the term  to maturity is 12 months, however it would be disclosed simply as ``1  year.''</p><p class="depth0">2. Adjustable loan term. Section 1026.37(a)(8) requires disclosure  of the term to maturity of the credit transaction. If the term to  maturity is adjustable, i.e., it is not known with certainty at  consummation, the creditor complies with Sec. 1026.37(a)(8), if it  discloses the possible range of the loan term, including the maximum  number of years possible under the terms of the legal obligation. For  example, if the loan term depends on the value of interest rate  adjustments during the term of the loan, to calculate the maximum loan  term, the creditor assumes that the interest rate rises as rapidly as  possible after consummation, taking into account the terms of the legal  obligation, including any applicable caps on interest rate adjustments  and lifetime interest rate cap.</p><p class="depth0">37(a)(9) Purpose.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. Section 1026.37(a)(9) requires disclosure of the  consumer's intended use of the credit. In ascertaining the consumer's  intended use, Sec. 1026.37(a)(9) requires the creditor to consider all  relevant information known to the creditor at the time of the  disclosure. If the purpose is not known, the creditor may rely on the  consumer's stated purpose. The following examples illustrate when each  of the permissible purposes should be disclosed:</p><p class="depth0">i. Purchase. The consumer intends to use the proceeds from the  transaction to purchase the property that will secure the extension of  credit.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Refinance. The consumer refinances an existing obligation  already secured by the   consumer's dwelling to change the rate, term, or other loan features and  may or may not receive cash from the transaction. For example, in a  refinance with no cash provided, the new amount financed does not exceed  the unpaid principal balance, any earned unpaid finance charge on the  existing debt, and amounts attributed solely to the costs of the  refinancing. Conversely, in a refinance with cash provided, the consumer  refinances an existing mortgage obligation and receives money from the  transaction that is in addition to the funds used to pay the unpaid  principal balance, any earned unpaid finance charge on the existing  debt, and amounts attributed solely to the costs of the refinancing. In  such a transaction, the consumer may, for example, use the newly- extended credit to pay off the balance of the existing mortgage and  other consumer debt, such as a credit card balance.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Construction. Section 1026.37(a)(9)(iii) requires the creditor  to disclose that the loan is for construction in transactions where the  creditor extends credit to finance only the cost of initial construction  (construction-only loan), not renovations to existing dwellings, and in  transactions where a multiple advance loan may be permanently financed  by the same creditor (construction-to-permanent loan). In a  construction-only loan, the borrower may be required to make interest  only payments during the loan term with the balance commonly due at the  end of the construction project. For additional guidance on disclosing  construction-to-permanent loans, see Sec. 1026.17(c)(6)(ii), comments  17(c)(6)-2 and -3, and appendix D to this part.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Home equity loan. The creditor is required to disclose that the  credit is for a ``home equity loan'' if the creditor intends to extend  credit for any purpose other than a purchase, refinancing, or  construction. This disclosure applies whether the loan is secured by a  first or subordinate lien.</p><p class="depth0">2. Refinance coverage. The disclosure requirements under Sec.  1026.37(a)(9)(ii) apply to credit transactions that meet the definition  of a refinancing under Sec. 1026.20(a) but without regard to whether  they are made by a creditor, holder, or servicer of the existing  obligation. Section 1026.20(a) applies only to refinancings undertaken  by the original creditor or a holder or servicer of the original debt.  See comment 20(a)-5.</p><p class="depth0">37(a)(10) Product.</p><p class="depth0">1. No features. If the loan product disclosed pursuant to Sec.  1026.37(a)(10) does not include any of the features described in Sec.  1026.37(a)(10)(ii), only the product type and introductory and first  adjustment periods, if applicable, are disclosed. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Adjustable rate. When disclosing an adjustable rate product, the  disclosure of the loan product must be preceded by the length of the  introductory period and the frequency of the first adjustment period  thereafter. Thus, for example, if the loan product is an adjustable rate  with an introductory rate that is fixed for the first five years of the  loan term and then adjusts every three years starting in year six, the  disclosure required by Sec. 1026.37(a)(10) is ``5/3 Adjustable Rate.''  If the first adjustment period is not the period for all adjustments  under the terms of the legal obligation, the creditor should still  disclose the initial adjustment period and should not disclose other  adjustment periods. For example, if the loan product is an adjustable  rate with an introductory rate that is fixed for the first five years of  the loan term and then adjusts every three years starting in year six,  and then annually starting in year fifteen, the disclosure required by  Sec. 1026.37(a)(10) would still be ``5/3 Adjustable Rate.''</p><p class="depth0">A. No introductory period. If the loan product is an adjustable rate  with no introductory rate, the creditor should disclose ``0'' where the  introductory rate period would ordinarily be disclosed. For example, if  the loan product is an adjustable rate that adjusts every three years  with no introductory period, the disclosure required by Sec.  1026.37(a)(10) is ``0/3 Adjustable Rate.''</p><p class="depth0">B. Introductory period not yet known. If the loan product is an  adjustable rate with an introductory period that is not yet known at the  time of delivery of the Loan Estimate, the creditor should disclose the  shortest potential introductory period for the particular loan product  offered. For example, if the loan product is an adjustable rate with an  introductory period that may be between 36 and 48 months and the rate  would then adjust every year, the disclosure required by Sec.  1026.37(a)(10) is ``3/1 Adjustable Rate.''</p><p class="depth0">ii. Step rate. If the loan product is a step rate with an  introductory interest rate that lasts for ten years and adjusts every  year thereafter for the next five years, and then adjusts every three  years for the next 15 years, the disclosure required by Sec.  1026.37(a)(10) is ``10/1 Step Rate.'' If the loan product is a step rate  with no introductory rate, the creditor should disclose ``0'' where the  introductory rate period would ordinarily be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Fixed rate. If the loan product is not an adjustable rate or a  step rate, as described in Sec. 1026.37(a)(10)(i)(A) and (B), even if  an additional feature described in Sec. 1026.37(a)(10)(ii) may change  the consumer's periodic payment, the disclosure required by Sec.  1026.37(a)(10)(i) is ``Fixed Rate.''</p><p class="depth0">2. Additional features. When disclosing a loan product with at least  one of the features described in Sec. 1026.37(a)(10)(ii), Sec.  1026.37(a)(10)(iii) and (iv) require the disclosure of only the first  applicable feature in the order of Sec. 1026.37(a)(10)(ii) and that it  be preceded by the time period or the length of the introductory period  and the frequency of   the first adjustment period, as applicable, followed by a description of  the loan product and its time period as provided for in Sec.  1026.37(a)(10)(i). For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Negative amortization. Some loan products, such as ``payment  option'' loans, permit the borrower to make payments that are  insufficient to cover all of the interest accrued, and the unpaid  interest is added to the principal balance. Where the loan product  includes a loan feature that may cause the loan balance to increase, the  disclosure required by Sec. 1026.37(a)(10)(ii)(A) is preceded by the  time period that the borrower is permitted to make payments that result  in negative amortization (e.g., ``2 Year Negative Amortization''),  followed by the loan product type. Thus, a fixed rate product with a  step-payment feature for the first two years of the legal obligation  that may negatively amortize is disclosed as ``2 Year Negative  Amortization, Fixed Rate.''</p><p class="depth0">ii. Interest only. When disclosing an ``Interest Only'' feature, as  that term is defined in Sec. 1026.18(s)(7)(iv), the applicable time  period must precede the label ``Interest Only.'' Thus, a fixed rate loan  with only interest due for the first five years of the loan term is  disclosed as ``5 Year Interest Only, Fixed Rate.'' If the interest only  feature fails to cover the total interest due then, as required by Sec.  1026.37(a)(10)(iii), the disclosure must reference the negative  amortization feature and not the interest only feature (i.e., ``5 Year  Negative Amortization, Fixed Rate'').</p><p class="depth0">iii. Step payment. When disclosing a step payment feature (which is  sometimes referred to instead as a graduated payment), the period of  time at the end of which the scheduled payments will change must precede  the label ``Step Payment'' (e.g., ``5 Year Step Payment'') followed by  the name of the loan product. Thus, a fixed rate mortgage subject to a  5-year step payment plan is disclosed as a ``5 Year Step Payment, Fixed  Rate.''</p><p class="depth0">iv. Balloon payment. If a loan product includes a ``balloon  payment,'' as that term is defined in Sec. 1026.37(b)(5), the  disclosure of the balloon payment feature, including the year the  payment is due, precedes the disclosure of the loan product. Thus, if  the loan product is a step rate with an introductory rate that lasts for  three years and adjusts each year thereafter until the balloon payment  is due in the seventh year of the loan term, the disclosure required is  ``Year 7 Balloon Payment, 3/1 Step Rate.'' If the loan product includes  more than one balloon payment, only the earliest year that a balloon  payment is due shall be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">v. Seasonal payment. If a loan product includes a seasonal payment  feature, Sec. 1026.37(a)(10)(ii)(E) requires that the creditor disclose  the feature. The feature is not, however, required to be disclosed with  any preceding time period. Disclosure of the label ``Seasonal Payment''  without any preceding number of years satisfies this requirement.</p><p class="depth0">3. Periods not in whole years.</p><p class="depth0">i. Terms of 24 months or more. For product types and features that  have introductory periods or adjustment periods that do not equate to a  number of whole years, if the period is a number of months that is 24 or  greater and does not equate to a whole number of years, Sec.  1026.37(a)(10) requires disclosure of the whole number of years followed  by a decimal point with the remaining months rounded to two places. For  example, if the loan product is an adjustable rate with an introductory  period of 30 months that adjusts every year thereafter, the creditor  would be required to disclose ``2.5/1 Adjustable Rate.'' If the  introductory period were 31 months, the required disclosure would be  2.58/1 Adjustable Rate.''</p><p class="depth0">ii. Terms of less than 24 months. For product types and features  that have introductory periods or adjustment periods that do not equate  to a number of whole years, if the period is less than 24 months, Sec.  1026.37(a)(10) requires disclosure of the number of months, followed by  the designation ``mo.'' For example, if the product type is an  adjustable rate with an 18-month introductory period that adjusts every  18 months starting in the 19th month, the required disclosure would be  ``18 mo./18mo. Adjustable Rate.''</p><p class="depth0">iii. Adjustments more frequent than monthly. For adjustment periods  that change more frequently than monthly, Sec. 1026.37(a)(10) requires  disclosure of the applicable unit-period, such as daily, weekly, or bi- weekly. For example, for an adjustable rate construction loan with no  introductory fixed rate period where the interest rate adjusts every  seven days, the disclosure required by Sec. 1026.37(a)(10) is ``0/ Weekly Adjustable Rate.''</p><p class="depth0">37(a)(11) Loan type.</p><p class="depth0">1. Other. If the transaction is a type other than a conventional,  FHA, or VA loan, Sec. 1026.37(a)(11)(iv) requires the creditor to  disclose the loan type as ``Other'' and provide a name or brief  description of the loan type. For example, a loan that is guaranteed or  funded by the Federal government under the Rural Housing Service (RHS)  of the U.S. Department of Agriculture is required to be disclosed under  the subcategory ``Other.'' Section 1026.37(a)(11)(iv) requires a brief  description of the loan type (e.g., ``RHS''). A loan that is insured or  guaranteed by a State agency must also be disclosed as ``Other.''</p><p class="depth0">37(a)(12) Loan identification number (Loan ID # ).</p><p class="depth0">1. Unique identifier. Section 1026.37(a)(12) requires that the  creditor disclose a loan identification number that may be used by the  creditor, consumer, and other parties to identify the transaction,  labeled as ``Loan ID  .'' The loan identification number is  determined by the creditor, which number may   contain any alpha-numeric characters. Because the number must allow for  the identification of the particular credit transaction under Sec.  1026.37(a)(12), a creditor must use a unique loan identification number,  i.e., the creditor may not use the same loan identification number for  different, but related, loan transactions (such as different loans to  the same borrower). Where a creditor issues a revised Loan Estimate for  a transaction, the loan identification number must be sufficient to  enable identification of the transaction pursuant to Sec.  1026.37(a)(12).</p><p class="depth0">37(a)(13) Rate lock.</p><p class="depth0">1. Interest rate. For purposes of Sec. 1026.37(a)(13), the interest  rate is locked for a specific period of time if the creditor has agreed  to extend credit to the consumer at a given rate, subject to  contingencies that are described in any rate lock agreement between the  creditor and consumer.</p><p class="depth0">2. Expiration date. The disclosure required by Sec.  1026.37(a)(13)(ii) related to estimated closing costs is required  regardless of whether the interest rate is locked for a specific period  of time or whether the terms and costs are otherwise accepted or  extended.</p><p class="depth0">3. Time zone. The disclosure required by Sec. 1026.37(a)(13)  requires the applicable time zone for all times provided, as determined  by the creditor. For example, if the creditor is located in New York and  determines that the Loan Estimate will expire at 5:00 p.m. in the time  zone applicable to its location, while standard time is in effect, the  disclosure must include a reference to the Eastern time zone (i.e., 5:00  p.m. EST).</p><p class="depth0">37(b) Loan terms.</p><p class="depth0">1. Legal obligation. The disclosures required by Sec. 1026.37 must  reflect good faith estimates of the credit terms to which the parties  will be legally bound for the transaction. Accordingly, if certain terms  of the transaction are known or reasonably available to the creditor,  based on information such as the consumer's selection of a product type  or other information in the consumer's application, Sec. 1026.37  requires the creditor to disclose those credit terms. For example, if  the consumer selects a product type with a prepayment penalty, Sec.  1026.37(b)(4) requires disclosure of the maximum amount of the  prepayment penalty and period in which the prepayment penalty may be  charged as known to the creditor at the time the disclosures are  provided.</p><p class="depth0">37(b)(2) Interest rate.</p><p class="depth0">1. Interest rate at consummation not known. Where the interest rate  that will apply at consummation is not known at the time the creditor  must deliver the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(e), Sec.  1026.37(b)(2) requires disclosure of the fully-indexed rate, defined as  the index plus the margin at consummation. Although Sec. 1026.37(b)(2)  refers to the index plus margin ``at consummation,'' if the index value  that will be in effect at consummation is unknown at the time the  disclosures are provided pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(iii), i.e.,  within three business days after receipt of a consumer's application,  the fully-indexed rate disclosed under Sec. 1026.37(b)(2) may be based  on the index in effect at the time the disclosure is delivered. The  index in effect at consummation (or the time the disclosure is delivered  pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(e)) need not be used if the contract provides  for a delay in the implementation of changes in an index value. For  example, if the contract specifies that rate changes are based on the  index value in effect 45 days before the change date, creditors may use  any index value in effect during the 45 days before consummation (or any  earlier date of disclosure) in calculating the fully-indexed rate to be  disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">37(b)(3) Principal and interest payment.</p><p class="depth0">1. Frequency of principal and interest payment. Pursuant to Sec.  1026.37(o)(5)(i), if the contract provides for a unit-period, as defined  in appendix J to this part, of a month, such as a monthly payment  schedule, the payment disclosed under Sec. 1026.37(b)(3) should be  labeled ``Monthly Principal & Interest.'' If the contract requires bi- weekly payments of principal or interest, the payment should be labeled  ``Bi-Weekly Principal & Interest.'' If a creditor voluntarily permits a  payment schedule not provided for in the contract, such as an informal  principal-reduction arrangement, the disclosure should reflect only the  payment frequency provided for in the contract. See Sec. 1026.17(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0">2. Initial periodic payment if not known. Pursuant to Sec.  1026.37(b)(3), the initial periodic payment amount that will be due  under the terms of the legal obligation must be disclosed. If the  initial periodic payment is not known because it will be based on an  interest rate at consummation that is not known at the time the  disclosures required by Sec. 1026.19(e) must be provided, for example  if it is based on an external index that may fluctuate before  consummation, Sec. 1026.37(b)(3) requires that the disclosure be based  on the fully-indexed rate disclosed under Sec. 1026.37(b)(2). See  comment 37(b)(2)-1 for guidance regarding calculating the fully-indexed  rate.</p><p class="depth0">37(b)(4) Prepayment penalty.</p><p class="depth0">1. Transaction includes a prepayment penalty. Section 1026.37(b)(4)  requires disclosure of a statement of whether the transaction includes a  prepayment penalty. If the transaction includes a prepayment penalty,  Sec. 1026.37(b)(7) sets forth the information that must be disclosed  under Sec. 1026.37(b)(4) (i.e., the maximum amount of the prepayment  penalty that may be imposed under the terms of the loan contract and the  date on which the penalty will no longer be imposed). For an example of  such disclosure, see form H-24 of appendix H to this part. The  disclosure under Sec. 1026.37(b)(4) applies to   transactions where the terms of the loan contract provide for a  prepayment penalty, even though the creditor does not know at the time  of the disclosure whether the consumer will, in fact, make a payment to  the creditor that would cause imposition of the penalty. For example, if  the monthly interest accrual amortization method described in comment  37(b)(4)-2.i is used such that interest is assessed on the balance for a  full month even if the consumer makes a full prepayment before the end  of the month, the transaction includes a prepayment penalty that must be  disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(b)(4).</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples of prepayment penalties. For purposes of Sec.  1026.37(b)(4), the following are examples of prepayment penalties:</p><p class="depth0">i. A charge determined by treating the loan balance as outstanding  for a period of time after prepayment in full and applying the interest  rate to such ``balance,'' even if the charge results from interest  accrual amortization used for other payments in the transaction under  the terms of the loan contract. ``Interest accrual amortization'' refers  to the method by which the amount of interest due for each period (e.g.,  month) in a transaction's term is determined. For example, ``monthly  interest accrual amortization'' treats each payment as made on the  scheduled, monthly due date even if it is actually paid early or late  (until the expiration of any grace period). Thus, under the terms of a  loan contract providing for monthly interest accrual amortization, if  the amount of interest due on May 1 for the preceding month of April is  $3,000, the loan contract will require payment of $3,000 in interest for  the month of April whether the payment is made on April 20, on May 1, or  on May 10. In this example, if the consumer prepays the loan in full on  April 20 and if the accrued interest as of that date is $2,000, then  assessment of a charge of $3,000 constitutes a prepayment penalty of  $1,000 because the amount of interest actually earned through April 20  is only $2,000.</p><p class="depth0">ii. A fee, such as an origination or other loan closing cost, that  is waived by the creditor on the condition that the consumer does not  prepay the loan. See comment 37(b)(4)-3.iii below for additional  guidance regarding waived bona fide third-party charges imposed by the  creditor if the consumer pays all of a covered transaction's principal  before the date on which the principal is due sooner than 36 months  after consummation.</p><p class="depth0">iii. A minimum finance charge in a simple interest transaction.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Computing a refund of unearned interest by a method that is less  favorable to the consumer than the actuarial method, as defined by  section 933(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, 15  U.S.C. 1615(d). For purposes of computing a refund of unearned interest,  if using the actuarial method defined by applicable State law results in  a refund that is greater than the refund calculated by using the method  described in section 933(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act  of 1992, creditors should use the State law definition in determining if  a refund is a prepayment penalty.</p><p class="depth0">3. Fees that are not prepayment penalties. For purposes of Sec.  1026.37(b)(4), fees that are not prepayment penalties include, for  example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Fees imposed for preparing and providing documents when a loan is  paid in full, if such fees are imposed whether or not the loan is  prepaid.

Loan guarantee fees.</p><p class="depth0">iii. A waived bona fide third-party charge imposed by the creditor  if the consumer pays all of a covered transaction's principal before the  date on which the principal is due sooner than 36 months after  consummation. For example, assume that at consummation, the creditor  waives $3,000 in closing costs to cover bona fide third-party charges  but the terms of the loan agreement provide that the creditor may recoup  the $3,000 in waived charges if the consumer repays the entire loan  balance sooner than 36 months after consummation. The $3,000 charge is  not a prepayment penalty. In contrast, for example, assume that at  consummation, the creditor waives $3,000 in closing costs to cover bona  fide third-party charges but the terms of the loan agreement provide  that the creditor may recoup $4,500 in part to recoup waived charges, if  the consumer repays the entire loan balance sooner than 36 months after  consummation. The $3,000 that the creditor may impose to cover the  waived bona fide third-party charges is not a prepayment penalty, but  the additional $1,500 charge is a prepayment penalty and must be  disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(b)(4).</p><p class="depth0">4. Rebate of finance charge. For an obligation that includes a  finance charge that does not take into account each reduction in the  principal balance of the obligation, the disclosure under Sec.  1026.37(b)(4) reflects whether or not the consumer is entitled to a  rebate of any finance charge if the obligation is prepaid in full or  part. Finance charges that do not take into account each reduction in  the principal balance of an obligation may include precomputed finance  charges. If any portion of an unearned precomputed finance charge will  not be provided as a rebate upon full prepayment, the disclosure  required by Sec. 1026.37(b)(4) will be an affirmative answer, indicate  the maximum amount of such precomputed finance charge that may not be  provided as a rebate to the consumer upon any prepayment, and state when  the period   during which a full rebate would not be provided terminates, as required  by Sec. 1026.37(b)(7). If, instead, there will be a full rebate of the  precomputed finance charge and no other prepayment penalty imposed on  the consumer, to comply with the requirements of Sec. 1026.37(b)(4) and  (7), the creditor states a negative answer only. If the transaction  involves both a precomputed finance charge and a finance charge computed  by application of a rate to an unpaid balance, disclosure about both the  entitlement to any rebate of the finance charge upon prepayment and any  other prepayment penalty are made as one disclosure under Sec.  1026.37(b)(4), stating one affirmative or negative answer and an  aggregated amount and time period for the information required by Sec.  1026.37(b)(7). For example, if in such a transaction, a portion of the  precomputed finance charge will not be provided as a rebate and the loan  contract also provides for a prepayment penalty based on the amount  prepaid, both disclosures are made under Sec. 1026.37(b)(4) as one  aggregate amount, stating the maximum amount and time period under Sec.  1026.37(b)(7). If the transaction instead provides a rebate of the  precomputed finance charge upon prepayment, but imposes a prepayment  penalty based on the amount prepaid, to comply with Sec. 1026.37(b)(4),  the creditor states an affirmative answer and the information about the  prepayment penalty, as required by Sec. 1026.37(b)(7).

If a payment is not itself a regular  periodic payment and is more than two times any one regular periodic  payment during the loan term, then it is disclosed as a balloon payment  under Sec. 1026.37(b)(5). The regular periodic payments used to  determine whether a payment is a balloon payment under Sec.  1026.37(b)(5) are the payments of principal and interest (or interest  only, depending on the loan features) specified under the terms of the  loan contract that are due from the consumer for two or more unit- periods in succession. All regular periodic payments during the loan  term are used to determine whether a particular payment is a balloon  payment, regardless of whether the regular periodic payments have  changed during the loan term due to rate adjustments or other payment  changes permitted or required under the loan contract.</p><p class="depth0">i. For example, assume that, under a 15-year step rate mortgage, the  loan contract provides for scheduled monthly payments of $300 each  during the years one through three and scheduled monthly payments of  $700 each during years four through 15. If an irregular payment of  $1,000 is scheduled during the final month of year 15, that payment is  disclosed as a balloon payment under Sec. 1026.37(b)(5), because it is  more than two times the regular periodic payment amount of $300 during  years one through three. This is the case even though the irregular  payment is not more than two times the regular periodic payment of $700  per month during years four through fifteen. The $700 monthly payments  during years four through fifteen are not balloon payments even though  they are more than two times the regular periodic payments during years  one through three, because they are regular periodic payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> the loan contract requires monthly payments of $300 during  years one through five, (2) the loan contract permits interest rate  increases every three years starting in the sixth year up to the fully- indexed rate, subject to caps on interest rate adjustments specified in  the loan contract, (3) based on the application of the interest rate  adjustment caps, the interest rate may increase to the fully-indexed  rate starting in year nine, and (4) the monthly payment based on the  fully-indexed rate is $700. The regular periodic payments during years  one through five are $300 per month, because they are known and  scheduled. The regular periodic payments during years six through eight  are up to $700 per month, based on the fully-indexed rate but subject to  the application of interest rate adjustment caps specified under the  loan contract. The regular periodic payments during years nine through  thirty are $700, based on the fully-indexed rate. Therefore, if an  irregular payment of $1,000 is scheduled during the final month of year  30, that payment is disclosed as a balloon payment under   Sec. 1026.37(b)(5), because it is more than two times the regular  periodic payment amount of $300 during years one through five. This is  the case even though the irregular payment is not more than two times  the regular periodic payment during years nine through thirty (i.e.,  based on the fully-indexed rate). However, the regular periodic payments  during years six through thirty themselves are not balloon payments,  even though they may be more than two times the regular periodic  payments during years one through five.</p><p class="depth0">iii. For a loan with a negative amortization feature, the regular  periodic payment does not take into account the possibility that the  consumer may exercise an option to make a payment greater than the  scheduled periodic payment specified under the terms of the loan  contract, if any.</p><p class="depth0">iv. A final payment that differs from other regular periodic  payments because of rounding to account for payment amounts including  fractions of cents is still a regular periodic payment and need not be  disclosed as a balloon payment under Sec. 1026.37(b)(5).</p><p class="depth0">v. The disclosure of balloon payments in the ``Projected Payments''  table under Sec. 1026.37(c) is governed by that section and its  commentary, rather than Sec. 1026.37(b)(5), except that the  determination, as a threshold matter, of whether a payment disclosed  under Sec. 1026.37(c) is a balloon payment is made in accordance with  Sec. 1026.37(b)(5) and its commentary.</p><p class="depth0">2. Single and double payment transactions. The definition of a  ``balloon payment'' under Sec. 1026.37(b)(5) includes the payments  under transactions that require only one or two payments during the loan  term, even though a single payment transaction does not require regular  periodic payments, and a transaction with only two scheduled payments  during the loan term may not require regular periodic payments.</p><p class="depth0">37(b)(6) Adjustments after consummation.</p><p class="depth0">1.

Additional information regarding increase in periodic payment. A  creditor complies with the requirement under Sec. 1026.37(b)(6)(iii) to  disclose additional information indicating the scheduled frequency of  adjustments to the periodic principal and interest payment by using the  phrases ``Adjusts every'' and ``starting in.'' A creditor complies with  the requirement under Sec. 1026.37(b)(6)(iii) to disclose additional  information indicating the maximum possible periodic principal and  interest payment, and the date when the periodic principal and interest  payment may first equal the maximum principal and interest payment by  using the phrase ``Can go as high as'' and then indicating the date at  the end of that phrase or for a scheduled maximum amount, such as under  a step payment loan, ``Goes as high as.'' A creditor complies with the  requirement under Sec. 1026.37(b)(6)(iii) to indicate that there is a  period during which only interest is required to be paid and the due  date of the last periodic payment of such period using the phrase  ``Includes only interest and no principal until.''

If there are multiple periods of adjustment under the terms  of the legal obligation, Sec. 1026.37(b)(6)(iii) requires disclosure of  the frequency of only the first adjustment to the periodic principal and  interest payment, regardless of the basis for the adjustment.  Accordingly, where the periodic principal and interest payment may  change because of more than one factor and such adjustments are on  different schedules, the frequency disclosed is the adjustment of  whichever factor adjusts first. For example, where the interest rate for  a transaction is fixed until year six and then adjusts every three years  but the transaction also has a negative amortization feature that ends  in year seven, Sec. 1026.37(b)(6)(iii) requires disclosure that the  interest rate will adjust every three years starting in year six because  the periodic principal and interest payment adjusts based on the  interest rate before it adjusts based on the end of the negative  amortization period.</p><p class="depth0">37(b)(7) Details about prepayment penalty and balloon payment.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 37(b)(7)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Maximum prepayment penalty. Section 1026.37(b)(7)(i) requires  disclosure of the maximum amount of the prepayment penalty that may be  imposed under the terms of the legal obligation. The creditor complies  with Sec. 1026.37(b)(7)(i) when it assumes that the consumer prepays at  a time when the prepayment penalty may be charged and that the consumer  makes all payments prior to the prepayment on a timely basis and in the  amount required by the terms of the legal obligation. The creditor must  determine the maximum of each amount used in calculating the prepayment  penalty. For example, if a transaction is fully amortizing and the  prepayment penalty is two percent of the loan balance at the time of  prepayment, the prepayment penalty amount should be determined by using  the highest loan balance possible during the period in which the penalty  may be imposed. If more than one type of prepayment penalty applies, the  creditor must aggregate the maximum amount of each type of prepayment  penalty in the maximum penalty disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">2.

See form H-24 of appendix H to this  part for the required format of such phrases, which is required for  federally related mortgage loans under Sec. 1026.37(o)(3).

For example, an interest rate that is fixed for five  years and can first adjust at the beginning of the 61st month from the  date that interest for the regularly scheduled periodic payment began to  accrue would be disclosed as beginning to adjust in ``year 6.'' A  monthly periodic payment that adjusts starting with the 61st scheduled  payment likewise would be disclosed as adjusting in ``year 6.''</p><p class="depth0">2. Periods not in whole years.

Periodic payments. For purposes of Sec. 1026.37(c)(1)(i), the  periodic payment is the regularly scheduled payment of principal and  interest, mortgage insurance premiums, and escrow payments described in  Sec. 1026.37(c)(2) without regard to any final payment that differs  from other payments because of rounding to account for payment amounts  including fractions of cents.</p><p class="depth0">2. Initial periodic payment or range of payments. Section  1026.37(c)(1)(i) requires the creditor to disclose the initial periodic  payment or range of payments. The disclosure required is of the actual  periodic payment or   range of payments that corresponds to the interest rate that will apply  at consummation, including any initial discounted or premium interest  rate. For examples of discounted and premium rate transactions, see  comment 17(c)(1)-10.v. For guidance regarding whether the disclosure  should reflect a buydown, see comments 17(c)(1)-3 through -5. If the  initial periodic payment or range of payments may vary based on an  adjustment to an index value that applies at consummation, Sec.  1026.37(c)(1)(i) requires that the disclosure of the initial periodic  payment or range of payments be based on the fully-indexed rate  disclosed under Sec. 1026.37(b)(2). See comment 37(b)(2)-1 for guidance  regarding calculating the fully-indexed rate.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 37(c)(1)(i)(A).</p><p class="depth0">1. Periodic principal and interest payments. For purposes of Sec.  1026.37(c)(1)(i)(A), periodic principal and interest payments may change  when the interest rate, applicable interest rate caps, required periodic  principal and interest payments, or ranges of such payments may change.  Minor payment variations resulting solely from the fact that months have  different numbers of days are not changes to periodic principal and  interest payments.</p><p class="depth0">2. Negative amortization. In a loan that contains a negative  amortization feature, periodic principal and interest payments or the  range of such payments may change for purposes of Sec.  1026.37(c)(1)(i)(A) at the time the negative amortization period ends  under the terms of the legal obligation, meaning the consumer must begin  making payments that do not result in an increase of the principal  balance. The occurrence of an event requiring disclosure of additional  separate periodic payments or ranges of payments should be based on the  assumption that the consumer will make payments as scheduled or, if  applicable, elect to make the periodic payments that would extend the  negative amortization period to the latest time permitted under the  terms of the legal obligation. The occurrence of all subsequent events  requiring disclosure of additional separate periodic payments or ranges  of payments should be based on this assumption. The table required by  Sec. 1026.37(c) should also reflect any balloon payment that would  result from such scheduled payments or election. See Sec.  1026.37(c)(1)(ii)(A) for special rules regarding disclosure of balloon  payments.</p><p class="depth0">3. Interest only. In a loan that contains an interest only feature,  periodic principal and interest payments may change for purposes of  Sec. 1026.37(c)(1)(i)(A) when the interest only period ends, meaning  the consumer must begin making payments that do not defer repayment of  principal.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 37(c)(1)(i)(B).</p><p class="depth0">1.

General. ``Mortgage insurance or any functional equivalent''  means the amounts identified in Sec. 1026.4(b)(5). For purposes of  Sec. 1026.37(c), ``mortgage insurance or any functional equivalent''  includes any mortgage guarantee that provides coverage similar to  mortgage insurance (such as a United States Department of Veterans  Affairs or United States Department of Agriculture guarantee), even if  not technically considered insurance under State or other applicable  law. The fees for such a guarantee are included in ``mortgage insurance  premiums.''</p><p class="depth0">2. Calculation of mortgage insurance termination. For purposes of  Sec. 1026.37(c)(1)(i)(C), mortgage insurance premiums should be  calculated based on the declining principal balance that will occur as a  result of changes to the interest rate and payment amounts, applying the  interest rates applicable to the transaction. Such calculation should  take into account any initial discounted or premium interest rate. For  example, for an adjustable rate transaction that has a discounted  interest rate during an initial five-year period, the creditor makes the  calculation using a composite rate based on the rate in effect during  the initial five-year period and, thereafter, the fully-indexed rate,  unless otherwise required by applicable law. For guidance on calculation  of the amount of mortgage insurance premiums to disclose on the table  required by Sec. 1026.37(c), see Sec. 1026.37(c)(2)(ii) and its  commentary. See comment 37(b)(2)-1 for guidance regarding calculating  the fully-indexed rate.</p><p class="depth0">3. Disclosure of mortgage insurance termination. The table required  by Sec. 1026.37(c) should reflect the consumer's mortgage insurance  premiums until the date on which the creditor must automatically  terminate coverage under applicable law, even though the consumer may  have a right to request that the insurance be cancelled earlier. Unlike  termination of mortgage insurance, a subsequent decline in the  consumer's mortgage insurance premiums is not, by itself, an event that  requires the disclosure of additional separate periodic payments or  ranges of payments in the table required by Sec. 1026.37(c). For  example, some mortgage insurance programs annually adjust premiums based  on the declining loan balance. Such annual adjustment to the amount of  premiums would not require a separate disclosure of a periodic payment  or range payments.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 37(c)(1)(i)(D).</p><p class="depth0">1. Anniversary of the due date of initial periodic payment.

Section 1026.37(c)(1)(i)(A) provides that a potential change in the  periodic principal and interest payment is an event requiring disclosure  of additional separate periodic payments. See comment 37(c)(1)(iii)(B)-1  for an example of the application of Sec. 1026.37(c)(1)(i)(D).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 37(c)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 37(c)(1)(ii)(A).</p><p class="depth0">1. Special rule regarding balloon payments that are final payments.  Section 1026.37(c)(1)(ii)(A) is an exception to the general rule in  Sec. 1026.37(c)(1)(ii), and requires that a balloon payment that is  scheduled as a final payment under the terms of the legal obligation is  always disclosed as a separate periodic payment or range of payments, in  which case the creditor discloses as a single range of payments all  events requiring disclosure of additional separate periodic payments or  ranges of payments described in Sec. 1026.37(c)(1)(i)(A) through (D),  other than the final balloon payment, occurring after the second  separate periodic payment or range of payments disclosed. Balloon  payments that are not scheduled as final payments under the terms of the  legal obligation, such as a balloon payment due at the scheduled recast  of a loan that permits negative amortization, are disclosed pursuant to  the general rule in Sec. 1026.37(c)(1)(ii). A balloon payment that is a  final payment is disclosed as a single payment, and not combined with  other changes to periodic principal and interest payments and disclosed  as a range.</p><p class="depth0">2. Example. Assume a loan with a term of seven years, where the  interest rate adjusts each year for the first three years and is fixed  thereafter, that provides for a balloon payment as the final payment,  where no mortgage insurance is required, and no escrow account will be  established for the payment of charges described in Sec.  1026.37(c)(4)(ii). The creditor discloses on the table required by Sec.  1026.37(c) in the first column the initial periodic payment or range of  payments, in the second column the periodic payment or range of payments  that would apply after the first interest rate adjustment, in the third  column the periodic payments or ranges of payments that would apply  after the second interest rate adjustment until the final balloon  payment (disclosed as a single range of payments), and in the fourth  column the final balloon payment. Although the balloon payment that is  scheduled as the final payment under the terms of the legal obligation  occurs after the third separate periodic payment or range of payments,  the creditor discloses the final balloon payment as a separate event  requiring disclosure of additional periodic payments or range of  payments due to the special rule in Sec. 1026.37(c)(1)(ii)(A).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 37(c)(1)(ii)(B).</p><p class="depth0">1. Special rule regarding disclosure of the automatic termination of  mortgage insurance. Section 1026.37(c)(1)(ii)(B) is an exception to the  general rule in Sec. 1026.37(c)(1)(ii), and requires that the automatic  termination of mortgage insurance or any functional equivalent under  applicable law is disclosed as a separate periodic payment or range of  payments only if the total number of separate periodic payments or  ranges of payments otherwise disclosed does not exceed three. This means  that the automatic termination of mortgage insurance or any functional  equivalent under applicable law is disclosed as its own event only if  there is a column in which to disclose it, i.e., there are only three  other separate periodic payments or ranges of payments that are required  to be disclosed. Where the automatic termination of mortgage insurance  or any functional equivalent under applicable law is not disclosed as a  separate periodic payment or range of payments, the absence of a  required mortgage insurance payment is disclosed with the next disclosed  event requiring disclosure of additional separate periodic payments or  ranges of payments, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">2. Examples of special rule regarding disclosure of the automatic  termination of mortgage insurance. i. Assume a step-rate loan with a 30- year term with an introductory interest rate that lasts for five years,  a different interest rate that applies for the next five-year period, a  final interest rate adjustment after 10 years, where mortgage insurance  would terminate for purposes of Sec. 1026.37(c)(1)(i)(C) in the third  year, and where no escrow account would be established for the payment  of charges described in Sec. 1026.37(c)(4)(ii). The creditor would  disclose on the table required by Sec. 1026.37(c) the initial periodic  payment for years one through three (reflecting the principal and  interest payment corresponding to the introductory interest rate and  payments for mortgage insurance premiums), an additional separate  periodic payment for years four and five (reflecting the principal and  interest payment corresponding to the introductory rate and no payments  for mortgage insurance premiums), an additional separate periodic  payment or range of payments for years six through 10 (reflecting the  principal and interest payment corresponding to the interest rate that  would apply after the introductory rate), and an additional separate  periodic payment or range of payments for years 11 through 30  (reflecting the principal and interest payment corresponding to the  interest rate that would apply after the second interest rate adjustment  until the end of the loan   term). In this example, the automatic termination of mortgage insurance  would be separately disclosed on the table required by Sec. 1026.37(c)  because the total number of separate periodic payments or ranges of  payments otherwise disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(c)(1) does not  exceed three.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume the same loan as above, except that the terms of the  legal obligation also provide for a third interest rate adjustment that  would occur after 15 years. The creditor would disclose on the table  required by Sec. 1026.37(c) the initial periodic payment for years one  through five (reflecting the principal and interest payment  corresponding to the introductory interest rate and payments for  mortgage insurance premiums), an additional separate periodic payment or  range of payments for years six through 10 (reflecting the principal and  interest payment corresponding to the interest rate that would apply  after the first interest rate adjustment and no payments for mortgage  insurance premiums), an additional separate periodic payment or range of  payments for years 11 through 15 (reflecting the principal and interest  payment corresponding to the interest rate that would apply after the  second interest rate adjustment), and an additional separate periodic  payment or range of payments for years 16 through 30 (reflecting the  principal and interest payment corresponding to the interest rate that  would apply after the third interest rate adjustment until the end of  the loan term). In this example, the automatic termination of mortgage  insurance would not be separately disclosed on the table required by  Sec. 1026.37(c) because the total number of separate periodic payments  or ranges of payments otherwise disclosed pursuant to Sec.  1026.37(c)(1) exceeds three. However, the creditor would disclose the  termination of mortgage insurance beginning with the periodic payment or  range of payments for years six through 10, which is the next disclosed  event requiring disclosure of additional separate periodic payments or  ranges of payments.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 37(c)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">1.

When a range of payments is required to be  disclosed under Sec. 1026.37(c)(1), Sec. 1026.37(c)(1)(iii) requires  the creditor to disclose the minimum and maximum amount for both the  principal and interest payment under Sec. 1026.37(c)(2)(i) and the  total periodic payment under Sec. 1026.37(c)(2)(iv). The amount  required to be disclosed for mortgage insurance premiums pursuant to  Sec. 1026.37(c)(2)(ii) and the amount payable into an escrow account  pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(c)(2)(iii) shall not be disclosed as a range.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 37(c)(1)(iii)(B).</p><p class="depth0">1. Multiple events occurring in a single year. If changes to  periodic principal and interest payments would result in more than one  separate periodic payment or range of payments in a single year, Sec.  1026.37(c)(1)(iii)(B) requires the creditor to disclose the range of  payments that would apply during the year in which the events occur. For  example, assume a loan with a 30-year term with a payment that adjusts  every month for the first 12 months and is fixed thereafter, where  mortgage insurance is not required, and where no escrow account would be  established for the payment of charges described in Sec.  1026.37(c)(4)(ii). The creditor discloses as a single range of payments  the initial periodic payment and the periodic payment that would apply  after each payment adjustment during the first 12 months and would also  disclose, as an additional separate periodic payment or range of  payments, the periodic principal and interest payment or range of  payments that would apply after the payment becomes fixed. Assume  instead a loan with a 30-year term with a payment that adjusts upward at  three months and at six months and is fixed thereafter, where mortgage  insurance is not required, and where no escrow account would be  established for the payment of charges described in Sec.  1026.37(c)(4)(ii). The creditor discloses as a single range of payments  the initial periodic payment, the periodic payment that would apply  after the payment adjustment that occurs at three months, and the  periodic payment that would apply after the payment adjustment that  occurs at six months, which single range represents the minimum payment  and maximum payment, respectively, which would apply during the first  year of the loan. Pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(c)(1)(i)(D), the creditor  also discloses as an additional separate periodic payment or range of  payments, the principal and interest payment that would apply on the  one-year anniversary of the due date of the initial periodic payment or  range of payments, because that is the anniversary that immediately  follows the occurrence of the multiple payments or ranges of payments  that occurred during the first year of the loan. Assume that the same  loan has a payment that, instead of becoming fixed after the adjustment  at six months, adjusts once more at 18 months and becomes fixed  thereafter. The creditor would disclose the same single range of  payments for year one. Pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(c)(1)(iii)(B), the  creditor also discloses the principal and interest payment that would  apply on the one-year anniversary of the due date of the initial  periodic payment (as required by Sec. 1026.37(c)(1)(i)(D)) and the  periodic payment that would apply after the payment adjustment that  occurs at 18 months as a single range of payments in year two. Pursuant  to Sec. 1026.37(c)(1)(i)(D), the creditor also discloses as an  additional separate periodic payment or range of payments, the principal  and interest payment that would apply on the two-year anniversary of the  due date of the initial periodic payment or range of payments,   because that is the anniversary that immediately follows the occurrence  of the multiple payments or ranges of payments that occurred during the  second year of the loan.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 37(c)(1)(iii)(C).</p><p class="depth0">1. Adjustable rate mortgages. For an adjustable rate loan, the  periodic principal and interest payment at each time the interest rate  may change will depend on the rate that applies at the time of the  adjustment, which is not known at the time the disclosure is provided.  As a result, the creditor discloses the minimum and maximum periodic  principal and interest payment that could apply during each period  disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(c)(1) after the first period.</p><p class="depth0">37(c)(2) Itemization.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 37(c)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. General rule for adjustable rate loans. For an adjustable rate  loan, in disclosing the maximum possible payment for principal and  interest under Sec. 1026.37(c), the creditor assumes that the interest  rate will rise as rapidly as possible after consummation, taking into  account the terms of the legal obligation, including any applicable caps  on interest rate adjustments and lifetime interest rate cap. For a loan  with no lifetime interest rate cap, the maximum rate is determined by  reference to other applicable laws, such as State usury law. In  disclosing the minimum payment for purposes of Sec. 1026.37(c), the  creditor assumes that the interest rate will decrease as rapidly as  possible after consummation, taking into account any introductory rates,  caps on interest rate adjustments, and lifetime interest rate floor. For  an adjustable rate loan based on an index that has no lifetime interest  rate floor, the minimum interest rate is equal to the margin.</p><p class="depth0">2. Special rule for adjustable rate loans with negative amortization  features. Section 1026.37(c)(2)(i)(B) provides a special rule for  calculation of the maximum principal and interest payment in an  adjustable rate loan that contains a negative amortization feature. That  section provides that the maximum amounts payable for principal and  interest after the negative amortization period ends are calculated  using the maximum principal amount permitted under the terms of the  legal obligation at the end of the negative amortization period. See  section Sec. 1026.37(c)(1)(i)(A) and associated commentary for guidance  regarding when the negative amortization period ends for purposes of  Sec. 1026.37(c)(2). For example, if the maximum principal balance for  the last payment in the negative amortization period is achieved at an  interest rate that is not the maximum interest rate permitted under the  terms of the legal obligation before the negative amortization period  ends, future events requiring disclosure of additional, separate  periodic payments or ranges of payments assume that the interest rate in  effect at the end of the negative amortization period was such interest  rate, and not the maximum possible interest rate. After the end of the  negative amortization period, the general rule under Sec.  1026.37(c)(2)(i)(A) regarding assumptions of interest rate changes for  the maximum principal and interest payment to be disclosed applies from  such interest rate. The minimum payment in an adjustable rate loan that  contains a negative amortization feature is determined pursuant to the  general rule under Sec. 1026.37(c)(2)(i)(A).</p><p class="depth0">3. Disclosure of balloon payment amounts. Although the existence of  a balloon payment is determined pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(b)(5) and its  commentary (see comment 37(c)(1)(i)(B)-1), balloon payment amounts to be  disclosed under Sec. 1026.37(c) are calculated in the same manner as  periodic principal and interest payments under Sec. 1026.37(c)(2)(i).  For example, for a balloon payment amount that can change depending on  previous interest rate adjustments that are based on the value of an  index at the time of the adjustment, the balloon payment amounts are  calculated using the assumptions for minimum and maximum interest rates  described in Sec. 1026.37(c)(2)(i) and its commentary, and should be  disclosed as a range of payments.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 37(c)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Mortgage insurance disclosure. Mortgage insurance premiums should  be reflected on the disclosure required by Sec. 1026.37(c) even if no  escrow account is established for the payment of mortgage insurance  premiums. If the consumer is not required to purchase mortgage insurance  or any functional equivalent, the creditor discloses the mortgage  insurance premium amount as ``0.'' If the creditor is disclosing the  automatic termination or the absence of mortgage insurance or any  functional equivalent under applicable law or the absence of mortgage  insurance or any functional equivalent after coverage has terminated,  the creditor discloses the mortgage insurance premium as ``-.''</p><p class="depth0">2. Relationship to principal and interest disclosure. The creditor  discloses mortgage insurance premiums pursuant to Sec.  1026.37(c)(2)(ii) on the same periodic basis that payments for principal  and interest are disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(c)(2)(i), even if  mortgage insurance premiums are actually paid on some other periodic  basis. If no escrow account for the payment of some or all such charges  will be established, the creditor discloses the mortgage insurance  premium as ``0.''</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 37(c)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Escrow disclosure. The disclosure described in Sec.  1026.37(c)(2)(iii) is required only if the creditor will establish an  escrow account for the payment of some or all of the charges described  in Sec. 1026.37(c)(4)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">37(c)(3) Subheadings.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 37(c)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Years. Section 1026.37(c)(3)(ii) requires that each separate  periodic payment or range of payments be disclosed under a subheading  that states the years during which that payment or range of payments  will apply and that such subheadings be stated in a sequence of whole  years from the due date of the initial periodic payment. Therefore, for  purposes of Sec. 1026.37(c), ``year'' is defined as the twelve-month  interval beginning on the due date of the initial periodic payment, and  the next whole year begins each anniversary thereafter. If an event  requiring the disclosure of an additional separate periodic payment or  range of payments occurs on a date other than the anniversary of the due  date of the initial periodic payment, and no other events occur during  that single year requiring disclosure of multiple events under Sec.  1026.37(c)(1)(iii)(B), such event is disclosed beginning in the next  year in the sequence, because the separate periodic payment or range of  payments that applied during the previous year will also apply during a  portion of that year. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Assume a fixed rate loan with a term of 124 months (10 years,  four months). The creditor would label the disclosure of periodic  payments as ``Years 1-11.''</p><p class="depth0">ii. Assume a loan with a 30-year term that does not require mortgage  insurance and requires interest only payments for the first 60 months  from the due date of the initial periodic payment, then requires fixed,  fully amortizing payments of principal and interest beginning at the  61st month for the duration of the loan, the creditor would label the  first disclosure of periodic payments as ``Years 1-5'' (including the  term ``only interest'' pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(c)(2)(i)) and the  second disclosure of periodic payments or range of payments as ``Years  6-30.'' If that loan requires interest only payments for the first 54  months from the due date of the initial periodic payment, then requires  fixed, fully amortizing payments of principal and interest for the  duration of the loan, because the change in the periodic payment occurs  on a date other than the anniversary of the due date of the initial  periodic payment and the previous payment applies during that year, the  creditor would likewise label the first disclosure of periodic payments  as ``Years 1-5'' (including the term ``only interest'' pursuant to Sec.  1026.37(c)(2)(i)) and the second disclosure of periodic payments or  range of payments as ``Years 6-30.'' If the loan that requires interest  only payments for the first 54 months also requires mortgage insurance  that would automatically terminate under applicable law after the 100th  month from the due date of the initial periodic payment, the creditor  would label the first disclosure of periodic payments as ``Years 1-5''  (including the term ``only interest'' pursuant to Sec.  1026.37(c)(2)(i)), the second disclosure of periodic payments or range  of payments as ``Years 6-9,'' and the third disclosure of periodic  payments or range of payments as ``Years 10-30.''</p><p class="depth0">2. Loans with variable terms. If the loan term may increase based on  an adjustment of the interest rate, the creditor must disclose the  maximum loan term possible under the legal obligation. To calculate the  maximum loan term, the creditor assumes that the interest rate rises as  rapidly as possible, taking into account the terms of the legal  obligation, including any applicable caps on interest rate adjustments  and lifetime interest rate cap.

See the  commentary under Sec. 1026.43(b)(8) for guidance on the charges that  are included in taxes, insurance, and assessments for purposes of Sec.  1026.37(c)(4)(ii), except that the portion of that commentary related to  amounts identified in Sec. 1026.4(b)(5) is inapplicable to the  disclosure required by Sec. 1026.37(c)(4)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 37(c)(4)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">1. Description of other amounts. Section 1026.37(c)(4)(iv) requires  the creditor to disclose a statement of whether the amount disclosed  pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(c)(4)(ii) includes payments for property  taxes, amounts identified in Sec. 1026.4(b)(8) (homeowner's insurance  premiums), and other amounts described in Sec. 1026.37(c)(4)(ii), along  with a description of any such other amounts. If the amount disclosed  pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(c)(4)(ii) requires the creditor to disclose a  description of more than one amount other than amounts for payment of  property taxes or homeowner's insurance premiums, the creditor may  disclose a descriptive statement of one such amount along with an  indication that additional amounts are also included, such as by using  the phrase ``and additional costs.''</p><p class="depth0">2. Amounts paid by the creditor using escrow account funds. Section  1026.37(c)(4)(iv) requires the creditor to disclose an indication of  whether the amounts disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(c)(4)(ii) will  be paid by the creditor using escrow account funds. If the amount  disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(c)(4)(ii) requires the creditor to  disclose a description of more than one amount other than amounts for  payments of property taxes or homeowner's insurance and only some of  those amounts will be paid by the creditor using escrow account funds,  the creditor may indicate that only some of those amounts will be paid  using escrow account funds, such as by using the word ``some.''</p><p class="depth0">37(d) Costs at closing.</p><p class="depth0">37(d)(2) Optional alternative table for transactions without a  seller.</p><p class="depth0">1.

Origination charges. Charges included under the subheading  ``Origination Charges'' pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(f)(1) are those  charges paid by the consumer to each creditor and loan originator for  originating and extending the credit, regardless of how such fees are  denominated. In accordance with Sec. 1026.37(o)(4), the dollar amounts  disclosed under Sec. 1026.37(f)(1) must be rounded to the nearest whole  dollar and the percentage amounts must be disclosed as an exact number  up to two or three decimal places, except that decimal places shall not  be disclosed if the percentage is a whole number. See comment  19(e)(3)(i)-3 for a discussion of when a fee is considered to be ``paid  to'' a person. See Sec. 1026.36(a) and associated commentary for a  discussion of the meaning of ``loan originator'' in connection with  limits on compensation in a consumer credit transaction secured by a  dwelling.</p><p class="depth0">2. Indirect loan originator compensation. Only charges paid directly  by the consumer to compensate a loan originator are included in the  amounts listed under Sec. 1026.37(f)(1). Compensation of a loan  originator paid indirectly by the creditor through the interest rate is  not itemized on the Loan Estimate required by Sec. 1026.19(e). However,  pursuant to Sec. 1026.38(f)(1), such compensation is itemized on the  Closing Disclosure required by Sec. 1026.19(f).</p><p class="depth0">3. Description of charges. Other than for points charged in  connection with the transaction to reduce the interest rate, for which  specific language must be used, the creditor may use a general label  that uses terminology that, under Sec. 1026.37(f)(5), is consistent  with Sec. 1026.17(a)(1), clearly and conspicuously describes the  service that is disclosed as an origination charge pursuant to Sec.  1026.37(f)(1). Items that are listed under the subheading ``Origination  Charges'' may include, for example, application fee, origination fee,  underwriting fee, processing fee, verification fee, and rate-lock fee.</p><p class="depth0">4. Points. If there are no points charged in connection with the  transaction to reduce the interest rate, the creditor leaves blank the  percentage of points used in the label and the dollar amount disclosed  under Sec. 1026.37(f)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">5. Itemization. Creditors determine the level of itemization of  ``Origination Charges'' that is appropriate under Sec. 1026.37(f)(1) in  relation to charges paid by the consumer to the creditor, subject to the  limitations in Sec. 1026.37(f)(1)(ii). For example, the following  charges should be itemized separately: compensation paid directly by a  consumer to a loan originator that is not also the creditor; or a charge  imposed to pay for a loan level pricing adjustment assessed on the  creditor, which the creditor passes onto the consumer as a charge at  consummation and not as an adjustment to the interest rate.</p><p class="depth0">37(f)(2) Services you cannot shop for.</p><p class="depth0">1.

Examples of the services and amounts to be  disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(f)(2) might include an appraisal  fee, appraisal management company fee, credit report fee, flood  determination fee, government funding fee, homeowner's association  certification fee, lender's attorney fee, tax status research fee,  third-party subordination fee, title--closing protection letter fee,  title--lender's title insurance policy, and an upfront mortgage  insurance fee, provided that the fee is charged at consummation and is  not a prepayment of future premiums over a specific future time period  or a payment into an escrow account. Government funding fees include a  United States Department of Veterans Affairs or United States Department  of Agriculture guarantee fee, or any other fee paid to a government  entity as part of a governmental loan program, that is paid at  consummation.</p><p class="depth0">3. Title insurance services. The services required to be labeled  beginning with ``Title -''   pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(f)(2) or (3) are those required for the  issuance of title insurance policies to the creditor in connection with  the consummation of the transaction or for conducting the closing. These  services may include, for example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Examination and evaluation, based on relevant law and title  insurance underwriting principles and guidelines, of the title evidence  to determine the insurability of the title being examined and what items  to include or exclude in any title commitment and policy to be issued;</p><p class="depth0">ii. Preparation and issuance of the title commitment or other  document that discloses the status of the title as it is proposed to be  insured, identifies the conditions that must be met before the policy  will be issued, and obligates the insurer to issue a policy of title  insurance if such conditions are met;</p><p class="depth0">iii.

Preparation and issuance of the policy or policies of title  insurance; and</p><p class="depth0">v. Premiums for any title insurance coverage for the benefit of the  creditor.</p><p class="depth0">4. Lender's title insurance policy. Section 1026.37(f)(2) and (3)  requires disclosure of the amount the consumer will pay for the lender's  title insurance policy. However, an owner's title insurance policy that  covers the consumer and is not required to be purchased by the creditor  is only disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(g). Accordingly, the  creditor must quote the amount of the lender's title insurance coverage  pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(f)(2) or (3) as applicable based on the type  of lender's title insurance policy required by its underwriting  standards for that loan. The amount disclosed for the lender's title  insurance policy pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(f)(2) or (3) is the amount of  the premium without any adjustment that might be made for the  simultaneous purchase of an owner's title insurance policy. This amount  may be disclosed as ``Title --Premium for Lender's Coverage,'' or in any  similar manner that clearly indicates the amount of the premium  disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(f)(2) is for the lender's title  insurance coverage.

Clear and conspicuous standard. Section 1026.37(f)(5) requires  creditors to label the loan costs disclosed pursuant Sec. 1026.37(f)  using terminology that describes each item. A creditor complies with  this requirement if it uses terminology that is clear and conspicuous,  consistent with Sec. 1026.17(a)(1), and describes the service or  administrative function that the charge pays for in a manner that is  reasonably understood by consumers within the space provided in form H- 24 of appendix H to this part. For example, if a creditor imposes a fee  on a consumer to cover the costs associated with underwriting the  transaction, the creditor would comply with Sec. 1026.37(f)(5) if it  labeled the cost ``Underwriting Fee.'' A label that uses abbreviations  or acronyms that are not reasonably understood by consumers would not  comply with Sec. 1026.37(f)(5).</p><p class="depth0">37(f)(6) Use of addenda.</p><p class="depth0">1. State law disclosures. If a creditor is required by State law to  make additional disclosures that, pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(f)(6)(i),  cannot be included in the disclosures required under Sec. 1026.37(f),  the creditor may make those additional State law disclosures on a  document whose pages are separate from, and are not presented as part  of, the disclosures prescribed in Sec. 1026.37, for example, as an  addendum to the Loan Estimate. See comment 37(o)(1)-1.</p><p class="depth0">2. Reference to addendum. If an addendum is used as permitted under  Sec. 1026.37(f)(6)(ii), an example of a label that complies with the  requirement for an appropriate reference on the last line is: ``See  attached page for additional items you can shop for.''</p><p class="depth0">37(g) Closing cost details; other costs.</p><p class="depth0">1. General description. The items listed under the heading of  ``Other Costs'' pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(g) include services that are  ancillary to the creditor's decision to evaluate   the collateral and the consumer for the loan. The amounts disclosed for  these items are: Established by government action; determined by  standard calculations applied to ongoing fixed costs; or based on an  obligation incurred by the consumer independently of any requirement  imposed by the creditor. Except for prepaid interest under Sec.  1026.37(g)(2)(iii), or charges for optional credit insurance provided by  the creditor, the creditor does not retain any of the amounts or  portions of the amounts disclosed as other costs.</p><p class="depth0">2. Charges pursuant to property contract. The creditor is required  to disclose charges that are described in Sec. 1026.37(g)(1) through  (3). Other charges that are required to be paid at or before closing  pursuant to the property contract for sale between the consumer and  seller are disclosed on the Loan Estimate to the extent the creditor has  knowledge of those charges when it issues the Loan Estimate, consistent  with the good faith standard under Sec. 1026.19(e). A creditor has  knowledge of those charges where, for example, it has the real estate  purchase and sale contract. See also Sec. 1026.37(g)(4) and comment  37(g)(4)-3.</p><p class="depth0">37(g)(1) Taxes and other government fees.</p><p class="depth0">1. Recording fees. Recording fees listed under Sec. 1026.37(g)(1)  are fees assessed by a government authority to record and index the loan  and title documents as required under State or local law. Recording fees  are assessed based on the type of document to be recorded or its  physical characteristics, such as the number of pages. Unlike transfer  taxes, recording fees are not based on the sale price of the property or  loan amount. For example, a fee for recording a subordination agreement  that is $20, plus $3 for each page over three pages, is a recording fee,  but a fee of $1,250 based on 0.5 percent of the loan amount is a  transfer tax, and not a recording fee.</p><p class="depth0">2. Other government charges. Any charges or fees imposed by a State  or local government that are not transfer taxes are aggregated with  recording fees and disclosed under Sec. 1026.37(g)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">3. Transfer taxes--terminology. In general, transfer taxes listed  under Sec. 1026.37(g)(1) are State and local government fees on  mortgages and home sales that are based on the loan amount or sales  price, while recording fees are State and local government fees for  recording the loan and title documents. The name that is used under  State or local law to refer to these amounts is not determinative of  whether they are disclosed as transfer taxes or as recording fees and  other taxes under Sec. 1026.37(g)(1).</p><p class="depth0">4. Transfer taxes--consumer. Only transfer taxes paid by the  consumer are disclosed on the Loan Estimate pursuant to Sec.  1026.37(g)(1). State and local government transfer taxes are governed by  State or local law, which determines if the seller or consumer is  ultimately responsible for paying the transfer taxes. For example, if  State law indicates a lien can attach to the consumer's acquired  property if the transfer tax is not paid, the transfer tax is disclosed.  If State or local law is unclear or does not specifically attribute  transfer taxes to the seller or the consumer, the creditor is in  compliance with requirements of Sec. 1026.37(g)(1) if the amount of the  transfer tax disclosed is not less than the amount apportioned to the  consumer using common practice in the locality of the property.</p><p class="depth0">5. Transfer taxes--seller. Transfer taxes paid by the seller in a  purchase transaction are not disclosed on the Loan Estimate under Sec.  1026.37(g)(1), but are disclosed on the Closing Disclosure pursuant to  Sec. 1026.38(g)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">6. Deletion and addition of items. The lines and labels required by  Sec. 1026.37(g)(1) may not be deleted, even if recording fees or  transfer taxes are not charged to the consumer. No additional items may  be listed under the subheading in Sec. 1026.37(g)(1).</p><p class="depth0">37(g)(2) Prepaids.</p><p class="depth0">1. Examples. Prepaid items required to be disclosed pursuant to  Sec. 1026.37(g)(2) include the interest due at consummation for the  period of time before interest begins to accrue for the first scheduled  periodic payment and certain periodic charges that are required by the  creditor to be paid at consummation. Each periodic charge listed as a  prepaid item indicates, as applicable, the time period that the charge  will cover, the daily amount, the percentage rate of interest used to  calculate the charge, and the total dollar amount of the charge.  Examples of periodic charges that are disclosed pursuant to Sec.  1026.37(g)(2) include:</p><p class="depth0">i. Real estate property taxes due within 60 days after consummation  of the transaction;</p><p class="depth0">ii. Past-due real estate property taxes;</p><p class="depth0">iii. Mortgage insurance premiums;</p><p class="depth0">iv. Flood insurance premiums; and</p><p class="depth0">v. Homeowner's insurance premiums.</p><p class="depth0">2. Interest rate. The interest rate disclosed pursuant to Sec.  1026.37(g)(2)(iii) is the same interest rate disclosed pursuant to Sec.  1026.37(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0">3. Terminology. For purposes of Sec. 1026.37(g)(2), the term  ``property taxes'' has the same meaning as in Sec. 1026.43(b)(8) and  further described in comment 43(b)(8)-2; the term ``homeowner's  insurance'' means the amounts identified in Sec. 1026.4(b)(8); and the  term ``mortgage insurance'' has the same meaning as ``mortgage insurance  or any functional equivalent'' in Sec. 1026.37(c), which means the  amounts identified in Sec. 1026.4(b)(5).</p><p class="depth0">4. Deletion of items. The lines and labels required by Sec.  1026.37(g)(2) may not be deleted, even if amounts for those labeled  items are not charged to the consumer. If an amount   for a labeled item is not charged to the consumer, the time period,  daily amount, and percentage used in the labels are left blank.</p><p class="depth0">37(g)(3) Initial escrow payment at closing.</p><p class="depth0">1. Listed item not charged. Pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(g)(3), each  periodic charge to be included in the escrow or reserve account must be  itemized under the ``Initial Escrow Payment at Closing'' subheading,  with a relevant label, monthly payment amount, and number of months  expected to be collected at consummation. If an item described in Sec.  1026.37(g)(3)(i) through (iii) is not charged to the consumer, the  monthly payment amount and time period used in the labels are left  blank.</p><p class="depth0">2. Aggregate escrow account calculation. The aggregate escrow  account adjustment required under Sec. 1026.38(g)(3) and 12 CFR  1024.17(d)(2) is not included on the Loan Estimate under Sec.  1026.37(g)(3).</p><p class="depth0">3. Terminology. As used in Sec. 1026.37(g)(3), the term ``property  taxes'' has the same meaning as in Sec. 1026.43(b)(8) and further  described in comment 43(b)(8)-2; the term ``homeowner's insurance''  means the amounts identified in Sec. 1026.4(b)(8); and the term  ``mortgage insurance'' has the same meaning as ``mortgage insurance or  any functional equivalent'' in Sec. 1026.37(c).</p><p class="depth0">4. Deletion of items. The lines and labels required by Sec.  1026.37(g)(3) may not be deleted, even if amounts for those labeled  items are not charged to the consumer.</p><p class="depth0">5. Escrowed tax payments for different time frames. Payments for  property taxes that are paid at different time periods can be itemized  separately when done in accordance with 12 CFR 1024.17, as applicable.  For example, a general property tax covering a fiscal year from January  1 to December 31 can be listed as a property tax under Sec.  1026.37(g)(3)(i); and a separate property tax to fund schools that cover  a fiscal year from November 1 to October 31 can be added as a separate  item under Sec. 1026.37(g)(3)(v).</p><p class="depth0">37(g)(4) Other.</p><p class="depth0">1. Owner's title insurance policy rate. The amount disclosed for an  owner's title insurance premium pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(g)(4) is based  on a basic owner's policy rate, and not on an ``enhanced'' title  insurance policy premium, except that the creditor may instead disclose  the premium for an ``enhanced'' policy when the ``enhanced'' title  insurance policy is required by the real estate sales contract, if such  requirement is known to the creditor when issuing the Loan Estimate.  This amount should be disclosed as ``Title--Owner's Title Policy  (optional),'' or in any similar manner that includes the introductory  description ``Title -'' at the beginning of the label for the item, the  parenthetical description ``(optional)'' at the end of the label, and  clearly indicates the amount of the premium disclosed pursuant to Sec.  1026.37(g)(4) is for the owner's title insurance coverage. See comment  37(f)(2)-4 for a discussion of the disclosure of the premium for  lender's title insurance coverage.</p><p class="depth0">2. Simultaneous title insurance premium rate in purchase  transactions. The premium for an owner's title insurance policy for  which a special rate may be available based on the simultaneous issuance  of a lender's and an owner's policy is calculated and disclosed pursuant  to Sec. 1026.37(g)(4) as follows:</p><p class="depth0">i. The title insurance premium for a lender's title policy is based  on the full premium rate, consistent with Sec. 1026.37(f)(2) or (f)(3).</p><p class="depth0">ii. The owner's title insurance premium is calculated by taking the  full owner's title insurance premium, adding the simultaneous issuance  premium for the lender's coverage, and then deducting the full premium  for lender's coverage.</p><p class="depth0">3. Designation of optional items. Products disclosed under Sec.  1026.37(g)(4) for which the parenthetical description ``(optional)'' is  included at the end of the label for the item include only items that  are separate from any item disclosed on the Loan Estimate under  paragraphs other than Sec. 1026.37(g)(4). For example, such items may  include optional owner's title insurance, credit life insurance, debt  suspension coverage, debt cancellation coverage, warranties of home  appliances and systems, and similar products, when coverage is written  in connection with a credit transaction that is subject to Sec.  1026.19(e). However, because the requirement in Sec. 1026.37(g)(4)(ii)  applies to separate products only, additional coverage and endorsements  on insurance otherwise required by the lender are not disclosed under  Sec. 1026.37(g)(4). See comments 4(b)(7) and (b)(8)-1 through -3 and  comments 4(b)(10)-1 and -2 for guidance on determining when credit life  insurance, debt suspension coverage, debt cancellation coverage, and  similar coverage is written in connection with a transaction subject to  Sec. 1026.19(e).</p><p class="depth0">4. Examples. Examples of other items that are disclosed under Sec.  1026.37(g)(4) if the creditor is aware of those items when it issues the  Loan Estimate include commissions of real estate brokers or agents,  additional payments to the seller to purchase personal property pursuant  to the property contract, homeowner's association and condominium  charges associated with the transfer of ownership, and fees for  inspections not required by the creditor but paid by the consumer  pursuant to the property contract. Although the consumer is obligated  for these costs, they are not imposed upon the consumer by the creditor  or loan originator. Therefore, they are not disclosed with the  parenthetical description ``(optional)'' at the end of the label for the  item, and they are disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(g) rather than  Sec. 1026.37(f). Even if such items are not required to be disclosed on  the Loan Estimate   under Sec. 1026.37(g)(4), however, they may be required to be disclosed  on the Closing Disclosure pursuant to Sec. 1026.38.

Lender credits. Section 1026.19(e)(1)(i) requires disclosure of  lender credits as provided in Sec. 1026.37(g)(6)(ii). Comment  19(e)(3)(i)-5 describes such lender credits as payments from the  creditor to the consumer that do not pay for a particular fee on the  disclosures provided under Sec. 1026.37.</p><p class="depth0">2. Credits or rebates from the creditor to offset a portion or all  of the closing costs. For loans where a portion or all of the closing  costs are offset by a credit or rebate provided by the creditor  (sometimes referred to as ``no-cost'' loans), whether all or a defined  portion of the closing costs disclosed under Sec. 1026.37(f) or (g)  will be paid by a credit or rebate from the creditor, the creditor  discloses such credit or rebate as a lender credit under Sec.  1026.37(g)(6)(ii). The creditor should ensure that the lender credit  disclosed under Sec. 1026.37(g)(6)(ii) is sufficient to cover the  estimated costs the creditor represented to the consumer as not being  required to be paid by the consumer at consummation, regardless of  whether such representations pertained to specific items.</p><p class="depth0">37(g)(7) Item descriptions and ordering.</p><p class="depth0">1.

Section 1026.37(h)(1) describes the  amounts that are used to calculate the estimated amount of cash or other  funds that the consumer must provide at consummation. The labels that  are to be used under Sec. 1026.37(h)(1) are illustrated by form H-24(A)  of appendix H to this part.</p><p class="depth0">37(h)(1)(ii) Closing costs financed.</p><p class="depth0">1. Calculating amount. The amount of closing costs financed  disclosed under Sec. 1026.37(h)(1)(ii) is determined by subtracting the  estimated total amount of payments to third parties not otherwise  disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(f) and Sec. 1026.37(g) from the  total loan amount disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(b)(1). If the  result of the calculation is a positive number, that amount is disclosed  as a negative number under Sec. 1026.37(h)(1)(ii), but only to the  extent that it does not exceed the total amount of lender credits  disclosed under Sec. 1026.37(g)(6)(ii).

Section 1026.37(h)(1)(iv)(A) requires disclosure of a deposit in  a purchase transaction. The deposit to be disclosed under Sec.  1026.37(h)(1)(iv)(A) is any amount that the consumer has agreed to pay  to a party identified in the real estate purchase and sale agreement to  be held until consummation of the transaction, which is often referred  to as an earnest money deposit. In a purchase transaction in which no  such deposit is paid in connection with the transaction, Sec.  1026.37(h)(1)(iv)(A) requires the creditor to disclose $0. In any other  type of transaction, Sec. 1026.37(h)(1)(iv)(B) requires disclosure of  the deposit amount as $0.</p><p class="depth0">37(h)(1)(v) Funds for borrower.</p><p class="depth0">1. Use of calculation--non-purchase transactions. The calculation  described in Sec. 1026.37(h)(1)(v) is only used to determine the  amounts disclosed under Sec. 1026.37(h)(1)(iii) and (h)(1)(v) in a  transaction that is not described as a purchase transaction under Sec.  1026.37(a)(9)(i), in accordance with the provisions of Sec.  1026.37(h)(1)(iii)(A). In a purchase transaction (other than a  construction loan), the amount disclosed under Sec. 1026.37(h)(1)(v)  will be $0, in accordance with Sec. 1026.37(h)(1)(v)(A).</p><p class="depth0">37(h)(1)(vi) Seller credits.</p><p class="depth0">1. Credits to be disclosed. The seller credits known to the creditor  at the time of delivery of the Loan Estimate are disclosed under Sec.  1026.37(h)(1)(vi). For example, a creditor may know the amount of seller  credits that will be paid in the transaction from information obtained  verbally from the consumer, from a review of the purchase and sale  contract, or from information obtained from a real estate agent in the  transaction.</p><p class="depth0">2. Seller credits for specific charges. To the extent known by the  creditor at the time of delivery of the Loan Estimate, seller credits  for specific items disclosed under Sec. 1026.37(f) and (g) are  represented by the total amount disclosed for those items.</p><p class="depth0">37(h)(1)(vii) Adjustments and other credits.</p><p class="depth0">1. Other credits known at the time the Loan Estimate is issued.  Amounts expected to be paid by third parties not involved in the   transaction, such as gifts from family members and not otherwise  identified under Sec. 1026.37(h)(1), are included in the amount  disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(h)(1)(vii).</p><p class="depth0">2. Persons that may make payments causing adjustment and other  credits. Persons, as defined under Sec. 1026.2(a)(22), means natural  persons or organizations.

Credits. Only credits from persons other than the creditor or  seller can be disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(h)(1)(vii). Seller  credits and credits from the creditor are disclosed pursuant to Sec.  1026.37(h)(1)(vi) and Sec. 1026.37(g)(6)(ii), respectively.</p><p class="depth0">4. Other credits to be disclosed. Credits other than those from the  creditor or seller are disclosed under Sec. 1026.37(h)(1)(vii).  Disclosure of other credits is, like other disclosures under Sec.  1026.37, subject to the good faith requirement under Sec.  1026.19(e)(1)(i). See Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) and comments 17(c)(2)(i)-1  and 19(e)(1)(i)-1. The creditor may obtain information regarding items  to be disclosed under Sec. 1026.37(h)(1)(vii), for example, verbally  from the consumer, from a review of the purchase and sale contract, or  from information obtained from a real estate agent in the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">5. Proceeds from subordinate financing or other source. Funds that  are provided to the consumer from the proceeds of subordinate financing,  local or State housing assistance grants, or other similar sources are  included in the amount disclosed under Sec. 1026.37(h)(1)(vii).</p><p class="depth0">6. Reduction in amounts for adjustments. Adjustments that require  additional funds from the consumer pursuant to the real estate purchase  and sale contract, such as for additional personal property that will be  disclosed on the Closing Disclosure under Sec. 1026.38(j)(1)(iii) or  adjustments that will be disclosed on the Closing Disclosure under Sec.  1026.38(j)(1)(v) can be included in the amount disclosed under Sec.  1026.37(h)(1)(vii), and because the amount disclosed is a sum of  adjustments and other credits, such amount would reduce the total amount  disclosed.

Limitation on amount disclosed. The amount disclosed under Sec.  1026.37(h)(2)(v) is limited to the total amount of closing costs  disclosed under Sec. 1026.37(g)(6), even if the difference between  Sec. 1026.37(h)(2)(i) and Sec. 1026.37(h)(2)(iii) is greater than the  amount disclosed under Sec. 1026.37(g)(6).</p><p class="depth0">37(i) Adjustable payment table.</p><p class="depth0">1. When table is not permitted to be disclosed. The disclosure  described in Sec. 1026.37(i) is required only if the periodic principal  and interest payment may change after consummation based on a loan term  other than a change to the interest rate, or the transaction contains a  seasonal payment product feature as described in Sec.  1026.37(a)(10)(ii)(E). If the transaction does not contain such loan  terms, this table shall not appear on the Loan Estimate.</p><p class="depth0">2. Periods to be disclosed. Section 1026.37(i)(1) through (4)  requires disclosure of the periods during which interest only, optional  payment, step payment, and seasonal payment product features will be in  effect. The periods required to be disclosed should be disclosed by  describing the number of payments counting from the first periodic  payment due after consummation. The period of seasonal payments required  to be disclosed by Sec. 1026.37(i)(4), to be clear and conspicuous,   should be disclosed with a noun that identifies the unit-period, because  such feature may apply on a regular basis during the loan term that does  not depend on when regular periodic payments begin. The disclosures  required by Sec. 1026.37(i)(1) through (4) may include abbreviations to  fit in the space provided for the information on form H-24, provided the  information is disclosed in a clear and conspicuous manner. For example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Period from date of consummation. If a loan has an interest only  period for the first 60 regular periodic payments due after  consummation, the disclosure states ``for your first 60 payments.''</p><p class="depth0">ii. Period during middle of loan term. If the loan has an interest  only period between the 61st and 85th payments, the disclosure states  ``from your 61st to 85th payment.''</p><p class="depth0">iii. Multiple successive periods. If there are multiple periods  during which a certain adjustable payment term applies, such as a period  of step payments that occurs from the first through 12th payments, does  not occur from the 13th through 24th payments, and occurs again from the  25th through 36th payments, the period disclosed is the entire span of  all such periods. Accordingly, such period is disclosed as ``for your  first 36 payments.''</p><p class="depth0">iv. Seasonal payments. For a seasonal payment product with a unit- period of a month that does not require periodic payments for the months  of June, July, and August each year during the loan term, because such  feature depends on calendar months and not on when regular periodic  payments begin, the period is disclosed as ``from June to August.'' For  a transaction with a quarterly unit-period that does not require a  periodic payment every third quarter during the loan term and does not  depend on calendar months, the period is disclosed as ``every third  payment.'' In the same transaction, if the seasonal payment feature ends  after the 20th quarter, the period is disclosed as ``every quarter until  the 20th quarter.'' As described above in this comment 37(i)-2, the  creditor may abbreviate ``quarter'' to ``quart.'' or ``Q.''</p><p class="depth0">37(i)(5) Principal and interest payments.</p><p class="depth0">1. Statement of periodic payment frequency. The subheading required  by Sec. 1026.37(i)(5) must include the unit-period of the transaction,  such as ``quarterly,'' ``bi-weekly,'' or ``annual.'' This unit-period  should be the same as disclosed under Sec. 1026.37(b)(3). See Sec.  1026.37(o)(5)(i).</p><p class="depth0">2. Initial payment adjustment unknown. The disclosure required by  Sec. 1026.37(i)(5) must state the number of the first payment for which  the regular periodic principal and interest payment may change. This  payment is typically set forth in the legal obligation. However, if the  exact payment number of the first adjustment is not known at the time  the creditor provides the Loan Estimate, the creditor must disclose the  earliest possible payment that may change under the terms of the legal  obligation, based on the information available to the creditor at the  time, as the initial payment number and amount.</p><p class="depth0">3. Subsequent changes. The disclosure required by Sec.  1026.37(i)(5) must state the frequency of adjustments to the regular  periodic principal and interest payment after the initial adjustment, if  any, expressed in years, except if adjustments are more frequent than  once every year, in which case the disclosure should be expressed as  payments. If there is only one adjustment of the periodic payment under  the terms of the legal obligation (for example, if the loan has an  interest only period for the first 60 payments and there are no  adjustments to the payment after the end of the interest only period),  the disclosure should state: ``No subsequent changes.'' If the loan has  graduated increases in the regular periodic payment every 12th payment,  the disclosure should state: ``Every year.'' If the frequency of  adjustments to the periodic payment may change under the terms of the  legal obligation, the disclosure should state the smallest period of  adjustments that may occur. For example, if an increase in the periodic  payment is scheduled every sixth payment for 36 payments, and then every  12th payment for the next 24 payments, the disclosure should state:  ``Every 6th payment.''</p><p class="depth0">4. Maximum payment. The disclosure required by Sec. 1026.37(i)(5)  must state the larger of the maximum scheduled or maximum potential  amount of a regular periodic principal and interest payment under the  terms of the legal obligation, as well as the payment number of the  first periodic principal and interest payment that can reach such  amount. If the disclosed payment is scheduled, Sec. 1026.37(i)(5)  requires that the disclosure state the payment number when such payment  is reached with the preceding text, ``starting at.'' If the disclosed  payment is only potential, as may be the case for a loan that permits  optional payments, the disclosure states the earliest payment number  when such payment can be reached with the preceding text, ``as early  as.'' Section 1026.37(i)(5) requires that the first possible periodic  principal and interest payment that can reach the maximum be disclosed.  For example, for a fixed interest rate optional-payment loan with  scheduled payments that result in negative amortization under the terms  of the legal obligation, the maximum periodic payment disclosed should  be based on the consumer having elected to make the periodic payments  that would increase the principal balance to the maximum amount at the  latest time possible before the loan begins to fully amortize, which  would cause the periodic principal and interest payment to be the  maximum possible. For example, if the earliest payment that could reach  the maximum principal balance was the 41st   payment at which time the loan would begin to amortize and the periodic  principal and interest payment would be recalculated, but the last  payment that permitted the principal balance to increase was the 60th  payment, the disclosure required by Sec. 1026.37(i)(5) must assume the  consumer only reaches the maximum principal balance at the 60th payment  because this would result in the maximum possible principal and interest  payment under the terms of the legal obligation. The disclosure must  state the maximum periodic principal and interest payment based on this  assumption and state ``as early as the 61st payment.''</p><p class="depth0">5. Payments that do not pay principal. Although the label of the  disclosure required by Sec. 1026.37(i)(5) is ``Principal and Interest  Payments,'' and the section refers to periodic principal and interest  payments, it includes a scheduled periodic payment that only covers some  or all of the interest that is due and not any principal (i.e., an  interest only or negatively amortizing payment).</p><p class="depth0">37(j) Adjustable interest rate table.</p><p class="depth0">1. When table is not permitted to be disclosed. The disclosure  described in Sec. 1026.37(j) is required only if the interest rate may  increase after consummation, either based on changes to an index or  scheduled changes to the interest rate. If the legal obligation does not  permit the interest rate to adjust after consummation, such as for a  ``Fixed Rate'' product under Sec. 1026.37(a)(10), this table is not  permitted to appear on the Loan Estimate. The creditor may not disclose  a blank table or a table with ``N/A'' inserted within each row.</p><p class="depth0">37(j)(1) Index and margin.</p><p class="depth0">1. Index and margin. The index disclosed pursuant to Sec.  1026.37(j)(1) must be stated such that a consumer reasonably can  identify it. A common abbreviation or acronym of the name of the index  may be disclosed in place of the proper name of the index, if it is a  commonly used public method of identifying the index. For example,  ``LIBOR'' may be disclosed instead of London Interbank Offered Rate. The  margin should be disclosed as a percentage. For example, if the contract  determines the interest rate by adding 4.25 percentage points to the  index, the margin should be disclosed as ``4.25%.''</p><p class="depth0">37(j)(2) Increases in interest rate.</p><p class="depth0">1. Adjustments not based on an index. If the legal obligation  includes both adjustments to the interest rate based on an external  index and scheduled and pre-determined adjustments to the interest rate,  such as for a ``Step Rate'' product under Sec. 1026.37(a)(10), the  disclosure required by Sec. 1026.37(j)(1), and not Sec. 1026.37(j)(2),  must be provided pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(j)(2). The disclosure  described in Sec. 1026.37(j)(2) is stated only if the product type does  not permit the interest rate to adjust based on an external index.</p><p class="depth0">37(j)(3) Initial interest rate.</p><p class="depth0">1. Interest rate at consummation. In all cases, the interest rate in  effect at consummation must be disclosed as the initial interest rate,  even if it will apply only for a short period, such as one month.</p><p class="depth0">37(j)(4) Minimum and maximum interest rate.</p><p class="depth0">1. Minimum interest rate. The minimum interest rate required to be  disclosed by Sec. 1026.37(j)(4) is the minimum interest rate that may  occur at any time during the term of the transaction, after any  introductory or ``teaser'' interest rate expires, under the terms of the  legal obligation, such as an interest rate ``floor.'' If the terms of  the legal obligation do not state a minimum interest rate, the minimum  interest rate that applies to the transaction under applicable law must  be disclosed. If the terms of the legal obligation do not state a  minimum interest rate, and no other minimum interest rate applies to the  transaction under applicable law, the amount of the margin is disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">2. Maximum interest rate. The maximum interest rate required to be  disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(j)(4) is the maximum interest rate  permitted under the terms of the legal obligation, such as an interest  rate ``cap.'' If the terms of the legal obligation do not specify a  maximum interest rate, the maximum interest rate permitted by applicable  law, such as State usury law, must be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">37(j)(5) Frequency of adjustments.</p><p class="depth0">1. Exact month unknown. The disclosure required by Sec.  1026.37(j)(5) must state the first month for which the interest rate may  change. This month is typically scheduled in the terms of the legal  obligation. However, if the exact month is not known at the time the  creditor provides the Loan Estimate, the creditor must disclose the  earliest possible month under the terms of the legal obligation, based  on the best information available to the creditor at the time.</p><p class="depth0">37(j)(6) Limits on interest rate changes.</p><p class="depth0">1. Different limits on subsequent interest rate adjustments. If more  than one limit applies to the amount of adjustments to the interest rate  after the initial adjustment, the greatest limit on subsequent  adjustments must be disclosed. For example, if the initial interest rate  adjustment is capped at two percent, the second adjustment is capped at  two and a half percent, and all subsequent adjustments are capped at  three percent, the disclosure required by Sec. 1026.37(j)(6)(ii) states  ``3%.''</p><p class="depth0">37(k) Contact information.</p><p class="depth0">1. NMLSR ID. Section 1026.37(k) requires the disclosure of an  Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry (NMLSR ID) number for  each creditor, mortgage broker, and loan officer identified on the Loan  Estimate. The NMLSR ID is a unique number or other identifier generally  assigned to individuals registered or licensed through NMLSR to provide  loan originating services. For more information, see the Secure and   Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (SAFE Act) sections  1503(3) and (12) and 1504 (12 U.S.C. 5102(3) and (12) and 5103), and its  implementing regulations (i.e., 12 CFR 1007.103(a) and 1008.103(a)(2)).  An entity may also have an NMLSR ID. Thus, if the creditor, mortgage  broker, or loan officer has obtained an NMLSR ID, the NMLSR IDs must be  provided in the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.37(k)(1) and (2).</p><p class="depth0">2. License number or unique identifier. Section 1026.37(k)(1) and  (2) requires the disclosure of a license number or unique identifier for  the creditor, mortgage broker, and loan officer if such entity or  individual has not obtained an NMLSR ID. In such event, if the  applicable State, locality, or other regulatory body with responsibility  for licensing and/or registering such entity's or individual's business  activities has issued a license number or other unique identifier to  such entity or individual, that number is disclosed. In addition, Sec.  1026.37(k)(1) and (2) require the abbreviation of the State of the  jurisdiction or regulatory body that issued such license or registration  is required to be included before the word ``License'' in the label  required by Sec. 1026.37(k)(1) and (2). If no such license or  registration is required to be disclosed, such as if an NMLSR number is  disclosed, the space provided for such an abbreviation in form H-24 of  appendix H to this part may be left blank. A U.S. Postal Service State  abbreviation complies with Sec. 1026.37(k)(1) and (2), if applicable.</p><p class="depth0">3. Contact. Section 1026.37(k)(2) requires the disclosure of the  name and NMLSR ID of the person who is the primary contact for the  consumer, labeled ``Loan Officer.'' The loan officer is generally the  natural person employed by the creditor or mortgage broker disclosed  under Sec. 1026.37(k)(1) who interacts most frequently with the  consumer and who has an NMLSR ID or, if none, a license number or other  unique identifier to be disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(k)(2), as  applicable.</p><p class="depth0">4. Email address and phone number. Section 1026.37(k)(3) requires  disclosure of the loan officer's email address and phone number.  Disclosure of a general number or email address for the loan officer's  lender or mortgage broker, as applicable, satisfies this requirement if  no such information is generally available for such person.</p><p class="depth0">37(l) Comparisons.</p><p class="depth0">37(l)(1) In five years.</p><p class="depth0">1. Loans with terms of less than five years. In transactions with a  scheduled loan term of less than 60 months, to comply with Sec.  1026.37(l)(1), the creditor discloses the amounts paid through the end  of the loan term.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 37(l)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Calculation of total payments in five years. The amount disclosed  pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(l)(1)(i) is the sum of principal, interest,  mortgage insurance, and loan costs scheduled to be paid through the end  of the 60th month after the due date of the first periodic payment. For  guidance on how to calculate interest for mortgage loans that are  Adjustable Rate products under Sec. 1026.37(a)(10)(i)(A) for purposes  of Sec. 1026.37(l)(1)(i), see comment 17(c)(1)-10. In addition, for  purposes of Sec. 1026.37(l)(1)(i), the creditor should assume that the  consumer makes payments as scheduled and on time. For purposes of Sec.  1026.37(l)(1)(i), mortgage insurance means ``mortgage insurance or any  fractional equivalent'' as defined pursuant to comment 37(c)(1)(i)(C)-1  and includes prepaid or escrowed mortgage insurance. Loan costs are  those costs disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(f).</p><p class="depth0">2. Negative amortization loans. For loans that have a negative  amortization feature under Sec. 1026.37(a)(10)(ii)(A), the creditor  calculates the total payments in five years using the scheduled  payments, even if it is a negatively amortizing payment amount, until  the consumer must begin making fully amortizing payments under the terms  of the legal obligation.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 37(l)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Calculation of principal paid in five years. The disclosure  required by Sec. 1026.37(l)(1)(ii) is calculated in the same manner as  the disclosure required by Sec. 1026.37(l)(1)(i), except that the  disclosed amount reflects only the total payments to principal through  the end of the 60th month after the due date of the first periodic  payment.</p><p class="depth0">37(l)(3) Total interest percentage.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. When calculating the total interest percentage, the  creditor assumes that the consumer will make each payment in full and on  time, and will not make any additional payments.</p><p class="depth0">2. Adjustable rate and step rate mortgages. For Adjustable Rate  products under Sec. 1026.37(a)(10)(i)(A), Sec. 1026.37(l)(3) requires  that the creditor compute the total interest percentage in accordance  with comment 17(c)(1)-10. For Step Rate products under Sec.  1026.37(a)(10)(i)(B), Sec. 1026.37(l)(3) requires that the creditor  compute the total interest percentage in accordance with Sec.  1026.17(c)(1) and its associated commentary.</p><p class="depth0">3. Negative amortization loans. For loans that have a negative  amortization feature under Sec. 1026.37(a)(10)(ii)(A), Sec.  1026.37(l)(3) requires that the creditor compute the total interest  percentage using the scheduled payment, even if it is a negatively  amortizing payment amount, until the consumer must begin making fully  amortizing payments under the terms of the legal obligation.</p><p class="depth0">37(m) Other considerations.</p><p class="depth0">37(m)(1) Appraisal.</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicability. The disclosure required by Sec. 1026.37(m)(1) is  only applicable to transactions subject to Sec. 1026.19(e) that are  also subject either to 15 U.S.C. 1639h or 1691(e) or   both, as implemented by this part or Regulation B, 12 CFR part 1002,  respectively. Accordingly, if a transaction is not also subject to  either or both of these provisions, as implemented by this part or  Regulation B, respectively, the disclosure required by Sec.  1026.37(m)(1) may be omitted from the Loan Estimate as described by  comment 37-1 as illustrated by form H-24 of appendix H to this part. For  transactions subject to section 1639h but not section 1691(e), the  creditor may delete the word ``promptly'' from the disclosure required  by Sec. 1026.37(m)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">2. Consummation. Section 1026.37(m)(1) requires the creditor to  disclose that it will provide a copy of any appraisal, even if the  transaction is not consummated. On form H-24, the disclosure required by  Sec. 1026.37(m)(1) states that the creditor will provide an appraisal,  even if the ``loan does not close.'' Pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(o)(3),  the disclosure required by Sec. 1026.37(m)(1) is that illustrated by  form H-24.</p><p class="depth0">37(m)(2) Assumption.</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosure. Section 1026.37(m)(2) requires the creditor to  disclose whether or not a third party may be allowed to assume the loan  on its original terms if the property is sold or transferred by the  consumer. In many cases, the creditor cannot determine, at the time the  disclosure is made, whether a loan may be assumable at a future date on  its original terms. For example, the assumption clause commonly used in  mortgages sold to the Federal National Mortgage Association and the  Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation conditions an assumption on a  variety of factors, such as the creditworthiness of the subsequent  borrower, the potential for impairment of the creditor's security, and  the execution of an assumption agreement by the subsequent borrower. If  the creditor can determine that such assumption is not permitted, the  creditor complies with Sec. 1026.37(m)(2) by disclosing that the loan  is not assumable. In all other situations, including where assumption of  a loan is permitted or is dependent on certain conditions or factors, or  uncertainty exists as to the future assumability of a mortgage loan, the  creditor complies with Sec. 1026.37(m)(2) by disclosing that, under  certain conditions, the creditor may allow a third party to assume the  loan on its original terms.</p><p class="depth0">2. Original terms. For purposes of Sec. 1026.37(m)(2), the  imposition of an assumption fee is not a departure from the original  terms of the obligation but a modification of the legal obligation, such  as a change in the contract interest rate, represents a departure from  the original terms.</p><p class="depth0">37(m)(3) Homeowner's insurance.</p><p class="depth0">1. Optional disclosure. Section 1026.37(m)(3) provides that  creditors may, but are not required to, disclose a statement of whether  homeowner's insurance is required on the property and whether the  consumer may choose the insurance provider, labeled ``Homeowner's  Insurance.''</p><p class="depth0">2. Relation to the finance charge. Section 1026.4(d)(2) describes  the conditions under which a creditor may exclude premiums for  homeowner's insurance from the finance charge. For transactions subject  to Sec. 1026.19(e), a creditor satisfies Sec. 1026.4(d)(2)(i) by  disclosing the statement described in Sec. 1026.37(m)(3).</p><p class="depth0">37(m)(4) Late payment.</p><p class="depth0">1. Definition. Section 1026.37(m)(4) requires a disclosure if  charges are added to an individual delinquent installment by a creditor  that otherwise considers the transaction ongoing on its original terms.  Late payment charges do not include: (i) The right of acceleration; (ii)  fees imposed for actual collection costs, such as repossession charges  or attorney's fees; (iii) referral and extension charges; or (iv) the  continued accrual of simple interest at the contract rate after the  payment due date. However, an increase in the interest rate on account  of a late payment by the consumer is a late payment charge to the extent  of the increase.</p><p class="depth0">2. Applicability of State law. Many State laws authorize the  calculation of late charges as either a percentage of the delinquent  payment amount or a specified dollar amount, and permit the imposition  of the lesser or greater of the two calculations. The language provided  in the disclosure may reflect the requirements and alternatives allowed  under State law.</p><p class="depth0">37(m)(6) Servicing.</p><p class="depth0">1. Creditor's intent. Section 1026.37(m)(6) requires the creditor to  disclose whether it intends to service the loan directly or transfer  servicing to another servicer after consummation. A creditor complies  with Sec. 1026.37(m)(6) if the disclosure reflects the creditor's  intent at the time the Loan Estimate is issued.</p><p class="depth0">37(m)(7) Liability after foreclosure.</p><p class="depth0">1. When statement is not permitted to be disclosed. The disclosure  described by Sec. 1026.37(m)(7) is required under the condition  specified by Sec. 1026.37(m)(7), specifically, if the purpose of the  credit transaction is a refinance under Sec. 1026.37(a)(9)(ii). Under  any other conditions, this statement is not permitted to appear in the  Loan Estimate.</p><p class="depth0">37(n) Signature statement.</p><p class="depth0">1. Signature line optional. Whether a signature line is provided  under Sec. 1026.37(n) is determined solely by the creditor. If a  signature line is provided, however, the disclosure must include the  statement required by Sec. 1026.37(n)(1).</p><p class="depth0">2. Multiple consumers. If there is more than one consumer who will  be obligated in the transaction, the first consumer signs as the  applicant and each additional consumer signs as a co-applicant. If there  is not enough space under the heading ``Confirm Receipt'' to provide  signature lines for every   consumer in the transaction, the creditor may add additional signature  pages, as needed, at the end of the form for the remaining consumers'  signatures. However, the creditor is required to disclose the heading  and statement required by Sec. 1026.37(m)(7) on such additional pages.</p><p class="depth0">3. Consumer's name. The creditor may insert the consumer's name  under the signature line, rather than using the designation  ``Applicant'' or ``Co-Applicant'' as illustrated in form H-24 of  appendix H to this part, but is not required to do so pursuant to Sec.  1026.37(n)(1).</p><p class="depth0">37(o) Form of disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">37(o)(1) General requirements.</p><p class="depth0">1. Clear and conspicuous; segregation. The clear and conspicuous  standard requires that the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.37 be  legible and in a readily understandable form. Section 1026.37(o)(1)(i)  requires that the disclosures be grouped together and segregated from  everything else. For example, creditors may not add additional pages in  between the pages of the Loan Estimate, or attach to the Loan Estimate  additional pages that are not provided for under Sec. 1026.37 after the  last page of the Loan Estimate. As required by Sec. 1026.37(o)(3)(i),  the disclosures for any transaction that is a federally related mortgage  loan under Regulation X, 12 CFR 1024.2, must be made using the standard  form H-24 of appendix H to this part. Accordingly, use of that form  constitutes compliance with the clear and conspicuous and segregation  requirements of Sec. 1026.37(o). In addition, Sec. 1026.37(o)(1)(ii)  requires creditors to disclose on the Loan Estimate only the information  required by Sec. 1026.37(a) through (n), except as otherwise provided  by Sec. 1026.37(o), and in the same order, and positioned relative to  the master headings, headings, subheadings, labels, and similar  designations in the same manner, as shown in form H-24, set forth in  appendix H to this part. For example, creditors may not use form H-24,  but include in the Loan Terms table under the subheading ``Can this  amount increase after closing?'' information that is not required by  Sec. 1026.37(b)(6).</p><p class="depth0">2. Balloon payment financing with leasing characteristics. In  certain credit sale or loan transactions, a consumer may reduce the  dollar amount of the payments to be made during the transaction by  agreeing to make, at the end of the loan term, a large final payment  based on the expected residual value of the property. The consumer may  have a number of options with respect to the final payment, including,  among other things, retaining the property and making the final payment,  refinancing the final payment, or transferring the property to the  creditor in lieu of the final payment. Such transactions may have some  of the characteristics of lease transactions subject to Regulation M (12  CFR part 1013), but are considered credit transactions where the  consumer assumes the indicia of ownership, including the risks, burdens,  and benefits of ownership, upon consummation. These transactions are  governed by the disclosure requirements of this part instead of  Regulation M. Under Sec. 1026.37(o)(1)(ii), creditors may not include  any additional information with the disclosures required by Sec.  1026.37, except as provided in Sec. 1026.37(o)(5). Thus, the  disclosures must show the large final payment as a balloon payment in  the projected payments table required by Sec. 1026.37(c) and should  not, for example, reflect the other options available to the consumer at  maturity.</p><p class="depth0">37(o)(2) Headings and labels.</p><p class="depth0">1. Estimated amounts. Section 1026.37(o)(2) incorporates the  ``estimated'' designations reflected on form H-24 of appendix H to this  part into the disclosure requirements of Sec. 1026.37, even if the  relevant provision of Sec. 1026.37 does not expressly require or permit  disclosure of the word ``estimate.'' Where form H-24 uses the  abbreviation ``est.'' in place of the word ``estimated,'' Sec.  1026.37(o)(2) also incorporates that designation into its requirement.  For example, Sec. 1026.37(c)(2)(iv) requires disclosure of the total  periodic payment labeled ``Total Monthly Payment,'' but the label on  form H-24 contains the designation ``Estimated'' and thus, the label  required by Sec. 1026.37(c)(2)(iv) must contain the designation  ``Estimated.'' Although many of the disclosures required by Sec.  1026.38 cross-reference their counterparts in Sec. 1026.37, Sec.  1026.38(t) incorporates the ``estimated'' designations reflected on form  H-25, not form H-24.</p><p class="depth0">37(o)(3) Form.</p><p class="depth0">1. Non-federally related mortgage loans. For a non-federally related  mortgage loan, the creditor is not required to use form H-24 of appendix  H to this part, although its use as a model form for such transactions,  if properly completed with accurate content, constitutes compliance with  the clear and conspicuous and segregation requirements of Sec.  1026.37(o)(1)(i). Even when the creditor elects not to use the model  form, Sec. 1026.37(o)(1) requires that the disclosures be grouped  together and segregated from everything else; contain only the  information required by Sec. 1026.37(a) through (n); and be provided in  the same order as they occur in form H-24, using the same relative  positions of the headings, labels, and similar designations as shown in  the form. In addition, Sec. 1026.37(o)(2) requires that the creditor  include the designation of ``estimated'' for all headings, subheading,  labels, and similar designations required by Sec. 1026.37 for which  form H-24 contains the ``estimated'' designation in such heading,  subheading, label, or similar designation. The disclosures required by  Sec. 1026.37 comply with the requirement to be in a format  substantially similar to form   H-24 when provided on letter size (8.5[sec] x 11[sec]) paper.</p><p class="depth0">37(o)(4) Rounding.</p><p class="depth0">1. Rounding. Consistent with Sec. 1026.2(b)(4), except as otherwise  provided in Sec. 1026.37(o)(4), any amount required to be disclosed by  Sec. 1026.37 is not permitted to be rounded and is disclosed using  decimal places where applicable, unless otherwise provided.</p><p class="depth0">2. Calculations. If a dollar amount that is required to be rounded  by Sec. 1026.37(o)(4)(i) on the Loan Estimate is a total of one or more  dollar amounts that are not required or permitted to be rounded, the  total amount must be rounded consistent with Sec. 1026.37(o)(4)(i), but  such component amounts used in the calculation must use such unrounded  numbers. In addition, if any such unrounded component amount is required  to be disclosed under Sec. 1026.37, consistent with Sec. 1026.2(b)(4),  it should be disclosed as an unrounded number. If an amount that is  required to be rounded by Sec. 1026.37(o)(4)(i) on the Loan Estimate is  a total of one or more components that are also required to be rounded  by Sec. 1026.37(o)(4)(i), the total amount must be calculated using  such rounded amounts. For example, the subtotals required to be  disclosed by Sec. 1026.37(f)(1), (2), and (3) are calculated using the  rounded amounts disclosed under those subsections. See also comment  37(o)(4)(i)(C)-1. However, the amounts required to be disclosed by Sec.  1026.37(l) reference actual amounts for their components, rather than  other amounts disclosed under Sec. 1026.37 and rounded pursuant to  Sec. 1026.37(o)(4)(i), and thus, they are calculated using unrounded  numbers.</p><p class="depth0">37(o)(4)(i) Nearest dollar.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 37(o)(4)(i)(A).</p><p class="depth0">1. Rounding of dollar amounts. Section 1026.37(o)(4)(i)(A) requires  that certain dollar amounts be rounded to the nearest whole dollar. For  example, pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(o)(4)(i)(A), periodic mortgage  insurance payments of $164.50 are required to be disclosed under Sec.  1026.37(c)(2)(ii) as $165. However, if the periodic mortgage insurance  payment equaled $164.49, the creditor would disclose $164.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 37(o)(4)(i)(B).</p><p class="depth0">1. Rounding of loan amount. Section 1026.37(o)(4)(i)(B) requires the  loan amount to be disclosed truncated at the decimal place if the loan  amount is a whole number. For example, if Sec. 1026.37(b)(1) requires  disclosure of a loan amount of $481,516.23, the creditor discloses the  amount as $481,516.23. However, if the loan amount required to be  disclosed were $481,516.00, the creditor would disclose $481,516.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 37(o)(4)(i)(C).</p><p class="depth0">1. Rounding of the total monthly payment. Section  1026.37(o)(4)(i)(C) requires the total monthly payment amount disclosed  under Sec. 1026.37(c)(2)(iv) to be rounded if any of its components are  rounded. For example, if the total monthly payment disclosed under Sec.  1026.37(c)(2)(iv) is composed of a $2,000.49 periodic principal and  interest payment required to be disclosed by Sec. 1026.37(c)(2)(i) and  a $164.49 periodic mortgage insurance payment required to be disclosed  by Sec. 1026.37(c)(2)(ii), the creditor would calculate the total  monthly payment by adding the exact periodic principal and interest  payment of $2,000.49 and the rounded periodic mortgage insurance payment  of $164, round the total, and disclose $2,164.</p><p class="depth0">37(o)(4)(ii) Percentages.</p><p class="depth0">1. Decimal places. Section 1026.37(o)(4)(ii) requires the percentage  amounts disclosed to be truncated at the decimal point, if the amount is  a whole number. For example, a 7.005 percent annual percentage rate is  disclosed in compliance with Sec. 1026.37(o)(4)(ii) as ``7.005%,'' but  a 7.000 percent annual percentage rate would be disclosed as ``7%.'' If  any percentage amounts required to be disclosed contain more than three  decimal places, they shall be rounded to three decimal places.</p><p class="depth0">37(o)(5) Exceptions.</p><p class="depth0">1. Permissible changes. The changes required or permitted by Sec.  1026.37(o)(5) are permitted for federally related mortgage loans for  which the use of form H-24 is required under Sec. 1026.37(o)(3). For  non-federally related mortgage loans, the changes required or permitted  by Sec. 1026.37(o)(5) do not affect the substance, clarity, or  meaningful sequence of the disclosure and therefore, are permissible.  Any changes to the disclosure not specified in Sec. 1026.37(o)(5) or  not permitted by other provisions of Sec. 1026.37 are not permissible  for federally related mortgage loans. Creditors in non-federally related  mortgage loans making any changes that affect the substance, clarity, or  meaningful sequence of the disclosure will lose their protection from  civil liability under TILA section 130.</p><p class="depth0">2. Manual completion. Section 1026.37(o) does not require the  creditor to use a computer, typewriter, or other word processor to  complete the disclosure form. The information and amounts required to be  disclosed by Sec. 1026.37 on form H-24 of appendix H to this part may  be filled in by hand printing or using any other method, provided the  information is clear and legible and complies with the formatting  required by form H-24, including replicating bold font where required.</p><p class="depth0">3. Contact information. If a transaction involves more than one  creditor or mortgage broker, the space provided on form H-24 of appendix  H to this part for the contact information required by Sec. 1026.37(m)  may be altered to add additional labels to accommodate the additional  information of such parties, provided that the information required by  Sec. 1026.37(l), (m), and (n) are disclosed on the same page as  illustrated by form H-24. If the space provided on form H-24 of appendix   H to this part does not allow for the disclosure of such contact and  other information on the same page, an additional page may be added to  provide the required contact information with an appropriate reference  to the additional page.</p><p class="depth0">4. Unit-period. Section 1026.37(o)(5)(i) provides that wherever form  H-24 or Sec. 1026.37 uses ``monthly'' to describe the frequency of any  payments or uses ``month'' to describe the applicable unit-period, the  creditor is required to substitute the appropriate term to reflect the  fact that the transaction's terms provide for other than monthly  periodic payments, such as bi-weekly or quarterly payments. For purposes  of Sec. 1026.37, the term ``unit-period'' has the same meaning as in  appendix J to Regulation Z.</p><p class="depth0">5. Additional page. Information required or permitted to be  disclosed by Sec. 1026.37 on a separate page should be formatted  similarly to form H-24 of appendix H to this part, so as not to affect  the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the disclosure. In  addition, information provided on additional pages should be  consolidated on as few pages as necessary to not affect the substance,  clarity, or meaningful sequence of the disclosure.</p><p class="depth0">6. Translation. Section 1026.37(o)(5)(ii) permits the translation of  form H-24 into languages other than English, consistent with Sec.  1026.27. Pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(o)(5)(ii) creditors may modify form  H-24 to the extent that translation prevents the headings, labels,  designations, and required disclosure items under Sec. 1026.37 from  fitting in the space provided on form H-24. For example, if the  translation of a required label does not fit within the line provided  for such label in form H-24, the label may be disclosed over two lines.  See form H-28 of appendix H to this part for Spanish translations of  form H-24.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.38--Content of Disclosures for Certain Mortgage</p><p class="depth0">Transactions (Closing Disclosure)</p><p class="depth0">1. Disclosures not applicable. Where a disclosure is not applicable  to a particular transaction, form H-25 of appendix H to this part may  not be modified to state ``not applicable'' or ``N/A.'' The portion of  the form pertaining to the inapplicable disclosure may be left blank  unless otherwise provided by Sec. 1026.38. For example, the disclosure  required by Sec. 1026.38(r) of the consumer's or seller's real estate  broker may be left blank for a transaction that does not involve real  estate brokers, such as a refinance or home equity loan. As provided in  Sec. 1026.38(m) and (n), however, the adjustable payment and adjustable  interest rate tables required by those paragraphs may be included only  if those disclosures are applicable to the transaction and otherwise  must be excluded.</p><p class="depth0">2.

The disclosures required by Sec. 1026.38  are required to reflect the actual terms of the legal obligation between  the parties, and the actual costs associated with the settlement of the  transaction. Creditors and settlement agents may estimate disclosures as  provided pursuant to Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(i) when the actual term or cost  is unknown at the time the disclosures are made. See Sec.

Alternative property. For guidance on disclosing the location of  a property for which an address is unavailable, see the commentary to  Sec. 1026.37(a)(6). Where personal property also secures the credit  transaction, a description of that property may be disclosed, at the  creditor's option, pursuant to Sec. 1026.38(a)(3)(vi). If the form does  not provide enough space to disclose a description of personal property  under Sec. 1026.38(a)(3)(vi), at the creditor's option an additional  page may be used and appended to the end of the form provided that the  creditor complies with the requirements of Sec. 1026.38(t)(3).</p><p class="depth0">38(a)(3)(vii) Sale price.</p><p class="depth0">1. No seller. In transactions where there is no seller, such as in a  refinancing, Sec. 1026.38(a)(3)(vii)(B) requires the creditor to  disclose the appraised value of the property. To comply with this  requirement, the creditor discloses the value determined by the  appraisal or valuation used to determine approval of the credit  transaction. If the creditor has not obtained an appraisal, the creditor  may disclose the estimated value of the property. Where an estimate is  disclosed, rather than an appraisal, the label for the disclosure is  changed to ``Estimated Prop. Value.'' The creditor may use the estimate  provided by the consumer at application, or if it has performed its own  estimate of the property value by the time the disclosure is   provided to the consumer, disclose that estimate provided that it was  the estimate the creditor used to determine approval of the credit  transaction.</p><p class="depth0">2.

Same identification number as Loan Estimate. The loan  identification number disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.38(a)(5)(v) must  be one that enables the creditor, consumer, and other parties to  identify the transaction as the same transaction disclosed on the Loan  Estimate. The loan identification number may contain any alpha-numeric  characters. If a creditor uses the same loan identification number on  several revised Loan Estimates to the consumer, but adds after such  number a hyphen and a number to denote the number of revised Loan  Estimates in sequence, the creditor must disclose the loan  identification number before such hyphen on the Closing Disclosure to  identify the transaction as the same for which the initial and revised  Loan Estimates were provided.</p><p class="depth0">38(b) Loan terms.</p><p class="depth0">1.

Required use. The disclosure of the cash to close table in Sec.  1026.38(d)(2) may only be provided by a creditor in a transaction  without a seller. The use of this alternative table for transactions  without a seller is required if the Loan Estimate provided to the  consumer disclosed the optional alternative table pursuant to Sec.  1026.37(d)(2), and must be used in conjunction with the use of the  alternative calculating cash to close disclosure under Sec. 1026.38(e).</p><p class="depth0">2. Method of indication. The indication of whether the cash is  either due from or payable to the consumer is made by the use of check  boxes as shown in form H-25(J) of appendix H to this part. Forms H-25(E)  and H-25(G) of appendix H to this part contain examples of the use of  these checkboxes.</p><p class="depth0">38(e) Alternative calculating cash to close table for transactions  without a seller.</p><p class="depth0">1. Required use. The disclosure of the table in Sec. 1026.38(e) may  only be provided by a creditor in a transaction without a seller. The  use of this alternative calculating cash to close table for transactions  without a seller is required for transactions in which the Loan Estimate  provided to the consumer disclosed the optional alternative table  pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(h)(2), and must be used in conjunction with  the alternative disclosure under Sec. 1026.38(d)(2).</p><p class="depth0">2. More prominent disclosures. Section 1026.38(e)(1)(iii), (2)(iii),  (3)(iii), and (4)(iii) requires that statements are given as to whether  the ``Final'' amount disclosed under each subparagraph (ii) of Sec.  1026.38(e)(1) through (e)(4) is different than or equal to, and in some  cases whether the amount is greater than or less than, the corresponding  ``Loan Estimate'' amount disclosed under each subparagraph (i) of Sec.  1026.38(e)(1) through (e)(4). These statements are more prominent than  the other disclosures under Sec. 1026.38(e). The statement of whether  the estimated and final amounts are different, stated as a ``Yes'' or  ``No'' in capital letters and in boldface, under the subheading ``Did  this change?,'' as shown on forms H-25(E) and H-25(G) of appendix H to  this part, complies with the requirement to state whether the amounts  are different more prominently. Such statement of ``No'' satisfies the  requirement to state that the estimated and final amounts are equal, and  these sections do not provide for any narrative text to be included with  such statement. The prominence requirement also requires that, in the  event an increase or decrease in costs has occurred, certain words  within the narrative text to be included under the subheading ``Did this  change?'' for a ``Yes'' answer are   displayed more prominently than other disclosures. For example, under  Sec. 1026.38(e)(2)(iii)(A), this more prominent statement could take  the form of the phrases ``Total Loan Costs (D)'' and ``Total Other Costs  (I)'' being shown in boldface, as shown on forms H-25(E) and H-25(G) of  appendix H to this part. See comment 38(e)-4 for further guidance  regarding the prominence of such statements.</p><p class="depth0">3. Statements of differences. The dollar amounts disclosed under  Sec. 1026.38 generally are shown to two decimal places unless otherwise  required. See comment 38(t)(4)-1. As a result, any ``Final'' amount that  is disclosed in the alternative ``Calculating Cash to Close'' table  under Sec. 1026.38(e) is shown to two decimal places unless otherwise  required. Pursuant to Sec. 1026.38(t)(4)(i)(C), however, any ``Loan  Estimate'' amount that is disclosed in the alternative ``Calculating  Cash to Close'' table under Sec. 1026.38(e) is shown to the nearest  dollar amount, and thus matches the corresponding estimated amount  disclosed on the Loan Estimate's ``Calculating Cash to Close'' table  under Sec. 1026.37(h), which is shown to the nearest whole dollar  pursuant to Sec. 1026.37(o)(4)(i)(A). For this reason, a ``Final''  amount shown to two decimal places could be a larger number than its  corresponding ``Estimate'' amount shown to the nearest whole dollar,  when, in fact, the apparent increase is due solely to rounding.  Therefore, for purposes of Sec. 1026.38(e)(1)(iii), (2)(iii), (3)(iii),  and (4)(iii), each statement of a change between the amounts disclosed  on the Loan Estimate and the Closing Disclosure is based on the actual,  non-rounded estimate that would have been disclosed on the Loan Estimate  under Sec. 1026.37(h) if it had been shown to two decimal places rather  than a whole dollar amount. For example, if the ``Loan Estimate'' amount  of ``Total Closing Costs'' disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(e)(2)(i) is  $12,500, and the ``Final'' amount of ``Total Closing Costs'' disclosed  under Sec. 1026.38(e)(2)(ii) is $12,500.35, then even though the table  would appear to show a $0.35 increase in ``Total Closing Costs,'' no  statement of such increase is given under Sec. 1026.38(e)(2)(iii) so  long as the actual, non-rounded estimate (i.e., the estimated amount of  ``Total Closing Costs'' that would have been shown on the Loan Estimate  to two decimal places) is equal to $12,500.35.</p><p class="depth0">4. Statements that the consumer should see details. The provisions  of Sec. 1026.38(e)(2)(iii)(A) and (e)(4)(iii)(A) each require a  statement that the consumer should see certain details of the closing  costs disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(f), (g), or (t). Forms H-25(E) and  H-25(G) of appendix H to this part contain examples of these statements.  For example, Sec. 1026.38(e)(4)(iii)(A) requires a statement that the  consumer should see the details disclosed pursuant to Sec.  1026.38(t)(5)(vii)(B), and, as shown on forms H-25(E) and H-25(G) of  appendix H to this part, the statement, ``See Payoffs and Payments,'' in  which the words ``Payoffs and Payments'' are in boldface, complies with  this provision.</p><p class="depth0">5. Statement of increase or decrease. Section 1026.38(e)(1)(iii)(A)  requires a statement of whether the loan amount increased or decreased.  A creditor complies with this requirement by disclosing, ``This amount  increased'' or ``This amount decreased'' with the words ``increase'' and  ``decrease'' in boldface font.</p><p class="depth0">38(e)(1) Loan amount.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 38(e)(1)(iii)(A).</p><p class="depth0">1. Statements of increases or decreases. Section  1026.38(e)(1)(iii)(A) requires a statement of whether the amount  increased or decreased from the estimated amount. For Sec.  1026.38(e)(1)(iii)(A), the statement, ``You increased this amount,'' in  which the word ``increased'' is in boldface font and is replaced with  the word ``decreased'' as applicable, complies with this provision.</p><p class="depth0">38(e)(2) Total closing costs.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 38(e)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Reference to disclosure of total closing costs. Under Sec.  1026.38(e)(2)(i), the amount disclosed is labeled ``Total Closing  Costs,'' and such label is accompanied by a reference to the disclosure  of ``Total Closing Costs'' under Sec. 1026.38(h)(1). This reference may  take the form, for example, of a cross-reference in parenthesis to the  row on the table disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(h) that includes the  itemized amount for ``Total Closing Costs,'' as shown on form H-25 of  appendix H to this part.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 38(e)(2)(iii)(A).</p><p class="depth0">1. Statements and references regarding the total loan costs and  total other costs. Under Sec. 1026.38(e)(2)(iii)(A), the statements  under the subheading ``Did this change?'' that the consumer should see  the total loan costs and total other costs subtotals disclosed on the  Closing Disclosure under Sec. 1026.38(f)(4) and (g)(5) are made only if  and to the extent the difference in the ``Total Closing Costs'' is  attributable to differences in itemized charges that are included in  either or both of such subtotals.</p><p class="depth0">i. For example, if an increase in the ``Total Closing Costs'' is  attributable only to an increase in the appraisal fee (which is an  itemized charge on the Closing Disclosure under the subheading  ``Services Borrower Did Not Shop For,'' itself under the heading ``Loan  Costs''), then a statement is given under the subheading ``Did this  change?'' that the consumer should see the total loan costs subtotal  disclosed on the Closing Disclosure under Sec. 1026.38(f)(4). If the  increase in ``Total Closing Costs'' is attributable only to an increase  in recording fees (which is an itemized charge on the Closing Disclosure  under the subheading ``Taxes and Other Government Fees,'' itself under  the heading ``Other Costs''), then a statement is given   under the subheading ``Did this change?'' that the consumer should see  the total other costs subtotal disclosed on the Closing Disclosure under  Sec. 1026.38(g)(5). If, however, the increase is attributable in part  to an increase in the appraisal fee and in part to an increase in the  recording fee, then a statement is given under the subheading ``Did this  change?'' that the consumer should see the total loan costs and total  other costs subtotals disclosed on the Closing Disclosure under Sec.  1026.38(f)(4) and (g)(5).</p><p class="depth0">ii. For guidance regarding the requirement that this statement be  accompanied by a reference to the disclosures of the total loan costs  and total other costs under Sec. 1026.38(f)(4) and (g)(5), see comment  38(e)(2)(i)-1. For an example of such reference, see form H-25 of  appendix H to this part.</p><p class="depth0">2. Disclosure of excess amounts above limitations on increases in  closing costs.</p><p class="depth0">i. Because certain closing costs, individually, are subject to the  limitations on increases in closing costs under Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(i)  (e.g., fees paid to the creditor, transfer taxes, fees paid to an  affiliate of the creditor), while other closing costs are collectively  subject to the limitations on increases in closing costs under Sec.  1026.19(e)(3)(ii) (e.g., recording fees, fees paid to an unaffiliated  third party identified by the creditor if the creditor permitted the  consumer to shop for the service provider), Sec. 1026.38(e)(2)(iii)(A)  requires the creditor or closing agent to calculate subtotals for each  type of excess amount, and then add such subtotals together to yield the  dollar amount to be disclosed in the table. See commentary to Sec.  1026.19(e)(3) for additional guidance on calculating excess amounts  above the limitations on increases in closing costs under Sec.  1026.19(e)(3).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Under Sec. 1026.38(e)(2)(iii)(A), calculation of the excess  amounts above the limitations on increases in closing costs takes into  account that the itemized, estimated closing costs disclosed on the Loan  Estimate will not result in charges to the consumer if the service is  not actually provided at or before consummation. For example, if the  Loan Estimate included under ``Services You Cannot Shop For'' a $30  charge for a ``title courier fee,'' but the title company elects to  hand-deliver the title documents package to the creditor at no charge,  the $30 fee is not factored into the calculation of the ``Total Closing  Costs'' that are subject to the limitations on increases in closing  costs. However, if the title courier fee was assessed, but at only $15,  the charge is factored into the calculation because the third party  service was actually provided, albeit at a lower amount than estimated.  For an example, see form H-25 of appendix H to this part.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Under Sec. 1026.38(e)(2)(iii)(A), calculation of the excess  amounts above the limitations on increases in closing costs takes into  account that certain itemized charges listed on the Loan Estimate under  the subheading ``Services You Can Shop For'' may be subject to different  limitations depending on the circumstances. Such a charge would be  subject to the limitations under Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(i) if the consumer  decided to use a provider affiliated with the creditor. However, the  same charge would instead be subject to the limitations under Sec.  1026.19(e)(3)(ii) if the consumer selected a third party service  provider unaffiliated with but identified by the creditor, and the  creditor permitted the consumer to shop for the service provider. See  commentary to Sec. 1026.19(e)(3) for additional guidance on calculating  excess amounts above the limitations on increases in closing costs under  Sec. 1026.19(e)(3).</p><p class="depth0">38(e)(3) Closing costs paid before closing.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 38(e)(3)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Estimate of closing costs paid before closing. Under Sec.  1026.38(e)(3)(i), the ``Loan Estimate'' amount for ``Closing Costs  Subtotal Paid Before Closing'' is always shown as ``$0,'' because an  estimate of such amount is not disclosed on the Loan Estimate.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 38(e)(3)(iii)(B).</p><p class="depth0">1. Equal amount. Under Sec. 1026.38(e)(3)(iii)(B), the creditor or  settlement agent gives a statement that the ``Final'' amount disclosed  under Sec. 1026.38(e)(3)(ii) is equal to the ``Loan Estimate'' amount  disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(e)(3)(i), only if the ``Final'' amount is  $0, because the ``Loan Estimate'' amount is always disclosed as $0  pursuant to Sec. 1026.38(e)(3)(i).

All compensation paid to a loan  originator, as defined by Sec. 1026.36(a)(1), that is a third-party  associated with the transaction, regardless of the party that pays the  compensation, must be disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.38(f)(1).  Compensation from the consumer to a third-party loan originator is  designated as borrower-paid at or before closing, as applicable, on the  Closing Disclosure. Compensation from the creditor to a third-party loan  originator is designated as paid by others on the Closing Disclosure.  Compensation to a third-party loan originator from both the consumer and  the creditor in the transaction is prohibited under Sec. 1026.36(d)(2).</p><p class="depth0">3. Calculating compensation to a loan originator from the creditor.  The amount disclosed as paid from the creditor to a third-party loan  originator under Sec. 1026.38(f)(1) is the dollar value of salaries,  commissions, and any financial or similar compensation provided to a  third-party loan originator by the creditor that are considered to be  points and fees under Sec. 1026.32(b)(1)(ii).

Owner's title insurance premium. In a jurisdiction where  simultaneous issuance title insurance rates are permitted, any owner's  title insurance premium disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(g)(4) is  calculated by using the full   owner's title insurance premium, adding any simultaneous issuance  premium for issuance of lender's coverage, and then deducting the full  premium for lender's coverage disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(f)(2) or  (f)(3). Section 1026.38(g)(4)(i) requires that the disclosure of the  cost of the premium for an owner's title insurance policy include  ``Title--'' at the beginning of the label. In addition, Sec.  1026.38(g)(4)(ii) requires that the disclosure of the cost of the  premium for an owner's title insurance policy include the parenthetical  ``(optional)'' at the end of the label when designated borrower-paid at  or before closing.</p><p class="depth0">3.

The amount of real estate commissions  pursuant to Sec. 1026.38(g)(4) must be the total amount paid to any  real estate brokerage as a commission, regardless of the identity of the  party holding any earnest money deposit. Additional charges made by real  estate brokerages or agents to the seller or consumer are itemized  separately as additional items for services rendered, with a description  of the service and an identification of the person ultimately receiving  the payment.</p><p class="depth0">38(g)(6) Subtotal of costs.</p><p class="depth0">1.

General lender credits. When the consumer receives a generalized  credit from the creditor for closing costs, the amount of the credit  must be disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(h)(3). However, if such credit is  attributable to a specific loan cost or other cost listed in the Closing  Cost Details tables, pursuant to Sec. 1026.38(f) or (g), that amount  should be reflected in the Paid by Others column in the Closing Cost  Details tables under Sec. 1026.38(f) or (g).

For a  discussion of general lender credits and lender credits for specific  charges, see comment 19(e)(3)(i)-5.</p><p class="depth0">2. Credits for excess charges. Credits from the creditor to offset  an amount charged in excess of the limitations described in Sec.  1026.19(e)(3) are disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.38(h)(3), along with  a statement that such amount was paid to offset an excess charge, with  funds other than closing funds. If an excess charge to the consumer is  discovered after consummation and a refund provided, the corrected  disclosure must be provided to the consumer under Sec.  1026.19(f)(2)(v). For an example, see form H-25(F) of appendix H to this  part.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 38(h)(4).</p><p class="depth0">1. Consistent terminology and order of charges. On the Closing  Disclosure the creditor must label the corresponding services and costs  disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(f) and (g) using terminology that  describes each item, as applicable, and must use terminology or the  prescribed label, as applicable, that is consistent with that used on  the Loan Estimate to identify each corresponding item. In addition,  Sec. 1026.38(h)(4) requires the creditor to list the items disclosed  under each subcategory of charges in a consistent order. If costs move  between subheadings under Sec. 1026.38(f)(2) and (f)(3), listing the  costs in alphabetical order in each subheading category is considered to  be in compliance with Sec. 1026.38(h)(4). See comment 37(f)(5)-1 for  guidance regarding the requirement to use terminology that describes the  items to be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0">38(i) Calculating cash to close.</p><p class="depth0">1. More prominent disclosures. Section 1026.38(i)(1)(iii), (2)(iii),  (3)(iii), (4)(iii), (5)(iii), (6)(iii), (7)(iii), and (8)(iii) requires  that statements are given as to whether the ``Final'' amount disclosed  under each subparagraph (ii) of Sec. 1026.38(i)(1) through (i)(8) is  different or equal to, and in some cases whether the amount is greater  than or less than, the corresponding ``Loan Estimate'' amount disclosed  under each subparagraph (i) of Sec. 1026.38(i)(1) through (i)(8). These  statements are more prominent than the other disclosures under Sec.  1026.38(i). The statement of whether the estimated and final amounts are  different, stated as a ``Yes'' or ``No'' in capital letters and in  boldface font, under the subheading ``Did this change?,'' as shown on  form H-25 of appendix H to this part, complies with the requirement to  state whether the amounts are different more prominently. Such statement  of ``No'' satisfies the requirement to state that the estimated and  final amounts are equal, and these sections do not provide for any  narrative text to be included with such statement. The prominence  requirement also requires that, in the event an increase or decrease in  costs has occurred, certain words within the narrative text to be  included under the subheading ``Did this change?'' for a ``Yes'' answer  are displayed more prominently than other disclosures. For example,  under Sec. 1026.38(i)(1)(iii)(A), this more prominent statement could  take the form of the phrases   ``Total Loan Costs'' and ``Total Other Costs'' being shown in boldface,  as shown on form H-25 of appendix H to this part. See comments 38(i)-3  and -4 for further guidance regarding the prominence of such statements.</p><p class="depth0">2. Statements of differences. The dollar amounts disclosed under  Sec. 1026.38 generally are shown to two decimal places unless otherwise  required. See comment 38(t)(4)-1. As a result, any ``Final'' amount that  is disclosed in the ``Calculating Cash to Close'' table under Sec.  1026.38(i) is shown to two decimal places unless otherwise required.  Pursuant to Sec. 1026.38(t)(4)(i)(C), however, any ``Loan Estimate''  amount that is disclosed in the ``Calculating Cash to Close'' table  under Sec. 1026.38(i) is shown rounded to the nearest dollar amount,  and thus matches the corresponding estimated amount disclosed on the  Loan Estimate's ``Calculating Cash to Close'' table under Sec.  1026.37(h), which is shown rounded to the nearest whole dollar pursuant  to Sec. 1026.37(o)(4)(i)(A). For this reason, a ``Final'' amount shown  to two decimal places could be a larger number than its corresponding  ``Loan Estimate'' amount shown rounded to the nearest whole dollar,  when, in fact, the apparent increase is due solely to rounding.  Therefore, for purposes of Sec. 1026.38(i)(1)(iii), (2)(iii), (3)(iii),  (4)(iii), (5)(iii), (6)(iii), (7)(iii), and (8)(iii), each statement of  a change between the amounts disclosed on the Loan Estimate and the  Closing Disclosure is based on the actual, non-rounded estimate that  would have been disclosed on the Loan Estimate under Sec. 1026.37(h) if  it had been shown to two decimal places rather than a whole dollar  amount. For example, if the ``Loan Estimate'' amount of ``Total Closing  Costs'' disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(i)(1)(i) is $12,500, and the  ``Final'' amount of ``Total Closing Costs'' disclosed under Sec.  1026.38(i)(1)(ii) is $12,500.35, then even though the table would appear  to show a $0.35 increase in ``Total Closing Costs,'' no statement of  such increase is given under Sec. 1026.38(i)(1)(iii) so long as the  actual, non-rounded estimate (i.e., the estimated amount of ``Total  Closing Costs'' that would have been shown on the Loan Estimate to two  decimal places) is equal to $12,500.35.</p><p class="depth0">3. Statements that the consumer should see details. The provisions  of Sec. 1026.38(i)(4)(iii)(A), (i)(5)(iii)(A), (i)(7)(iii)(A), and  (i)(8)(iii)(A) each require a statement that the consumer should see  certain details of the closing costs disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(j).  Form H-25 of appendix H to this part contains examples of these  statements. For example, Sec. 1026.38(i)(7)(iii)(A) requires a  statement that the consumer should see the details disclosed pursuant to  Sec. 1026.38(j)(2)(v), and, as shown on form H-25(B) of appendix H to  this part, the statement, ``See Seller Credits in Section L,'' in which  the words ``Section L'' are in boldface font, complies with this  provision. In addition, for example, Sec. 1026.38(i)(5)(iii)(A)  requires a statement that the consumer should see the details disclosed  pursuant to Sec. 1026.38(j)(2)(ii), and the following statement which  is similar to that shown on form H-25(B) of appendix H to this part for  Sec. 1026.38(i)(7)(iii)(A), ``See Deposit in Section L,'' in which the  words ``Section L'' are in boldface font, complies with this provision.  In addition, for example, the statement ``See details in Sections K and  L,'' in which the words ``Sections K and L'' are in boldface font,  complies with the requirement under Sec. 1026.38(i)(8)(iii)(A). See  form H-25(B) of appendix H to this part for an example of the statement  required by Sec. 1026.38(i)(8)(iii)(A).</p><p class="depth0">4. Statements of increases or decreases. The provisions of Sec.  1026.38(i)(4)(iii)(A), (i)(5)(iii)(A), and (i)(6)(iii)(A) each require a  statement of whether the amount increased or decreased from the  estimated amount. For the statement required by Sec.  1026.38(i)(6)(iii)(A), the statement ``This amount increased,'' in which  the word ``increased'' is in boldface and is replaced with the word  ``decreased'' as applicable, complies with this requirement. For the  statements required by Sec. 1026.38(i)(4)(iii)(A) and (i)(5)(iii)(A),  the statement, ``You increased this payment,'' in which the word  ``increased'' is in boldface and is replaced with the word ``decreased''  as applicable, complies with these requirements.</p><p class="depth0">38(i)(1) Total closing costs.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 38(i)(1)(iii)(A).</p><p class="depth0">1. Statements and references regarding the total loan costs and  total other costs. Under Sec. 1026.38(i)(1)(iii)(A), the statements  under the subheading ``Did this change?'' that the consumer should see  the total loan costs and total other costs subtotals disclosed on the  Closing Disclosure under Sec. 1026.38(f)(4) and (g)(5) is made only if  and to the extent the difference in the ``Total Closing Costs'' is  attributable to differences in itemized charges that are included in  either or both of such subtotals.</p><p class="depth0">i. For example, if an increase in the ``Total Closing Costs'' is  attributable only to an increase in the appraisal fee (which is an  itemized charge on the Closing Disclosure under the subheading  ``Services Borrower Did Not Shop For,'' itself under the heading ``Loan  Costs''), then a statement is given under the subheading ``Did this  change?'' that the consumer should see the total loan costs subtotal  disclosed on the Closing Disclosure under Sec. 1026.38(f)(4). If the  increase in ``Total Closing Costs'' is attributable only to an increase  in recording fees (which is an itemized charge on the Closing Disclosure  under the subheading ``Taxes and Other Government Fees,'' itself under  the heading ``Other Costs''), then a statement is given under the  subheading ``Did this change?'' that the consumer should see the total  other costs subtotal disclosed on the Closing Disclosure under Sec.  1026.38(g)(5). If, however, the   increase is attributable in part to an increase in the appraisal fee and  in part to an increase in the recording fee, then a statement is given  under the subheading ``Did this change?'' that the consumer should see  the total loan costs and total other costs subtotals disclosed on the  Closing Disclosure under Sec. 1026.38(f)(4) and (g)(5).</p><p class="depth0">ii. For guidance regarding the requirement that this statement be  accompanied by a reference to the disclosures of the total loan costs  and total other costs under Sec. 1026.38(f)(4) and (g)(5), see comment  38(i)-1. For an example of such reference, see form H-25 of appendix H  to this part.</p><p class="depth0">2. Disclosure of excess amounts above limitations on increases in  closing costs.</p><p class="depth0">i. Because certain closing costs, individually, are subject to the  limitations on increases in closing costs under Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(i)  (e.g., fees paid to the creditor, transfer taxes, fees paid to an  affiliate of the creditor), while other closing costs are collectively  subject to the limitations on increases in closing costs under Sec.  1026.19(e)(3)(ii) (e.g., recording fees, fees paid to an unaffiliated  third party identified by the creditor if the creditor permitted the  consumer to shop for the service provider), Sec. 1026.38(i)(1)(iii)(A)  requires the creditor or closing agent to calculate subtotals for each  type of excess amount, and then add such subtotals together to yield the  dollar amount to be disclosed in the table. See commentary to Sec.  1026.19(e)(3) for additional guidance on calculating excess amounts  above the limitations on increases in closing costs under Sec.  1026.19(e)(3).</p><p class="depth0">ii. Under Sec. 1026.38(i)(1)(iii)(A), calculation of the excess  amounts above the limitations on increases in closing costs takes into  account that the itemized, estimated closing costs disclosed on the Loan  Estimate will not result in charges to the consumer if the service is  not actually provided at or before consummation. For example, if the  Loan Estimate included under ``Services You Cannot Shop For'' a $30  charge for a ``title courier fee,'' but the title company elects to  hand-deliver the title documents package to the creditor at no charge,  the $30 fee is not factored into the calculation of the ``Total Closing  Costs'' that are subject to the limitations on increases in closing  costs. However, if the title courier fee was assessed, but at only $15,  the charge is factored into the calculation because the third-party  service was actually provided, albeit at a lower amount than estimated.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Under Sec. 1026.38(i)(1)(iii)(A), calculation of the excess  amounts above the limitations on increases in closing costs takes into  account that certain itemized charges listed on the Loan Estimate under  the subheading ``Services You Can Shop For'' may be subject to different  limitations depending on the circumstances. Such a charge would be  subject to the limitations under Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(i) if the consumer  decided to use a provider affiliated with the creditor. However, the  same charge would instead be subject to the limitations under Sec.  1026.19(e)(3)(ii) if the consumer selected a third-party service  provider unaffiliated with but identified by the creditor, and the  creditor permitted the consumer to shop for the service provider. See  commentary to Sec. 1026.19(e)(3) for additional guidance on calculating  excess amounts above the limitations on increases in closing costs under  Sec. 1026.19(e)(3).</p><p class="depth0">3. Statements regarding excess amount and any credit to the  consumer. Section 1026.38(i)(1)(iii)(A)(3) requires statements that an  increase in closing costs exceeds legal limits by the dollar amount of  the excess and a statement directing the consumer to the disclosure of  lender credits under Sec. 1026.38(h)(3) if a credit is provided under  Sec. 1026.19(f)(2)(v).

Estimate of closing costs paid before closing. Under Sec.  1026.38(i)(2)(i), the ``Loan Estimate'' amount for ``Closing Costs Paid  Before Closing'' is always shown as ``$0,'' because an estimate of such  amount is not disclosed on the Loan Estimate.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 38(i)(2)(iii)(B).</p><p class="depth0">1. Equal amount. Under Sec. 1026.38(i)(2)(iii)(B), the creditor or  closing agent will give a statement that the ``Final'' amount disclosed  under Sec. 1026.38(i)(2)(ii) is equal to the ``Loan Estimate'' amount  disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(i)(2)(i), only if the ``Final'' amount is  $0, because the ``Loan Estimate'' amount is always disclosed as $0  pursuant to Sec. 1026.38(i)(2)(i).

Under Sec. 1026.38(i)(4)(ii)(A), in a transaction  that is a purchase as defined in Sec. 1026.37(a)(9)(i), the ``Final''  amount disclosed for ``Down Payment/Funds from Borrower'' reflects any  change, following delivery of the Loan Estimate, in the amount of down  payment required of the consumer. This change might result, for example,  from an increase in the purchase price of the property.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 38(i)(4)(ii)(B).</p><p class="depth0">1. Funds from borrower. Section 1026.38(i)(4)(ii)(B) provides that,  in a transaction other than a purchase as defined in Sec.  1026.37(a)(9)(i), the ``Final'' amount disclosed for ``Down Payment/ Funds from Borrower'' is the amount of ``Funds from Borrower''  determined in accordance with Sec. 1026.38(i)(6)(iv). Under Sec.  1026.38(i)(6)(iv), the ``Final'' amount of ``Funds from Borrower'' to be  disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(i)(4)(ii)(B) is determined by subtracting  from the total amount of all existing debt being satisfied in   the real estate closing and disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(j)(1)(v)  (except to the extent the satisfaction of such existing debt is  disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(g)) the principal amount of the credit  extended, and is disclosed either as a positive number or $0 depending  on the result of the calculation. An increase in the ``Final'' amount of  ``Funds from Borrower'' compared to the corresponding ``Loan Estimate''  amount might result, for example, from a decrease in the amount of the  credit extended or an increase in the payoff amount for the consumer's  existing debt that is secured by the property. For additional guidance  regarding the determination of the ``Down Payment/Funds from Borrower''  amount, see comment 38(i)(6)(ii)-1.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 38(i)(4)(iii)(A).</p><p class="depth0">1. Statement of differences. Section 1026.38(i)(4)(iii)(A) requires,  as applicable, a statement that the consumer has increased or decreased  this payment, along with a statement that the consumer should see the  details disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(j)(1) or (j)(2), as applicable.  The applicable disclosure to be referenced corresponds to the label on  the Closing Disclosure under which the information accounting for the  increase in the ``Down Payment/Funds from Borrower'' amount is  disclosed. For example, in a transaction that is a purchase as defined  in Sec. 1026.37(a)(9)(i), if the purchase price of the property has  increased and therefore caused the ``Down Payment'' amount to increase,  the statement, ``You increased this payment. See details in Section K,''  with the words ``increased'' and ``Section K'' in boldface, complies  with this requirement. In a purchase or refinancing transaction, in the  event the amount of the credit extended by the creditor has decreased  and therefore caused the ``Funds from Borrower'' amount to increase, the  statement can read, for example, ``You increased this payment.

Under Sec. 1026.38(i)(6)(iv),  the ``Final'' amount of ``Funds for Borrower'' to be disclosed under  Sec. 1026.38(i)(6)(ii) is determined by subtracting from the total  amount of all existing debt being satisfied in the transaction and  disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(j)(1)(v) (except to the extent the  satisfaction of such existing debt is disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(g))  the principal amount of the credit extended (excluding any amount  disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(i)(3)(ii)), and is disclosed under Sec.  1026.38(i)(6)(ii) either as a negative number or $0.00 depending on the  result of the calculation.

The amounts disclosed under the following  provisions of Sec. 1026.38(j) are the same as the amounts disclosed  under the corresponding provisions of Sec. 1026.38(k): Sec.  1026.38(j)(1)(ii) and (k)(1)(ii); Sec. 1026.38(j)(1)(iii) and  (k)(1)(iii); if the amount disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(j)(1)(v) is  attributable to contractual adjustments between the consumer and seller,  Sec. 1026.38(j)(1)(v) and (k)(1)(iv); Sec. 1026.38(j)(1)(vii) and  (k)(1)(vi); Sec. 1026.38(j)(1)(viii) and (k)(1)(vii); Sec.  1026.38(j)(1)(ix) and (k)(1)(viii); Sec. 1026.38(j)(1)(x) and  (k)(1)(ix); Sec. 1026.38(j)(2)(iv) and (k)(2)(iv); Sec.  1026.38(j)(2)(v) and (k)(2)(vii); Sec. 1026.38(j)(2)(viii) and  (k)(2)(x); Sec. 1026.38(j)(2)(ix) and (k)(2)(xi); Sec.  1026.38(j)(2)(x) and (k)(2)(xii); and Sec. 1026.38(j)(2)(xi) and  (k)(2)(xiii).</p><p class="depth0">38(j)(1) Itemization of amounts due from borrower.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 38(j)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Contract sales price and personal property. Section  1026.38(j)(1)(ii) requires disclosure of the contract sales price of the  property being sold, excluding the price of any tangible personal  property if the consumer and seller have agreed to a separate price for  such items. Personal property is defined by State law, but could include  such items as carpets, drapes, and appliances. Manufactured homes are  not considered personal property under Sec. 1026.38(j)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 38(j)(1)(v).</p><p class="depth0">1. Contractual adjustments. Section 1026.38(j)(1)(v) requires  disclosure of amounts owed by the consumer that are not otherwise  disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.38(j). For example, the following items  must be disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(j), to the extent applicable:</p><p class="depth0">i. The balance in the seller's reserve account held in connection  with an existing loan, if assigned to the consumer in a loan assumption  transaction;</p><p class="depth0">ii. Any rent that the consumer will collect after the real estate  closing for a period of time prior to the real estate closing; and</p><p class="depth0">iii. The treatment of any tenant security deposit.</p><p class="depth0">2. Other consumer charges. The amounts disclosed under Sec.  1026.38(j)(1)(v) which are for charges owed by the consumer at the real  estate closing not otherwise disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.38(f),  (g), and (j) will not have a corresponding credit in the summary of the  seller's transaction under Sec. 1026.38(k)(1)(iv). For example, the  amounts paid to any existing holders of liens on the property in a  refinance transaction, and any outstanding real estate property taxes  are disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(j)(1)(v) without a corresponding  credit in the summary of the seller's transaction under Sec.  1026.38(k)(1)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 38(j)(1)(x).</p><p class="depth0">1. Additional adjustments. Examples of items for which adjustments  may be made include taxes, other than those disclosed pursuant to Sec.  1026.38(j)(1)(vii) and (viii), paid in advance for an entire year or  other period, when the real estate closing occurs prior to the  expiration of the year or other period for which they were paid.  Additional examples of items for which adjustments may be made include:</p><p class="depth0">i. Flood and hazard insurance premiums, if the consumer is being  substituted as an insured under the same policy;</p><p class="depth0">ii. Mortgage insurance in loan assumptions;</p><p class="depth0">iii. Planned unit development or condominium association assessments  paid in advance;</p><p class="depth0">iv. Fuel or other supplies on hand, purchased by the seller, which  the consumer will use when the consumer takes possession of the  property; and</p><p class="depth0">v. Ground rent paid in advance.</p><p class="depth0">38(j)(2) Itemization of amounts already paid by or on behalf of  borrower.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 38(j)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Deposit. All amounts paid into a trust account by the consumer  pursuant to the contract of sale for real estate, any addenda thereto,  or any other agreement between the consumer and seller must be disclosed  under   Sec. 1026.38(j)(2)(ii). If there is no deposit paid in a transaction,  that amount is left blank on the Closing Disclosure.</p><p class="depth0">2. Reduction of deposit when deposit used to pay for closing charges  prior to closing. If the consumer's deposit has been applied toward a  charge for a closing cost, the amount applied should not be included in  the amount disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.38(j)(2)(ii), but instead  should be shown on the appropriate line for the closing cost in the  Closing Cost Detail tables pursuant to Sec. 1026.38(f) or (g),  designated borrower-paid before closing.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 38(j)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">1. First user loan. For purposes of Sec. 1026.38(j), a first user  loan is a loan to finance construction of a new structure or purchase of  a new manufactured home that is known at the time of consummation to be  real property under State law, where the structure was constructed for  sale or the manufactured home was purchased for purposes of resale and  the loan is used as or converted to a loan to finance purchase by the  first user. For other loans subject to Sec. 1026.19(f) that finance  construction of a new structure or purchase of a manufactured home that  is known at the time of consummation to be real property under State  law, the sales price of the land and the construction cost or purchase  price of the manufactured home should be disclosed separately and the  amount of the loan in the current transaction must be disclosed. The  remainder of the Closing Disclosure should be completed taking into  account adjustments and charges related to the temporary financing and  permanent financing that are known at the time of consummation.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 38(j)(2)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">1. Assumption of existing loan obligation of seller by consumer. The  outstanding amount of any loans that the consumer is assuming, or  subject to which the consumer is taking title to the property must be  disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(j)(2)(iv). When more than one loan is  being assumed, the total amount of all outstanding loans being assumed  should be disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(j)(2)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 38(j)(2)(v).</p><p class="depth0">1. General seller credits. When the consumer receives a generalized  credit from the seller for closing costs or where the seller (typically  a builder) is making an allowance to the consumer for items to purchase  separately, the amount of the credit must be disclosed. However, if the  seller credit is attributable to a specific loan cost or other cost  listed in the Closing Cost Details tables, pursuant to Sec. 1026.38(f)  or (g), that amount should be reflected in the seller-paid column in the  Closing Cost Details tables under Sec. 1026.38(f) or (g).</p><p class="depth0">2. Other seller credits. Any other obligations of the seller to be  paid directly to the consumer, such as for issues identified at a walk- through of the property prior to closing, are disclosed under Sec.  1026.38(j)(2)(v).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 38(j)(2)(vi).</p><p class="depth0">1. Credits from any party other than the seller or creditor. Section  1026.38(j)(2)(vi) requires disclosure of a description and the amount of  items paid by or on behalf of the consumer and not disclosed elsewhere  under Sec. 1026.38(j)(2). For example, credits a consumer receives from  a real estate agent or other third party, other than a seller or  creditor, are disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.38(j)(2)(vi). However, if  the credit is attributable to a specific closing cost listed in the  Closing Cost Details tables under Sec. 1026.38(f) or (g), that amount  should be reflected in the paid by others column on the Closing Cost  Details tables and not in the disclosure required under Sec.  1026.38(j)(2)(vi). Similarly, if a real estate agent rebates a portion  of the agent's commission to the consumer, the rebate should be listed  as a credit along with a description of the rebate, which must include  the name of the party giving the credit.</p><p class="depth0">2. Subordinate financing proceeds. Any financing arrangements or  other new loans not otherwise disclosed pursuant to Sec.  1026.38(j)(2)(iii) or (iv) must also be disclosed pursuant to Sec.  1026.38(j)(2)(vi). For example, if the consumer is using a second  mortgage or note to finance part of the purchase price, whether from the  same creditor, another creditor, or the seller, the principal amount of  the loan must be disclosed with a brief explanation. If the net proceeds  of a second loan are less than the principal amount of the second loan,  the net proceeds may be listed on the same line as the principal amount  of the second loan. For an example, see form H-25(C) of appendix H to  this part.</p><p class="depth0">3. Satisfaction of existing subordinate liens by consumer. For  payments to subordinate lien holders by or on behalf of the consumer,  disclosure of any amounts paid with funds other than closing funds, as  defined under Sec. 1026.38(j)(4)(ii), in connection with the second  mortgage payoff are required to be disclosed under Sec.  1026.38(j)(2)(vi), with a statement that such amounts were paid outside  of closing funds. For an example, see form H-25(D) of appendix H to this  part.</p><p class="depth0">4. Transferred escrow balances. In a refinance transaction, any  transferred escrow balance is listed as a credit pursuant to Sec.  1026.38(j)(2)(vi), along with a description of the transferred escrow  balance.</p><p class="depth0">5. Gift funds. A credit must be disclosed for any money or other  payments made by family members or third parties not otherwise  associated with the transaction, along with a description of the nature  of the funds provided under Sec. 1026.38(j)(2)(vi).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 38(j)(2)(xi).</p><p class="depth0">1. Examples. Examples of items that would be disclosed under Sec.  1026.38(j)(2)(xi) include:</p><p class="depth0">i. Utilities used but not paid for by the seller;</p><p class="depth0">ii. Rent collected in advance by the seller from a tenant for a  period extending beyond the closing date; and</p><p class="depth0">iii. Interest on loan assumptions.</p><p class="depth0">38(j)(3) Calculation of borrower's transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 38(j)(3)(iii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Stating if amount is due to or from consumer. To comply with  Sec. 1026.38(j)(3)(iii), the creditor must state either the cash  required from the consumer at closing, or cash payable to the consumer  at closing.</p><p class="depth0">2. Methodology. To calculate the cash to close, total the amounts  disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(j)(3)(i) and (ii). If that calculation  results in a positive amount, the amount is due from the consumer. If  the calculation results in a negative amount, the amount is due to the  consumer.</p><p class="depth0">38(j)(4) Items paid outside of closing funds.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 38(j)(4)(i).</p><p class="depth0">1. Charges not paid with closing funds. Section 1026.38(j)(4)(i)  requires that any charges not paid from closing funds but that otherwise  are disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.38(j) be marked as ``paid outside  of closing'' or ``P.O.C.'' The disclosure must include a statement of  the party making the payment, such as the consumer, seller, loan  originator, real estate agent, or any other person. For an example of a  disclosure of a charge not made from closing funds, see form H-25(D) of  appendix H to this part. For an explanation of what constitutes closing  funds, see Sec. 1026.38(j)(4)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">2. Items paid without closing funds not included in sums. Charges  that are paid outside of closing funds under Sec. 1026.38(j)(4)(i)  should not be included in computing totals under Sec. 1026.38(j)(1) and  (j)(2).</p><p class="depth0">38(k) Summary of seller's transaction.</p><p class="depth0">1. Transactions with no seller. Section 1026.38(k) does not apply in  transactions where there is no seller, such as a refinance transaction.</p><p class="depth0">2. Extra line items. For guidance regarding the use of addenda for  items disclosed on the Closing Disclosure under Sec. 1026.38(k), see  comment 38(j)-2.</p><p class="depth0">3. Identical amounts. The amounts disclosed under certain provisions  of Sec. 1026.38(k) are the same as the amounts disclosed under certain  provisions of Sec. 1026.38(j). See comment 38(j)-3 for a listing of the  specific provisions.</p><p class="depth0">38(k)(2) Itemization of amounts due from seller.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 38(k)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Distributions of deposit to seller prior to closing. If the  deposit or any portion thereof has been disbursed to the seller prior to  closing, the amount of the deposit that has been distributed to the  seller must be disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(k)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 38(k)(2)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">1. Assumption of existing loan obligation of seller by consumer. If  the consumer is assuming or taking title subject to existing liens and  the amounts of the outstanding balance of the liens are to be deducted  from the sales price, the amounts of the outstanding balance of the  liens must be disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(k)(2)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">2. Other seller credits. Any other obligations of the seller to be  paid directly to the consumer, such as credits for issues identified at  a walk-through of the property prior to the real estate closing, are  disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(k)(2)(vii).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 38(k)(2)(viii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Satisfaction of other seller obligations. Seller obligations,  other than second liens, that must be paid off to clear title to the  property must be disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.38(k)(2)(viii).  Examples of disclosures pursuant to Sec. 1026.38(k)(2)(viii) include  the satisfaction of outstanding liens imposed due to Federal, State, or  local income taxes, real estate property tax liens, judgments against  the seller reduced to a lien upon the property, or any other obligations  the seller wishes the closing agent to pay from their proceeds at the  real estate closing.</p><p class="depth0">2. Consumer satisfaction of outstanding subordinate loans. If the  consumer is satisfying existing liens which will not be deducted from  the sales price, the amount of the outstanding balance of the loan must  be disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(k)(2)(viii). For example, the amount of  any second lien which will be paid as part of the real estate closing  that is not deducted from the seller's proceeds under Sec.  1026.38(k)(2)(iv), is disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(k)(2)(viii). For  payments to the subordinate lien holder, any amounts paid must be  disclosed, and other amounts paid by or on behalf of the seller must be  disclosed as paid outside of closing funds under Sec.  1026.38(j)(2)(vi). For additional discussion, see comment 38(j)(2)(vi)- 2.</p><p class="depth0">3. Escrows held by closing agent for payment of invoices received  after consummation. Funds to be held by the closing agent for the  payment of either repairs, or water, fuel, or other utility bills that  cannot be prorated between the parties at closing because the amounts  used by the seller prior to closing are not yet known must be disclosed  under Sec. 1026.38(k)(2)(viii). Subsequent disclosure of the actual  amount of these post-closing items to be paid from closing funds is  optional.</p><p class="depth0">38(k)(3) Calculation of seller's transaction.</p><p class="depth0">1. Stating if amount is due to or from seller. To comply with Sec.  1026.38(k)(3)(iii), the creditor must state either the cash required  from the seller at closing, or cash payable to the seller at closing.</p><p class="depth0">2. Methodology. To calculate the cash due to or from the consumer,  total the amounts disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(k)(3)(i) and (ii). If  that calculation results in a positive   amount, the amount is due to the seller. If the calculation results in a  negative amount, the amount is due from the seller.</p><p class="depth0">38(k)(4) Items paid outside of closing funds.</p><p class="depth0">1. Guidance.

See the commentary to Sec. 1026.37(m)(4) for guidance  on disclosing late payment fees, as required under Sec. 1026.38(l)(3).</p><p class="depth0">38(l)(6) Security interest.</p><p class="depth0">1. Alternate property address. Section 1026.38(l)(6) requires  disclosure of the address for the property that secures the credit,  including the zip code. If the address is unavailable, Sec.  1026.38(l)(6) requires disclosure of other location information for the  property, such as a lot number; however, disclosure of a zip code is  required in all instances. For transactions secured by a consumer's  interest in a timeshare plan, the creditor may disclose as other  location information a lot, square, or other such number or other legal  description of the property assigned by the local governing authority,  or if no such number or description is available, disclose the name of  the timeshare property or properties with a designation indicating that  the property is an interest in a timeshare plan.</p><p class="depth0">2. Personal property. Where personal property also secures the  credit transaction, a description of that property may be disclosed, at  the creditor's option, pursuant to Sec. 1026.38(l)(6). If the form does  not provide enough space to disclose a description of personal property  to be disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(l)(6), an additional page may be  used and appended to the end of the form provided that the creditor  complies with the requirements of Sec. 1026.38(t)(3). The creditor may  use one addendum to disclose the personal property under Sec.  1026.38(a)(3)(vi) and (l)(6). See comment 38(a)(3)(vi)-1.</p><p class="depth0">38(l)(7) Escrow account.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 38(l)(7)(i)(A)(2).</p><p class="depth0">1. Estimated costs not paid by escrow account funds. Section  1026.38(l)(7)(i)(A)(2) requires the creditor to estimate the amount the  consumer is likely to pay during the first year after consummation for  charges described in Sec. 1026.37(c)(4)(ii) that are known to the  creditor that will not be paid using escrow account funds. The creditor  discloses this amount only if an escrow account will be established for  the payment of any amounts described in Sec. 1026.37(c)(4)(ii). The  creditor complies with this provision by disclosing the amount of such  charges used to calculate the estimated taxes, insurance, and  assessments disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.38(c)(1) as the total  amount scheduled to be paid during the first year after consummation.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 38(l)(7)(i)(A)(4).</p><p class="depth0">1. Estimated costs paid using escrow account funds. The amount the  consumer will be required to pay into an escrow account with each  periodic payment during the first year after consummation pursuant to  Sec. 1026.38(l)(7)(i)(A)(4) is the amount of estimated escrow payments  disclosed pursuant to Sec. 1026.38(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 38(l)(7)(i)(B)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1.

The disclosure required by Sec. 1026.38(m) is  required to be provided under a different master heading than the  disclosure required by Sec. 1026.37(i), but all other requirements  applicable to the disclosure required by Sec. 1026.37(i) apply to the  disclosure required by Sec. 1026.38(m).</p><p class="depth0">3. When table is not permitted to be disclosed. Like the disclosure  required by Sec. 1026.37(i), the disclosure required by Sec.  1026.38(m) is required only if the periodic principal and interest  payment may change after consummation based on a loan term other than on  an adjustment to the interest rate or if the transaction is a seasonal  payment product as described under Sec. 1026.37(a)(10)(ii)(E).

State law requirements. If the creditor forecloses on the  property and the proceeds of the foreclosure sale are less than the  unpaid balance on the loan, whether the consumer has continued or  additional responsibility for the loan balance after foreclosure, and  the conditions under which liability occurs, will vary by State. If the  applicable State law affords any type of protection, other than a  statute of limitations that only limits the timeframe in which a  creditor may seek redress, Sec. 1026.38(p)(3) requires a statement that  State law may protect the consumer from liability for the unpaid  balance.</p><p class="depth0">38(q) Questions notice.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 38(q)(3).</p><p class="depth0">1.

Columns are left blank where  no such person is participating in the transaction. For example, if  there is no mortgage broker involved in the transaction, the column for  the mortgage broker is left blank. Conversely, in the event the  transaction involves more than one of each such person (e.g., two  sellers' real estate brokers splitting a commission), the space in the  contact information table provided on form H-25 of appendix H to this  part may be altered to accommodate the information for such persons,  provided that the information required by Sec. 1026.38(o),(p),(q),(r)  and (s) is disclosed on the same page as illustrated by form H-25. If  the space provided on form H-25 does not accommodate the addition of  such information, an additional table to accommodate the information may  be provided on a separate page, with an appropriate reference to the  additional table. A creditor or settlement agent may also omit a column  on the table that is inapplicable or, if necessary, replace an  inapplicable column with the contact information for the additional  person.</p><p class="depth0">2. Name of person. Where Sec. 1026.38(r)(1) calls for disclosure of  the name of the person participating in the transaction, the person's  legal name (e.g., the name used for registration, incorporation, or  chartering purposes), the person's trade name, if any, or an  abbreviation of the person's legal name or the trade name is disclosed,  so long as the disclosure is clear and conspicuous as required by Sec.  1026.38(t)(1)(i). For example, if the creditor's   legal name is ``Alpha Beta Chi Bank and Trust Company, N.A.'' and its  trade name is ``ABC Bank,'' then under Sec. 1026.38(r)(1) the full  legal name, the trade name, or an abbreviation such as ``ABC Bank &  Trust Co.'' may be disclosed. However, the abbreviation ``Bank & Trust  Co.'' is not sufficiently distinct to enable a consumer to identify the  person, and therefore would not be clear and conspicuous. If the  creditor, mortgage broker, seller's real estate broker, consumer's real  estate broker, or settlement agent participating in the transaction is a  natural person, the natural person's name is listed in the Sec.  1026.38(r)(1) and (r)(4) disclosures (assuming that such natural person  is the primary contact for the consumer or seller, as applicable).</p><p class="depth0">3. Address. The address disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(r)(2) is the  identified person's place of business where the primary contact for the  transaction is located (usually the local office), rather than a general  corporate headquarters address. If a natural person's name is to be  disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(r)(1), see comment 38(r)-2, the business  address of such natural person is listed (assuming that such natural  person is the primary contact for the consumer or seller, as  applicable).</p><p class="depth0">4. NMLSR ID. Section 1026.38(r)(3) and (5) requires the disclosure  of an NMLSR identification (ID) number for each person identified in the  table. The NMLSR ID is a unique number or other identifier that is  generally assigned by the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System &  Registry (NMLSR) to individuals registered or licensed through NMLSR to  provide loan originating services (for more information, see the Secure  and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (SAFE Act)  sections 1503(3) and (12) and 1504, 12 U.S.C. 5102(3) and (12) and 5103,  and its implementing regulations (i.e., 12 CFR 1007.103(a) and  1008.103(a)(2)). An entity may also have an NMLSR ID. Thus, any NMLSR ID  that is obtained by a creditor or mortgage broker entity disclosed under  Sec. 1026.38(r)(1), as applicable, or a natural person disclosed under  Sec. 1026.38(r)(4), either as required under the SAFE Act or otherwise,  is disclosed. If the creditor, mortgage broker, or natural person has an  NMLSR ID and a separate license number or unique identifier issued by  the applicable State, locality, or other regulatory body with  responsibility for licensing and/or registering such entity or person's  business activities, both the NMLSR ID and the separate license number  or unique identifier may be disclosed. The space in the table is left  blank for the disclosures in the columns corresponding to persons that  have no NMLSR ID to be disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(r)(3) and (5);  provided that, the creditor may omit the column from the table or, if  necessary, replace the column with the contact information for an  additional person. See comment 38(r)-1.</p><p class="depth0">5. License number or unique identifier. Section 1026.38(r)(3) and  (5) requires the disclosure of a license number or unique identifier for  each person (including natural persons) identified in the table who does  not have a NMLSR ID if the applicable State, locality, or other  regulatory body with responsibility for licensing and/or registering  such person's business activities has issued a license number or other  unique identifier to such person under Sec. 1026.38(r)(3) and (5). The  space in the table is left blank for the disclosures in the columns  corresponding to persons who are not subject to the issuance of such a  license number or unique identifier to be disclosed under Sec.  1026.38(r)(3) and (5); provided that, the creditor or settlement agent  may omit the column from the table or, if necessary, replace the column  with the contact information for an additional person. See comment  38(r)-1. In addition, under Sec. 1026.38(r)(3) and (5), the  abbreviation of the State or the jurisdiction or regulatory body that  issued such license or registration is required to be included before  the word ``License'' in the label required by Sec. 1026.37(r)(3) and  (5). If no such license or registration is required to be disclosed,  such as if an NMLSR number is disclosed, the space provided for such an  abbreviation in form H-25 of appendix H to this part may be left blank.  A creditor complies with the requirements of Sec. 1026.38(r)(3) and (5)  to disclose the abbreviation of the State by disclosing a U.S. Postal  Service State abbreviation, if applicable.</p><p class="depth0">6. Contact. Section 1026.38(r)(4) requires the disclosure of the  primary contact for the consumer. The primary contact is the natural  person employed by the person disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(r)(1) who  interacts most frequently with the consumer and who has an NMLSR ID or,  if none, a license number or other unique identifier to be disclosed  under Sec. 1026.38(r)(5), as applicable. For example, if the senior  loan officer employed by the creditor or mortgage broker disclosed under  Sec. 1026.38(r)(1) has an NMLSR ID, but the consumer meets with a  different loan officer to complete the application and answer questions,  the senior loan officer's name is disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(r)(4)  unless the other loan officer also has an NMLSR ID, in which case the  other loan officer's name is disclosed. Further, if the sales agent  employed by the consumer's real estate broker disclosed under Sec.  1026.38(r)(1) has a State-issued brokers' license number, but the  consumer meets with an associate sales agent to tour the property being  purchased and complete the sales contract, the sales agent's name is  disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(r)(4) unless the associate sales agent  also has a State-issued license number, in which case the associate  sales agent's name is disclosed. Moreover, if the closing attorney  employed by the settlement agent disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(r)(1) has   a State-issued settlement agent license number, but the consumer meets  with the attorney's assistant to fill out any necessary documentation  prior to the closing and to answer questions, the closing attorney's  name is disclosed under Sec. 1026.38(r)(4) because the assistant is  only performing clerical functions.</p><p class="depth0">7. Email address and phone number. Section 1026.38(r)(6) and (7)  requires disclosure of the email address and phone number, respectively,  for the persons listed in Sec. 1026.37(r)(4). Disclosure of a general  number or email address for the lender, mortgage broker, real estate  broker, or settlement agent, as applicable, satisfies this requirement  if no such information is generally available for such person.</p><p class="depth0">38(s) Signature statement.</p><p class="depth0">1. General requirements. See the commentary to Sec. 1026.37(n) for  guidance regarding the optional signature requirements and signature  lines for multiple consumers.</p><p class="depth0">38(t) Form of disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">38(t)(1) General requirements.</p><p class="depth0">1. Clear and conspicuous; segregation. The clear and conspicuous  standard requires that the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.38 be  legible and in a readily understandable form. The disclosures also must  be grouped together and segregated from everything else. As required by  Sec. 1026.38(t)(3), the disclosures for any transaction that is a  federally related mortgage loan under Regulation X, 12 CFR 1024.2, must  be made using the standard form H-25 of appendix H to this part.  Accordingly, use of that form constitutes compliance with the clear and  conspicuous and segregation requirements of Sec. 1026.38(t)(1).</p><p class="depth0">2. Balloon payment financing with leasing characteristics. In  certain credit sale or loan transactions, a consumer may reduce the  dollar amount of the payments to be made during the course of the  transaction by agreeing to make, at the end of the loan term, a large  final payment based on the expected residual value of the property. The  consumer may have a number of options with respect to the final payment,  including, among other things, retaining the property and making the  final payment, refinancing the final payment, or transferring the  property to the creditor in lieu of the final payment. Such transactions  may have some of the characteristics of lease transactions subject to  Regulation M (12 CFR part 1013), but are considered credit transactions  where the consumer assumes the indicia of ownership, including the  risks, burdens and benefits of ownership, upon consummation. These  transactions are governed by the disclosure requirements of this part  instead of Regulation M. Under Sec. 1026.38(t)(1)(ii), creditors may  not include any additional information in the disclosures required by  Sec. 1026.38. Thus, the disclosures must show the large final payment  as a balloon payment in the projected payments table required by Sec.  1026.38(c) and should not, for example, reflect the other options  available to the consumer at maturity.</p><p class="depth0">38(t)(2) Headings and labels.</p><p class="depth0">1. Estimated amounts. Certain amounts are estimated when provided on  the disclosure required by Sec. 1026.37. When disclosed as required by  Sec. 1026.38, however, many of the corresponding disclosures must be  actual amounts rather than estimates in accordance with the requirements  of Sec. 1026.19(f), even though the provision of Sec. 1026.38 cross- references a counterpart in Sec. 1026.37. Section 1026.38(t)(2)  provides that, if a master heading, heading, subheading, label, or  similar designation contains the word ``estimated'' in form H-25 of  appendix H to this part, that heading, label, or similar designation  shall contain the word ``estimated.'' Thus, Sec. 1026.38(t)(2)  incorporates the ``estimated'' designations reflected on form H-25 into  the requirements of Sec. 1026.38. See comment 37(o)(2)-1.</p><p class="depth0">38(t)(3) Form.</p><p class="depth0">1. Non-federally related mortgage loans. For a transaction that a  non-federally related mortgage loan, the creditor is not required to use  form H-25 of appendix H to this part, although its use as a model form  for such transactions, if properly completed with accurate content,  constitutes compliance with the clear and conspicuous and segregation  requirements of Sec. 1026.38(t)(1)(i). Even when the creditor elects  not to use the model form, Sec. 1026.38(t)(1)(ii) requires that the  disclosures contain only the information required by Sec. 1026.38(a)  through (s), and that the creditor make the disclosures in the same  order as they occur in form H-25, use the same headings, labels, and  similar designations as used in the form (many of which also are  expressly required by Sec. 1026.38(a) through (s)), and position the  disclosures relative to those designations in the same manner as shown  in the form. In order to be in a format substantially similar to form H- 25, the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.38 must be provided on letter  size (8.5[sec] x 11[sec]) paper.</p><p class="depth0">38(t)(4) Rounding.</p><p class="depth0">1. Generally. Consistent with Sec. 1026.2(b)(4), any amount  required to be disclosed by Sec. 1026.38 and not required to be rounded  by Sec. 1026.38(t)(4) must be disclosed as an exact numerical amount  using decimal places where applicable, unless otherwise provided. For  example, under Sec. 1026.38(t)(4), the principal and interest payment  disclosed under Sec. 1026.37(b)(3) and Sec. 1026.38(b) must be  disclosed using decimal places even if the amount of cents is zero, in  contrast to the loan amount disclosed under Sec. 1026.37(b)(1) and  Sec. 1026.38(b).</p><p class="depth0">2. Guidance. For guidance regarding the requirements of Sec.  1026.38(t)(4), see the commentary to Sec. 1026.37(o)(4).</p><p class="depth0">38(t)(5) Exceptions.</p><p class="depth0">1. Permissible changes. The changes required and permitted by Sec.  1026.38(t)(5) are permitted for federally related mortgage loans for  which the use of form H-25 is required under Sec. 1026.38(t)(3). For  non-federally related mortgage loans, the changes required or permitted  by Sec. 1026.38(t)(5), do not affect the substance, clarity, or  meaningful sequence of the disclosure and therefore, are permissible.  Any changes to the disclosure not specified in Sec. 1026.38(t)(5) or  not permitted by other provisions of Sec. 1026.38 are not permissible  for federally related mortgage loans. Creditors in non-federally related  mortgage loans making any changes that affect the substance, clarity, or  meaningful sequence of the disclosure will lose their protection from  civil liability under TILA section 130.</p><p class="depth0">2. Manual completion. The creditor, or settlement agent preparing  the form, under Sec. 1026.19(f)(1)(v) is not required to use a  computer, typewriter, or other word processor to complete the disclosure  required by Sec. 1026.38. The creditor or settlement agent may fill in  information and amounts required to be disclosed by Sec. 1026.38 on  form H-25 of appendix H to this part by hand printing or using any other  method, provided the person produces clear and legible text and uses the  formatting required by Sec. 1026.38, including replicating bold font  where required.</p><p class="depth0">3. Unit-period. Section 1026.38(t)(5)(i) provides that wherever form  H-25 or Sec. 1026.38 uses ``monthly'' to describe the frequency of any  payments or uses ``month'' to describe the applicable unit-period, the  creditor is required to substitute the appropriate term to reflect the  fact that the transaction's terms provide for other than monthly  periodic payments, such as bi-weekly or quarterly payments. For purposes  of Sec. 1026.38, the term ``unit-period'' has the same meaning as in  appendix J to Regulation Z.</p><p class="depth0">4. Signature lines. Section 1026.38(t) does not restrict the  addition of signature lines to the disclosure required by Sec. 1026.38,  provided any signature lines for confirmations of receipt of the  disclosure appear only under the ``Confirm Receipt'' heading required by  Sec. 1026.38(s) as illustrated by form H-25 of appendix H to this part.  If the number of signatures requested by the creditor for confirming  receipt of the disclosure requires space for signature lines in excess  of that provided on form H-25, an additional page may be added to  accommodate the additional signature lines with an appropriate reference  to the additional page. Such additional page should also contain the  heading and statement required by Sec. 1026.38(s) in the format  provided on form H-25. Signatures for a purpose other than confirming  receipt of the form may be obtained on a separate page, and consistent  with Sec. 1026.38(t)(1)(i), not on the same page as the information  required by Sec. 1026.38.</p><p class="depth0">5. Additional page. Information required or permitted to be  disclosed by Sec. 1026.38 on a separate page should be formatted  similarly to form H-25 of appendix H to this part, so as not to affect  the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the disclosure. In  addition, information provided on additional pages should be  consolidated on as few pages as necessary so as not to affect the  substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the disclosure.</p><p class="depth0">6. Page numbers. References required by provisions of Sec. 1026.38  to information disclosed pursuant to other provisions of the section, as  illustrated on form H-25 of appendix H, may be altered to refer to the  appropriate page number of the form containing such information.</p><p class="depth0">7. Translation. Section 1026.38(t)(5)(viii) permits the translation  of form H-25 into languages other than English, similar to Sec.  1026.37(o)(5)(ii). Pursuant Sec. 1026.38(t)(5)(viii) creditors may  modify form H-25 to the extent that translation prevents the headings,  labels, designations, and required disclosure items under Sec. 1026.38  from fitting in the space provided on form H-25. For example, if the  translation of a required label does not fit within the line provided  for such label in form H-25, the label may be disclosed over two lines.  See form H-28 of appendix H to this part for Spanish translations of  form H-25.</p><p class="depth0">38(t)(5)(iv) Closing Cost Details.</p><p class="depth0">1. Line numbers; closing cost details. Section 1026.38(t)(5)(iv)(A)  permits the deletion of unused lines from the disclosures required by  Sec. 1026.38(f)(1) through (3) and (g)(1) through (4), if necessary to  allow the addition of lines to other sections that require them for the  required disclosures. This provision permits creditors and settlement  agents to use the space gained from deleting unused lines for additional  lines to accommodate all of the costs that are required to be itemized.  For example, if the only origination charge required by Sec.  1026.38(f)(1) is points, the remaining seven lines illustrated on form  H-25 of appendix H to this part may be deleted and added to the  disclosure required by Sec. 1026.38(g)(4), if seven lines in addition  to those provided on form H-25 are necessary to accommodate such  disclosure.</p><p class="depth0">2. Two pages; closing cost details. Section 1026.38(t)(5)(iv)(B)  permits the disclosure of the information required by Sec. 1026.38(f)  through (h) over two pages, but only if form H-25 of appendix H to this  part, as modified pursuant to Sec. 1026.38(t)(5)(iv)(A), does not  accommodate all of the costs required to be disclosed on one page. If  the deletion of unused lines and the addition of such lines to other  sections permits the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.38(f) through  (h) to fit on one page, modification pursuant to Sec.  1026.38(t)(5)(iv)(B) is not permissible.</p><p class="depth0">3. Separate pages for Loan Costs and Other Costs. The modification  permitted by Sec. 1026.38(t)(5)(iv)(B) allows the information required  by Sec. 1026.38(f) through (h) to be disclosed over two pages, numbered  as ``2a'' and ``2b.'' For an example of such a modification, see form H- 25(H) of appendix H to this part. Under this modification, the  information required by Sec. 1026.38(h) must remain on the same page as  the information required by Sec. 1026.38(g). Accordingly, the Loan  Costs section of form H-25 may appear on its own page ``2a,'' but the  Other Costs section must appear on the same page as the Total Closing  Costs section on page ``2b.'' The modifications permitted by Sec.  1026.38(t)(5)(iv)(A) and (B) may be used in conjunction to ensure  disclosure of Sec. 1026.38(f) on one page and Sec. 1026.38(g) and (h)  on a separate page.</p><p class="depth0">38(t)(5)(vii) Transaction without a seller.</p><p class="depth0">1.

Appraised property value. The modifications permitted by Sec.  1026.38(t)(5)(vii) do not specifically refer to the label required by  Sec. 1026.38(a)(3)(vii)(B) for transactions that do not involve a  seller, because the label is required by that section and is a  requirement and not considered a modification. As required by Sec.  1026.38(a)(3)(vii)(B), a form used for a transaction that does not  involve a seller and is modified pursuant to Sec. 1026.38(t)(5)(viii)  must contain the label ``Appraised Prop. Value'' or ``Estimated Prop.

Customary recitals and information. Section 1026.38(t)(5)(ix)  permits an additional page to be added to the disclosure for customary  recitals and information used locally in real estate settlements.  Examples of such information include a breakdown of payoff figures, a  breakdown of the consumer's total monthly mortgage payments, check  disbursements, a statement indicating receipt of funds, applicable  special stipulations between buyer and seller, and the date funds are  transferred.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1026.39--Mortgage Transfer Disclosures</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">39(d) Content of required disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">2. Partial payment policy. The disclosures required by Sec.  1026.39(d)(5) must identify whether the covered person accepts periodic  payments from the consumer that are less than the full amount due and  whether the covered person applies the payments to a consumer's loan or  holds the payments in a separate account until the consumer pays the  remainder of the full amount due. The disclosures required by Sec.  1026.39(d)(5) apply only to a mortgage loan that is a closed-end  consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling or real property and  that is not a reverse mortgage transaction subject to Sec. 1026.33. In  an open-end consumer credit transaction secured by the consumer's  principal dwelling, Sec. 1026.39(d) requires a covered person to  provide the disclosures required by Sec. 1026.39(d)(1) through (4), but  not the partial payment policy disclosure required by Sec.  1026.39(d)(5). If, however, the dwelling in the open-end consumer credit  transaction is not the consumer's principal dwelling (e.g., it is used  solely for vacation purposes), none of the disclosures required by Sec.  1026.39(d) is required because the transaction is not a mortgage loan  for purposes of Sec. 1026.39. See Sec. 1026.39(a)(2). In contrast, a  closed-end consumer credit transaction secured by the consumer's  dwelling that is not the consumer's principal dwelling is considered a  mortgage loan for purposes of Sec. 1026.39. Assuming that the  transaction is not a reverse mortgage transaction subject to Sec.  1026.33, Sec. 1026.39(d) requires a covered person to provide the  disclosures under Sec. 1026.39(d)(1) through (5). But if the  transaction is a reverse mortgage transaction subject to Sec. 1026.33,  Sec. 1026.39(d) requires a covered person to provide only the  disclosures under Sec. 1026.39(d)(1) through (4).</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">39(d)(5) Partial payment policy.</p><p class="depth0">1.

Section 1026.39(d)(5) requires disclosure  of the partial payment policy of covered persons for closed-end consumer  credit transactions secured by a dwelling or real property, other than a  reverse mortgage transaction subject to Sec. 1026.33. A covered person  may utilize the format of the disclosure illustrated by form H-25 of  appendix H to this part for the information required to be disclosed by  Sec. 1026.38(l)(5). For example, the statement required Sec.  1026.39(d)(5)(iii) that a new covered person may have a different  partial payment policy may be disclosed using the language illustrated  by form H-25, which states ``If this loan is sold, your new lender may  have a different policy.'' The text illustrated by form H-25 may be  modified to suit the format of the covered person's disclosure under  Sec. 1026.39. For example, the format illustrated by form H-25 begins  with the text, ``Your lender may'' or ``Your lender does not,'' which  may not be suitable to the format of the covered person's other  disclosures under Sec. 1026.39. This text may be modified to suit the  format of the covered person's integrated disclosure, using a phrase  such as ``We will''   or ``We are your new lender and have a different Partial Payment Policy  than your previous lender. Under our policy we will.'' Any modifications  must be appropriate and not affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful  sequence of the disclosure.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">Appendix D--Multiple-Advance Construction Loans</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">6. Relation to Sec. 1026.18(s). A creditor must disclose an  interest rate and payment summary table for certain transactions secured  by a dwelling, pursuant to Sec. 1026.18(s), instead of the general  payment schedule required by Sec. 1026.18(g) or the projected payments  table required by Sec. Sec. 1026.37(c) and 1026.38(c). Accordingly,  some home construction loans that are secured by a dwelling are subject  to Sec. 1026.18(s) and not Sec. 1026.18(g). See comment app. D-7 for a  discussion of transactions that are subject to Sec. Sec. 1026.37 and  1026.38. Under Sec. 1026.17(c)(6)(ii), when a multiple-advance  construction loan may be permanently financed by the same creditor, the  construction phase and the permanent phase may be treated as either one  transaction or more than one transaction. Following are illustrations of  the application of appendix D to transactions subject to Sec.  1026.18(s), under each of these two alternatives:</p><p class="depth0">i. If a creditor uses appendix D and elects pursuant to Sec.  1026.17(c)(6)(ii) to disclose the construction and permanent phases as  separate transactions, the construction phase must be disclosed  according to the rules in Sec. 1026.18(s). Under Sec. 1026.18(s), the  creditor must disclose the applicable interest rates and corresponding  periodic payments during the construction phase in an interest rate and  payment summary table. The provision in appendix D, part I.A.3, which  allows the creditor to omit the number and amounts of any interest  payments ``in disclosing the payment schedule under Sec. 1026.18(g)''  does not apply because the transaction is governed by Sec. 1026.18(s)  rather than Sec. 1026.18(g). Also, because the construction phase is  being disclosed as a separate transaction and its terms do not repay all  principal, the creditor must disclose a balloon payment, pursuant to  Sec. 1026.18(s)(5).</p><p class="depth0">ii. On the other hand, if the creditor elects to disclose the  construction and permanent phases as a single transaction, where  interest is payable on the amount actually advanced for the time it is  outstanding, the construction phase must be disclosed pursuant to  appendix D, part II.C.1, which provides that the creditor shall disclose  the repayment schedule without reflecting the number or amounts of  payments of interest only that are made during the construction phase.  Appendix D also provides, however, that creditors must disclose (outside  of the table) the fact that interest payments must be made and the  timing of such payments. The interest rate and payment summary table  disclosed under Sec. 1026.18(s) in such cases must reflect only the  permanent phase of the transaction. Therefore, in determining the rates  and payments that must be disclosed in the columns of the table,  creditors should apply the requirements of Sec. 1026.18(s) to the  permanent phase only. For example, under Sec. 1026.18(s)(2)(i)(A) or  Sec. 1026.18(s)(2)(i)(B)(1), as applicable, the creditor should  disclose the interest rate corresponding to the first installment due  under the permanent phase and not any rate applicable during the  construction phase.</p><p class="depth0">7. Relation to Sec. Sec. 1026.37 and 1026.38. A creditor must  disclose a projected payments table for certain transactions secured by  real property, pursuant to Sec. Sec. 1026.37(c) and 1026.38(c), instead  of the general payment schedule required by Sec. 1026.18(g) or the  interest rate and payments summary table required by Sec. 1026.18(s).  Accordingly, some home construction loans that are secured by real  property are subject to Sec. Sec. 1026.37(c) and 1026.38(c) and not  Sec. 1026.18(g). See comment app. D-6 for a discussion of transactions  that are subject to Sec. 1026.18(s). Under Sec. 1026.17(c)(6)(ii),  when a multiple-advance construction loan may be permanently financed by  the same creditor, the construction phase and the permanent phase may be  treated as either one transaction or more than one transaction.  Following are illustrations of the application of appendix D to  transactions subject to Sec. Sec. 1026.37(c) and 1026.38(c), under each  of these two alternatives:</p><p class="depth0">i. If a creditor uses appendix D and elects pursuant to Sec.  1026.17(c)(6)(ii) to disclose the construction and permanent phases as  separate transactions, the construction phase must be disclosed  according to the rules in Sec. Sec. 1026.37(c) and 1026.38(c). Under  Sec. Sec. 1026.37(c) and 1026.38(c), the creditor must disclose the  periodic payments during the construction phase in a projected payments  table. The provision in appendix D, part I.A.3, which allows the  creditor to omit the number and amounts of any interest payments ``in  disclosing the payment schedule under Sec. 1026.18(g)'' does not apply  because the transaction is governed by Sec. Sec. 1026.37(c) and  1026.38(c) rather than Sec. 1026.18(g). The creditor determines the  amount of the interest-only payment to be made during the construction  phase using the assumption in appendix D, part I.A.1. Also, because the  construction phase is being disclosed as a separate transaction and its  terms do not repay all principal, the creditor must disclose the  construction phase transaction as a product with a balloon payment  feature, pursuant to   Sec. Sec. 1026.37(a)(10)(ii)(D) and 1026.38(a)(5)(iii), in addition to  reflecting the balloon payment in the projected payments table.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If the creditor elects to disclose the construction and  permanent phases as a single transaction, the repayment schedule must be  disclosed pursuant to appendix D, part II.C.2. Under appendix D, part  II.C.2, the projected payments table must reflect the interest-only  payments during the construction phase in a first column, followed by  the appropriate column(s) reflecting the amortizing payments for the  permanent phase. The creditor determines the amount of the interest-only  payment to be made during the construction phase using the assumption in  appendix D, part II.A.1.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">Appendices G and H--Open-End and Closed-End Model Forms and Clauses</p><p class="depth0">1. Permissible changes. Although use of the model forms and clauses  is not required, creditors using them properly will be deemed to be in  compliance with the regulation with regard to those disclosures.  Creditors may make certain changes in the format or content of the forms  and clauses and may delete any disclosures that are inapplicable to a  transaction or a plan without losing the Act's protection from  liability, except formatting changes may not be made to model forms and  samples in H-18, H-19, H-20, H-21, H-22, H-23, H-24, H-25, H-26, H-27,  H-28, G-2(A), G-3(A), G-4(A), G-10(A)-(E), G-17(A)-(D), G-18(A) (except  as permitted pursuant to Sec. 1026.7(b)(2)), G-18(B)-(C), G-19, G-20,  and G-21, or to the model clauses in H-4(E), H-4(F), H-4(G), and H-4(H).  Creditors may modify the heading of the second column shown in Model  Clause H-4(H) to read ``first adjustment'' or ``first increase,'' as  applicable, pursuant to Sec. 1026.18(s)(2)(i)(C). The rearrangement of  the model forms and clauses may not be so extensive as to affect the  substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the forms and clauses.  Creditors making revisions with that effect will lose their protection  from civil liability. Except as otherwise specifically required,  acceptable changes include, for example:</p><p class="depth0">i. Using the first person, instead of the second person, in  referring to the borrower.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Using ``borrower'' and ``creditor'' instead of pronouns.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Rearranging the sequences of the disclosures.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Not using bold type for headings.</p><p class="depth0">v. Incorporating certain State ``plain English'' requirements.</p><p class="depth0">vi. Deleting inapplicable disclosures by whiting out, blocking out,  filling in ``N/A'' (not applicable) or ``0,'' crossing out, leaving  blanks, checking a box for applicable items, or circling applicable  items.

This sample illustrates a graduated payment  transaction subject to Sec. 1026.17(a) with a 5-year graduation period  and a 7\1/2\ percent yearly increase in payments. The loan amount is  $44,900, payable in 360 monthly installments at a simple interest rate  of 14.75%. Two points ($898), as well as an initial guarantee insurance  premium of $225.00, are included in the prepaid finance charge. The  guarantee insurance premiums are calculated on the basis of \1/4\ of 1%  of the outstanding principal balance under an annual reduction plan. The  abbreviated disclosure permitted under Sec. 1026.18(g)(2) is used for  the payment schedule for years 6 through 30. The prepayment disclosure  refers to both penalties and rebates because information about penalties  is required for the simple interest portion of the obligation and  information about rebates is required for the guarantee insurance  portion of the obligation.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0">29.

Although creditors and servicers are not required to use a  certain paper size in disclosing the information under Sec. 1026.20(e),  model form H-29 is designed to be printed on an 8\1/2\ x 1- inch sheet  of paper. In addition, the following formatting techniques were   used in presenting the information in the model form to ensure that the  information is readable:</p><p class="depth0">A. A readable font style and font size (10-point minimum font size);</p><p class="depth0">B. Sufficient spacing between lines of the text;</p><p class="depth0">C. Standard spacing between words and characters. In other words,  the text was not compressed to appear smaller than 10-point type;</p><p class="depth0">D. Sufficient white space around the text of the information in each  row, by providing sufficient margins above, below and to the sides of  the text;</p><p class="depth0">E. Sufficient contrast between the text and the background.  Generally, black text was used on white paper.</p><p class="depth0">iv. While the regulation does not require creditors or servicers to  use the above formatting techniques in presenting information in the  tabular format (except for the 10-point minimum font size requirement),  creditors and servicers are encouraged to consider these techniques when  deciding how to disclose information in the notice to ensure that the  information is presented in a readable format.</p><p class="depth0">v.

Relationship to RESPA tolerance cure. Under Regulation X (12 CFR  1024.7(i)), if any charges at settlement exceed the charges listed on  the good faith estimate of settlement costs by more than the amounts  permitted under 12 CFR 1024.7(e), the loan originator may cure the  tolerance violation by reimbursing the amount by which the tolerance was  exceeded at settlement or within 30 calendar days after settlement.  Similarly, under Sec. 1026.19(f)(2)(v), if amounts paid by the consumer  exceed the amounts specified under Sec. 1026.19(e)(3)(i) or (ii), the  creditor complies with Sec. 1026.19(e)(1)(i) if the creditor refunds  the excess to the consumer no later than 60 days after consummation. The  amount paid to the consumer pursuant to Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(iv) may be  offset by the amount paid to the consumer pursuant to 12 CFR 1024.7(i)  or Sec. 1026.19(f)(2)(v), to the extent that the amount paid to the  consumer pursuant to 12 CFR 1024.7(i) or Sec. 1026.19(f)(2)(v) is being  applied to fees or charges included in points and fees pursuant to Sec.  1026.32(b)(1). However, a creditor or assignee has not satisfied Sec.  1026.43(e)(3)(iii) unless the total amount described in Sec.  1026.43(e)(3)(iv), including any offset due to a payment made pursuant  to 12 CFR 1024.7(i) or Sec. 1026.19(f)(2)(v), is paid to the consumer  within 210 days after consummation and prior to the occurrence of any of  the events in Sec. 1026.43(e)(3)(iii)(B)(1) through (3).</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p>
