JAG approval is required before asserting a claim against a Federal government contractor when the contract provides that the contractor will be indemnified or held harmless by the Federal government for tort liability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> U.S. personnel. JAG approval is required before asserting MCRA claims directly against servicemembers, their dependents and federal employees and their dependents for injury to another person. No approval is necessary to assert claims against their insurance policies, however, except for injuries caused by servicemembers and federal employees acting ``within the scope of their employment.'' Intra-familial tort immunity would not preclude the Government from asserting any claims for care furnished to a tortfeasor's family members.
