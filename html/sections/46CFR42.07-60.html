                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Director, Field Operations (DFO) or the Coast Guard District  Commander may detain a vessel for survey if there is reason to believe  that the vessel is proceeding on her journey in excess of the draft  allowed by the regulations in this subchapter as indicated by the  vessel's load line certificate, or otherwise. The Coast Guard District  Commander may detain a vessel if it is so loaded as to be manifestly  unsafe to proceed to sea.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the Director, Field Operations (DFO) orders a vessel  detained, he shall immediately inform the Coast Guard District Commander  thereof, who shall thereupon advise the Director, Field Operations (DFO)  whether or not he deems that the vessel may proceed to sea with safety.  If the Coast Guard District Commander orders a vessel detained, such  officer will furnish the Director, Field Operations (DFO) immediate  notification of such detention. The clearance shall be refused to any  vessel which shall have been ordered detained, which shall be in effect  until it is shown that the vessel is not in violation of the applicable  law and the regulations in this subchapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section, the detention shall only be exercised insofar as  may be necessary to   ensure that the vessel can proceed to sea without danger to passengers  or crew.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The detention of a vessel will be by written order of either the  Coast Guard District Commander or the Director, Field Operations (DFO),  depending on who orders the detention. The Coast Guard District  Commander will immediately arrange for a survey in the manner prescribed  by 46 U.S.C. 5113. Unless the owner or agent waives in writing and  stipulates to accept the Coast Guard's survey, the Coast Guard District  Commander shall appoint three disinterested surveyors and, where  practicable, one of them shall be from the Surveying Staff of the  American Bureau of Shipping. Such surveyors shall conduct a survey to  ascertain whether or not the vessel is loaded in violation of the  applicable provisions in the load line acts, and the regulations in this  subchapter. If the survey confirms the allegation that the vessel is in  violation of either law or the applicable regulations in this  subchapter, ``the owner and agent shall bear the costs of the survey in  addition to any penalty or fine imposed'', as provided in these laws.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Whenever a vessel is detained, the master or owner may, within 5  days, appeal to the Commandant who may, if he desires, order a further  survey, and may affirm, set aside, or modify the order of the detaining  officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Where a foreign vessel is detained or intervention action of any  other kind is taken against a foreign vessel, the officer carrying out  the action shall immediately inform in writing the Consul or the  diplomatic representative of the State whose flag the vessel is flying,  of the decision involved together with all pertinent circumstances under  which intervention was deemed necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the foreign vessel is marked with load lines and has on board  a valid International or Great Lakes Load Line Certificate certifying to  the correctness of the marks, the control provisions in this part which  are in accord with Article 21 of the 1966 Convention shall be observed.  In this connection, the vessel shall not be loaded beyond the limits  allowed by the certificate. The position of the load lines on the vessel  shall correspond with the certificate. The vessel shall not have been so  materially altered as to make the vessel manifestly unfit to proceed to  sea without danger to human life, in regard to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The hull or superstructure (if necessitating assignment of an  increased freeboard); and/or,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The appliances and fittings for protection of openings,  guardrails, freeing ports, and means of access to crew's quarters (if  necessitating replacement or other effective maintenance).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> (Alternatively provided) If the foreign vessel has on board an  International Load Line Exemption Certificate in lieu of an  International Load Line Certificate, 1966, in such case, verify that it  is valid and any conditions stipulated therein are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A foreign vessel of a nation for which the 1966 Convention has  not come into force does not qualify for an International Load Line  Certificate, 1966. In lieu thereof, such a vessel shall be required to  have on board a valid Form B load line certificate or a recognized 1930  Convention certificate.
