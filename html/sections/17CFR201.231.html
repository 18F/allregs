Any respondent in an enforcement or disciplinary  proceeding may move that the Division of Enforcement produce for  inspection and copying any statement of any person called or to be  called as a witness by the Division of Enforcement that pertains, or is  expected to pertain, to his or her direct testimony and that would be  required to be produced pursuant to the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. 3500. For  purposes of this section, statement shall have the meaning set forth in  18 U.S.C. 3500(e). Such production shall be made at a time and place  fixed by the hearing officer and shall be made available to any party,  provided, however, that the production shall be made under conditions  intended to preserve the items to be inspected or copied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Failure to produce--harmless error. In the event that a  statement required to be made available for inspection and copying by a  respondent is not turned over by the Division of Enforcement, no  rehearing or redecision of a proceeding already heard or decided shall  be required unless the respondent establishes that the failure to turn  over the statement was not harmless error.
