                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section,  each arriving alien applying for admission (or boarding the vessel or  aircraft on which he or she arrives) into the United States for lawful  permanent residence, or as a lawful permanent resident returning to an  unrelinquished lawful permanent residence in the United States, shall  present one of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A valid, unexpired immigrant visa;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A valid, unexpired Form I-551, Permanent Resident Card, if  seeking readmission after a temporary absence of less than 1 year, or in  the case of a crewmember regularly serving on board a vessel or aircraft  of United States registry seeking readmission after any temporary  absence connected with his or her duties as a crewman;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A valid, unexpired Form I-327, Permit to Reenter the United  States;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A valid, unexpired Form I-571, Refugee Travel Document, properly  endorsed to reflect admission as a lawful permanent resident;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An expired Form I-551, Permanent Resident Card, accompanied by a  filing receipt issued within the previous 6 months for either a Form I- 751, Petition to Remove the Conditions on Residence, or Form I-829,  Petition by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions, if seeking admission or  readmission after a temporary absence of less than 1 year;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A Form I-551, whether or not expired, presented by a civilian or  military employee of the United States Government who was outside the  United States pursuant to official orders, or by the spouse or child of  such employee who resided abroad while the employee or serviceperson was  on overseas duty and who is preceding, accompanying or following to join  within 4 months the employee, returning to the United States; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Form I-551, whether or not expired, or a transportation letter  issued by an American consular officer, presented by an employee of the  American University of Beirut, who was so employed immediately preceding  travel to   the United States, returning temporarily to the United States before  resuming employment with the American University of Beirut, or resuming  permanent residence in the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Waivers. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A waiver of the visa required in paragraph (a) of  this section shall be granted without fee or application by the district  director, upon presentation of the child's birth certificate, to a child  born subsequent to the issuance of an immigrant visa to his or her  accompanying parent who applies for admission during the validity of  such a visa; or a child born during the temporary visit abroad of a  mother who is a lawful permanent resident alien, or a national, of the  United States, provided that the child's application for admission to  the United States is made within 2 years of birth, the child is  accompanied by the parent who is applying for readmission as a permanent  resident upon the first return of the parent to the United States after  the birth of the child, and the accompanying parent is found to be  admissible to the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For an alien described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section,  recordation of the child's entry shall be on Form I-181, Memorandum of  Creation of Record of Admission for Lawful Permanent Residence. The  carrier of such alien shall not be liable for a fine pursuant to section  273 of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If an immigrant alien returning to an unrelinquished lawful  permanent residence in the United States after a temporary absence  abroad believes that good cause exists for his or her failure to present  an unexpired immigrant visa, permanent resident card, or reentry permit,  the alien may file an application for a waiver of this requirement with  the DHS officer with jurisdiction over the port of entry where the alien  arrives. To apply for this waiver, the alien must file the designated  form with the fee prescribed in 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1). If the alien's  permanent resident card was lost or stolen and the alien has been absent  for less than one year, rather than the waiver application the alien  must apply for a replacement card as described in 8 CFR 264.5. In the  exercise of discretion, the DHS officer who has jurisdiction over the  port of entry where the alien arrives may waive the alien's lack of an  immigrant visa, permanent resident card, or reentry permit and admit the  alien as a returning resident if DHS is satisfied that the alien has  established good cause for the alien's failure to present an immigrant  visa, permanent resident card, or reentry permit. Filing a request to  replace a lost or stolen card will serve as both application for  replacement and as application for waiver of passport and visa, without  the obligation to file a separate waiver application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Immigrants having occupational status defined in section  101(a)(15) (A), (E), or (G) of the Act. An immigrant visa, reentry  permit, or Form I-551 shall be invalid when presented by an alien who  has an occupational status under section 101(a)(15) (A), (E), or (G) of  the Act, unless he or she has previously submitted, or submits at the  time he or she applies for admission to the United States, the written  waiver required by section 247(b) of the Act and 8 CFR part 247.  [62 FR 10346, Mar. 6, 1997, as amended at 63 FR 39218, July 22, 1998; 63  FR 70315, Dec. 21, 1998; 74 FR 26937, June 5, 2009; 76 FR 53786, Aug.  29, 2011]</p>
