                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If, at the end of a fiscal year, the assessments collected are  in excess of expenses incurred, such excess shall be accounted for as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, each  person entitled to a proportionate refund of the excess assessment shall  be credited with such refund against the operation of the following  fiscal year unless such person demands repayment thereof, in which event  it shall be paid to him: Provided, That any sum paid by a person in  excess of his pro rata share of the expenses during any fiscal year may  be applied by the committee at the end of such fiscal year to any  outstanding obligations due the committee from such person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Secretary, upon recommendation of the committee, may  determine   that it is appropriate for the maintenance and functioning of the  committee that the funds remaining at the end of a fiscal year which are  in excess of the expenses necessary for committee operations during such  year may be carried over into following years as a reserve. Such reserve  may be established at an amount not to exceed approximately 3 fiscal  years' operational expenses. Funds in the reserve may be used to cover  the necessary expenses of liquidation, in the event of termination of  this part, and to cover the expenses incurred for the maintenance and  functioning of the committee during any fiscal year when there is crop  failure, or during any period of suspension of any or all of the  provisions of this part. Such reserve may also be used by the committee  to finance its operations during any fiscal year prior to the time that  assessment income is sufficient to cover such expenses and to cover  deficits incurred during any fiscal year when income is less than  expenses. Upon termination of this part, any funds not required to  defray the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in  such manner as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate: Provided,  That to the extent practical, such funds shall be returned pro rata to  the persons from whom such funds were collected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All funds received by the committee pursuant to the provisions  of this part shall be used solely for the purposes specified in this  part, and shall be accounted for in the manner provided in this part.  The Secretary may, at any time, require the committee and its members to  account for all receipts and disbursements.  [19 FR 3439, June 11, 1954, as amended at 22 FR 3513, May 21, 1957.
