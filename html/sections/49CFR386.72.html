                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whenever it is determined that an imminent hazard exists as a  result of the transportation by motor vehicle of a particular hazardous  material, the Chief Counsel or Deputy Chief Counsel of the FMCSA may  bring, or request the United States Attorney General to bring, an action  in the appropriate United States District Court for an order suspending  or restricting the transportation by motor vehicle of the hazardous  material or for such other order as is necessary to eliminate or  ameliorate the imminent hazard, as provided by 49 U.S.C. 5122. In this  paragraph, ``imminent hazard'' means the existence of a condition that  presents a substantial likelihood that death, serious illness, severe  personal injury, or a substantial endangerment to health, property, or  the environment may occur before a notice of investigation proceeding,  or other administrative hearing or formal proceeding, to abate the risk  of harm can be completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whenever it is determined that a violation of 49 U.S.C. 31502  or the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984, as amended, or the Commercial  Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986, as amended, or a regulation issued  under such section or Acts, or a combination of such violations, poses  an imminent hazard to safety, the Director of the Office of Enforcement  and Compliance or a Division Administrator, or his or her delegate,  shall order:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A commercial motor vehicle or employee operating such vehicle  out-of-service, or order an employer to cease all or part of the  employer's commercial motor vehicle operations, as provided by 49 U.S.C.  521(b)(5);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An intermodal equipment provider's specific vehicle or  equipment out-of-service, or order an intermodal equipment provider to  cease all or part   of its operations, as provided by 49 U.S.C. 521(b)(5) and 49 U.S.C.  31151(a)(3)(I).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In making any such order, no restrictions shall be imposed on  any vehicle, terminal or facility, employee, employer or intermodal  equipment provider beyond that required to abate the hazard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In this paragraph (b), imminent hazard means any condition of  vehicle, intermodal equipment, employee, or commercial motor vehicle  operations that substantially increases the likelihood of serious injury  or death if not discontinued immediately.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Upon the issuance of an order under paragraph (b)(1) of this  section, the motor carrier employer, intermodal equipment provider or  driver employee shall comply immediately with such order. Opportunity  for review shall be provided in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 554, except  that such review shall occur not later than 10 days after issuance of  such order, as provided by section 213(b) of the Motor Carrier Safety  Act of 1984 (49 U.S.C. 521(b)(5)). An order to an employer or intermodal  equipment provider to cease all or part of its operations shall not  prevent vehicles in transit at the time the order is served from  proceeding to their immediate destinations, unless any such vehicle or  its driver is specifically ordered out-of-service forthwith. However,  vehicles and drivers proceeding to their immediate destination shall be  subject to compliance upon arrival.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For purposes of this section, the term immediate destination is  the next scheduled stop of the vehicle already in motion where the cargo  on board can be safely secured.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Failure to comply immediately with an order issued under this  section shall subject the motor carrier employer, intermodal equipment  provider, or driver to penalties prescribed in subpart G of this part.
