                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If a State licensing agency determines under Sec. 395.4(c) that the right, title to, and interest in a vending facility may be vested in the blind vendor, the State licensing agency shall enter into a written agreement with each vendor who is to have such ownership. Such agreement shall contain in full the terms and conditions governing such ownership in accordance with criteria in the State licensing agency's regulations, this part, and the terms and conditions of the permit. The criteria established to govern the determination that the title may be so vested shall contain reasonable provisions to enable a vendor to purchase vending facility equipment and to ensure that no individual will be denied the opportunity to become a vendor because of his inability to purchase the vending facility equipment or the initial stock;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The State licensing agency shall establish in writing and maintain policies determining whether the vendor-owner or the State licensing agency shall be required to maintain the vending facility in good repair and in an attractive condition and replace worn-out or obsolete equipment; and if the former, such policies shall provide that upon such vendor-owner's failure to do so, the State licensing agency may make the necessary maintenance, replacement, or repairs and make equitable arrangements for reimbursement;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where the vendor owns such equipment and is required to maintain the vending facility in good repair and in an attractive condition and replace worn-out or obsolete equipment, or agrees to purchase additional new equipment, service charges for such purposes shall be equitably reduced and the method for determining such amount shall be established by the State licensing agency in writing;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where the vendor owns such equipment, the State licensing agency shall retain a first option to repurchase such equipment, and in the event the vendor-owner dies, or for any other reason ceases to be a licensee, or transfers to another vending facility, ownership of such equipment shall become vested in the State licensing agency for transfer to a successor licensee subject to an obligation on its part to pay to such vendor-owner or his estate, the fair value therein; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The vendor-owner, his personal representative or next of kin shall be entitled to an opportunity for a full evidentiary hearing with respect to the determination of the amount to be paid by the State licensing agency for a vendor's ownership in the equipment. When the vendor-owner is dissatisfied with any decision rendered as a result of such hearing, he may file a complaint with the Secretary under Sec. 395.13 to request the convening of an ad hoc arbitration panel.</p>
