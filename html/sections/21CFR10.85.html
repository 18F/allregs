Issues involved.</p><p class="depth2">(A concise statement of the issues and questions on which an opinion  is requested.)</p><p class="depth2">B.

(Signature)_____________________________________________________________ (Person making request)_________________________________________________ (Mailing address)_______________________________________________________   (Telephone number)______________________________________________________</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Commissioner may respond to an oral or written request to  the agency as a request for an advisory opinion, in which case the  request will be filed with the Division of Dockets Management and be  subject to this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A statement of policy or interpretation made in the following  documents, unless subsequently repudiated by the agency or overruled by  a court, will constitute an advisory opinion:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any portion of a Federal Register notice other than the text of  a proposed or final regulation, e.g., a notice to manufacturers or a  preamble to a proposed or final regulation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Trade Correspondence (T.C. Nos. 1-431 and 1A-8A) issued by FDA  between 1938 and 1946.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Compliance policy guides issued by FDA beginning in 1968 and  codified in the Compliance Policy Guides manual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Other documents specifically identified as advisory opinions,  e.g., advisory opinions on the performance standard for diagnostic X-ray  systems, issued before July 1, 1975, and filed in a permanent public  file for prior advisory opinions maintained by the Division of Freedom  of Information (ELEM-1029)'' and adding in its place ``(the Freedom of  Information Staff's address is available on the agency's web site at  http://www.fda.gov.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An advisory opinion represents the formal position of FDA on a  matter and except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section,  obligates the agency to follow it until it is amended or revoked. The  Commissioner may not recommend legal action against a person or product  with respect to an action taken in conformity with an advisory opinion  which has not been amended or revoked.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In unusual situations involving an immediate and significant  danger to health, the Commissioner may take appropriate civil  enforcement action contrary to an advisory opinion before amending or  revoking the opinion. This action may be taken only with the approval of  the Commissioner, who may not delegate this function. Appropriate  amendment or revocation of the advisory opinion involved will be  expedited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> An advisory opinion may be amended or revoked at any time after  it has been issued. Notice of amendment or revocation will be given in  the same manner as notice of the advisory opinion was originally given  or in the Federal Register, and will be placed on public display as part  of the file on the matter in the office of the Division of Dockets  Management. The Division of Dockets Management shall maintain a separate  chronological index of all advisory opinions filed. The index will  specify the date of the request for the advisory opinion, the date of  the opinion, and identification of the appropriate file.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Action undertaken or completed in conformity with an advisory  opinion which has subsequently been amended or revoked is acceptable to  FDA unless the Commissioner determines that substantial public interest  considerations preclude continued acceptance. Whenever possible, an  amended or revoked advisory opinion will state when action previously  undertaken or completed does not remain acceptable, and any transition  period that may be applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> An interested person may submit written comments on an advisory  opinion or modified advisory opinion. Four copies of any comments are to  be sent to the Division of Dockets Management for inclusion in the  public file on the advisory opinion. Individuals may submit only one  copy. Comments will be considered in determining whether further  modification of an advisory opinion is warranted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> An advisory opinion may be used in administrative or court  proceedings to illustrate acceptable and unacceptable procedures or  standards, but not as a legal requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> A statement made or advice provided by an FDA employee  constitutes an advisory opinion only if it is issued in writing under  this section. A statement or advice given by an FDA employee orally, or  given in writing but not under this section or Sec. 10.90, is an  informal communication that represents the best judgment of that  employee at that time but does not constitute an advisory opinion, does  not   necessarily represent the formal position of FDA, and does not bind or  otherwise obligate or commit the agency to the views expressed.
