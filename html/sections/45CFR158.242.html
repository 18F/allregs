                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Individual market. An issuer must meet its obligation to provide any rebate due to an enrollee in the individual market by providing it to the enrollee. For individual policies that cover more than one person, one lump-sum rebate may be provided to the subscriber on behalf of all enrollees covered by the policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Large group and small group markets. Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section, an issuer must meet its obligation to provide any rebate to persons covered under a group health plan by providing it to the policyholder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of a policyholder that is a non-Federal governmental group health plan, the policyholder must use the amount of the rebate that is proportionate to the total amount of premium paid by all subscribers under the policy, for the benefit of subscribers in one of the following ways, at the option of the policyholder:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For all subscribers covered under any option offered under the policyholder's group health plan at the time the rebate is received by the policyholder, to reduce the subscribers' portion of premium for the subsequent policy year;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For subscribers covered, at the time the rebate is received by the policyholder, under the group health plan option for which the issuer is providing a rebate, to reduce the subscribers' portion of premium for the subsequent policy year;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A cash refund to subscribers of the group health plan option for which the issuer is providing a rebate, who were enrolled in the group health plan option either during the MLR reporting year that resulted in the issuer providing the rebate or at the time the rebate is received by the policyholder;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The reduction in future premium or the cash refund provided under paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section may, at the option of the policyholder, be: Divided evenly among such subscribers; divided based on each subscriber's actual contributions to premium; or apportioned in a manner that reasonably reflects each subscriber's contributions to premium; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> All rebate distributions made under paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section must be made within 3 months of the policyholder's receipt of the rebate. Rebate distributions made after 3 months must include late payment interest at the current Federal Reserve Board lending rate or 10 percent annually, whichever is higher, on the total amount of the rebate, accruing from the date payment was due under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a policyholder that is a non-Federal governmental group health plan, the portion of a rebate based upon former subscribers' contributions to premium must be aggregated and used for the benefit of current subscribers in the group health plan in any manner permitted by paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the policyholder is a group health plan that is not a governmental plan and not subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.) (ERISA), rebates may only be paid to the policyholder if the issuer receives a written assurance from the policyholder that the rebates will be used as provided in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section; otherwise, the issuer must distribute the rebate directly to the subscribers of the group health plan covered by the policy during the MLR reporting year on which the rebate is based by dividing the entire rebate, including the amount proportionate to the amount of premium paid by the policyholder, in equal amounts to all subscribers entitled to a rebate without regard to how much each subscriber actually paid toward premiums.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the group health plan has been terminated at the time of rebate payment and the issuer cannot, despite reasonable efforts, locate the policyholder whose plan participants or employees were enrolled in the group health plan, the issuer must distribute the rebate directly to the subscribers of the terminated group health plan by dividing the entire rebate, including the amount proportionate to the amount of premium paid by the policyholder, in equal amounts to all subscribers entitled to a rebate without regard to how much each subscriber actually paid toward premiums.
