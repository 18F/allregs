Sec. 24.16 and 24.17), and miscellaneous amounts (bills other than duties, taxes, reimbursable services, liquidated damages, fines, and penalties) are due as provided for in Sec. 24.3(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Assessment of interest charges--(1) Bills for vessel repair duties, reimbursable services and miscellaneous amounts. If payment is not received by CBP on or before the late payment date appearing on the bill, interest charges will be assessed upon the delinquent principal amount of the bill.

Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) through (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section, interest assessed due to an underpayment of duties, taxes, fees, or interest will accrue from the date the importer of record is required to deposit estimated duties, taxes, fees, and interest to the date of

liquidation or reliquidation of the applicable entry or reconciliation. An example follows:</p><p class="depth0">Example: Entry underpaid as determined upon liquidation</p><p class="depth0">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR20OC99.000</p><p class="depth0">Importer owes $500 plus interest as follows:The importer makes a $1,000 initial deposit on the required date (January 1) and the entry liquidates for $1,500 (December 1).

Importer owes interest on $200 as follows:The importer makes a $1,000 initial deposit on the required date (January 1) and an additional pre-liquidation deposit of $200 (May 1) and the entry liquidates for $1,200 (December 1).

The interest accrues in two segments: (1) Interest accrues in favor of the importer on the initial overpayment ($100) from the date of deposit (January 1) to the date of the refund (May 1); and (2) interest accrues in favor of the Government on the refund overpayment ($200) from the date of the refund (May 1) to the date of liquidation (December 1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the additional deposit or any portion thereof is determined upon liquidation or reliquidation of the applicable entry or reconciliation to constitute a payment in excess of the amount initially required to be deposited, the excess deposit will be treated as a refundable amount on which interest also may be payable (see Sec. 24.36).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If a depository bank notifies CBP by a debit voucher that a CBP account is being debited due to a dishonored check or dishonored Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) transaction, interest will accrue on the debited amount from the date of the debit voucher to either the date of payment of the debt represented by the debit voucher or the date of issuance of a bill for payment, whichever date is earlier.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Interest on overdue bills.

(1) The percentage rate of interest to be charged on such bills will be based upon the quarterly rate(s) established under sections 6621 and 6622 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 6621, 6622). The current rate of interest will appear on the CBP bill and may be obtained from the IRS or the CBP's Revenue Division, Office of Administration.
