                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Participant refuses to accept payment of the VIOMPSP. If a participant, other than one described in paragraph (b) of this section, refuses to accept payment or instructs the school not to accept payment of the VIOMPSP scholarship provided by VA, the participant must, in addition to any obligation incurred under the agreement, pay to the United States the amount of $1,500 in liquidated damages. Payment of this amount must be made no later than 90 days from the date that the participant fails to accept payment of the VIOMPSP or instructs the school not to accept payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Participant fails to complete course of study or does not obtain certification. A participant described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section must, instead of otherwise fulfilling the terms of his or her acceptance agreement, pay to the United States an amount equal to all VIOMPSP funds awarded under the acceptance agreement. Payment of this amount must be made no later than 1 year after the date that the participant meets any of the criteria described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section, unless VA determines that a longer period is necessary to avoid hardship. No interest will be charged on any part of this indebtedness. A participant will pay such amount if one of the following criteria is met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The participant fails to maintain an acceptable level of academic standing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The participant is dismissed from the school for disciplinary reasons;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The participant, for any reason, voluntarily terminates the course of study or program for which the scholarship was awarded including a reduction of course load from full-time to part-time before completing the course of study or program; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The participant fails to become certified in the discipline for which the degree prepared the participant, if applicable, no later than 180 days after the date such person becomes eligible to apply for certification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Participant fails to perform all or any part of their service obligation. (1) Participants who breach their agreements by failing to begin or complete their service obligation, for any reason, including the loss, revocation, suspension, restriction, or limitation of required certification, and other than provided for under paragraph (b) of this section, must repay the portion of all VIOMPSP funds paid to or on behalf of the participant, adjusted for the service that they provided. To calculate the unearned portion of VIOMPSP funds, subtract the number of months of obligated service rendered from the total months of obligated service owed, divide the remaining months by the total obligated service, then multiply by the total amount of VIOMPSP funds paid to or on behalf of the participant. The following formula may be used in determining the unearned portion:
A = P((t-s)/t) in which``A'' is the amount the United States is entitled to recover;``P'' is the amounts paid under the VIOMPSP, to or on behalf of the</p><p class="depth0">participant;``t'' is the total number of months in the participant's period of</p><p class="depth0">obligated service; and``s'' is the number of months of obligated service rendered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount that the United States is entitled to recover will be paid no later than 1 year after the date the applicant failed to begin or complete the period of obligated service, as determined by VA.
