If the local board that ordered  the ASW to report for Alternative Service determines he would be  entitled to classification in Class 3-A, assuming that the ASW were  eligible to file a claim for that class, further compliance with his  order shall be suspended for a period not to exceed 365 days, as the  local board specifies. Extensions of not more than 365 days each may be  granted by the local board so long as the hardship continues until the  ASW's liability for training and service under the Military Selective  Service Act terminates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An ASW may file a request for the suspension of his Order to  Perform Alternative Service with the ASO. This request must be in  writing, state as clearly as possible the basis for the request, and be  signed and dated by the ASW. The ASW must continue working in his  assigned job until his request for the suspension of his Order to  Perform Alternative Service has been approved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Local boards shall follow the procedures established in parts  1642 and 1648 of this chapter to the extent they are applicable in  considering a request for the suspension of an Order to Perform  Alternative Service.</p>
