                            <p class="depth0">Evidence of title, when required by the regulations, must be  submitted in such form and by such abstracter or company as may be  satisfactory to the Bureau of Land Management. A policy of title  insurance, or a certificate of title, may be accepted in lieu of an  abstract, in proper cases, when issued by a title company. A policy of  title insurance when furnished must be free from conditions and  stipulations not acceptable to the Department of the Interior. A  certificate of title will be accepted only where the certificate is made  to the Government, or expressly for its benefit and where the interests  of the Government will be sufficiently protected thereby.
