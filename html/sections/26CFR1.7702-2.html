                                Sec. 1.7702-2  Attained age of the insured under a life insurance
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. This section provides guidance on determining the attained age of an insured under a contract that is a life insurance contract under the applicable law, for purposes of determining the guideline level premium of the contract under section 7702(c)(4), applying the cash value corridor of section 7702(d) or applying the computational rules of section 7702(e), as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Contract insuring a single life. (1) If a contract insures the life of a single individual, either of the following two ages may be treated as the attained age of the insured with respect to that contract--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If a contract insures the life of a single individual, either of the following two ages may be treated as the attained age of the insured with respect to that contract--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The insured's age determined by reference to the individual's actual birthday as of the date of determination (actual age); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The insured's age determined by reference to contract anniversary (rather than the individual's actual birthday), so long as the age assumed under the contract (contract age) is within 12 months of the actual age as of that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Once determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the attained age with respect to an individual insured under a contract changes annually. Moreover, the same attained age must be used for purposes of applying sections 7702(c)(4), 7702(d), and 7702(e), as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Contract insuring multiple lives on a last-to-die basis--(1) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if a contract insures the lives of more than one individual on a last-to-die basis, the attained age of the insured is determined by applying paragraph (b) of this section as if the youngest individual were the only insured under the contract for purposes of sections 7702(c)(4), 7702(d), and 7702(e), as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if a contract insures the lives of more than one individual on a last-to-die basis, the attained age of the insured is determined by applying paragraph (b) of this section as if the youngest individual were the only insured under the contract for purposes of sections 7702(c)(4), 7702(d), and 7702(e), as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Modifications to cash value and future mortality charges upon the death of insured. If both the cash value and future mortality charges under a contract change by reason of the death of one or more insureds to no longer take into account the attained age of the deceased insured or insureds, the youngest surviving insured shall thereafter

be treated as the only insured under the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Contract insuring multiple lives on a first-to-die basis. If a contract insures the lives of more than one individual on a first-to-die basis, the attained age of the insured is determined by applying paragraph (b) of this section as if the oldest individual were the only insured under the contract for purposes of sections 7702(c)(4), 7702(d), and 7702(e), as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the determination of the attained age of the insured for purposes of sections 7702(c)(4), 7702(d), and 7702(e), as applicable. The examples are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X was born on May 1, 1947. X became 60 years old on May 1, 2007. On January 1, 2008, X purchases from IC a contract insuring X's life. January 1 is the contract anniversary date for all future years. IC determines X's annual premiums on an age-last-birthday basis. Based on the method used by IC to determine age, X has an attained age of 60 for the first contract year, 61 for the second contract year, and so on.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 1.7702-2(b)(1) permits the determination of attained age under either of two alternative approaches. Section 1.7702-2(b)(1)(i) provides that, if a contract insures the life of a single insured individual, the attained age may be determined by reference to the individual's actual birthday as of the date of determination. Under this provision, X has an attained age of 60 for the first contract year, 61 for the second contract year, and so on. Alternatively, Sec. 1.7702-2(b)(1)(ii) provides that the insured's age may be determined by reference to contract anniversary (rather than the individual's actual birthday), so long as the age assumed under the contract is within 12 months of the actual age as of that date. If IC determines X's attained age under Sec. 1.7702-2(b)(1)(ii), X likewise has an attained age of 60 for the first contract year, 61 for the second contract year, and so on. Whichever provision IC uses to determine X's attained age must be used consistently from year to year for purposes of sections 7702(c)(4), 7702(d), and 7702(e), as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that, under the contract, X's annual premiums are determined on an age-nearest-birthday basis. X's nearest birthday to January 1, 2008, is May 1, 2008, when X will become 61 years old. Based on the method used by IC to determine age, X has an attained age of 61 for the first contract year, 62 for the second contract year, and so on.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 1.7702-2(b)(1) permits the determination of attained age under either of two alternative approaches. Section 1.7702-2(b)(1)(i) provides that, if a contract insures the life of a single insured individual, the attained age may be determined by reference to the individual's actual birthday as of the date of determination. Under this provision, X has an attained age of 60 for the first contract year, 61 for the second contract year, and so on. Alternatively, Sec. 1.7702-2(b)(1)(ii) provides that the insured's age may be determined by reference to contract anniversary (rather than the individual's actual birthday), so long as the age assumed under the contract is within 12 months of the actual age as of that date. If IC determines X's attained age under Sec. 1.7702-2(b)(1)(ii), X has an attained age of 61 for the first contract year, 62 for the second contract year, and so on. Whichever provision IC uses to determine X's attained age must be used consistently from year to year for purposes of sections 7702(c)(4), 7702(d), and 7702(e), as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that the face amount of the contract is increased on May 15, 2011. During the contract year beginning January 1, 2011, the age assumed under the contract on an age-last-birthday basis is 63 years. However, X has an actual age of 64 as of the date the face amount of the contract is increased.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 1.7702-2(b)(1)(ii) provides that the insured's age may be determined by reference to contract anniversary (rather than the individual's actual birthday), so long as the age assumed under the contract is within 12 months of the actual age. Section 1.7702-2(b)(2) provides that, once determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the attained age with respect to an individual insured under a contract changes annually. Accordingly, X continues to be 63 years old throughout the contract year beginning January 1, 2011, for purposes of sections 7702(c)(4), 7702(d), and 7702(e), as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that in addition to X (born in 1947), the insurance contract also insures the life of Y, born on September 1, 1942. The death benefit will be paid when the second of the two insureds dies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 1.7702-2(c)(1) provides that if a life insurance contract insures the lives of more than one individual on a last-to-die basis, the attained age of the insured is determined by applying Sec. 1.7702-2(b) as if the youngest individual were the only insured under the contract. Because X is younger than Y, the attained age of X must be used for purposes of sections 7702(c)(4), 7702(d), and 7702(e), as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as Example 4 except that X (the younger of the two insureds) dies in 2012. After X's death, both the cash value and mortality charges of the

life insurance contract are adjusted to take into account only the life of Y.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 1.7702-2(c)(1) provides that if a life insurance contract insures the lives of more than one individual on a last-to-die basis, the attained age of the insured is determined by applying Sec. 1.7702-2(b) as if the youngest individual were the only insured under the contract. Paragraph (c)(2) of this section provides that if both the cash value and future mortality charges under a contract change by reason of the death of an insured to no longer take into account the attained age of the deceased insured, the youngest surviving insured is thereafter treated as the only insured under the contract. Because both the cash value and mortality charges are adjusted after X's death to take into account only the life of Y, only the attained age of Y is taken into account after X's death for purposes of sections 7702(c)(4), 7702(d), and 7702(e), as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as Example 1 except that in addition to X (born in 1947), the insurance contract also insures the life of Z, born on September 1, 1952. The death benefit will be paid when the first of the two insureds dies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 1.7702-2(d) provides that if a life insurance contract insures the lives of more than one individual on a first-to-die basis, the attained age of the insured is determined by applying Sec. 1.7702-2(b) as if the oldest individual were the only insured under the contract. Because X is older than Z, the attained age of X must be used for purposes of sections 7702(c)(4), 7702(d), and 7702(e), as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective dates--(1) In general.

Sec. 1.7702B-1  Consumer protection provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Under sections 7702B(b)(1)(F), 7702B(g), and 4980C, qualified long-term care insurance contracts and issuers of those contracts are required to satisfy certain provisions of the Long-Term Care Insurance Model Act (Model Act) and Long-Term Care Insurance Model Regulation (Model Regulation) promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), as adopted as of January 1993. The requirements for qualified long-term care insurance contracts under section 7702B(b)(1)(F) and (g) relate to guaranteed renewal or noncancellability, prohibitions on limitations and exclusions, extension of benefits, continuation or conversion of coverage, discontinuance and replacement of policies, unintentional lapse, disclosure, prohibitions against post-claims underwriting, minimum standards, inflation protection, prohibitions against pre-existing conditions exclusions and probationary periods, and prior hospitalization. The requirements for qualified long-term care insurance contracts under section 4980C relate to application forms and replacement coverage, reporting requirements, filing requirements for marketing, standards for marketing, appropriateness of recommended purchase, standard format outline of coverage, delivery of a shopper's guide, right to return, outline of coverage, certificates under group plans, policy summary, monthly reports on accelerated death benefits, and incontestability period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Coordination with State requirements--(1) Contracts issued in a State that imposes more stringent requirements. If a State imposes a requirement that is more stringent than the analogous requirement imposed by section 7702B(g) or 4980C, then, under section 4980C(f), compliance with the more stringent requirement of State law is considered compliance with the parallel requirement of section 7702B(g) or 4980C. The principles of paragraph (b)(3) of this section apply to any case in which a State imposes a requirement that is more stringent than the analogous requirement imposed by section 7702B(g) or 4980C (as described in this paragraph (b)(1)), but in which there has been a failure to comply with that State requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contracts issued in a State that imposes more stringent requirements. If a State imposes a requirement that is more stringent than the analogous requirement imposed by section 7702B(g) or 4980C, then, under section 4980C(f), compliance with the more stringent requirement of State law is considered compliance with the parallel requirement of section 7702B(g) or 4980C. The principles of paragraph (b)(3) of this section apply to any case in which a State imposes a requirement that is more stringent than the analogous requirement imposed by section 7702B(g) or 4980C (as described in this paragraph (b)(1)), but in which there has been a failure to comply with that State requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contracts issued in a State that has adopted the model provisions. If a State imposes a requirement that is the same as the parallel requirement imposed by

section 7702B(g) or 4980C, compliance with that requirement of State law is considered compliance with the parallel requirement of section 7702B(g) or 4980C, and failure to comply with that requirement of State law is considered failure to comply with the parallel requirement of section 7702B(g) or 4980C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Contracts issued in a State that has not adopted the model provisions or more stringent requirements. If a State has not adopted the Model Act, the Model Regulation, or a requirement that is the same as or more stringent than the analogous requirement imposed by section 7702B(g) or 4980C, then the language, caption, format, and content requirements imposed by sections 7702B(g) and 4980C with respect to contracts, applications, outlines of coverage, policy summaries, and notices will be considered satisfied for a contract subject to the law of that State if the language, caption, format, and content are substantially similar to those required under the parallel provision of the Model Act or Model Regulation. Only nonsubstantive deviations are permitted in order for language, caption, format, and content to be considered substantially similar to the requirements of the Model Act or Model Regulation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effective date. This section applies with respect to contracts issued after December 10, 1999.

Sec. 1.7702B-2  Special rules for pre-1997 long-term care insurancecontracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. The definitions and special provisions of this section apply solely for purposes of determining whether an insurance contract (other than a qualified long-term care insurance contract described in section 7702B(b) and any regulations issued thereunder) is treated as a qualified long-term care insurance contract for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code under section 321(f)(2) of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-191).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Pre-1997 long-term care insurance contracts--(1) In general. A pre-1997 long-term care insurance contract is treated as a qualified long-term care insurance contract, regardless of whether the contract satisfies section 7702B(b) and any regulations issued thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A pre-1997 long-term care insurance contract is treated as a qualified long-term care insurance contract, regardless of whether the contract satisfies section 7702B(b) and any regulations issued thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Pre-1997 long-term care insurance contract defined. A pre-1997 long-term care insurance contract is any insurance contract with an issue date before January 1, 1997, that met the long-term care insurance requirements of the State in which the contract was sitused on the issue date. For this purpose, the long-term care insurance requirements of the State are the State laws (including statutory and administrative law) that are intended to regulate insurance coverage that constitutes ``long-term care insurance'' (as defined in section 4 of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Long-Term Care Insurance Model Act, as in effect on August 21, 1996), regardless of the terminology used by the State in describing the insurance coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Issue date of a contract--(i) In general. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(3), the issue date of a contract is the issue date assigned to the contract by the insurance company. In no event is the issue date earlier than the date the policyholder submitted a signed application for coverage to the insurance company. If the period between the date the signed application is submitted to the insurance company and the date coverage under which the contract actually becomes effective is substantially longer than under the insurance company's usual business practice, then the issue date is the later of the date coverage under which the contract becomes effective or the issue date assigned to the contract by the insurance company. A policyholder's right to return a contract within a free-look period following delivery for a full refund of any premiums paid is not taken into account in determining the contract's issue date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(3), the issue date of a contract is the issue date assigned to the contract by the insurance company. In no event is the issue date earlier than the date the policyholder submitted a signed application for coverage to the insurance company. If the period between the date the signed application is submitted to the insurance company and the date coverage under which the contract actually becomes effective is substantially longer than under the insurance company's usual business practice, then the issue date is the later of the date coverage under which the contract becomes effective or the issue date assigned to the contract by the insurance company. A policyholder's right to return a contract within a free-look period following delivery for a full refund of any premiums paid is not taken into account in determining the contract's issue date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for group contracts. The issue date of a group contract (including any certificate issued thereunder) is the date on which coverage under the group contract becomes effective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exchange of contract or certain changes in a contract treated as a new issuance. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A contract issued in exchange for an existing contract after December 31, 1996, is considered a contract issued after that date;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any change described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section is treated as the issuance of a new contract with an issue date no earlier than the date the change goes into effect; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If a change described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section occurs with regard to one or more, but fewer than all, of the certificates evidencing coverage under a group contract, then the insurance coverage under the changed certificates is treated as coverage under a newly issued group contract (and the insurance coverage provided by any unchanged certificate continues to be treated as coverage under the original group contract).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Changes treated as the issuance of a new contract--(i) In general. For purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, the following changes are treated as the issuance of a new contract--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, the following changes are treated as the issuance of a new contract--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A change in the terms of a contract that alters the amount or timing of an item payable by either the policyholder (or certificate holder), the insured, or the insurance company;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A substitution of the insured under an individual contract; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A change (other than an immaterial change) in the contractual terms, or in the plan under which the contract was issued, relating to eligibility for membership in the group covered under a group contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exceptions. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4), the following changes are not treated as the issuance of a new contract--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A policyholder's exercise of any right provided under the terms of the contract as in effect on December 31, 1996, or a right required by applicable State law to be provided to the policyholder;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A change in the mode of premium payment (for example, a change from monthly to quarterly premiums);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> In the case of a policy that is guaranteed renewable or noncancellable, a classwide increase or decrease in premiums;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A reduction in premiums due to the purchase of a long-term care insurance contract by a family member of the policyholder;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> A reduction in coverage (with a corresponding reduction in premiums) made at the request of a policyholder;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> A reduction in premiums as a result of extending to an individual policyholder a discount applicable to similar categories of individuals pursuant to a premium rate structure that was in effect on December 31, 1996, for the issuer's pre-1997 long-term care insurance contracts of the same type;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> The addition, without an increase in premiums, of alternative forms of benefits that may be selected by the policyholder;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> The addition of a rider (including any similarly identifiable amendment) to a pre-1997 long-term care insurance contract in any case in which the rider, if issued as a separate contract of insurance, would itself be a qualified long-term care insurance contract under section 7702B and any regulations issued thereunder (including the consumer protection provisions in section 7702B(g) to the extent applicable to the addition of a rider);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> The deletion of a rider or provision of a contract that prohibited coordination of benefits with Medicare (often referred to as an HHS (Health and Human Services) rider);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(J)</em> The effectuation of a continuation or conversion of coverage right that is provided under a pre-1997 group contract and that, in accordance with the terms of the contract as in effect on December 31, 1996, provides for coverage under an individual contract following an individual's ineligibility for continued coverage under the group contract; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(K)</em> The substitution of one insurer for another insurer in an assumption reinsurance transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (b):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On December 3, 1996, A, an individual, submits a signed application to an insurance company to purchase a nursing home contract that meets the long-term care insurance requirements of the State in which the contract is sitused. The insurance company decides on December 20, 1996, that it

will issue the contract, and assigns December 20, 1996, as the issue date for the contract. Under the terms of the contract, A's insurance coverage becomes effective on January 1, 1997. The company delivers the contract to A on January 3, 1997. A has the right to return the contract within 15 days following delivery for a refund of all premiums paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the issue date of the contract is December 20, 1996. Thus, the contract is a pre-1997 long-term care insurance contract that is treated as a qualified long-term care insurance contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the insurance coverage under the contract does not become effective until March 1, 1997. Under the insurance company's usual business practice, the period between the date of the application and the date the contract becomes effective is 30 days or less.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the issue date of the contract is March 1, 1997. Thus, the contract is not a pre-1997 long-term care insurance contract, and, accordingly, the contract must meet the requirements of section 7702B(b) and any regulations issued thereunder to be a qualified long-term care insurance contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> B, an individual, is the policyholder under a long-term care insurance contract purchased in 1995. On June 15, 2000, the insurance coverage and premiums under the contract are increased by agreement between B and the insurance company.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section, a change in the terms of a contract that alters the amount or timing of an item payable by the policyholder or the insurance company is treated as the issuance of a new contract. Thus, B's coverage is treated as coverage under a contract issued on June 15, 2000, and, accordingly, the contract must meet the requirements of section 7702B(b) and any regulations issued thereunder in order to be a qualified long-term care insurance contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> C, an individual, is the policyholder under a long-term care insurance contract purchased in 1994. At that time and through December 31, 1996, the contract met the long-term care insurance requirements of the State in which the contract was sitused. In 1996, the policy was amended to add a provision requiring the policyholder to be offered the right to increase dollar limits for inflation every three years (without the policyholder being required to pass a physical or satisfy any other underwriting requirements). During 2002, C elects to increase the amount of insurance coverage (with a resulting premium increase) pursuant to the inflation provision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, an increase in the amount of insurance coverage at the election of the policyholder (without the insurance company's consent and without underwriting or other limitations on the policyholder's rights) pursuant to a pre-1997 inflation provision is not treated as the issuance of a new contract. Thus, C's contract continues to be a pre-1997 long-term care insurance contract that is treated as a qualified long-term care insurance contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effective date. This section is applicable January 1, 1999.
