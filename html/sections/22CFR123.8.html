This  requirement applies whether the aircraft, vessel, or satellite is  physically located in the United States or abroad.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The registration in a foreign country of any aircraft, vessel or  satellite covered by the U.S. Munitions List which is not registered in  the United States but which is located in the United States constitutes  an export. A license or written approval from the Directorate of Defense  Trade Controls is therefore required. Such transactions may also require  the prior approval of the U.S. Department of Transportation's Maritime  Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration or other agencies of  the U.S. Government.
