However, freight prepaid bills of lading which indicate firm incurrence of freight costs will be accepted by A.I.D. as evidence of payment to the ocean carrier provided that the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor agrees to ensure that such carrier is actually paid no later than 7 calendar days following receipt of U.S. Government funds by the sponsor or its agent. A.I.D. will reimburse nongovernmental cooperating sponsors only up to a maximum of 2\1/2\ percent commission paid to their freight forwarders as a result of booking Public Law 480, title II cargo. Similarly, when A.I.D. books cargo, a maximum of 2\1/2\ percent commission may be paid by the contracted carrier. Proof of payment of commissions must be submitted with requests for reimbursement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Shipping instructions--(1) Shipments booked by A.I.D.

USAID or the Diplomatic Post shall promptly clear such requests for shipment of commodities or, if there is reason for delay or disapproval, advise the cooperating sponsor and AID/W within seven (7) days of receipt of requests for shipment. After the cooperating sponsor

headquarters concurs in the request and issues the order, the original will be sent promptly to AID/W which will forward it to CCC for procurement action with a copy to USAID or the Diplomatic Post. Headquarters of cooperating sponsors which book their own shipments shall provide their representatives and USAID or the Diplomatic Post with the names of vessels, ETAs and other pertinent information on shipments booked.

Copies of the guidelines and any proposed amendments may be obtained from the Transportation Division, Office of Procurement, Agency for International Development, Washington, DC 20523.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Tolerances. Delivery by the United States to the cooperating sponsor at point of transfer of title within a tolerance of 5 percent (2 percent in the case of quantities over 10,000 metric tons) plus or minus, of the quantity ordered for shipment shall be regarded as completion of delivery.
