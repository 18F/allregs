                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Creation of the status of an alien lawfully admitted for  permanent residence. (1) In a removal proceeding, an alien may apply to  the immigration judge for cancellation of removal under section 240A of  the Act, adjustment of status under section 1 of the Act of November 2,  1966 (as modified by section 606 of Pub. L. 104-208), section 101 or 104  of the Act of October 28, 1977, section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100, or  section 902 of Pub. L. 105-277, or for the creation of a record of  lawful admission for permanent residence under section 249 of the Act.  The application shall be subject to the requirements of Sec. 1240.20,  and 8 CFR parts 1245 and 1249. The approval of any application made to  the immigration judge under section 245 of the Act by an alien spouse  (as defined in section 216(g)(1) of the Act) or by an alien entrepreneur  (as defined in section 216A(f)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of the Act) shall result in the  alien's obtaining the status of lawful permanent resident on a  conditional basis in accordance with the provisions of section 216 or  216A of the Act, whichever is applicable. However, the Petition to  Remove the Conditions on Residence required by section 216(c) of the  Act, or the Petition by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions required by  section 216A(c) of the Act shall be made to the director in accordance  with 8 CFR part 1216.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In conjunction with any application for creation of status of an  alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence made to an immigration  judge, if the alien is inadmissible under any provision of section  212(a) of the Act, and believes that he or she meets the eligibility  requirements for a waiver of the ground of inadmissibility, he or she  may apply to the immigration judge for such waiver. The immigration  judge shall inform the alien of his or her apparent eligibility to apply  for any of the benefits enumerated in this chapter and shall afford the  alien an opportunity to make application during the hearing, in  accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1240.8(d). In a relevant case,  the immigration judge may adjudicate the sufficiency of an Affidavit of  Support Under Section 213A (Form I-864), executed on behalf of an  applicant for admission or for adjustment of status, in accordance with  the provisions of section 213A of the Act and 8 CFR part 213a.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In exercising discretionary power when considering an  application for status as a permanent resident under this chapter, the  immigration judge may consider and base the decision on information not  contained in the record and not made available for inspection by the  alien, provided the Commissioner has determined that such information is  relevant and is classified under the applicable Executive Order as  requiring protection from unauthorized disclosure in the interest   of national security. Whenever the immigration judge believes that he or  she can do so while safeguarding both the information and its source,  the immigration judge should inform the alien of the general nature of  the information in order that the alien may have an opportunity to offer  opposing evidence. A decision based in whole or in part on such  classified information shall state that the information is material to  the decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Voluntary departure. The alien may apply to the immigration  judge for voluntary departure in lieu of removal pursuant to section  240B of the Act and subpart C of this part. The immigration judge shall  advise the alien of the consequences of filing a post-decision motion to  reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the time specified by  the immigration judge for the alien to depart voluntarily.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applications for asylum and withholding of removal. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the  alien expresses fear of persecution or harm upon return to any of the  countries to which the alien might be removed pursuant to Sec.  1240.10(f), and the alien has not previously filed an application for  asylum or withholding of removal that has been referred to the  immigration judge by an asylum officer in accordance with Sec. 1208.14  of this chapter, the immigration judge shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Advise the alien that he or she may apply for asylum in the  United States or withholding of removal to those countries;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Make available the appropriate application forms; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Advise the alien of the privilege of being represented by  counsel at no expense to the government and of the consequences,  pursuant to section 208(d)(6) of the Act, of knowingly filing a  frivolous application for asylum. The immigration judge shall provide to  the alien a list of persons who have indicated their availability to  represent aliens in asylum proceedings on a pro bono basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An application for asylum or withholding of removal must be  filed with the Immigration Court, pursuant to Sec. 1208.4(b) of this  chapter. Upon receipt of an application, the Immigration Court may  forward a copy to the Department of State pursuant to Sec. 1208.11 of  this chapter and shall calendar the case for a hearing. The reply, if  any, from the Department of State, unless classified under an applicable  Executive Order, shall be given to both the alien and to DHS counsel and  shall be included in the record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Applications for asylum and withholding of removal so filed will  be decided by the immigration judge pursuant to the requirements and  standards established in 8 CFR part 1208 of this chapter after an  evidentiary hearing to resolve factual issues in dispute. An evidentiary  hearing extending beyond issues related to the basis for a mandatory  denial of the application pursuant to Sec. 1208.14 or Sec. 1208.16 of  this chapter is not necessary once the immigration judge has determined  that such a denial is required.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Evidentiary hearings on applications for asylum or withholding  of removal will be open to the public unless the alien expressly  requests that the hearing be closed pursuant to Sec. 3.27 of this  chapter. The immigration judge shall inquire whether the alien requests  such closure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Nothing in this section is intended to limit the authority of  the immigration judge to properly control the scope of any evidentiary  hearing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> During the removal hearing, the alien shall be examined under  oath on his or her application and may present evidence and witnesses in  his or her own behalf. The alien has the burden of establishing that he  or she is a refugee as defined in section 101(a)(42) of the Act pursuant  to the standards set forth in Sec. 1208.13 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Service counsel may call witnesses and present evidence for the  record, including information classified under the applicable Executive  Order, provided the immigration judge or the Board has determined that  such information is relevant to the hearing. When the immigration judge  receives such classified information, he or she shall inform the alien.  The agency that provides the classified information to the immigration  judge may provide an unclassified summary of the information for release  to the alien, whenever it determines it can do so consistently with  safeguarding both the classified nature of the information and its   sources. The summary should be as detailed as possible, in order that  the alien may have an opportunity to offer opposing evidence. A decision  based in whole or in part on such classified information shall state  whether such information is material to the decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The decision of an immigration judge to grant or deny asylum or  withholding of removal shall be communicated to the alien and to the  Service counsel. An adverse decision shall state why asylum or  withholding of removal was denied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Application for relief under sections 237(a)(1)(H) and  237(a)(1)(E)(iii) of the Act. The respondent may apply to the  immigration judge for relief from removal under sections 237(a)(1)(H)  and 237(a)(1)(E)(iii) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> General. An application under this section shall be made only  during the hearing and shall not be held to constitute a concession of  alienage or deportability in any case in which the respondent does not  admit his or her alienage or deportability. However, nothing in this  section shall prohibit the Service from using information supplied in an  application for asylum or withholding of deportation or removal  submitted to the Service on or after January 4, 1995, as the basis for  issuance of a charging document or to establish alienage or  deportability in a case referred to an immigration judge under Sec.  1208.14(b) of this chapter. The alien shall have the burden of  establishing that he or she is eligible for any requested benefit or  privilege and that it should be granted in the exercise of discretion.  Nothing contained in this section is intended to foreclose the  respondent from applying for any benefit or privilege that he or she  believes himself or herself eligible to receive in proceedings under  this part. Nothing in this section is intended to limit the Attorney  General's authority to remove an alien to any country permitted by  section 241(b) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Fees. The alien shall not be required to pay a fee on more than  one application within paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, provided  that the minimum fee imposed when more than one application is made  shall be determined by the cost of the application with the highest fee.  When a motion to reopen or reconsider is made concurrently with an  application for relief seeking one of the immigration benefits set forth  in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, only the fee set forth in  Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of 8 CFR chapter I for the motion must accompany the  motion and application for relief. If such a motion is granted, the  appropriate fee for the application for relief, if any, set forth in 8  CFR 103.7(b)(1), must be paid within the time specified in order to  complete the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Safe third country agreement. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The immigration judge has  authority to apply section 208(a)(2)(A) of the Act, relating to a  determination that an alien may be removed to a safe third country  pursuant to a bilateral or multilateral agreement (Agreement), in the  case of an alien who is subject to the terms of the Agreement and is  placed in proceedings pursuant to section 240 of the Act. In an  appropriate case, the immigration judge shall determine whether under  the Agreement the alien should be returned to the safe third country, or  whether the alien should be permitted to pursue asylum or other  protection claims in the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(A)</em> of the  Act, unless the immigration judge determines, by preponderance of the  evidence, that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Agreement does not apply to the alien or does not preclude  the alien from applying for asylum in the United States; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The alien qualifies for an exception to the Agreement as set  forth in paragraph (g)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The immigration judge shall apply the applicable regulations in  deciding whether the alien qualifies for any exception under the  Agreement that would permit the United States to exercise authority over  the alien's asylum claim. The exceptions under the Agreement are  codified at 8 CFR 208.30(e)(6)(iii). The immigration judge shall not  review, consider, or decide any issues pertaining to any discretionary  determination on whether the alien should be permitted to pursue an  asylum claim in the United States notwithstanding the general terms of  the   Agreement, as such discretionary public interest determinations are  reserved to DHS. However, an alien in removal proceedings who is  otherwise ineligible to apply for asylum under the Agreement may apply  for asylum if DHS files a written notice in the proceedings before the  immigration judge that it has decided in the public interest to allow  the alien to pursue claims for asylum or withholding of removal in the  United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An alien who is found to be ineligible to apply for asylum under  section 208(a)(2)(A) of the Act is ineligible to apply for withholding  of removal pursuant to section 241(b)(3) of the Act and the Convention  against Torture. However, the alien may apply for any other relief from  removal for which the alien may be eligible. If an alien who is subject  to section 208(a)(2)(A) of the Act is ordered removed, the alien shall  be ordered removed to the safe third country in which the alien will be  able to pursue his or her claims for asylum or protection against  persecution or torture under the laws of that country.
