Answers to formal motions shall comply with the requirements of Sec. 201.80. Motions and answers thereto shall be addressed to the presiding officer if the case is pending before such officer. Oral argument upon a written motion in which an answer has been filed may be granted within the discretion of the Administration or the presiding officer, as the case may be.
