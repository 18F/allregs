Any member in good standing of the bar of the highest court  of any State may represent others before the Bureau if such attorney is  not currently suspended or debarred from practice before the Bureau or  by a court of the United States or of any State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> By non-attorneys. So long as such individual is not currently  suspended or debarred from practice before the Bureau:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An individual may appear on his or her own behalf;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A member of a partnership may represent the partnership;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A duly authorized officer of a corporation, trust or  association may represent the corporation, trust or association; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A duly authorized officer or employee of any government unit,  agency, or authority may represent that unit, agency, or authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notice of appearance. Any individual acting as counsel on behalf  of a party, including the Bureau, shall file a notice of appearance at  or before the time that the individual submits papers or otherwise  appears on behalf of a party in the adjudication proceeding. The notice  of appearance must include a written declaration that the individual is  currently qualified as provided in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this  section and is authorized to represent the particular party, and if  applicable, must include the attorney's jurisdiction of admission or  qualification, attorney identification number, and a statement by the  appearing attorney attesting to his or her good standing within the  legal profession. By filing a notice of appearance on behalf of a party  in an adjudication proceeding, the counsel agrees and represents that he  or she is authorized to accept service on behalf of the represented  party and that, in the event of withdrawal from representation, he or  she will, if required by the hearing officer, continue to accept service  until a new counsel has filed a notice of appearance or until the  represented party indicates that he or she will proceed on a pro se  basis. The notice of appearance shall provide the representative's email  address, telephone number and business address and, if different from  the representative's addresses, electronic or other address at which the  represented party may be served.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Sanctions. Dilatory, obstructionist, egregious, contemptuous or  contumacious conduct at any phase of any adjudication proceeding may be  grounds for exclusion or suspension of counsel from the proceeding. An  order imposing a sanction must describe the sanctioned conduct and  explain the basis for the sanction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Standards of conduct; disbarment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All attorneys practicing  before the Bureau shall conform to the standards of ethical conduct  required by the bars of which the attorneys are members.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If for good cause shown, the Director believes that any attorney  is not conforming to such standards, or that an attorney or counsel to a  party has otherwise engaged in conduct warranting disciplinary action,  the Director may issue an order requiring such person to show cause why  he should not be suspended or disbarred from practice before the Bureau.  The alleged   offender shall be granted due opportunity to be heard in his or her own  defense and may be represented by counsel. Thereafter, if warranted by  the facts, the Director may issue against the attorney or counsel an  order of reprimand, suspension, or disbarment.</p>
