A copy of the Secretary's  notice must be submitted with the appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Equitable tolling; extension of filing deadline. In  extraordinary circumstances, the appellant's 15-day deadline for filing  an appeal with the MSPB is subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling,  which permits the Board to extend the deadline where the appellant,  despite having diligently pursued his or her rights, was unable to make  a timely filing. Examples include cases involving deception or in which  the appellant filed a defective pleading during the statutory period.
