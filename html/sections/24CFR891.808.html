                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> HUD is authorized to provide capital advance funds to expand the  supply of supportive housing for the elderly and persons with  disabilities in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Section  202 and Section 811 supportive housing programs. For mixed-finance  projects, HUD provides a capital advance funds reservation to the  sponsor, which transfers the fund reservation to the mixed-finance owner  meeting the requirements of this subpart. The sponsor may transfer the  fund reservation directly to the owner or to the general partner of the  owner, or the sponsor may be the general partner of the mixed-finance  owner if the sponsor meets the applicable statutory and regulatory  requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Developments built with mixed-finance funds may combine Section  202 or Section 811 units with other units, which may or may not benefit  from federal assistance. The number of Section 202 or Section 811  supportive housing units must not be less than the number specified in  the agreement letter for a capital advance. In the case of a Section 811  mixed-finance project, the additional units cannot cause the project to  exceed the applicable Section 811 project size limit if they will also  house persons with disabilities.</p>
