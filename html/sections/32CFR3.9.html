                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority. A competitively awarded OT agreement for a prototype  project that satisfies the condition set forth in law that requires non- Federal parties to the OT agreement to provide at least one-third of the  costs of the prototype project may provide for the award of a follow-on  production contract to the awardee of the OT prototype agreement for a  specific number of units at specific target prices, without further  competition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Conditions. The Agreements Officer must do the following in the  award of the prototype project:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(B)(i)</em>, 10 U.S.C. 2371 note.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use competition to select parties for participation in the OT  prototype agreement and evaluate the proposed quantity and target prices  for the follow-on production units as part of that competition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Determine the production quantity that may be procured without  further competition, by balancing of the level of the investment made in  the project by the non-Federal parties with the interest of the Federal  Government in having competition among sources in the acquisition of the  product or products prototyped under the project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Specify the production quantity and target prices in the OT  prototype agreement and stipualte in the agreement that the Contracting  Officer for the follow-on contract may award a production contract  without further competition if the awardee successfully completes the  prototype project and agrees to production quantities and prices that do  not exceed those specified in the OT prototype agreement (see part  206.001 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Limitation. As a matter of policy, establishing target prices  for production units should only be considered when the risk of the  prototype project permits realistic production pricing   without placing undue risks on the awardee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Documentation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Agreements Officer will need to provide  information to the Contracting Officer from the agreement and award file  that the conditions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section have been  satisfied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The information shall contain, at a minimum:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The competitive procedures used;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> How the production quantities and target prices were evaluated  in the competition;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The percentage of cost-share; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The production quantities and target prices set forth in the OT  agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Project Manager will provide evidence of successful  completion of the prototype project to the Contracting Officer.
