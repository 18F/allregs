In public emergencies, officers may accept private property for storage and safekeeping or for transmission to another destination, provided the owner signs a statement to the effect that the property is being accepted for deposit at his request, at his own risk, and with full knowledge that neither the Government of the United States nor any of its officers assumes responsibility therefor.</p>
