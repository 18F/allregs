                            <p class="depth0">Public Law 97-98 enacted on December 22, 1981, amended section 320 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, to preserve the effectiveness of the tobacco program by discouraging the production of tobacco not under quota in states where tobacco farmers have elected to comply with marketing quotas. Under the amendment, any tobacco represented by the producer as nonquota which is produced in a state where producers have approved marketing quotas shall be determined to be subject to marketing quotas for the quota tobacco produced in that state having the highest price support, with the specific exemptions provided for in section 320(b) and set out in 7 CFR parts 724, 725, and 726 of these regulations. The regulations in this subpart set out procedures for requesting a Tobacco Classification Certificate which would certify that the inspected tobacco is readily and distinguishably different from all kinds of quota tobacco, as determined through application of the standards for inspection and identification of tobacco.</p><p class="depth0">administration</p>
