A property offered for sale under a homeownership program must meet local code requirements (or, if no local code exists, the housing quality standards established by HUD for the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program, 24 CFR part 982) and the relevant requirements of the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4821-4846), the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 4851-4856), and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 35, subparts A, B,

L, and R of this title. When a prospective purchaser who has known disabilities, or who has a family member with known disabilities requires accessible features, the features must be added as a reasonable accommodation to the disability, in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 8.29 of this title. Further, the property must be in good repair, with the major components having a remaining useful life that is sufficient to justify a reasonable expectation that homeownership will be affordable by the purchasers. These standards must be met as a condition for conveyance of a dwelling to an individual purchaser.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A unit in this program for which the purchasing family is receiving assistance under Section 8(y) must be an eligible unit for purposes of the Homeownership Option under 24 CFR part 982, subpart M.</p>
