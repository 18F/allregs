                            <p class="depth0">The administrative law judge shall issue an initial decision on the  application within 75 days after completion of proceedings on the  application. In all decisions on applications, the administrative law  judge shall include written findings and conclusions on the applicant's  eligibility, and an explanation of the reasons for any difference  between the amount requested and the amount awarded. As to applications  filed pursuant to Sec. 2704.105(a), the administrative law judge shall  also include findings on the applicant's status as a prevailing party  and whether the position of the Secretary was substantially justified;  if at issue, the judge shall also make findings on whether the applicant  unduly protracted or delayed the underlying proceeding or whether  special circumstances make the award unjust. As to applications filed  pursuant to Sec. 2704.105(b), the administrative law judge shall include  findings on whether the Secretary made a demand that is substantially in  excess of the decision of the Commission and unreasonable when compared  with that decision; if at issue, the judge shall also make findings on  whether the applicant has committed a willful violation of the law or  otherwise acted in bad faith or whether special circumstances make the  award unjust. Under either paragraph, the decision shall include, if at  issue, detailed findings and conclusions on whether an increase in the  cost of living or any other special factor justifies a higher fee than  the $125 per hour fee set forth in the statute. The initial decision by  the administrative law judge shall become final 40 days after its  issuance unless review by the Commission is ordered under Sec. 2704.308  of this part.
