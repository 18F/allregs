                            <p class="depth0">A nonfarmer, as well as a farmer, who has an employee engaged in the  operations specified in section 13(b)(16) may take advantage of the  exemption. Employees of contractual haulers, packers, processors,  wholesalers, ``bird-dog'' operators, and others may qualify for  exemption. If an employee is engaged in the specified operations, the  exemption will apply ``whether or not'' these operations are ``performed  by the farmer'' who has grown the harvested fruits and vegetables. Where  such operations are performed by the farmer, the engagement by his  employee in them will provide a basis for exemption under section  13(b)(16) without regard to whether the farmer is performing the  operations as an incident to or in conjunction with his farming  operations.</p><p class="depth0">Exempt Operations on Fruits or Vegetables</p>
