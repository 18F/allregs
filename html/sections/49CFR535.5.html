Each manufacturer of a fleet of heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans shall comply with the fuel consumption standards in this paragraph (a) expressed in gallons per 100 miles. If the manufacturer's fleet includes conventional vehicles (gasoline, diesel and alternative fueled vehicles) and advanced technology vehicles (hybrids with regenerative braking, vehicles equipped with Rankine-cycle engines, electric and fuel cell vehicles), it should divide its fleet into two separate fleets each with its own separate fleet average fuel consumption standard which a manufacturer must comply with the requirements of this paragraph (a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Mandatory standards. For model years 2016 and later, each manufacturer must comply with the fleet average standard derived from the unique subconfiguration target standards (or groups of subconfigurations approved by EPA in accordance with 40 CFR 1037.104) of the model types that make up the manufacturer's fleet in a given model year. Each subconfiguration has a unique attribute-based target standard, defined by each group of vehicles having the same payload, towing capacity and whether the vehicles are equipped with a 2-wheel or 4-wheel drive configuration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Subconfiguration target standards.

Round each standard to the nearest 0.01 gallons per 100 miles and specify all weights in pounds rounded to the nearest pound. Calculate the subconfiguration target standards using the following equation:

A manufacturer may optionally certify a tractor to the standards and useful life applicable to a higher vehicle service class (or regulatory subcategory changes such as complying with the Class 8 day-cab tractor standard instead of Class 7 day-cab tractor), provided the manufacturer does not generate credits with the vehicle. If a manufacturer includes smaller vehicles in a credit-generating subfamily (with an FEL below the standard), exclude their production volume from the credit calculation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Vocational tractors. Tractors meeting the definition of vocational tractors in 49 CFR 523.2 for purposes of certifying vehicles to fuel consumption standards, are divided into families of vehicles as specified in 40 CFR 1037.230(a)(1) and must comply with standards for heavy-duty vocational vehicles and engines of the same weight class specified in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section. Class 7 and Class 8 tractors certified or exempted as vocational tractors are limited in production to no more than 21,000 vehicles in any three consecutive model years. If a manufacturer is determined as not applying this allowance in good faith by the EPA in its applications for certification in accordance with 40 CFR 1037.205 and 1037.630, a manufacturer must comply with the tractor fuel consumption standards in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Vocational tractors generating credits can trade and transfer credits in the same averaging sets as tractors and vocational vehicles in the same weight class.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Heavy-duty engines. Each manufacturer of heavy-duty engines shall comply with the fuel consumption standards in this paragraph (d) expressed in gallons per 100 brake-horsepower-hours. Each engine must be certified to the primary intended service class that it is designed for in accordance with 40 CFR 1036.108;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Mandatory standards.

Each engine family is limited to a single model year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A manufacturer complies with the requirements of this part, if at the end of the model year, it provides reports, as specified in Sec. 535.8, by the required deadlines and meets one of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The manufacturer's fuel consumption performance of each engine family as determined in Sec. 535.6 is less than the applicable standard; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The manufacturer uses one or more of the flexibilities provided under NHTSA's Averaging, Banking and Trading Program, specified in Sec. 535.7, to comply with standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A manufacturer failing to comply with the provisions specified in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section is liable to pay civil penalties in accordance with Sec. 535.9.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Voluntary compliance. (i) For model years 2013 through 2016 for compression-ignition engines, and for model year 2015 for spark-ignition engines, a manufacturer may choose voluntarily to comply with the fuel consumption standards provided in paragraph (d)(3) through (5) of this section. For example, a manufacturer may choose to comply early in order to begin accumulating credits through over-compliance with the applicable standards. A manufacturer choosing early compliance must comply with all the vehicles and engines it manufacturers in each regulatory category for a given model year except in model year 2013 the manufacturer may comply with individual engine families as specified in 40 CFR 1036.150(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For model years 2013 through 2016 for compression-ignition engines, and for model year 2015 for spark-ignition engines, a manufacturer may choose voluntarily to comply with the fuel consumption standards provided in paragraph (d)(3) through (5) of this section.

The alternative fuel consumption standards for heavy-duty compression-ignition engines are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Manufacturers entering the voluntary program in model years 2014 through 2016, may choose to certify compression-ignition engine families unable to meet standards provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section to the alternative fuel consumption standards of this paragraph (d)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Manufacturers may not certify engines to these alternate standards if they are part of an averaging set in which they carry a balance of banked credits. For purposes of this section, manufacturers are deemed to carry credits in an averaging set if they carry credits from advance technology that are allowed to be used in that averaging set in accordance with Sec. 535.7(d)(12).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The emission standards of this section are determined as specified in EPA 40 CFR 1036.620(a) through (c) and should be converted to equivalent fuel consumption values.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Alternate Phase-In Standards. Manufacturers have the option to comply with EPA emissions standards for compression-ignition engines using an alternative phase-in schedule that correlates with the EPA OBD standards. If a manufacturer chooses to use the alternative phase-in schedule for meeting EPA standards and optionally chooses to comply early with the NHTSA fuel consumption program, it must use the same phase-in schedule beginning in model year 2013 for fuel consumption standards and must remain in the program for each model year thereafter. The fuel consumption standard for each model year of the alternative phase-in schedule is provided in Table 6 of this section.
