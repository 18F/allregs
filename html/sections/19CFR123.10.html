                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any merchandise or baggage regularly landed but not covered by a  permit for its release shall be allowed to remain at the place of  unlading until the fifteenth calendar day after landing. No later than  20 calendar days after landing, the owner or operator of the vehicle or  the agent thereof shall notify Customs of any such merchandise or  baggage for which entry has not been made. Such notification shall be  provided in writing or by any appropriate Customs-authorized electronic  data interchange system. Failure to provide such notification may result  in assessment of a monetary penalty of up to $1,000 per bill of lading  against the owner or operator of the vehicle or the agent thereof. If  the value of the merchandise on the bill is less than $1,000, the  penalty shall be equal to the value of such merchandise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any merchandise or baggage that is taken into custody from an  arriving carrier by any party under a Customs-authorized permit to  transfer or in-bond entry may remain in the custody of that party for 15  calendar days after receipt under such permit to transfer or 15 calendar  days after arrival at the port of destination. No later than 20 calendar  days after receipt under the permit to transfer or 20 calendar days  after arrival under bond at the port of destination, the party shall  notify Customs of any such merchandise or baggage for which entry has  not been made. Such notification shall be provided in writing or by any  appropriate   Customs-authorized electronic data interchange system. If the party  fails to notify Customs of the unentered merchandise or baggage in the  allotted time, he may be liable for the payment of liquidated damages  under the terms and conditions of his custodial bond (see Sec.  113.63(c)(4) of this chapter).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> and 113.64(b) of this chapter).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the carrier or any other party to whom custody of the  unentered merchandise has been transferred by a Customs-authorized  permit to transfer or in-bond entry fails to timely relinquish custody  of the merchandise to a Customs-approved bonded General Order warehouse,  the carrier or other party may be liable for liquidated damages equal to  the value of that merchandise under the terms and conditions of his  international carrier or custodial bond, as applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the bonded warehouse operator fails to take possession of  unentered and unreleased merchandise or baggage within five calendar  days after receipt of notification of the presence of such merchandise  or baggage under this section, he may be liable for the payment of  liquidated damages under the terms and conditions of his custodial bond  (see Sec. 113.63(a)(1) of this chapter). If the port director finds  that the warehouse proprietor cannot accept the goods because they are  required by law to be exported or destroyed (see Sec. 127.28 of this  chapter), or for other good cause, the goods will remain in the custody  of the arriving carrier or other party to whom the goods have been  transferred under a Customs-authorized permit to transfer or in-bond  entry. In this event, the carrier or other party will be responsible  under bond for exporting or destroying the goods, as necessary (see  Sec. Sec. 113.63(c)(3) and 113.64(b) of this chapter).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In ports where there is no bonded warehouse authorized to accept  general order merchandise, or if merchandise requires specialized  storage facilities which are unavailable in a bonded facility, the port  director, after having received notice of the presence of unentered  merchandise or baggage in   accordance with the provisions of this section, shall direct the storage  of the merchandise by the carrier or by any other appropriate means.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Merchandise taken into the custody of the port director pursuant  to section 490(b), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1490(b)),  shall be sent to a general order warehouse after 1 day after the day the  vehicle arrived, to be held there at the risk and expense of the  consignee.
