                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Form. Recourse by borrowers or guarantors may be by a repayment guarantee, irrevocable letter of credit, additional tangible or intangible collateral, or other form acceptable to the Program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Principals accountable. The principal parties in interest, who ultimately stand most to benefit from the project, will ordinarily be held financially accountable for the project's performance. The Program may require recourse against:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All major shareholders of a closely-held corporate obligor;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The parent corporation of a subsidiary corporate obligor;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The related business entities of the obligor if the Program determines that the obligor lacks substantial pledged assets other than the project property or is otherwise lacking in any credit factor required to approve the application;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any or all major limited partners;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Non-obligor spouses of applicants or obligors in community property states; and/or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Against any others it deems necessary to protect its interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Recourse against parties. Should the Program determine that a secondary means of repayment from other sources is necessary (including the net worth of parties other than the obligor), the Program may require secured or unsecured recourse against any such secondary repayment sources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Recourse unavailable. Where appropriate recourse is unavailable, the conservatively projected net liquidating value of the obligor's assets (as such assets are pledged to the Program) must, in the Program's credit judgment, substantially exceed all projected Program exposure or other risks of loss.</p>
