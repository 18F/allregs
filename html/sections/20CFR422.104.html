We can assign you a social  security number if you meet the evidence requirements in Sec. 422.107  and you are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A United States citizen; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An alien lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent  residence or under other authority of law permitting you to work in the  United States (Sec. 422.105 describes how we determine if a nonimmigrant  alien is permitted to work in the United States); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An alien who cannot provide evidence of alien status showing  lawful admission to the U.S., or an alien with evidence of lawful  admission but without authority to work in the U.S., if the evidence  described in Sec. 422.107(e) does not exist, but only for a valid  nonwork reason. We consider you to have a valid nonwork reason if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You need a social security number to satisfy a Federal statute  or regulation that requires you to have a social security number in  order to receive a Federally-funded benefit to which you have otherwise  established entitlement and you reside either in or outside the U.S.; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You need a social security number to satisfy a State or local  law that requires you to have a social security number in order to  receive public assistance benefits to which you have otherwise  established entitlement, and you are legally in the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Annotation for a nonwork purpose. If we assign you a social  security number as an alien for a nonwork purpose, we will indicate in  our records that you are not authorized to work. We will also mark your  social security card with a legend such as ``NOT VALID FOR EMPLOYMENT.''  If earnings are reported to us on your number, we will inform the  Department of Homeland Security of the reported earnings.  [68 FR 55308, Sept. 25, 2003]</p>
