A Broadcaster shall make the royalty payments due under Sec.  380.12 to the Collective.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Designation of the Collective. (1) Until such time as a new designation is made, SoundExchange, Inc., is designated as the Collective to receive statements of account and royalty payments from Broadcasters due under Sec.  380.12 and to distribute such royalty payments to each Copyright Owner and Performer, or their designated agents, entitled to receive royalties under 17 U.S.C. 112(e) and 114(g).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Until such time as a new designation is made, SoundExchange, Inc., is designated as the Collective to receive statements of account and royalty payments from Broadcasters due under Sec.  380.12 and to distribute such royalty payments to each Copyright Owner and Performer, or their designated agents, entitled to receive royalties under 17 U.S.C. 112(e) and 114(g).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If SoundExchange, Inc. should dissolve or cease to be governed by a board consisting of equal numbers of representatives of Copyright Owners and Performers, then it shall be replaced by a successor Collective upon the fulfillment of the requirements set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> By a majority vote of the nine Copyright Owner representatives and the nine Performer representatives on

the SoundExchange board as of the last day preceding the condition precedent in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, such representatives shall file a petition with the Copyright Royalty Board designating a successor to collect and distribute royalty payments to Copyright Owners and Performers entitled to receive royalties under 17 U.S.C. 112(e) or 114(g) that have themselves authorized such Collective.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Copyright Royalty Judges shall publish in the Federal Register within 30 days of receipt of a petition filed under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section an order designating the Collective named in such petition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Monthly payments and reporting.

All monthly payments shall be rounded to the nearest cent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Minimum payments. A Broadcaster shall make any minimum payment due under Sec.  380.12(b) by January 31 of the applicable calendar year, except that payment by a Broadcaster that was not making Eligible Transmissions or Ephemeral Recordings pursuant to the licenses in 17 U.S.C. 114 and/or 17 U.S.C. 112(e) as of said date but begins doing so thereafter shall be due by the 45th day after the end of the month in which the Broadcaster commences to do so.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Late fees. A Broadcaster shall pay a late fee for each instance in which any payment, any statement of account or any report of use is not received by the Collective in compliance with applicable regulations by the due date. The amount of the late fee shall be 1.5% of a late payment, or 1.5% of the payment associated with a late statement of account or report of use, per month, or the highest lawful rate, whichever is lower. The late fee shall accrue from the due date of the payment, statement of account or report of use until a fully compliant payment, statement of account or report of use is received by the Collective, provided that, in the case of a timely provided but noncompliant statement of account or report of use, the Collective has notified the Broadcaster within 90 days regarding any noncompliance that is reasonably evident to the Collective.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Statements of account. Any payment due under Sec.  380.12 shall be accompanied by a corresponding statement of account.

(1) Broadcasters other than electing Small Broadcasters covered by paragraph (g)(2) of this section shall submit reports of use on a per-performance basis in compliance with the regulations set forth in part 370 of this chapter, except that the following provisions shall apply notwithstanding the provisions of such part 370 of this chapter from time to time in effect:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Broadcasters other than electing Small Broadcasters covered by paragraph (g)(2) of this section shall submit reports of use on a per-performance basis in compliance with the regulations set forth in part 370 of this chapter, except that the following provisions shall apply notwithstanding the provisions of such part 370 of this chapter from time to time in effect:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Broadcasters may pay for, and report usage in, a percentage of their programming hours on an Aggregate Tuning Hour basis as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Broadcasters shall submit reports of use to the Collective on a monthly basis.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> As provided in paragraph (d) of this section, Broadcasters shall submit reports of use by no later than the 45th day following the last day of the month to which they pertain.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, Broadcasters shall submit reports of use to the Collective on a census reporting basis (i.e., reports of use shall include every sound recording performed in the relevant month and the number of performances thereof).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Broadcasters shall either submit a separate report of use for each of their stations, or a collective report of use covering all of their stations but identifying usage on a station-by-station basis;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Broadcasters shall transmit each report of use in a file the name of which includes:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The name of the Broadcaster, exactly as it appears on its notice of use, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the report covers a single station only, the call letters of the station.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Broadcasters shall submit reports of use with headers, as presently described in Sec.  370.4(e)(7) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Broadcasters shall submit a separate statement of account corresponding to each of their reports of use, transmitted in a file the name of which includes:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The name of the Broadcaster, exactly as it appears on its notice of use, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the statement covers a single station only, the call letters of the station.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On a transitional basis for a limited time in light of the unique business and operational circumstances currently existing with respect to Small Broadcasters and with the expectation that Small Broadcasters will be required, effective January 1, 2016, to report their actual usage in compliance with then-applicable regulations. Small Broadcasters that have made an election pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section for the relevant year shall not be required to provide reports of their use of sound recordings for Eligible Transmissions and related Ephemeral Recordings. The immediately preceding sentence applies even if the Small Broadcaster actually makes Eligible Transmissions for the year exceeding 27,777 Aggregate Tuning Hours, so long as it qualified as a Small Broadcaster at the time of its election for that year. In addition to minimum royalties hereunder, electing Small Broadcasters will pay to the Collective a $100 Proxy Fee to defray costs associated with this reporting waiver, including development of proxy usage data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Broadcasters generally reporting pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of this section may pay for, and report usage in, a percentage of their programming hours on an Aggregate Tuning Hours basis, if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Census reporting is not reasonably practical for the programming during those hours, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the total number of hours on a single report of use, provided pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of this section, for which this type of reporting is used is below the maximum percentage set forth below for the relevant year:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> 2011: 16%;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> 2012: 14%;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> 2013: 12%;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> 2014: 10%;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> 2015: 8%.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To the extent that a Broadcaster chooses to report and pay for usage on an Aggregate Tuning Hours basis pursuant to paragraph (g)(3) of this section, the Broadcaster shall</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Report and pay based on the assumption that the number of sound recordings performed during the relevant programming hours is 12 per hour;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Pay royalties (or recoup minimum fees) at the per-performance rates provided in Sec.  380.12 on the basis of paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(A) of this section;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Include Aggregate Tuning Hours in reports of use; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Include in reports of use complete playlist information for usage reported on the basis of Aggregate Tuning Hours.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Election of Small Broadcaster Status. To be eligible for the reporting waiver for Small Broadcasters with respect to any particular channel in a given year, a Broadcaster must satisfy the definition set forth in Sec.  380.11 and must submit to the Collective a completed and signed election form (available on the SoundExchange Web site at http://www.soundexchange.com) by no later than January 31 of the applicable year. Even if a Broadcaster has once elected to be treated as a Small Broadcaster, it must make a separate, timely election in each subsequent year in which it wishes to be treated as a Small Broadcaster.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Distribution of royalties. (1) The Collective shall promptly distribute royalties received from Broadcasters to Copyright Owners and Performers, or their designated agents, that are entitled to such royalties. The Collective shall only be responsible for making distributions to those Copyright Owners, Performers, or their designated agents who provide the Collective with such information as is necessary to identify and pay the correct recipient. The Collective shall distribute royalties on a basis that values all performances by a Broadcaster equally based upon information provided under the report of use requirements for Broadcasters contained in Sec.  370.4 of this chapter and this subpart, except that in the case of electing Small Broadcasters, the Collective shall distribute royalties based on proxy usage data in accordance with a methodology adopted by the Collective's Board of Directors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Collective shall promptly distribute royalties received from Broadcasters to Copyright Owners and Performers, or their designated agents, that are entitled to such royalties.
