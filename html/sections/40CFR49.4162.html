                                Sec. 49.4162  Delegation of authority of administration to the tribes.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> What is the purpose of this section? The purpose of this section is to establish the process by which the Regional Administrator may delegate to the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation the authority to assist the EPA with administration of this Federal Implementation Plan (FIP). This section provides for administrative delegation and does not affect the eligibility criteria under 40 CFR 49.6 for treatment in the same manner as a state.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> How does the Tribe request delegation? In order to be delegated authority to assist us with administration of this FIP, the authorized representative of the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation must submit a request to the Regional Administrator that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Identifies the specific provisions for which delegation is requested;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Includes a statement by the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation's legal counsel (or equivalent official) that includes the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A statement that the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation are an Indian Tribe recognized by the Secretary of the Interior;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A descriptive statement demonstrating that the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation are currently carrying out substantial governmental duties and powers over a defined area and that meets the requirements of Sec. 49.7(a)(2); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A description of the laws of the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation that provide adequate authority to carry out the aspects of the rule for which delegation is requested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Demonstrates that the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation have, or will have, adequate resources to carry out the aspects of the rule for which delegation is requested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> How is the delegation of administration accomplished? (1) A Delegation of Authority Agreement will set forth the terms and conditions of the delegation, will specify the rule and provisions that the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation shall be authorized to implement on behalf of the EPA, and shall be entered into by the Regional Administrator and the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation. The Agreement will become effective upon the date that both the Regional Administrator and the authorized representative of the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation have signed the Agreement. Once the delegation becomes effective, the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation will be responsible, to the extent specified in the Agreement, for assisting us with administration of this FIP and shall act as the Regional Administrator as that term is used in these regulations. Any Delegation of Authority Agreement will clarify the circumstances in which the term ``Regional Administrator''' found throughout this FIP is to remain the EPA Regional Administrator and when it is intended to refer to the ``Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation,'' instead.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A Delegation of Authority Agreement may be modified, amended, or revoked, in part or in whole, by the Regional Administrator after consultation with the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> How will any delegation of authority agreement be publicized? The Regional Administrator shall publish a notice in the Federal Register informing the public of any delegation of authority agreement with the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation to assist us with administration of all or a portion of this FIP and will identify such delegation in the FIP. The Regional Administrator shall also publish an announcement of the delegation of authority agreement in local newspapers.</p>
