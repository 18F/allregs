                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Time for filing petition and restrictions on assessment--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Time for filing petition. Within 90 days after notice of the deficiency  is mailed (or within 150 days after mailing in the case of such notice  addressed to a person outside the States of the Union and the District  of Columbia), as provided in section 6212, a petition may be filed with  the Tax Court of the United States for a redetermination of the  deficiency. In determining such 90-day or 150-day period, Saturday,  Sunday, or a legal holiday in the District of Columbia is not counted as  the 90th or 150th day. In determining the time for filing a petition  with the Tax Court in the case of a notice of deficiency mailed to a  resident of Alaska prior to 12:01 p.m., e.s.t., January 3, 1959, and in  the case of a notice of deficiency mailed to a resident of Hawaii prior  to 4 p.m., e.d.s.t., August 21, 1959, the term ``States of the Union''  does not include Alaska or Hawaii, respectively, and the 150-day period  applies. In determining the time within which a petition to the Tax  Court may be filed in the case of a notice of deficiency mailed to a  resident of Alaska after 12:01 p.m., e.s.t., January 3, 1959, and in the  case of a notice of deficiency mailed to a resident of Hawaii after 4  p.m., e.d.s.t., August 21, 1959, the term ``States of the Union''  includes Alaska and Hawaii, respectively, and the 90-day period applies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Restrictions on assessment. Except as otherwise provided by this  section, by sections 6851, 6852, and 6861(a) (relating to termination  and jeopardy assessments), by section 6871(a) (relating to immediate  assessment of claims for income, estate, and gift taxes in bankruptcy  and receivership cases), or by section 7485 (in case taxpayer petitions  for a review of a Tax Court decision without filing bond), no assessment  of a deficiency in respect of a tax imposed by subtitle A or B or  chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44 of the Code and no levy or proceeding in court  for its collection shall be made until notice of deficiency has been  mailed to the taxpayer, nor until the expiration of the 90-day or 150- day period within which a petition may be filed with the Tax Court, nor,  if a petition has been filed with the Tax Court, until the decision of  the Tax Court has become final. As to the date on which a decision of  the Tax court becomes final, see section 7481. Notwithstanding the  provisions of section 7421(a), the making of an assessment or the  beginning of a proceeding or levy which is forbidden by this paragraph  may be enjoined by a proceeding in the proper court. In any case where  the running of   the time prescribed for filing a petition in the Tax Court with respect  to a tax imposed by chapter 42 or 43 is suspended under section 6213(e),  no assessment of a deficiency in respect of such tax shall be made until  expiration of the entire period for filing the petition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions to restrictions on assessment of deficiencies--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Mathematical errors. If a taxpayer is notified of an additional amount  of tax due on account of a mathematical error appearing upon the return,  such notice is not deemed a notice of deficiency, and the taxpayer has  no right to file a petition with the Tax Court upon the basis of such  notice, nor is the assessment of such additional amount prohibited by  section 6213(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Tentative carryback adjustments. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the district director or  the director of the regional service center determines that any amount  applied, credited, or refunded under section 6411(b) with respect to an  application for a tentative carryback adjustment is in excess of the  overassessment properly attributable to the carryback upon which such  application was based, the district director or the director of the  regional service center may assess the amount of the excess as a  deficiency as if such deficiency were due to a mathematical error  appearing on the return. That is, the district director or the director  of the regional service center may assess an amount equal to the excess,  and such amount may be collected, without regard to the restrictions on  assessment and collection imposed by section 6213(a). Thus, the district  director or the director of the regional service center may assess such  amount without regard to whether the taxpayer has been mailed a prior  notice of deficiency. Either before or after assessing such an amount,  the district director or the director of the regional service center  will notify the taxpayer that such assessment has been or will be made.  Such notice will not constitute a notice of deficiency, and the taxpayer  may not file a petition with the Tax Court of the United States based on  such notice. However, the taxpayer, within the applicable period of  limitation, may file a regular claim for credit or refund based on the  carryback, if he has not already filed such a claim, and may maintain a  suit based on such claim if it is disallowed or if it is not acted upon  by the Internal Revenue Service within 6 months from the date the claim  was filed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The method provided in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph to  recover any amount applied, credited, or refunded in respect of an  application for a tentative carryback adjustment which should not have  been so applied, credited, or refunded is not an exclusive method. Two  other methods are available to recover such amount: (a) By way of a  deficiency notice under section 6212; or (b) by a suit to recover an  erroneous refund under section 7405. Any one or more of the three  available methods may be used to recover any amount which was improperly  applied, credited, or refunded in respect of an application for a  tentative carryback adjustment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> shall in no way be considered   to be the acceptance of an offer by the taxpayer to settle such  controversy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Jeopardy. If the district director believes that the assessment  or collection of a deficiency will be jeopardized by delay, such  deficiency shall be assessed immediately, as provided in section  6861(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Failure to file petition. If no petition is filed with the Tax  Court within the period prescribed in section 6213(a), the district  director or the director of the regional service center shall assess the  amount determined as the deficiency and of which the taxpayer was  notified by registered or certified mail and the taxpayer shall pay the  same upon notice and demand therefor. In such case the district director  will not be precluded from determining a further deficiency and  notifying the taxpayer thereof by registered or certified mail. If a  petition is filed with the Tax Court the taxpayer should notify the  district director who issued the notice of deficiency that the petition  has been filed in order to prevent an assessment of the amount  determined to be the deficiency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Waiver of restrictions. The taxpayer may at any time by a signed  notice in writing filed with the district director waive the  restrictions on the assessment and collection of the whole or any part  of the deficiency. The notice must in all cases be filed with the  district director or other authorized official under whose jurisdiction  the audit or other consideration of the return in question is being  conducted. The filing of such notice with the Tax Court does not  constitute filing with the district director within the meaning of the  Code. After such waiver has been acted upon by the district director and  the assessment has been made in accordance with its terms, the waiver  cannot be withdrawn.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em>, the extension shall not be reduced as a result of  the correction being made prior to expiration of the period allowed for  making correction.
