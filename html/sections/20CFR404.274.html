Depending on the OASDI fund ratio, we measure the rise in one index or in both indexes during the applicable measuring period (described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section) to determine whether there will be an automatic cost-of-living increase and if so, its amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Measuring period based on the CPI--(1) When the period begins.

The measuring period ends with the third calendar quarter of the following year. If this measuring period ends in a year after the year in which an ad hoc increase was enacted or took effect, there can be no cost-of-living increase at that time. We will extend the measuring period to the third calendar quarter of the next year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Measuring period based on the AWI--(1) When the period begins.
