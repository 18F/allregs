                                Sec. 115.36  Indemnity settlements and reinstatement of Principal.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Indemnity settlements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An indemnity settlement occurs when a  defaulted Principal and its Surety agree upon an amount, less than the  actual loss under the bond, which will satisfy the Principal's  indebtedness to the Surety. Sureties must not agree to any indemnity  settlement proposal or enter into any such agreement without SBA's  concurrence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any settlement proposal submitted for SBA's consideration must  include current financial information, including financial statements,  tax returns, and credit reports, together with the Surety's written  recommendations. It should also indicate whether the   Principal is interested in further bonding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Surety must pay SBA its pro rata share of the settlement  amount within 45 days of receipt. Prior to closing the file on a  Principal, the Surety must certify that SBA has received its pro rata  share of all indemnity recovery.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Conditions for reinstatement. At any time after a Principal  becomes ineligible for further bond guarantees under Sec. 115.14(a), the  Surety may recommend that such Principal's eligibility be reinstated.  OSG may agree to reinstate the Principal and its Affiliates if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Principal's guarantee fee has been paid to SBA and SBA  receives evidence that the Principal has paid all delinquent amounts due  to the Surety (including amounts for Imminent Breach); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Surety has settled its claim with the Principal for an  amount and on terms accepted by OSG; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Principal contests a claim and provides collateral,  acceptable to the Surety and OSG, which has a liquidation value of at  least the amount of the claim including related expenses; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Principal's indebtedness to the Surety is discharged by  operation of law (e.g., bankruptcy discharge); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> OSG and the Surety determine that further bond guarantees are  appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Underwriting after reinstatement. A guarantee application  submitted after reinstatement of the Principal's eligibility is subject  to a very stringent underwriting review.  [61 FR 3271, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 79 FR 2087, Jan. 13, 2014]</p>
