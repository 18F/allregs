                            <p class="depth0">Any parties sharing a common non-controlling ownership interest who  aggregate more PCS spectrum among them than a single entity is entitled  to hold (See Sec. Sec. 20.6(e), 24.710, 24.204, 24.229(c) of this  chapter) will be permitted to divest sufficient properties within 90  days of the license grant to come into compliance with the spectrum  aggregation limits as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The broadband PCS applicant shall submit a signed statement with  its long-form application stating that sufficient properties will be  divested within 90 days of the license grant. If the licensee is  otherwise qualified, the Commission will grant the applications subject  to a condition that the licensee come into compliance with the PCS  spectrum aggregation limits within 90 days of grant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Within 90 days of license grant, the licensee must certify that  the applicant and all parties to the application have come into  compliance with the PCS spectrum aggregation limits. If the licensee  fails to submit the certification within 90 days, the Commission will  immediately cancel all broadband PCS licenses won by the applicant,  impose the default penalty and, based on the facts presented, take any  other action it may deem appropriate. Divestiture may be to an interim  trustee if a buyer has not been secured in the required time frame, as  long as the applicant has no interest in or control of the trustee, and  the trustee may dispose of the property as it sees fit. In no event may  the trustee retain the property for longer than six months from grant of  license.  [59 FR 53371, Oct. 24, 1994]    Sec. Sec. 24.834-24.838  [Reserved]</p>
