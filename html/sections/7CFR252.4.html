                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Application by processors to participate. Any food processor is  eligible to apply for participation in the NCP Program. Agreement  applications may be filed with FNS at any time on an FNS-approved form.  FNS will accept or reject the application of each individual food  processor within 30 days from the date of receipt, except that FNS may,  at its discretion, extend such period if it needs more information in  order to make its determination. In determining whether to accept or  reject an application, FNS shall take into consideration at least the  following matters: the financial responsibility of the applicant; the  ability of the applicant to meet the terms and conditions of the  regulations and the NCP agreement; ability to accept and store  commodities in minimum truckload quantities; historical performance  under the State and NCP processing programs; anticipated new markets for  NCP end products; geographic areas served by the processor; the ability  of the applicant to distribute processed products to eligible recipient  agencies; and a satisfactory record of integrity, business ethics and  performance. In addition, the processors must demonstrate their ability  to sell end products under NCP by submitting supporting documentation  such as written intent to purchase, bids awarded, or historical sales  performance. FNS will make a final determination based on all available  documentation submitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Agreement between FNS and Participating Food Processors. Upon  approval of an application for participating in the NCP Program, FNS  shall enter into an agreement with the applicant food processor. All  agreements under the NCP Program will terminate on the June 30th  following the agreement approval date. However, FNS may extend  processing contracts for two 1-year periods, provided that any changed  information must be updated before any contract extension is granted,  including the information in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(5) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Processor requirements and responsibilities. In accordance with  the following provisions and the NCP agreement, any processor  participating in the NCP Program may sell to any eligible recipient  agency nationwide a processed product containing the donated food  received from FNS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The processor shall submit to FNS end product data schedules  which include a description of each end product to be processed, the  quantity of each donated food and any other ingredient which is needed  to yield a specific number of units of each end product. FNS may permit  processors to specify the total quantity of any flavorings or seasonings  which may be used without identifying the ingredients which are, or may  be, components of seasonings or flavorings. The end product data  schedule shall provide pricing information supplied by the processor as  requested by FNS and a thorough explanation of what this pricing  information represents. The end product data schedule shall be made a  part of the NCP agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When determining the value of the donated food, the processor  shall use the agreement value of the donated   food which shall be the price assigned by the Department to a donated  food which reflects the Department's current acquisition price,  transportation and, if applicable, processing costs related to the food.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The processor shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of FNS that  internal controls are in place to insure that duplicate reporting of  sales under the NCP Program and any other food distribution program does  not occur.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The processor shall use a method of selling end products to  recipient agencies which ensures that the price of each case of end  product is reduced by the agreement value of the donated commodity and  ensures proper accountability. In line with FNS guidelines and subject  to FNS approval, the processor shall select one or more of the following  donated food value return systems to use during the term of the  agreement. Regardless of the method used, processors shall provide  pricing information summaries to recipient agencies as soon as possible  after contract approval by FNS. If the pricing information changes  during the contract period, processors shall provide updated pricing  information to FNS and the recipient agencies 30 days prior to the  effective date. Regardless of the method chosen for selling end  products, the processor shall reduce his inventory only by the amount of  donated food represented by the discount or refund placed on the end  product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Direct sale. A direct sale is a sale by the processor directly  to the eligible recipient agency. The following two methods of direct  sales are allowed:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Discount system. When the recipient agency pays the processor  directly for an end product purchased, the processor shall invoice the  recipient agency at the net case price which shall reflect the value of  the discount established in the agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Refund system. The processor shall invoice the recipient agency  for the commercial/gross price of the end product. The recipient agency  shall submit a refund application to the processor within 30 days of  receipt of the processed end product, except that recipient agencies may  submit refund applications to a single processor on a Federal fiscal  quarterly basis if the total anticipated refund due for all purchases of  end product from that processor during the quarter is 25 dollars or  less. The processor shall pay directly to the eligible recipient agency  within 30 days of receipt of the refund application from the recipient  agency, an amount equal to the established agreement value of donated  food per case of end product multiplied by the number of cases delivered  to and accepted by the recipient agency, except that processors may  group together refund applications for a single recipient agency on a  Federal fiscal quarterly basis if the total anticipated refund due that  recipient agency during the quarter is 25 dollars or less. In no event  shall refund applications for purchases during the period of agreement  be accepted by the processor later than 60 days after the close of the  agreement period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Indirect sale. An indirect sale is a sale by the processor  through a distributor to an eligible recipient agency. Indirect sales  can be made with or without dual billing. Dual billing involves the  processor billing the recipient agency for the end product and the  distributor billing the recipient agency for the cost of services  rendered in the handling and delivery of the end product. The following  three methods of indirect sales are allowed:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Sale through distributor with dual billing. When end products  are sold to recipient agencies through a distributor under a system  utilizing dual billing, the processor shall invoice the recipient  agencies directly for the end products purchased at the net case price  which reflects the value of the discount established in the agreement.  The processor shall ensure that the distributor bills the recipient  agencies only for the services rendered in the handling and delivery of  the end product. The processor shall maintain delivery and/or billing  invoices to substantiate the quantity of end product delivered to each  recipient agency and the net case price charged by the processor which  reflects the discount established by the agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Sale through distributor without dual billing. When end products  are sold   to recipient agencies through a distributor without dual billing,  processors shall provide refunds to the distributor and ensure that the  distributor provides discounts of equal value to recipient agencies.  Under this system, the processor shall sell end products to a  distributor at the processor's commercial/gross price for the end  product. The processor's invoice shall reflect the value of commodities  contained in the end product as established by the agreement. The  processor shall ensure that the distributor submits a refund application  to the processor within 30 days after the eligible recipient agency  receives the processed end product. The processor shall ensure that the  refund application includes documentation of the purchase of end  products by the eligible recipient agency through substantiating  invoices and that the recipient agency has purchased the end product at  the net case price which reflects the value of the discount established  by the agreement. Within 30 days of the receipt of the refund  application, the processor shall issue payment directly to the  distributor in an amount equal to the stated agreement value of the  donated food contained in the purchased end products covered by the  application. In no event shall refund applications for purchases during  the period of agreement be accepted by the processors later than 60 days  after the close of the agreement period. The processor shall verify a  statistically valid sample of discount sales made by distributors  without dual billing in a manner which ensures a 95 percent confidence  level. All such sales reported during a quarter shall be verified at the  end of that quarter. Processors shall verify that sales were made only  to eligible recipient agencies and that the value of donated commodities  was passed through to those recipient agencies. The processor shall  report to FNS the level of invalid or inaccurate sales identified in  each quarter within 60 days after the close of each quarter. At the same  time such report is submitted, the processor shall submit to FNS a  corrective action plan designed to correct problems identified in the  verification effort. The processor shall adjust performance reports to  reflect the invalid sales identified during the verification effort  required by this paragraph. If, as a result of this verification, FNS  determines that the value of donated food has not been passed on the  recipient agencies or that end products have been improperly  distributed, FNS may assert a claim against the processor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Sale through distributor with a refund. Under the refund system,  processors shall sell end products to distributors at the commercial/ gross price of the end product. Distributors shall sell end products to  recipient agencies at the commercial/gross price of the end products.  Processors shall ensure that their invoices and the invoices of  distributors identify the discount established by the agreement.  Recipient agencies shall submit refund applications to processors within  30 days of receipt of the processed end product. Within 30 days of the  receipt of the refund application from the recipient agency certifying  actual purchases of end product from substantiating invoices maintained  by the recipient agency, the processor shall compute the amount and  issue payment of the refund directly to the recipient agency. In no  event shall refund applications for purchases during the period of the  agreement be accepted by the processor later than 60 days after the  close of the agreement period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Other value pass-through systems. Processors may submit to FNS  for approval any proposed value pass-through (VPT) system not identified  in this section. The ``other'' VPT system must, in the judgment of FNS,  be verifiable and easily monitored. Any VPT system approved under this  part must comply with the sales verification requirements specified in  paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B) of this section or an alternative system  approved by FNS. If an alternative system is approved, FNS will notify  the States in which the system will be used. The Department retains the  authority to inspect and review all pertinent records under all VPT  systems, including the verification of a required statistically valid  sample of sales. FNS may consider the paperwork and resource burden  associated with alternative value pass-through systems when considering  approval and reserves the right to deny   approval of systems which are labor-intensive and provide no greater  accountability than those systems permitted under paragraph (c)(4) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The processor shall furnish to FNS prior to the ordering of any  donated food for processing, a performance supply and surety bond  obtained from surety companies listed in the current Department of  Treasury Circular 570 or an irrevocable letter of credit to cover the  amount of inventory on hand and on order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The processor shall draw down inventory only for the amount of  donated food used to produce the end product. In instances in which  concentrated skim milk is substituted for nonfat dry milk, the processor  shall draw down donated nonfat dry milk inventory only in an amount  equal to the amount of concentrated skim milk, based on milk solids  content, used to produce the end product. Processors shall ensure that  an amount equivalent to 100 percent of the donated food provided to the  processor under the NCP Program is physically contained in end products.  Additional commodities required to account for loss of donated food  during production shall be obtained from non-donated food.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(A)</em> of  this section (substitution of meat and poultry items shall not be  permitted).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Processors may request approval to substitute commercial foods  for donated foods not listed in paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section by  submitting such request to FNS in writing and satisfying the  requirements of paragraph (c)(7) of this section. FNS will notify the  processor in writing of authorization to substitute commercial foods for  donated foods not listed in paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section and such  authorization shall apply for the duration of all current contracts  entered into by the processor pursuant to this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The processor shall maintain records to substantiate that it  continues to acquire on the commercial market amounts of substitutable  food consistent with their levels of non-NCP Program production and to  document the receipt and disposition of the donated food.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> FNS shall withhold deliveries of donated food from processors  that FNS determines have reduced their level of non-NCP Program  production because of participation in the NCP Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When the processor seeks FNS approval to substitute donated  nonfat dry milk with concentrated skim milk under paragraph (c)(7)(i)(A)  of this section, an addendum must be added to the request which states:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The percent of milk solids that, at a minimum, must be contained  in the concentrated skim milk;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The weight ratio of concentrated skim milk to donated nonfat dry  milk:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The weight ratio is the weight of concentrated skim milk which  equals one pound of donated nonfat dry milk, based on milk solids;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In calculating this weight, nonfat dry milk shall be considered  as containing 96.5 percent milk solids;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If more than one concentration of concentrated skim milk is to  be used, a separate weight ratio must be specified for each  concentration;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The processor's method of verifying that the milk solids content  in the concentrated skim milk is as stated in the request;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A requirement that the concentrated skim milk shall be produced  in a USDA approved plant or in a plant approved by an appropriate  regulatory authority for the processing of Grade A milk products; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> A requirement that the contact value of donated food for a given  amount of concentrated skim milk used to produce an end product is the  value of the equivalent amount of donated nonfat dry milk, based on the  weight ratio of the two foods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Substitution must not be made solely for the purpose of  selling or disposing of the donated commodity in commercial channels for  profit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The processor shall be liable for all donated food provided  under the agreement. The processor shall immediately report to FNS any  loss or damage to donated food and shall dispose of   damaged or out-of-condition food in accordance with Sec. 250.7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The processor shall submit to FNS monthly performance reports  reflecting the sale and delivery of end products during the month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The processor shall ensure that the monthly performance report  is postmarked no later than the last day of the month following the  month being reported. The processor shall identify the month of delivery  for each sale reported. The sale and delivery of end products for any  prior month may be included on the monthly performance report. The  processor monthly performance report shall include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The donated food inventory at the beginning of the reporting  month;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Amount of donated food received from the Department during the  reporting month;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Amount of donated food transferred to and/or from existing  inventory;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A list of all recipient agencies purchasing end products and the  number of units of end products delivered to each during the report  month;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The net price paid for each unit of end product and whether the  sale was made under a discount or refund system;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> When the sale is made through a distributor, the name of the  distributor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> The amount of inventory drawdown represented by reported sales;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> The donated food inventory at the end of the reporting month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In addition to reporting the information identified in  paragraph (c)(9)(i) of this section, processors substituting  concentrated skim milk for donated nonfat dry milk shall report the  following information for the reporting period:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The number of pounds of nonfat dry milk used in commercial  products sold to outlets which are not recipient agencies; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The number of pounds of concentrated skim milk and the percent  of milk solids contained therein, used in end products sold to recipient  agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> At the end of each agreement period, there will be a final 90  day reconciliation period in which processors may adjust NCP sales for  any month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> The processor shall maintain complete and accurate records of  the receipt, disposal and inventory of donated food including end  products processed from donated food.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The processor shall keep production records, formulae, recipes,  daily or batch production records, loadout sheets, bills of lading, and  other processing and shipping records to substantiate the use of the  donated food and the subsequent redelivery to an eligible recipient  agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The processor shall document that sales reported on monthly  performance reports, specified in paragraph (c)(9) of this section were  made only to eligible recipient agencies and that the normal wholesale  price of the product was discounted or a refund payment made for the  agreement value of the donated commodity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> When donated food is commingled with commercial food, the  processor shall maintain records which will permit an accurate  determination of the donated commodity inventory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The processor shall make all pertinent records available for  inspection and review upon request by FNS, its representatives and the  General Accounting Office (GAO). All records must be retained for a  period of three years from the close of the Federal fiscal year to which  they pertain. Longer retention may be required for resolution of an  audit or of any litigation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> The processor shall obtain, upon FNS request, Federal  acceptance service grading and review of processing activities and shall  be bound by the terms and conditions of the grading and/or review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> The processor shall indemnify and save FNS and the recipient  agency free and harmless from any claims, damages, judgments, expenses,  attorney's fees, and compensation arising out of physical injury, death,  and/or property damage sustained or alleged to have been sustained in  whole or in part by any and all persons whatsoever as a result of or  arising out of any act or omission of the processor, his/her agents or  employees, or caused or resulting from any deleterious substance,   including bacteria, in any of the products produced from donated food.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> The processor shall be liable for payment for all uncommitted  food inventory remaining at agreement termination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When agreements are terminated at the request of the processor  or at FNS' request because there has been noncompliance on the part of  the processor with the terms and conditions of the agreement, or if any  right of FNS is threatened or jeopardized by the processor, the  processor shall pay FNS an amount equal to the CCC unrestricted sales  price, the cost CCC of replacement on the date the agreement is  terminated, or the agreement value of donated commodities, whichever is  highest, for the inventory, plus any expenses incurred by FNS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When the agreements are terminated at FNS' request where there  has been no fault or negligence on the part of the processor, the  processor shall pay FNS an amount equal to the CCC unrestricted sales  price, the cost to CCC of replacement on the date the agreement is  terminated, or the agreement value of the donated commodities, whichever  is highest, for the inventory, unless FNS and the processor mutually  agree on another value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> The processor shall not assign the processing contract or  delegate any aspect of processing under a subcontract or other  arrangement without the written consent of FNS. The subcontractor shall  be required to become a party to the processing contract and conform to  all conditions contained in that contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> The processor shall comply fully with the provisions of the NCP  agreement and all Federal regulations and instructions relevant to the  NCP Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> The processor shall label end products in accordance with  Sec. 250.15(j) and, when end products contain vegetable protein  products, in accordance with 7 CFR part 210, 225, or 226 appendix A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(17)</em> The processor shall return to FNS any funds received from the  sale of donated food containers and the market value or the price  received from the sale of any by-products of donated food or commercial  food which has been substituted for donated food.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(18)</em> For any year in which a processor receives more than $250,000  in donated food, the processor shall obtain an independent audit  conducted by a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) for that year.  Processors receiving $75,000 to $250,000 in donated food each year shall  obtain an independent audit conducted by a CPA every two years and those  receiving less than $75,000 in donated food each year shall obtain an  independent audit conducted by a CPA every three years. Processors in  the three year audit cycle shall move into the two year audit cycle when  the value of donated food received reaches $75,000. If the Department  determines that the audit is not acceptable or that the audit has  disclosed serious deficiencies, the processor shall be subject to  additional audits by OIG at the request of FNS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Audits shall be conducted in accordance with the auditing  provisions set forth under the Standards for Audit of Government  Organizations, Programs, Activities and Functions, and the FNS Audit  Guide for Multi-State Processors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The costs of the audits shall be borne by the processor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Audit findings shall be submitted by the processors to FNS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Noncompliance with the audit requirement contained in this part  will render the processor ineligible to enter into another processing  contract until the required audit has been conducted and deficiencies  corrected.
