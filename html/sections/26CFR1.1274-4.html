                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Determination of test rate of interest--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Test  rate is the 3-month rate. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this  section, the test rate of interest for a debt instrument issued in  consideration for the sale or exchange of property is the 3-month rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The 3-month rate. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(iii)  of this section, the 3-month rate is the lower of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The lowest applicable Federal rate (based on the appropriate  compounding period) in effect during the 3-month period ending with the  first month in which there is a binding written contract that  substantially sets forth the terms under which the sale or exchange is  ultimately consummated; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The lowest applicable Federal rate (based on the appropriate  compounding period) in effect during the 3-month period ending with the  month in which the sale or exchange occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special rule if there is no binding written contract. If there  is no binding written contract that substantially sets forth the terms  under which the sale or exchange is ultimately consummated, the 3-month  rate is the lowest applicable Federal rate (based on the appropriate  compounding period) in effect during the 3-month period ending with the  month in which the sale or exchange occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Test rate for certain debt instruments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Sale-leaseback  transactions. Under section 1274(e) (relating to certain sale-leaseback  transactions), the test rate is 110 percent of the 3-month rate  determined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. For purposes of  section 1274(e)(3), related party means a person related to the  transferor within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Qualified debt instrument. Under section 1274A(a), the test  rate for a qualified debt instrument is no greater   than 9 percent, compounded semiannually, or an equivalent rate based on  an appropriate compounding period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> provides an alternative test  rate under section 1274(d)(1)(D) for a debt instrument with a maturity  of 1 year or less. This alternative test rate applies, however, only if  the debt instrument provides for adequate stated interest using the  alternative test rate, the issuer provides on the face of the debt  instrument that the instrument qualifies as having adequate stated  interest under section 1274(d)(1)(D), and the issuer and holder treat or  agree to treat the instrument as having adequate stated interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Alternative test rate. For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A),  the alternative test rate is the market yield on U.S. Treasury bills  with the same maturity date as the debt instrument. If the same maturity  date is not available, the market yield on U.S. Treasury bills that  mature in the same week or month as the debt instrument is used. The  alternative test rate is determined as of the date on which there is a  binding written contract that substantially sets forth the terms under  which the sale or exchange is ultimately consummated or as of the date  of the sale or exchange, whichever date results in a lower rate. If  there is no binding written contract, however, the alternative test rate  is determined as of the date of the sale or exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Applicable Federal rate. Except as otherwise provided in this  section, the applicable Federal rate for a debt instrument is based on  the term of the instrument (i.e., short-term, mid-term, or long-term).  See section 1274(d)(1). The Internal Revenue Service publishes the  applicable Federal rates for each month in the Internal Revenue Bulletin  (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter). The applicable Federal  rates are based on the yield to maturity of outstanding marketable  obligations of the United States of similar maturities during the one  month period ending on the 14th day of the month preceding the month for  which the rates are applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Special rules to determine the term of a debt instrument for  purposes of determining the applicable Federal rate--(1) Installment  obligation. If a debt instrument is an installment obligation (as  defined in Sec. 1.1273-1(e)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1))</em>, the term of the instrument is the  instrument's weighted average maturity (as defined in Sec. 1.1273- 1(e)(3)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Certain variable rate debt instruments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except  as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, if a  variable rate debt instrument (as defined in Sec. 1.1275-5(a)) provides  for stated interest at a qualified floating rate (or rates), the term of  the instrument is determined by reference to the longest interval  between interest adjustment dates, or, if the variable rate debt  instrument provides for a fixed rate, the interval between the issue  date and the last day on which the fixed rate applies, if this interval  is longer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Restrictions on adjustments. If, due to significant  restrictions on variations in a qualified floating rate or the use of  certain formulae pursuant to Sec. 1.1275-5(b)(2) (e.g., 15 percent of  1-year LIBOR, plus 800 basis points), the rate in substance resembles a  fixed rate, the applicable Federal rate is determined by reference to  the term of the debt instrument.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Counting of either the issue date or the maturity date. The term  of a debt instrument includes either the issue date or the maturity  date, but not both dates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Certain debt instruments that provide for principal payments  uncertain as to time. If a debt instrument provides for principal  payments that are fixed in total amount but uncertain as to time, the  term of the instrument is determined by reference to the latest possible  date on which a principal payment can be made or, in the case of an  installment obligation, by reference to the longest weighted average  maturity under any possible payment schedule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Foreign currency loans. If all of the payments of a debt  instrument are denominated in, or determined by reference to, a currency  other than the U.S. dollar, the applicable Federal rate for the debt  instrument is a foreign currency rate of interest that is analogous to  the applicable Federal rate described in this section. For this purpose,  an analogous rate of interest is a   rate based on yields (with the appropriate compounding period) of the  highest grade of outstanding marketable obligations denominated in such  currency (excluding any obligations that benefit from special tax  exemptions or preferential tax rates not available to debt instruments  generally) with due consideration given to the maturities of the  obligations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. On July 1, 1996, A sells  nonpublicly traded property to B in return for a 5-year debt instrument  that provides for interest to be paid on July 1 of each year, beginning  on July 1, 1997, based on the prime rate of a local bank on that date.  However, the interest rate cannot increase or decrease from one year to  the next by more than .25 percentage points (25 basis points).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of  this section, the applicable Federal rate is determined by reference to  the term of the debt instrument, and the applicable Federal rate is the  Federal mid-term rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. On January 1, 1996, A  sells nonpublicly traded property to B in exchange for a debt instrument  that calls for a payment of $500,000 on January 1, 2001, and a payment  of $1,000,000 on January 1, 2006. The debt instrument does not provide  for any stated interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determination of term. The debt instrument is an installment  obligation. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the term of the debt  instrument is its weighted average maturity (as defined in Sec. 1.1273- 1(e)(3)). The debt instrument's weighted average maturity is 8.33 years,  which is the sum of (A) the ratio of the first payment to total payments  (500,000/1,500,000), multiplied by the number of complete years from the  issue date until the payment is due (5 years), and (B) the ratio of the  second payment to total payments (1,000,000/1,500,000), multiplied by  the number of complete years from the issue date until the second  payment is due (10 years).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Applicable Federal rate. Based on the calculation in paragraph  (ii) of this example, the term of the debt instrument is treated as 8.33  years. Consequently, the applicable Federal rate is the Federal mid-term  rate.
