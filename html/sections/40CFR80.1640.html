                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any refiner who produces gasoline by blending blendstock into  PCG, as defined at Sec. 80.2(d), must meet the requirements of  Sec. 80.1630 to sample and test every batch of gasoline as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Exclude the PCG for purposes of demonstrating compliance with  the sulfur standards of this subpart O.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To accomplish the exclusion required in paragraph (a)(1) of this  section, the refiner must determine the volume and sulfur content of the  PCG used at the refinery and the volume and sulfur content of the  gasoline produced at the refinery, and use the compliance calculation  procedures in paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For each batch of PCG that is used to produce gasoline the  refiner must include the volume and sulfur content of the PCG as a  negative volume and a positive sulfur content in the refiner's  compliance calculations in accord with the requirements at Sec. 80.1603.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For each batch of gasoline produced at the refinery using PCG  and blendstock, the refiner must determine the volume and sulfur content  of the combined product and include each batch of combined product for  purposes of sulfur compliance in the refinery's compliance calculations  at Sec. 80.1603 without regard to the presence of previously certified  gasoline in the batch.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The refiner must use any PCG that it includes as a negative  batch in its compliance calculations pursuant to Sec. 80.1603 as a  component in gasoline production during the annual averaging period in  which the PCG was included as a negative batch in the refiner's  compliance calculations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The refiner must also comply with Sec. 80.65(i) when producing  RBOB or RFG and Sec. 80.101(g)(9) when producing conventional gasoline  or CBOB.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Any negative annual average sulfur value shall be reported as  zero and not as a negative result.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the alternative, a refiner may sample and test each batch of  blendstock when received at the refinery to determine the volume and  sulfur content, and treat each blendstock receipt as a separate batch  for purposes of compliance calculations for the annual average sulfur  standard and for reporting. This alternative applies only if every batch  of blendstock used at a refinery during an averaging period has a sulfur  content that is equal to, or less than, the applicable per-gallon cap  standard under Sec. 80.1603.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Refiners who blend only butane into PCG may meet the sampling  and testing requirements of this subpart O for sulfur by using sulfur  test results of the butane supplier, provided that the requirements of  Sec. 80.82 are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Refiners who blend only blender grade pentane into PCG may meet  the sampling and testing requirements of this subpart O for sulfur by  using sulfur test results of the pentane supplier, provided that the  requirements of Sec. 80.85 are met.
