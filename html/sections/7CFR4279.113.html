                            <p class="depth0">Loan purposes must be consistent with the general purpose contained in Sec. 4279.101 of this subpart. They include but are not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Business and industrial acquisitions when the loan will keep the business from closing, prevent the loss of employment opportunities, or provide expanded job opportunities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Business conversion, enlargement, repair, modernization, or development.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Purchase and development of land, easements, rights-of-way, buildings, or facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Purchase of equipment, leasehold improvements, machinery, supplies, or inventory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Pollution control and abatement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Transportation services incidental to industrial development.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Startup costs and working capital.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Agricultural production, when not eligible for Farm Service Agency (FSA) farmer program assistance and when it is part of an integrated business also involved in the processing of agricultural products.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Examples of potentially eligible production include but are not limited to: An apple orchard in conjunction with a food processing plant; poultry buildings linked to a meat processing operation; or sugar beet production coupled with storage and processing. Any agricultural production considered for B&I; financing must be owned, operated, and maintained by the business receiving the loan for which a guarantee is provided. Independent agricultural production operations, even if not

eligible for FSA farmer programs assistance, are not eligible for the B&I; program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The agricultural-production portion of any loan will not exceed 50 percent of the total loan or $1 million, whichever is less.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Purchase of membership, stocks, bonds, or debentures necessary to obtain a loan from Farm Credit System institutions and other lenders provided that the purchase is required for all of their borrowers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Purchase of cooperative stock by individual farmers or ranchers in a farmer or rancher cooperative established for the purpose of processing an agricultural commodity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The cooperative may contract for services to process agricultural commodities or otherwise process value-added agricultural products during the 5-year period beginning on the operation startup date of the cooperative in order to provide adequate time for the planning and construction of the processing facility of the cooperative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding Sec. Sec. 4279.131(d) and 4279.137, the individual farmer or rancher may provide financial information in the manner that is generally required by commercial agricultural lenders in order to obtain a loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Aquaculture, including conservation, development, and utilization of water for aquaculture.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Commercial fishing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Commercial nurseries engaged in the production of ornamental plants and trees and other nursery products such as bulbs, flowers, shrubbery, flower and vegetable seeds, sod, and the growing of plants from seed to the transplant stage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Forestry, which includes businesses primarily engaged in the operation of timber tracts, tree farms, and forest nurseries and related activities such as reforestation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> The growing of mushrooms or hydroponics.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Interest (including interest on interim financing) during the period before the first principal payment becomes due or when the facility becomes income producing, whichever is earlier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Feasibility studies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> To refinance outstanding debt when it is determined that the project is viable and refinancing is necessary to improve cash flow and create new or save existing jobs. Except as provided for in Sec. 4279.108(d)(4) of this subpart, existing lender debt may be included provided that, at the time of application, the loan has been current for at least the past 12 months (unless such status is achieved by the lender forgiving the borrower's debt) and the lender is providing better rates or terms. Subordinated owner debt is not eligible under this paragraph. Unless the amount to be refinanced is owed directly to the Federal government or is federally guaranteed, the existing lender debt refinancing must be a secondary part (less than 50 percent) of the overall loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> Takeout of interim financing. Guaranteeing a loan after project completion to pay off a lender's interim loan will not be treated as debt refinancing provided that the lender submits a complete preapplication or application which proposes such interim financing prior to completing the interim loan. A lender that is considering an interim loan should be advised that the Agency assumes no responsibility or obligation for interim loans advanced prior to the Conditional Commitment being issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(t)</em> Fees and charges for professional services and routine lender fees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(u)</em> Agency guarantee fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(v)</em> Tourist and recreation facilities, including hotels, motels, and bed and breakfast establishments, except as prohibited under ineligible purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(w)</em> Educational or training facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(x)</em> Community facility projects which are not listed as an ineligible loan purpose such as convention centers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(y)</em> Constructing or equipping facilities for lease to private businesses engaged in commercial or industrial operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(z)</em> The financing of housing development sites provided that the community demonstrates a need for additional housing to prevent a loss of jobs in the area or to house families moving to the area as a result of new employment opportunities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(aa)</em> Community antenna television services or facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(bb)</em> Provide loan guarantees to assist industries adjusting to terminated Federal agricultural programs or increased foreign competition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(cc)</em> To finance energy projects.

Projects that produce steam or electricity as an output must have met or exceeded acceptance test performance criteria submitted to the Agency and be successfully interconnected with the purchaser of the output. Performance or acceptance test requirements for all other energy projects will be determined by the Agency on a case by case basis. Financing for energy projects will only be allowed when the facility has been constructed according to plans and specifications and is producing at the quality and quantity projected in the application.
