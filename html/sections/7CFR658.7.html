                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4203, states, ``Each  department, agency, independent commission or other unit of the Federal  Government, with the assistance of the Department of Agriculture, shall  review current provisions of law, administrative rules and regulations,  and policies and procedures applicable to it to determine whether any  provision thereof will prevent such unit of the Federal Government from  taking appropriate action to comply fully with the provisions of this  subtitle.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4203, requires, as  appropriate, each department, agency, independent commission, or other  unit of the Federal Government, with the assistance of the Department of  Agriculture, to develop proposals for action to bring its programs,  authorities, and administrative activities into conformity with the  purpose and policy of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> USDA will provide certain assistance to other Federal agencies  for the purposes specified in section 1542 of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4203. If  a Federal agency identifies or suggests changes in laws, administrative  rules and regulations, policies, or procedures that may affect the  agency's compliance with the Act, USDA can advise the agency of the  probable effects of the changes on the protection of farmland. To  request this assistance, officials of Federal agencies should correspond  with the Chief, Natural Resources Conservation Service, P.O. Box 2890,  Washington, DC 20013.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> To meet the reporting requirements of section 1546 of the Act, 7  U.S.C. 4207, and for data collection purposes, each Federal agency is  requested to report to the Chief of the Natural Resources Conservation  Service by November 15th of each year on progress made during the prior  fiscal year to implement sections 1542 (a) and (b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.  4203 (a) and (b). Until an agency fully implements those sections, the  agency should continue to make the annual report, but may omit the  report upon full implementation. However, an agency is requested to file  an annual report for any future year in which the agency has  substantially changed its process for compliance with the Act.
