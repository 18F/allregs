                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. The rules in this section apply to the transportation of one or more metal coils which, individually or grouped together, weigh 2268 kg (5000 pounds) or more. Shipments of metal coils that weigh less than 2268 kg (5000 pounds) may be secured in accordance with the provisions of Sec. Sec. 393.100 through 393.114.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Securement of coils transported with eyes vertical on a flatbed vehicle, in a sided vehicle or in an intermodal container with anchor points--(1) An individual coil. Each coil must be secured by tiedowns arranged in a manner to prevent the coils from tipping in the forward, rearward, and lateral directions. The restraint system must include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An individual coil. Each coil must be secured by tiedowns arranged in a manner to prevent the coils from tipping in the forward, rearward, and lateral directions. The restraint system must include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At least one tiedown attached diagonally from the left side of the vehicle or intermodal container (near the forwardmost part of the coil), across the eye of the coil, to the right side of

the vehicle or intermodal container (near the rearmost part of the coil);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At least one tiedown attached diagonally from the right side of the vehicle or intermodal container (near the forwardmost part of the coil), across the eye of the coil, to the left side of the vehicle or intermodal container (near the rearmost part of the coil);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> At least one tiedown attached transversely over the eye of the coil; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Either blocking and bracing, friction mats or tiedowns to prevent longitudinal movement in the forward direction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Coils grouped in rows. When coils are grouped and loaded side by side in a transverse or longitudinal row, then each row of coils must be secured by the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At least one tiedown attached to the front of the row of coils, restraining against forward motion, and whenever practicable, making an angle no more than 45 degrees with the floor of the vehicle or intermodal container when viewed from the side of the vehicle or container;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At least one tiedown attached to the rear of the row of coils, restraining against rearward motion, and whenever practicable, making an angle no more than 45 degrees with the floor of the vehicle or intermodal container when viewed from the side of the vehicle or container;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> At least one tiedown over the top of each coil or transverse row of coils, restraining against vertical motion. Tiedowns going over the top of a coil(s) must be as close as practicable to the eye of the coil and positioned to prevent the tiedown from slipping or becoming unintentionally unfastened while the vehicle is in transit; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Tiedowns must be arranged to prevent shifting or tipping in the forward, rearward and lateral directions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Securement of coils transported with eyes crosswise on a flatbed vehicle, in a sided vehicle or in an intermodal container with anchor points--(1) An individual coil. Each coil must be secured by the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An individual coil. Each coil must be secured by the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A means (e.g., timbers, chocks or wedges, a cradle, etc.) to prevent the coil from rolling. The means of preventing rolling must support the coil off the deck, and must not be capable of becoming unintentionally unfastened or loose while the vehicle is in transit. If timbers, chocks or wedges are used, they must be held in place by coil bunks or similar devices to prevent them from coming loose. The use of nailed blocking or cleats as the sole means to secure timbers, chocks or wedges, or a nailed wood cradle, is prohibited;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At least one tiedown through its eye, restricting against forward motion, and whenever practicable, making an angle no more than 45 degrees with the floor of the vehicle or intermodal container when viewed from the side of the vehicle or container; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> At least one tiedown through its eye, restricting against rearward motion, and whenever practicable, making an angle no more than 45 degrees with the floor of the vehicle or intermodal container when viewed from the side of the vehicle or container.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prohibition on crossing of tiedowns when coils are transported with eyes crosswise. Attaching tiedowns diagonally through the eye of a coil to form an X-pattern when viewed from above the vehicle is prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Securement of coils transported with eyes lengthwise on a flatbed vehicle, in a sided vehicle or in an intermodal container with anchor points--(1) An individual coil-option 1.
