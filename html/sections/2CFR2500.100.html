The  Foundation's implementation document, the NSF Proposal & Award Policies  & Procedures Guide, may be found at: http://www.nsf.gov/publications/ pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=papp.</p><p class="depth0">NSF's implementation includes the following deviation from the  Uniform Guidance:</p><p class="depth0">Award Cash Management System--NSF is continuing collection of award  financial information through the implementation of the Award Cash  Management Service (ACM$) and the Program Income Worksheet. ACM$  replaced the NSF Federal Financial Report (FFR) and the NSF FastLane  Cash Request process with a single web based user interface. ACM$ is  used to collect award level detail financial information at the time of  each payment request submitted by the awardee institution. The Program  Income Worksheet is used to collect program income financial information  from awardee institutions on an annual basis. ACM$ and the Program  Income Worksheet utilize approved government-wide data elements from the  FFR for the collection of financial information as provided for in the  Uniform Guidance paragraph 505(c) and prescribed in 2 CFR 200.327. The  requirement for Federal agencies to use the FFR data elements for cash  management and financial reporting was publically announced in Federal  Register on August 13, 2008.</p><p class="depth0">PARTS 2501	2519 [RESERVED]</p>
