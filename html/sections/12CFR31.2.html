                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. A national bank and its insiders shall comply with the provisions contained in 12 CFR part 215.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Enforcement.

Sec. Appendix A to Part 31--Interpretations: Deposits Between Affiliated</p><p class="depth0">Banks</p><p class="depth0">a. General rule. A deposit made by a bank in an affiliated bank is treated as a loan or extension of credit to the affiliate bank under 12 U.S.C. 371c, as this statute is implemented by the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation W, 12 CFR part 223. Thus, unless an exemption from Regulation W is available, these deposits must be secured in accordance with 12 CFR 223.14. However, a national bank may not pledge assets to secure private deposits unless otherwise permitted by law (see, e.g., 12 U.S.C. 90 (permitting collateralization of deposits of public funds); 12 U.S.C. 92a (trust funds); and 25 U.S.C. 156 and 162a (Native American funds)). Thus, unless one of the exceptions to 12 CFR part 223 noted in paragraph b. of this interpretation applies, unless another exception applies that enables a bank to meet the collateral requirements of Sec. 223.14, or unless a party other than the bank in which the deposit is made can legally offer and does post the required collateral, a national bank may not:</p><p class="depth0">1. Make a deposit in an affiliated national bank;</p><p class="depth0">2. Make a deposit in an affiliated State-chartered bank unless the affiliated State-chartered bank can legally offer collateral for the deposit in conformance with applicable State law and 12 CFR 223.14; or</p><p class="depth0">3. Receive deposits from an affiliated bank.</p><p class="depth0">b. Exceptions. The restrictions of 12 CFR part 223 (other than 12 CFR 223.13, which requires affiliate transactions to be consistent with safe and sound banking practices) do not apply to deposits:</p><p class="depth0">1. Made in an affiliated depository institution or affiliated foreign bank provided that the deposit represents an ongoing, working balance maintained in the ordinary course of

correspondent business. See 12 CFR 223.42(a); or</p><p class="depth0">2. Made in an affiliated, insured depository institution that meets the requirements of the ``sister bank'' exemption under 12 CFR 223.41(a) or (b).
[73 FR 22251, Apr. 24, 2008]


Sec. Appendix B to Part 31--Comparison of Selected Provisions of Part 31</p><p class="depth0">and Part 32 (as of October 1, 1996)</p><p class="depth0">Note: Even though part 31 now simply requires that national banks comply with the insider lending provisions contained in Regulation O (Reg. O) (12 CFR part 215), the chart in this appendix refers to part 31 because Reg. O is a Federal Reserve Board regulation and part 31 is the means by which several provisions of Reg. O are made applicable to national banks and their insiders.</p><p class="depth0">Definition of ``Loan or Extension of Credit''</p><p class="depth0">Renewals.....................  In most cases, the two definitions of</p><p class="depth0">``loan or extension of credit'' will be</p><p class="depth0">applied in the same manner. A difference</p><p class="depth0">exists, however, in the treatment of</p><p class="depth0">renewals. Under part 31, a renewal of a</p><p class="depth0">loan to an ``insider'' (which, unless</p><p class="depth0">noted otherwise, includes a bank's</p><p class="depth0">executive officers, directors, principal</p><p class="depth0">shareholders, and ``related interests''</p><p class="depth0">of such persons) is considered to be an</p><p class="depth0">extension of credit. Under part 32,</p><p class="depth0">renewals generally are not considered to</p><p class="depth0">be an extension of credit if the bank</p><p class="depth0">exercises reasonable efforts, consistent</p><p class="depth0">with safe and sound banking practices,</p><p class="depth0">to bring the loan into conformance with</p><p class="depth0">the lending limit. Renewals would be</p><p class="depth0">considered an extension of credit under</p><p class="depth0">part 32, however, if new funds are</p><p class="depth0">advanced to the borrower, a new borrower</p><p class="depth0">replaces the original borrower, or the</p><p class="depth0">OCC determines that the renewal was</p><p class="depth0">undertaken to evade the lending limits.Commitments to extend          A binding commitment to make a loan is</p><p class="depth0">credit...                      treated as an extension of credit under</p><p class="depth0">part 31. Under part 32, a commitment to</p><p class="depth0">make a loan will not be treated as an</p><p class="depth0">extension of credit if the amount of the</p><p class="depth0">commitment exceeds the lending limit.</p><p class="depth0">Rather, the commitment will be deemed a</p><p class="depth0">``nonqualifying commitment'' under part</p><p class="depth0">32 and advances may be made thereunder</p><p class="depth0">only if the advance, together with all</p><p class="depth0">other outstanding loans to the borrower,</p><p class="depth0">will not exceed the bank's lending</p><p class="depth0">limit.Overdrafts...................  An advance by means of an overdraft</p><p class="depth0">(except for an intraday overdraft)</p><p class="depth0">generally is considered to be an</p><p class="depth0">extension of credit under both Parts 31</p><p class="depth0">and 32. However, indebtedness in amounts</p><p class="depth0">up to $5,000 is excluded from the</p><p class="depth0">definition of ``extension of credit''</p><p class="depth0">under part 31 if the indebtedness arises</p><p class="depth0">pursuant to a written, preauthorized,</p><p class="depth0">interest-bearing plan or written,</p><p class="depth0">preauthorized transfer of funds from</p><p class="depth0">another account. Under part 31, if an</p><p class="depth0">overdraft is not made pursuant to this</p><p class="depth0">type of plan or transfer, a bank is</p><p class="depth0">prohibited from paying an overdraft of</p><p class="depth0">an insider (which, in this case,</p><p class="depth0">includes only an executive officer or</p><p class="depth0">director of the insider's bank) unless</p><p class="depth0">the overdraft is inadvertent, in amounts</p><p class="depth0">not exceeding $1,000, outstanding for</p><p class="depth0">not more than 5 business days, and</p><p class="depth0">subject to the bank's standard overdraft</p><p class="depth0">fee. Part 32 does not contain these</p><p class="depth0">exceptions for overdrafts, and simply</p><p class="depth0">treats overdrafts (except for intraday</p><p class="depth0">overdrafts) as extensions of credit</p><p class="depth0">subject to lending limits.Guarantees...................  Generally speaking, guarantees are</p><p class="depth0">included in the part 31 definition of</p><p class="depth0">``extension of credit'' but are not</p><p class="depth0">included in the definition of</p><p class="depth0">``extension of credit'' in part 32</p><p class="depth0">unless other criteria are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0">Part 31 applies to any transaction as a</p><p class="depth0">result of which an insider becomes</p><p class="depth0">obligated to pay money to a bank,</p><p class="depth0">whether the obligation arises (i)</p><p class="depth0">directly or indirectly, (ii) because of</p><p class="depth0">an endorsement on an obligation or</p><p class="depth0">otherwise, or (iii) by any means</p><p class="depth0">whatsoever. Accordingly, a loan</p><p class="depth0">guaranteed by an insider will be deemed</p><p class="depth0">to have been made to that insider. In</p><p class="depth0">contrast, part 32 does not consider a</p><p class="depth0">loan on which someone signs as guarantor</p><p class="depth0">as having been made to the guarantor</p><p class="depth0">unless that person is deemed to be a</p><p class="depth0">borrower under the ``direct benefit'' or</p><p class="depth0">``common enterprise'' tests (see</p><p class="depth0">discussion of these tests in the</p><p class="depth0">discussion of the ``General Rule'' under</p><p class="depth0">``Combination/Attribution Rules,''</p><p class="depth0">below).</p><p class="depth0"></p><p class="depth0"></p><p class="depth0">Exclusions to Definition</p><p class="depth0">Funds advanced for taxes,      Both rules exclude funds advanced for</p><p class="depth0">etc., necessary to preserve    items such as taxes, insurance, or other</p><p class="depth0">collateral or that are         expenses related to existing</p><p class="depth0">incidental to indebtedness.    indebtedness. However, part 32 includes</p><p class="depth0">these advances for the purpose of</p><p class="depth0">determining whether subsequent loans</p><p class="depth0">meet the lending limit, whereas part 31</p><p class="depth0">excludes these advances for all</p><p class="depth0">purposes. Part 31 contains no such</p><p class="depth0">requirement.Loan participations..........  Both rules exclude loan participations if</p><p class="depth0">the participation is without recourse.</p><p class="depth0">However, part 32 elaborates on this</p><p class="depth0">exclusion by requiring that the</p><p class="depth0">participation result in a pro rata</p><p class="depth0">sharing of credit risk proportionate to</p><p class="depth0">the respective interests of the</p><p class="depth0">originating and participating lenders.</p><p class="depth0">Part 32 also requires the originating</p><p class="depth0">bank, if funding the entire loan, to</p><p class="depth0">receive funding from the participants</p><p class="depth0">before the close of the next business</p><p class="depth0">day. Otherwise, the portion funded will</p><p class="depth0">be treated as a loan by the originating</p><p class="depth0">bank to the underlying borrower, and may</p><p class="depth0">be treated as a ``nonconforming'' loan</p><p class="depth0">rather than a violation if (i) the</p><p class="depth0">originating bank had an agreement with</p><p class="depth0">the participating bank that reduced the</p><p class="depth0">loan to an amount within the originating</p><p class="depth0">bank's lending limit, (ii) the</p><p class="depth0">participating bank reconfirmed its</p><p class="depth0">participation and the originating bank</p><p class="depth0">had no knowledge of information that</p><p class="depth0">would permit the participating bank to</p><p class="depth0">withhold its participation, and (iii)</p><p class="depth0">the participation was to be funded by</p><p class="depth0">close of business of the originating</p><p class="depth0">bank's next business day.Acquisition of debt through    Under part 31, a note or other evidence</p><p class="depth0">merger or foreclosure.         of indebtedness acquired through a</p><p class="depth0">merger is excluded from the definition</p><p class="depth0">of ``extension of credit.'' Under part</p><p class="depth0">32, the indebtedness is deemed to be a</p><p class="depth0">loan or extension of credit. However, if</p><p class="depth0">a loan that conformed with part 32 when</p><p class="depth0">originally made exceeds the lending</p><p class="depth0">limits following a merger after the loan</p><p class="depth0">is aggregated with other extensions of</p><p class="depth0">credit to the same borrower, the loan</p><p class="depth0">will not be deemed to be a lending</p><p class="depth0">limits violation. Rather, the loan will</p><p class="depth0">be treated as ``nonconforming,'' and the</p><p class="depth0">bank will have to exercise reasonable</p><p class="depth0">efforts to bring the loan into</p><p class="depth0">compliance unless to do so would be</p><p class="depth0">inconsistent with safe and sound banking</p><p class="depth0">practices.Credit card indebtedness.....  An insider may incur up to $15,000 in</p><p class="depth0">debt on a credit card or similar open-</p><p class="depth0">end credit plan offered by the insider's</p><p class="depth0">bank without the debt counting as an</p><p class="depth0">extension of credit under part 31. The</p><p class="depth0">terms of the credit card or other credit</p><p class="depth0">plan must be no more favorable than</p><p class="depth0">those offered by the bank to the general</p><p class="depth0">public. Part 32 does not exclude credit</p><p class="depth0">card debt from the lending limits.</p><p class="depth0"></p><p class="depth0"></p><p class="depth0">Combination/ Attribution Rules</p><p class="depth0">General rule.................  Under part 31, a loan will be attributed</p><p class="depth0">to an insider if the loan proceeds are</p><p class="depth0">``transferred to,'' or used for the</p><p class="depth0">``tangible economic benefit of,'' the</p><p class="depth0">insider or if the loan is made to a</p><p class="depth0">``related interest'' of the insider.</p><p class="depth0">Under part 32, a loan will be attributed</p><p class="depth0">to another person when either (i) the</p><p class="depth0">proceeds of the loan are to be used for</p><p class="depth0">the direct benefit of the other person</p><p class="depth0">or (ii) a common enterprise exists</p><p class="depth0">between the borrower and the other</p><p class="depth0">person. The ``transfer'' test and</p><p class="depth0">``tangible economic benefit'' test of</p><p class="depth0">part 31 are substantially the same as</p><p class="depth0">the ``direct benefit'' test of part 32.</p><p class="depth0">Under each of these tests, a loan will</p><p class="depth0">be attributed to another person where</p><p class="depth0">the proceeds are transferred to the</p><p class="depth0">other person, unless the proceeds are</p><p class="depth0">used in a bona fide arm's length</p><p class="depth0">transaction to acquire property, goods,</p><p class="depth0">or services. However, the ``related</p><p class="depth0">interest'' test of part 31 and the</p><p class="depth0">``common enterprise'' test under part 32</p><p class="depth0">will lead to different results in many</p><p class="depth0">instances. Under part 31, a ``related</p><p class="depth0">interest'' is a company or a political</p><p class="depth0">or campaign committee that is</p><p class="depth0">``controlled'' by an insider. Part 31</p><p class="depth0">defines ``control'' as meaning,</p><p class="depth0">generally speaking, that someone owns or</p><p class="depth0">controls at least 25 percent of a class</p><p class="depth0">of voting securities of a company,</p><p class="depth0">controls the election of a majority of</p><p class="depth0">the company's directors, or can</p><p class="depth0">``exercise a controlling influence''</p><p class="depth0">over the company. Part 32 uses the same</p><p class="depth0">definition of ``control'' in the</p><p class="depth0">``common enterprise'' test, but a mere</p><p class="depth0">finding of ``control'' is not, by</p><p class="depth0">itself, a sufficient basis to find that</p><p class="depth0">a common enterprise exists. Part 32 will</p><p class="depth0">attribute a loan under the ``common</p><p class="depth0">enterprise'' test if the borrowers are</p><p class="depth0">under common control (including where</p><p class="depth0">one of the persons in question controls</p><p class="depth0">the other) and there is ``substantial</p><p class="depth0">financial interdependence'' between the</p><p class="depth0">borrowers (i.e., where at least 50</p><p class="depth0">percent of the gross receipts or</p><p class="depth0">expenditures of one borrower comes from</p><p class="depth0">transactions with the other). If there</p><p class="depth0">is not both common control and</p><p class="depth0">substantial financial interdependence,</p><p class="depth0">the OCC will not attribute a loan under</p><p class="depth0">the ``common enterprise'' test unless</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> the expected source of repayment for</p><p class="depth0">a loan is the same for each borrower and</p><p class="depth0">neither borrower has another source of</p><p class="depth0">income from which the loan may be</p><p class="depth0">repaid, (ii) two people borrow to</p><p class="depth0">acquire a business of which they will</p><p class="depth0">own a majority of the voting securities,</p><p class="depth0">or (iii) OCC determines that a common</p><p class="depth0">enterprise exists based on facts and</p><p class="depth0">circumstances of a particular</p><p class="depth0">transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Loans to corporate groups....  Both Parts 31 and 32 will consider a loan</p><p class="depth0">that was made to a corporation to have</p><p class="depth0">been made to a third person if the tests</p><p class="depth0">identified in the previous discussion of</p><p class="depth0">the ``General Rule'' are satisfied. If</p><p class="depth0">these tests are not met, Parts 31 and 32</p><p class="depth0">still may require attribution, but the</p><p class="depth0">circumstances when this will occur and</p><p class="depth0">the consequences of attribution under</p><p class="depth0">these circumstances differ under the two</p><p class="depth0">rules. Under part 31, a loan to a</p><p class="depth0">corporation will be deemed to have been</p><p class="depth0">made to an insider if the corporation is</p><p class="depth0">a ``related interest'' of the insider</p><p class="depth0">(i.e., the insider owns at least 25%</p><p class="depth0">percent of a class of voting shares of</p><p class="depth0">the company, controls the election of a</p><p class="depth0">majority of the company's directors, or</p><p class="depth0">has the power to exercise a controlling</p><p class="depth0">influence over the company). Under part</p><p class="depth0">32, a loan to an individual or company</p><p class="depth0">will not be considered to have been made</p><p class="depth0">to a corporate group until a ``person''</p><p class="depth0">(which includes individuals and</p><p class="depth0">companies) owns more than 50% of the</p><p class="depth0">voting shares of a company. If a loan is</p><p class="depth0">found to have been made to a related</p><p class="depth0">interest of an insider under part 31,</p><p class="depth0">the loan must comply with all of the</p><p class="depth0">insider lending restrictions of part 31.</p><p class="depth0">If a loan is found to have been made to</p><p class="depth0">a corporate group under part 32, the</p><p class="depth0">loan, when aggregated with all other</p><p class="depth0">loans to that corporate group, generally</p><p class="depth0">may not exceed 50% of the bank's capital</p><p class="depth0">and surplus.</p><p class="depth0">[61 FR 54536, Oct. 21, 1996, as amended at 73 FR 22251, Apr. 24, 2008]</p>
