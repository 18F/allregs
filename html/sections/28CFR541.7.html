The UDC will make one of the following decisions after reviewing the incident report:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You committed the prohibited act(s) charged, and/or a similar prohibited act(s) as described in the incident report;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You did not commit the prohibited act(s) charged; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The incident report will be referred to the Discipline Hearing Officer (DHO) for further review, based on the seriousness of the prohibited act(s) charged.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If you are charged with a Greatest or High severity prohibited act, or are an inmate covered by Sec. 541.4, the UDC will automatically refer the incident report to the DHO for further review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> UDC members. The UDC ordinarily consists of two or more staff. UDC members will not be victims, witnesses, investigators, or otherwise significantly involved in the incident.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Timing. The UDC will ordinarily review the incident report within five work days after it is issued, not counting the day it was issued, weekends, and holidays. UDC review of the incident report may also be suspended if it is being investigated for possible criminal prosecution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Inmate appearance. You are permitted to appear before the UDC during its review of the incident report, except during UDC deliberations or when your presence would jeopardize institution security, at the UDC's discretion.

If you committed a prohibited act(s), the UDC can impose any of the available sanctions listed in Tables 1 and 2, except loss of good conduct sentence credit, disciplinary segregation, or monetary fines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Referral to the DHO.
