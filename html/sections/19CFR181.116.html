                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Right to petition. If the importer does not protest an adverse marking decision in accordance with section 514, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514), and part 174 of this chapter, the exporter or producer of the merchandise which was the subject of the adverse marking decision may file a petition with Customs requesting reconsideration of the decision. The petition may not be filed until after the importer's time to protest the adverse marking decision has expired (see Sec. 174.12(e) of this chapter for the time limits for filing protests). If the importer filed a protest upon which final administrative action has been taken, the exporter or producer may file a petition under this section, provided that the exporter or producer was not given notice of the pending protest pursuant to Sec. 181.114 of this part. If the importer filed a protest on which final administrative action has not been taken and notice of the pending protest was not provided to the exporter or producer under Sec. 181.114 of this part, a petition filed under this section shall be treated by the port director as an intervention under Sec. 181.115 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form and filing of petition. A petition under this section shall be typewritten, in English, and shall be filed, in triplicate, with the port director

Within 60 days of the date of receipt of the petition, the port director shall determine if the petition is to be granted or denied, in whole or in part. If, after reviewing the petition, the port director agrees with all of the petitioner's claims and determines that the initial adverse marking decision was not correct, a written notice granting the petition shall be issued to the petitioner. A description of the merchandise, a brief summary of the issue(s) and the port director's findings shall be forwarded to the Director, Tariff Classification Appeals Division, Customs Headquarters, for publication in the Customs Bulletin. If, after reviewing the petition, the port director determines that the initial adverse marking decision was correct in its entirety, a written notice shall be issued to the petitioner advising that the matter has been forwarded to the Director, Tariff Classification Appeals Division, Customs Headquarters, for further review and decision. All relevant background information, including available samples, a description of the adverse marking decision and the reasons for the decision, and the port director's recommendation shall be furnished to Headquarters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Review by port director.

No decision on a petition will be issued under this section with respect to any issue which is pending before the United States Court of International Trade, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or any court of appeal therefrom.
