                                Sec. 25.6161-1  Extension of time for paying tax or deficiency.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Tax shown on return. A reasonable extension of  time to pay the amount of tax shown on the return may be granted by the  district director at the request of the donor. The period of such  extension shall not be in excess of six months from the date fixed for  the payment of the tax, except that if the taxpayer is abroad the period  of extension may be in excess of six months.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Deficiency. The time for payment of any amount determined as a  deficiency in respect of tax imposed by Chapter 12 of the Code, or for  payment of any part thereof may be extended by the district director at  the request of the donor for a period not to exceed 18 months from the  date fixed for the payment of the deficiency, as shown on the notice and  demand from the district director, and, in exceptional cases, for a  further period not in excess of 12 months. No extension of time for the  payment of a deficiency shall be granted if the deficiency is due to  negligence, to intentional disregard of rules and regulations, or to  fraud with intent to evade tax.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Extension of time for filing distinguished. The granting of an  extension of time for filing a return does not operate to extend the  time for the payment of the tax or any part thereof, unless so specified  in the extension.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Undue hardship required for extension. An extension of the time  for payment shall be granted only upon a satisfactory showing that  payment on the due date of the amount with respect to which the  extension is desired will result in an undue hardship. The extension  will not be granted upon a general statement of hardship. The term  ``undue hardship'' means more than an inconvenience to the taxpayer. It  must appear that substantial financial loss, for example, loss due to  the sale of property at a sacrifice price, will result to the donor from  making payment on   the due date of the amount with respect to which the extension is  desired. If a market exists, the sale of the property at the current  market price is not ordinarily considered as resulting in an undue  hardship.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Application for extension. An application for an extension of  the time for payment of the tax shown on the return, or for the payment  of any amount determined as a deficiency, shall be in writing and shall  be accompanied by evidence showing the undue hardship that would result  to the donor if the extension were refused. The application shall also  be accompanied by a statement of the assets and liabilities of the donor  and an itemized statement showing all receipts and disbursements for  each of the 3 months immediately preceding the due date of the amount to  which the application relates. The application, with supporting  documents, must be filed with the applicable district director referred  to in paragraph (a) of Sec. 25.6091-1 regardless of whether the return  is to be filed with, or the tax is to be paid to, such district director  on or before the date prescribed for payment of the amount with respect  to which the extension is desired. The application will be examined by  the district director, and within 30 days, if possible, will be denied,  granted, or tentatively granted subject to certain conditions of which  the donor will be notified. If an additional extension is desired, the  request therefor must be made to the district director on or before the  expiration of the period for which the prior extension is granted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Payment pursuant to extension. If an extension of time for  payment is granted, the amount the time for payment of which is so  extended shall be paid on or before the expiration of the period of the  extension without the necessity of notice and demand from the district  director. The granting of an extension of the time for payment of the  tax or deficiency does not relieve the donor from liability for the  payment of interest thereon during the period of the extension. See  section 6601 and Sec. 301.6601-1 of this chapter (Regulations on  Procedure and Administration).  [T.D. 6334, 23 FR 8904, Nov. 15, 1958, as amended by T.D. 7012, 34 FR  7692, May 15, 1969]</p>
