                                Sec. 25.6019-2  Returns required in case of consent under section 2513.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Except as otherwise provided in this section, the provisions of  Sec. 25.6019-1 (other than paragraph (d) of Sec. 25.6019-1) apply with  respect to the filing of a gift tax return or returns in the case of a  husband and wife who consent (see Sec. 25.2513-1) to the application of  section 2513. If both spouses are (without regard to the provisions of  section 2513) required under the provisions of Sec. 25.6019-1 to file  returns, returns must be filed by both spouses. If only one of the  consenting spouses is (without regard to the provisions of section 2513)  required under Sec. 25.6019-1 to file a return, a return must be filed  by that spouse. In the latter case if, after giving effect to the  provisions of section 2513, the other spouse is considered to have made  a gift not excluded from the total amount of such other spouse's gifts  for the taxable year by reason of section 2503 (b) or (e) (relating,  respectively, to certain gifts of $10,000 per donee and the exclusion  for certain educational or medical expenses), a return must also be  filed by such other spouse. Thus, if during a calendar year beginning  after December 31, 1981, the first spouse made a gift of $18,000 to a  child (the gift not being either a future interest in property or an  amount excluded under section 2503(e)) and the other spouse made no  gifts, only the first spouse is required to file a return for that  calendar year. However, if the other spouse had made a gift in excess of  $2,000 to the same child during the same calendar year or if the gift  made by the first spouse had amounted to $21,000, each spouse would be  required to file a return if the consent is signified as provided in  section 2513.  [T.D. 8522, 59 FR 9664, Mar. 1, 1994]</p>
