                            <p class="depth0">The definition of ``agriculture,'' as contained in section 3(f) of  the Act, is discussed in subpart B of this part 780. The principles  there discussed should be referred to as guides to the meaning of the  terms ``agricultural employee'' and ``growing and harvesting'' as used  in section 13(a)(14).    Sec. 780.510  ``Any agricultural employee.''</p><p class="depth0">The section 13(a)(14) exemption applies to ``any agricultural  employee'' who is employed in the specified activities. The term ``any  agricultural employee'' includes not only agricultural employees of the  tobacco grower but also such employees of other farmers or independent  contractors. ``Any agricultural employee'' employed in the growing and  harvesting of shade-grown tobacco will qualify for exemption if he  engages in the specified processing operations. The use of the word  ``agricultural'' before ``employee'' makes it apparent that separate  consideration must be given to whether an employee is an ``agricultural  employee'' and to whether he is employed in the specified ``growing and  harvesting'' within the meaning of the Act.</p>
