The investigative report shall be forwarded to the common superior exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the commands to which the alleged offenders are assigned. That officer shall ensure the alleged offenders are shown the investigative report and permitted to comment on it, should they desire, before action is taken on the claim. That officer shall review the investigation and determine whether the claim is properly within the provisions of Article 139, UCMJ, and these regulations, and whether the facts indicate responsibility for the damage on members of his command. If the claim is found payable under these regulations, he shall fix the amount to be assessed against the offenders and direct the appropriate commanding officers to take action accordingly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Forwarding to SECNAV (JAG). Where it is not practical or possible to carry out the procedure in Sec. 755.7(a) of this section, the investigation or investigations shall be forwarded to the Secretary of the Navy (Judge Advocate General) who will take action in the matter. Commanding officers, in such a situation, are not to make charges against the pay of their members until directed by the Secretary of the Navy (Judge Advocate General).</p>
