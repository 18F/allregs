                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Approved State laboratory programs. State laboratory programs approved by HHS are assessed a fee for the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Costs of Federal inspections of laboratories in that State (that is, CLIA-exempt laboratories) to verify that standards are being enforced in an appropriate manner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Costs incurred for investigations of complaints against the State's CLIA-exempt laboratories if the complaint is substantiated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Costs of the State's prorata share of general overhead to develop and implement CLIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Accredited laboratories. (1) In addition to the certificate fee, a laboratory that is issued a certificate of accreditation is also assessed a fee to cover the cost of evaluating individual laboratories to determine overall whether an accreditation organization's standards and inspection policies are equivalent to the Federal program. All accredited laboratories share in the cost of these inspections. These costs are the same as those that are incurred when inspecting nonaccredited laboratories.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In addition to the certificate fee, a laboratory that is issued a certificate of accreditation is also assessed a fee to cover the cost of evaluating individual laboratories to determine overall whether an accreditation organization's standards and inspection policies are equivalent to the Federal program.

Costs are based on the actual resources and time necessary to perform the activities and are not assessed until after the laboratory concedes the existence of deficiencies or an ALJ rules in favor of HHS. HHS revokes the laboratory's certificate for failure to pay the assessed costs. If a complaint investigation results in a complaint being unsubstantiated, or if an HHS adverse action is overturned at the conclusion of the administrative appeals process, the costs of these activities are not imposed upon the laboratory.
