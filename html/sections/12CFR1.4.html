                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Calculation date. For purposes of determining compliance with 12 U.S.C. 24 (Seventh) and this part, a bank shall determine its investment limitations as of the most recent of the following dates:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The last day of the preceding calendar quarter; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The date on which there is a change in the bank's capital category for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 1831o and 12 CFR 6.3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effective date. (1) A bank's investment limit calculated in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be effective on the earlier of the following dates:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A bank's investment limit calculated in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be effective on the earlier of the following dates:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date on which the bank's Consolidated Report of Condition and Income (Call Report) is submitted; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date on which the bank's Consolidated Report of Condition and Income is required to be submitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A bank's investment limit calculated in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section will be effective on the date that the limit is to be calculated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Authority of OCC to require more frequent calculations. If the OCC determines for safety and soundness reasons that a bank should calculate its investment limits more frequently than required by paragraph (a) of this section, the OCC may provide written notice to the bank directing the bank to calculate its investment limitations at a more frequent interval. The bank shall thereafter calculate its investment limits at that interval until further notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Calculation of Type III and Type V securities holdings--(1) General. In calculating the amount of its investment in Type III or Type V securities issued by any one obligor, a bank shall aggregate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. In calculating the amount of its investment in Type III or Type V securities issued by any one obligor, a bank shall aggregate:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Obligations issued by obligors that are related directly or indirectly through common control; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Securities that are credit enhanced by the same entity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Aggregation by type. The aggregation requirement in paragraph (d)(1) of this section applies separately to the Type III and Type V securities held by a bank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Limit on investment company holdings--(1) General. In calculating the amount of its investment in investment company shares under this part, a bank shall use reasonable efforts to calculate and combine its pro rata share of a particular security in the portfolio of each investment company with the bank's direct holdings of that security. The bank's direct holdings of the particular security and the bank's pro rata interest in the same security in the investment company's portfolio may not, in the aggregate, exceed the investment limitation that would apply to that security.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. In calculating the amount of its investment in investment company shares under this part, a bank shall use reasonable efforts to calculate and combine its pro rata share of a particular security in the portfolio of each investment company with the bank's direct holdings of that security. The bank's direct holdings of the particular security and the bank's pro rata interest in the same security in the investment company's portfolio may not, in the aggregate, exceed the investment limitation that would apply to that security.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Alternate limit for diversified investment companies. A national bank may elect not to combine its pro rata interest in a particular security in an investment company with the bank's direct holdings of that security if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The investment company's holdings of the securities of any one issuer do not exceed 5 percent of its total portfolio; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The bank's total holdings of the investment company's shares do not exceed the most stringent investment limitation that would apply to any of the securities in the company's portfolio if those securities were purchased directly by the bank.</p>
