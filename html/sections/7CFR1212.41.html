                            <p class="depth0">With the exception of the initial Board, each Board member and alternate will serve a three-year term or until the Secretary selects his or her successor. No member or alternate may serve more than two consecutive terms, excluding any initial two-year term of office. The terms of the initial Board members shall be staggered for two-, three-, and four-year terms. For the initial Board, one producer, one first handler, one importer, and the representative of a national honey cooperative will serve a two-year term of office. One producer, one first handler, and the importer-handler representative, will serve a three-year term of office. One producer, one first handler, and one importer will serve a four-year term of office. Determination of which of the initial members and their alternates shall serve two-year, three-year or four-year terms, shall be designated by the Secretary. Thereafter, each of these positions will carry a full three-year term. Members serving initial terms of two or four years will be eligible to serve a second term of three years. Each term of office will end on December 31, with new terms of office beginning on January 1. If this part becomes effective on a date such that the initial period is less than six months in duration, then the tolling of time for purposes of this subsection shall not begin until the beginning of the first 12-month fiscal period.</p>
