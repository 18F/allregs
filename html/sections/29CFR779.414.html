                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Section 7(i) was enacted to relieve an employer from the obligation  of paying overtime compensation to certain employees of a retail or  service establishment paid wholly or in greater part on the basis of  commissions. These employees are generally employed in so-called ``big  ticket'' departments and those establishments or parts of establishments  where commission methods of payment traditionally have been used,  typically those dealing in furniture, bedding and home furnishings,  floor covering, draperies, major appliances, musical instruments, radios  and television, men's clothing, women's ready to wear, shoes, corsets,  home insulation, and various home custom orders. There may be other  segments in retailing where the proportionate amount of commission  payments would be great enough for employees employed in such segments  to come within the exemption. Each such situation will be examined,  where exemption is claimed, to make certain the employees treated as  exempt from overtime compensation under section 7(i) are properly within  the statutory exclusion.</p>
