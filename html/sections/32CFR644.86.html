                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Prior to the enactment of Pub. L. 91-646, the Corps encompassed a very generous policy of priority leasing with respect to former owners and tenants, in order to ease the burden of people who had to relocate because of the Corps' projects. Recognizing the inadequacies of the well-intentioned attempts by acquiring agencies to make whole the former landowner or tenant, the Congress enacted Pub. L. 91-646 which was approved on January 2, 1971. It would appear that the Congress intended that such law provide for the fair and equitable treatment of persons who are displaced, without having to rely on interim measures, such as priority leasing, to ease the inevitable relocation. In House Report 91-1656, the Committee on Public Works of the House of Representatives noted the likelihood that adequate housing may not be available readily and indicated this as its reason for including the provision in the law that satisfactory replacement housing must be available before displacement. In view of this, it is incumbent on the District Engineer to be opportune in seeking out replacement housing and to be judicious in the early relocation of owners and tenants before market changes eliminate any available supply of replacement homes. It is also essential that the District Engineer be diligent in providing the required relocation assistance advisory services and benefits authorized by the law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Possession by Government. It will be the objective of the District Engineer to have the premises vacated and

to cause unneeded improvements to be removed at the earliest practicable date and conform to the Congressional intention expressed above. In addition to the above, reasons for this objective are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To provide for the expeditious payment of benefits to former owners and tenants;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To complete administration of the actual relocation of owners and tenants in a timely manner;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To avoid maintenance and security problems with respect to acquired improvements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> To prevent vandalism, trespassing and poaching with respect to acquired improvements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> To avoid any implication that former owners or tenants may be permitted to remain indefinitely on the federally acquired property;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> To cause land to be leased on the basis of the most practicable size and configuration rather than on the basis of the size of the units acquired;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> To permit the general public to bid for the lease of federally owned land rather than restricting the privilege of leasing to the former owner or tenant; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> To avoid a backlog of incomplete actions when construction or flooding is imminent or the land is otherwise required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Possession reserved to former owners and tenants. It is considered that the policy of granting priority leases to former owners and tenants has been overridden by the enactment of Pub. L. 91-646. Accordingly, this policy is being phased out, and where applicable, the acquisition agreement will set forth the dates agreed upon for the vacation of the premises by the owner and tenant without commitments, express or implied, as to the leasing of the premises after such dates. Procedure for providing for vendor's continued possession after the Government's acquisition is covered in paragraph (l) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Outstanding rights. (1) When the United States is acquiring title subject to outstanding rights, the offer will differentiate between:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the United States is acquiring title subject to outstanding rights, the offer will differentiate between:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Property which the vendor is excepting or rights which he is reserving and which are created for the first time; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Rights which third parties have acquired in the past, generally referred to as outstanding rights in third parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions or reservations of rights which the vendor may retain, without interfering with the construction or operation of the project, will be set forth in the offer and deed by a clause following the description, beginning with the words: ``Excepting * * *'' or ``Reserving * * *.'' Any other outstanding rights, subject to which the United States is acquiring title, held by third parties will be set forth in the offer and deed by a clause, following the description, beginning with words, ``Said premises are conveyed subject to * * *.'' Negotiations with the surface owner will include the owner's interest in the subsurface, unless acquisition of a lesser interest has been authorized by directive or specific approvals. These negotiations will not include interest severed and outstanding in third parties by purchase or lease, unless the surface owner agrees to remove the outstanding interest or agrees to obtain a subordination from the holder of the outstanding interest if that is consistent with the acquisition plan. If negotiations with the surface owner are successful, an Offer to Sell will be obtained, reciting the outstanding interest in the ``Subject to'' paragraph of the form, unless the surface owner has agreed to remove the outstanding interest (or obtain a subordination, if appropriate), in which case the Offer to Sell must recite specifically that the surface owner is assuming this obligation. In order to carry out the requirements of this paragraph, the title evidence must be examined prior to negotiations or, in any event, prior to acceptance of the Offer to Sell.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Right to repurchase prohibited. In no case will an offer be obtained in which the vendor reserves the right to repurchase the property. Such a reservation would be contrary to the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of June 30, 1949, 63 Stat. 377, 40 U.S.C. 471, et seq.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> General reservation guidelines. (1) Reservations of the right to remove

crops, timber, buildings, and improvements during a specified period will not be permitted without express approval of the Division or District Engineer on civil works projects, the Army or Air Force using service on military projects, or the Federal agency, if other than the Army or Air Force, for which the land is being acquired.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reservations of the right to remove

crops, timber, buildings, and improvements during a specified period will not be permitted without express approval of the Division or District Engineer on civil works projects, the Army or Air Force using service on military projects, or the Federal agency, if other than the Army or Air Force, for which the land is being acquired.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At the time of the approval of the acquisition by the Chief of Engineers, a determination will generally have been made as to whether subsurface rights and/or water rights will be acquired or left outstanding. Acquisition will be on the basis of such determination and as outlined below. Lands will be acquired subject to minerals, oil and gas rights or other similar interests severed and outstanding in third parties by purchase or lease and as approved by the Chief of Engineers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where it is not possible to acquire or subordinate an outstanding interest by negotiation and the interest will not interfere with the operation of the project, consideration may be given to obtaining a waiver from the Office of the Chief of Engineers on the basis of taking a calculated risk rather than resorting to condemnation (paragraph (k) of this section). Waivers will be considered on a tract-by-tract basis or on a project segment basis. Since such waivers involve several elements of the Office of the Chief of Engineers (Civil Works or Military Construction as well as Real Estate), the basis for the calculated risk must be fully explained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Concurrently with the negotiations to acquire from the surface owner, negotiations should be opened with the owner of the subsurface rights or other interests severed and outstanding in third parties by purchase or lease and required for the project, unless these interests are held in ``block ownership.'' Block ownership exists where a person, corporation, or other entity owns subsurface or other interests in connection with more than one surface tract and in sufficient amount for the entire interest holding to have added value, for operational or other reasons, because it is in a block ownership. In other words, block ownership exists when the acquisition of a part of the block would require the assessment of severance damage, even if the value of the interest or the amount of the severance damage would be in a nominal amount. On this basis, subsurface or other interests need not be contiguous to constitute a block ownership. Block ownership interests will not be acquired (or subordinated) piecemeal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Acquisition of the required interests, including subordination, held in block ownership should be started as soon as the extent of an operational unit is determined. As stated in paragraph (f)(4) of this section, all interests in a tract of land should be acquired at one time or as close in time as possible. Dual acquisitions of entire areas, one for surface rights and then for subsurface interests, should be avoided and acquisition of separate interests should be scheduled to coincide.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Reservation of buildings and improvements. The reservation by vendors of the right to remove buildings and improvements will be permitted under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where the Division or District Engineer, in civil works projects, the using service in Army and Air Force projects, or the Federal agency, if other than the Army or Air Force, for which the land is being acquired, has determined that they will not be needed for the purpose of the project;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The consideration to the Government for the reservation will be an amount negotiated at not less than the appraised salvage value of the building and improvements which are reserved, and such amount will be deducted from the negotiated price at the time of negotiation prior to execution of the offer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where a reservation is permitted, the following clause will be inserted in the offer, following the description of the land:</p><p class="depth3">Excepting and reserving to the Vendor the right to remove (enter description of buildings) on or before ___ 19 _, which the Vendor agrees not to relocate on other land to be acquired for the project; provided, however, that, in the event that the said buildings and improvements are not completely removed on or before said date, the right of removal shall terminate automatically, and the United States shall have a good and indefeasible title to said buildings and improvements which remain without notice to the Vendor; and provided further that, in the

event said buildings and improvements are relocated on other land to be acquired for the project, the United States shall have good and indefeasible title to said buildings and improvements without notice or further compensation to the Vendor.

The date on which the buildings or improvements must be removed must be fixed so that there is no interference with contruction or carrying out the mission of the project. The date for the removal should allow a reasonable time for removal of the improvements, usually not more than 90 days, except that for valid reasons the Division or District Engineer may grant an extension of time for removal. The right to remove such buildings cannot be prolonged indefinitely and certainly such right cannot survive the limited right of possession reserved to former owners and tenants as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Reservation of growing crops. (1) The reservation by the owners of the right to harvest and remove growing crops should be encouraged in order to conserve land acquisition funds and to avoid the costs incident to disposal of crops by the Government, whenever there is a probability that possession of the land will not be required prior to the harvest season.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The reservation by the owners of the right to harvest and remove growing crops should be encouraged in order to conserve land acquisition funds and to avoid the costs incident to disposal of crops by the Government, whenever there is a probability that possession of the land will not be required prior to the harvest season.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where a reservation is permitted, the following clause will be inserted in the offer, following the description of the land:</p><p class="depth3">Reserving to the vendor the right to harvest all of the growing crops located on the above described land on or before __________ 19__. In the event the crops are not harvested on or before said date, the right of removal shall terminate automatically, and the United States shall have a good and indefeasible title to said crops, without notice to the vendor.

The date on which the crops must be removed must be fixed so that there is no interference with construction or carrying out the mission of the project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The consideration to the Government for the reservation will be an amount not less than the appraised value of the crops as of the date of surrender of possession as disclosed by an approved appraisal report, and such amount will be deducted from the purchase price at the time of preparation and execution of the offer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where a tenant has an interest in growing crops, the value of his interest must be fixed by use of ENG Form 1564, Consent to Offer to Sell Real Property, which provides that the value of the tenant's interest, as agreed upon by the landowner and tenant, will be paid from the purchase price for the land. The use of this form not only protects the tenant but, in addition, provides a simple method for extinguishing rights which the United States is legally bound to recognize. Where a tenant wishes to reserve the right to remove crops, it must be done in the name of the landowner, and in like manner. To accomplish the foregoing, any other form is satisfactory, in lieu of ENG Form 1564, as long as closing requirements are satisfied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Reservation of timber. (1) The reservation of the right to remove timber by vendors will be permitted only with the express approval of the Division or District Engineer, with the concurrence of the using service in cases other than civil works projects of the Corps of Engineers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The reservation of the right to remove timber by vendors will be permitted only with the express approval of the Division or District Engineer, with the concurrence of the using service in cases other than civil works projects of the Corps of Engineers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reservation of the right to remove timber will be handled in substantially the same manner as that described for the reservation of buildings and improvements. If owned by a third party, ENG Form 1564 will be used in the same manner as for crops unless the timber interests are held in block ownerships. The consideration to the Government for the reservation will be an amount not less than the appraised value of the timber, giving full weight to any unusual difficulty in harvesting and transporting which are caused by the size, shape and location of the stand reserved, time limitations for removal, clearing requirements over the above those normally involved in prudent harvesting, and similar factors. If necessary, the stand reserved will be re-appraised on this basis. An amount not less than this appraised value will be deducted from the purchase price at the time of preparation and execution of the offer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where a reservation is permitted, the following clause will be inserted in the offer following the description of the land:</p><p class="depth3">Reserving to the vendor the right to cut and remove on or before ___ 19 _, all trees

in excess of ___ inches in diameter at breast height (DBH) located on the above-described land. In the event the timber is not removed on or before said date, the right of removal shall terminate automatically, and the United States shall have a good and indefeasible title to said timber, without notice to the vendor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Coal, oil, gas or other minerals. Acquisition of land or interests therein for project purposes will usually include the subsurface as well as the surface, except in areas where minerals have more than a nominal value. When the mineral, oil and gas rights have an identifiable value or are the subject of separate estates in the land, such mineral, oil and gas rights will not be acquired except where the development thereof would interfere with project purposes, but mineral rights not acquired will be subordinated to the Government's right to regulate their development in a manner that will not interfere with the primary purposes of the project, including public access, and not be inimicable to the environment. This is covered in more detail in subpart A. It is essential, however, in many acquisitions that the subsurface rights be acquired. In others, where these rights need not be extinguished, provision must be made in the offer the deed to subordinate such rights to project requirements, by excluding the owners of such rights from the area, or limiting exercise of such rights so that they will not interfere with the primary purposes of the project, including public access. The following guidelines are applicable in these cases:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where it has been determined that subsurface rights in the vendor, or outstanding in third parties, must be acquired, extinguished or subordinated, such arrangements will be made in the course of obtaining an offer for the surface or subsurface interests. Where the negotiations for acquisition, extinguishment or subordination of subsurface rights will be delayed, and it is considered advisable to proceed with surface acquisition to keep pace with project requirements, appropriate recommendations and justification will be submitted to HQDA (DAEN-REA) WASH DC 20314 for approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the owners of the surface and subsurface rights are agreeable, the separate interests can be acquired in a single transaction by use of ENG Form 1564, Consent to Offer to Sell Real Property. This method is the most desirable one, and, if used, the purchase price in the offer will cover both the surface and subsurface interests and the offer will not be taken ``subject to'' the subsurface rights.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Subordination of the subsurface interest based upon the value of the minerals in place and which will allow continued production by the mineral owner or lessee must be pursuant to such terms as will safeguard the Government's interest and preclude a windfall to the mineral owner or lessee. Value of the minerals in place will not exceed the recoverable portion of said minerals using agreed upon production methods. See subpart A for detailed treatment in the section pertaining primarily to Real Estate Design Memoranda.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When the third-party owner of subsurface rights refuses to enter into an agreement as contemplated in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, the title to the surface estate may be acquired separately, and the subsurface rights outstanding in third parties acquired as a separate transaction. The offer for the acquisition of the surface estate will provide for the conveyance of all interests of the surface owner in and to the subsurface estate, as well as all surface rights, and provide for taking ``subject to'' the subsurface rights outstanding in third parties. In such cases, the negotiations described in Sec. 644.83 will be conducted on the basis of the approved appraisal, less the appraised value of the outstanding subsurface rights.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Where it has been determined that the subsurface rights and interests therein need not be acquired, but the owners of such rights must be excluded from the area, and the owner of the surface is the owner of the subsurface estate, the offer will contain a clause providing that he relinquish, for the period that title to the tract is vested in the Government, all rights to enter upon the lands covered by the offer or that he will limit entry and exploration in a named manner so as not to interfere with the operation of the project. If third parties own subsurface rights or interests, a similar waiver of

the exercise of such rights must be procured from all third parties having any interest in the subsurface estate, whether as lessees or assignees. The waiver by third parties must be obtained at the time the offer is procured for the surface estate, unless these subsurface interests are held in block ownership.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Title exceptions--Administrative waivers. (1) A distinction should be made between those title defects, objections, liens or encumbrances which, if not eliminated, might possibly defeat or adversely affect the Government's title, and those interests in the property owned by parties other than the grantor. All encumbrances, defects, and outstanding interests which cannot be waived under paragraphs (k) (2), (3), and (4) of this section must be eliminated or a waiver of the defect secured from the Attorney General.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A distinction should be made between those title defects, objections, liens or encumbrances which, if not eliminated, might possibly defeat or adversely affect the Government's title, and those interests in the property owned by parties other than the grantor. All encumbrances, defects, and outstanding interests which cannot be waived under paragraphs (k) (2), (3), and (4) of this section must be eliminated or a waiver of the defect secured from the Attorney General.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Title may be taken subject to an outstanding third party interest which has been administratively waived. Requests for administrative waivers shall be submitted to HQDA (DAEN-REA) WASH DC 20314 for consideration, together with recommendations from Division and District Engineers. The recommendation for waiver should be coordinated with the using agency, if other than Department of the Army land (military or civil works), and should be accompanied by a certificate signed by the Chief, Real Estate Division or the Chief Appraiser, certifying that the outstanding interest has no contributory value to the estate being acquired and will not interfere with the purpose for which the property is being acquired.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> It has previously been administratively determined that all lands for Department of the Army (military or civil works) or Air Force projects may be acquired ``subject to existing easements for public roads, public highways, public utilities, railroads and pipelines,'' and ``to the reservations, exceptions and any other outstanding rights contained in or referred to in patents issued by the United States,'' and also ``to water rights, claims or title to water, if any, or other similar title exceptions.'' A decision as to whether any of these exceptions should be eliminated is the responsibility of the Division or District Engineer, after coordination with the using service if other than the Department of the Army. If such interests are to be left outstanding, they should be included in the ``subject to'' clause of the Offer to Sell.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Offers to Sell may be accepted subject to subsurface mineral interests owned by third parties in accordance with Sec. 644.86(d). In such case, the ``subject to'' clause of the Offer to Sell should recite the specific interest which is being left outstanding. Where it is not possible to acquire or subordinate an outstanding subsurface interest by negotiations and the outstanding interest will not interfere with construction, operation or maintenance of the project, consideration may be given to obtaining a waiver from HQDA (DAEN-REA) WASH DC 20314 on the basis of taking a calculated risk rather than resorting to condemnation. Such waivers may be considered on a tract-by-tract, segment-by-segment, or project basis. Where a number of small mineral interests in a project are to be recommended for waiver, it is preferable that the recommendation be submitted on an entire project or group of segments at one time. Such a recommendation should specifically identify the subsurface mineral interests which are to be left outstanding, together with the estimated value of each interest, and should be accompanied by a map(s) on which the areas affected by the outstanding interests have been outlined. The basis for the calculated risk should be explained fully.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Possession reserved to vendor. (1) The objective in acquisition is to obtain possession for project purposes at the earliest practicable time. It is recognized, however, that there are occasions when possession by the Government may be delayed and provision must be made for continued possession by the former owner in order to meet the requirements of the Government's acquisition policy and to further soften the impact of the Government's acquisition. The retention of possession will enable the owner-occupant of farm land, or residential property, to receive

his purchase money and remove improvements reserved by him, and permit occupants who may be former owners or tenants the privilege of harvesting growing crops and sufficient time to relocate to other locations. Accordingly, the Division or District Engineer may make provision for the former owner, occupant, and/or his tenant(s) to remain in possession of the land under the terms and conditions as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The objective in acquisition is to obtain possession for project purposes at the earliest practicable time. It is recognized, however, that there are occasions when possession by the Government may be delayed and provision must be made for continued possession by the former owner in order to meet the requirements of the Government's acquisition policy and to further soften the impact of the Government's acquisition. The retention of possession will enable the owner-occupant of farm land, or residential property, to receive

his purchase money and remove improvements reserved by him, and permit occupants who may be former owners or tenants the privilege of harvesting growing crops and sufficient time to relocate to other locations. Accordingly, the Division or District Engineer may make provision for the former owner, occupant, and/or his tenant(s) to remain in possession of the land under the terms and conditions as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the tract is to be acquired by direct purchase, the provision for retention will be written into the offer (ENG Form 42, ENG Form 2970, or ENG Form 1564) and will read substantially as follows:</p><p class="depth4">Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph __ of this offer, (and/or consent to option) the occupant (vendor and/or his tenant) now in possession of the property, in consideration of the protection and maintenance of the land, buildings, and structures, and protection of the property against loss by fire, waste, or other causes, to which the occupant hereby agrees, reserves the right to occupy the property until _____. Such occupancy is subject to revocation by the (Division) (District) Engineer at any time by giving __ days notice in writing to the occupant if possession of the property is required by the United States; and provided further that the vendor-occupant or his tenant will remove no improvements or timber unless otherwise provided herein.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When the tract is to be acquired by condemnation, the circumstances of the right to remain in possession, which has been established as hereinafter set forth, will be fully described in the correspondence forwarding the condemnation assembly to HQDA (DAEN-REA-C) WASH DC 20314. The retention of possession without payment of rent is directed to the benefit of the occupant of the property with some property maintenance consideration to the Government. This procedure will not be used to permit non-occupant owners a means of retaining possession without payment of rent and at the same time collect cash rents or unreserved crop rents from tenants.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> When the land being acquired is utilized by the owner and/or tenant for agricultural or related purposes, a period of possession may be allowed, if consistent with project requirements, to permit the crop owner to harvest growing crops, and to avoid abrupt dislocations. The period of possession reserved in the offer, or for which request for the order of the court is deferred in declaration of taking cases, should generally be co-extensive with the crop season or the date that, by custom in the community, leases of such properties ordinarily expire: Provided, however, That such period does not exceed 12 months from the date title vests in the Government. Reservation of possession or delay in entry of order of possession that will interfere with the Government's requirements for use of the land will not be allowed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of owner-occupied residential property other than farm residences, possession may be permitted for a sufficient time to allow orderly relocation, but no longer than 12 months after title vests in the Government.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> In connection with the acquisition of commercial, industrial, tenant-occupied residential property other than residences occupied by farm tenants, and special use properties, ordinarily the procedures of reserving possession to the vendor by a clause in the offer, or deferring the right to possession under a declaration of taking proceeding, should not be utilized. In such cases, after title vests in the United States, the continued possession of the property by vendor or tenant should be formalized by an outlease from the Government. However, if in the opinion of the Division and District Engineer a reservation for possession in the offer or deferral of order of possession is desirable in certain instances from a public relations standpoint or for other compelling reasons, such cases will be forwarded to HQDA (DAEN-REA) WASH DC 20314 for consideration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The reservation of use and occupancy in the vendor and/or tenant under the terms of the offer or deferment of possession must be based on adequate consideration to the Government. It is anticipated, however, that items such as the vendor's maintenance of the land, buildings, and structures, his protection of the property against loss by fire, waste, or other causes, and the fact that his possession can be revoked within a short period of time, will, in most instances,

offset any rental for the period of the reserved occupancy or deferred possession which might otherwise be due. However, if possession is reserved by the vendor in the acquisition of commercial, industrial, and special use properties, or other type of property having a potentially high income factor, the fair rental value for the period of reserved use or deferred possession must be deducted from the agreed purchase price.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Special provisions for protection of the Government, such as those appearing in ENG Form 1366, Department of the Army Lease--River and Harbor or Flood Control Property, will be added to the reservation clause in the offer in cases where, in the opinion of the Division or District Engineer, they are necessary or desirable. If the case is not to be closed by direct purchase, the letter to the vendor notifying him of the Government's intention to file a declaration of taking will set forth the fact that possession is to be deferred and for what period, and will contain a statement as to the Government's expectation that the vendor will properly maintain and protect the premises, and perform such other acts (or refrain from such acts) as deemed advisable by the Division or District Engineer. Both the letter of notice and the reservation clause in the offer will provide that the right to possession may be revoked on 30 days notice to the vendor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is recognized that farmers may experience difficulty in finding substitute farms needed for their livelihood within one year, and other owners and tenants may encounter difficulty in relocating within one year. Therefore, the District Engineer, as an exception to the procedure in paragraph (l)(1) of this section may lease properties to former owners or tenants at the fair market rental value for up to one additional year where the circumstances justify such action, and, in such event, the record will contain the reasons justifying the action. Any occupancy by the former owner or tenant beyond 12 months from the date the property was acquired by the Government will be covered by a lease and will provide payment of the fair market rental value of the property leased.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The District Engineer, through channels, may request the Chief of Engineers to grant exceptions to this policy where unusual circumstances warrant such consideration. In keeping with the intent of this action, it is hoped that such cases will be minimal in number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The following will apply with respect to advance land acquisition projects. Former owners and tenants whose properties were acquired prior to August 1, 1972 will be allowed to remain on the property by lease on a year-to-year basis until the establishment of a land management use plan and thereafter, if the property is available for leasing, for a single five-year term. Former owners and tenants whose properties are acquired after August 1, 1972 will be allowed to remain on the property by lease on a year-to-year basis until construction commences: Provided, The property is available for leasing. After construction commences, if the property is not immediately required for project purposes, such former owners or tenants will be allowed to remain on the property by lease for an additional two years. Continued possession of properties acquired after the date construction commences will be governed by the procedure outlined in paragraph (l)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Schools, cemeteries, and facilities of State and local governments. ER 1180-1-1, Section 73, provides for the discretionary relocation by the Chief of Engineers of schools and other local governmental facilities, and acquisition of the sites under section 111 of Pub. L. 85-500. Section 73 will be followed in the acquisition and relocation of cemeteries. Where the school was formerly a part of an abutting tract, offers for the abutting tracts will contain a clause whereby the vendor or vendors agree to quitclaim all right, title, and interest whether vested or reversionary, in and to the school site in executing the deed to the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Reservations prior to completion of offer. Where immediate possession of areas is necessary and is obtained by right-of-entry or the filing of condemnation proceedings, owners often

wish to move, taking with them buildings and improvements, or wish to harvest timber or crops, prior to any offer by the Government for the sale of their land. This action is authorized only under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Appraisals of all the land, buildings, improvements, timber, and crops of the particular tract are completed and approved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A determination is made by the Division or District Engineer that the buildings, improvements, and timber will not be needed, and the harvesting of timber or crops will not interfere with construction or operation of the project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ENG Form 1565, Agreement for Removal of Property, will be obtained from all persons having an interest in the property to be removed. This agreement will recite the amount which the owner is willing to have deducted from the value of the tract as a whole for the right of removal, which may not be less than the appraised salvage value of the buildings, improvements and timber, and the appraised value of the crops, as set out in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> ENG Form 1565 will be obtained and accepted by the Division or District Engineer, or the Chief of the Real Estate Division.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If an offer is obtained later, an appropriate reservation must be inserted in the Offer to Sell to reflect the prior agreement relative to reservations and removals of property and the agreed value of same.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If it is necessary later to file a declaration of taking on the particular tract, a copy of the agreement (ENG Form 1565) will be forwarded with the correspondence transmitting the declaration of taking assembly for use of the Department of Justice in the court action. The agreement by its own terms will serve as a stipulation as to the amount to be deducted from the ultimate award for the right of removing buildings, improvements, timber or crops.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Loss or damages to improvements, timber, or crops--(1) Insurance protection against risks. The Government does not carry property insurance of any nature. Vendors, however, may be advised as to their liability for certain losses, and that insurance protection against such risks is optional. When buildings, improvements, timber, or crops on land being acquired by the United States are protected by insurance in effect when acquisition activities are initiated, the time and method of cancellation and negotiation for refund on premiums paid will be the responsibilities of the vendor. In order to avoid double payments to vendors, any amounts actually collected by vendors under the terms of the insurance policies for damage or loss occurring after acceptance of the offer by the Government will be deducted from the purchase price, regardless of when title is vested in the United States or the right to possession is exercised.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Insurance protection against risks.

Buildings, improvements, timber, or crops on land acquired by the United States by purchase or condemnation remain the property of the vendor until title has been vested in the United States by delivery of a deed of conveyance or filing of a declaration of taking, and loss or damage thereto caused by fire, acts of God, theft or vandalism, before such vesting of title, will be borne by the vendor, except as provided below.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Prior to vesting title in Government. Buildings, improvements, timber, or crops on land acquired by the United States by purchase or condemnation remain the property of the vendor until title has been vested in the United States by delivery of a deed of conveyance or filing of a declaration of taking, and loss or damage thereto caused by fire, acts of God, theft or vandalism, before such vesting of title, will be borne by the vendor, except as provided below.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Possession by Government. When the right to possession has been exercised by the United States under an accepted Offer to Sell, condemnation proceeding, or possession has otherwise been surrendered to and accepted by the United States, losses arising from damage to buildings, improvements, timber, or crops by fire, acts of God, theft, or vandalism will be borne by the United States. If, however, prior to vesting of title, the right to possession has been exercised, or surrender has been made and accepted only to part of the property, and the vendor continues to use buildings and/or to cultivate or harvest crops or timber, such loss will be borne by the vendor as to buildings, timber or crops retained.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Title in Government. After title has vested, losses to buildings, timber or crops not caused by the willful act or gross negligence of vendor will be borne by the United States; provided, however, that if the vendor continues in possession of buildings, timber or crops, after title has vested, and the

deed, stipulation or order of court has reserved to the vendor the right to remove such buildings, timber or crops, loss or damage thereto, both before and after removal, caused by fire, act of God, theft, or vandalism will be borne by the vendor, only to the extent of the amount deducted from the purchase price, as provided in the deed, stipulation or order of court, for the right to remove.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Other reservations. The following rights may be reserved to the owner wherever such reservation will be to the financial advantage of the Government and it has been determined by the Division or District Engineer that the reservation of the rights will not interfere with the operation of the project. These rights may be reserved in the Offer to Sell and in the condemnation estate but only whenever mutual agreement between the owner and the Government concerning all phases of the acquisition except just compensation has been reached, or by stipulation for settlement of condemnation cases, subject to approval of revestment, if any, by DAEN-REA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Rights-of-way for stock to water. Reservations of rights-of-way will be permitted for watering stock, in the case of bona fide livestock operations, such as dairymen and ranchers. Such rights-of-way will be limited to a reasonable width and will not be permitted in public access and use areas. The reservations will be so worded as not to require the owners to fence the rights-of-way, but to provide that if they elect to do so, they must provide gates at satisfactory intervals to permit crossing of the rights-of-way.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rights-of-way for water pipeline for domestic use. Reservations of rights-of-way for water pipelines for domestic use (household, stock watering, garden, farm yard, but excluding irrigation) may be permitted by providing for the reservation of a temporary or permanent easement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Rights-of-way for water pipline for irrigation use. (i) In areas where irrigation is commonly practiced, or is of paramount importance, owners of remainder or contiguous lands will be permitted to reserve a sufficient real estate interest to place water pipelines across Government-owned lands, in order to obtain financing for irrigation development and/or in order to be assured of being able to carry on irrigation operations. In ``water rights'' States (prior appropriation of water rights), the reservation of such interests will be permitted only to those owners who have established water rights from the State, or who may in the future obtain such rights. When irrigation is a project purpose, such reservation must be coordinated with the Bureau of Reclamation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In areas where irrigation is commonly practiced, or is of paramount importance, owners of remainder or contiguous lands will be permitted to reserve a sufficient real estate interest to place water pipelines across Government-owned lands, in order to obtain financing for irrigation development and/or in order to be assured of being able to carry on irrigation operations.

When irrigation is a project purpose, such reservation must be coordinated with the Bureau of Reclamation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Under these circumstances, a landowner may be permitted to reserve an easement and right-of-way for a water pipeline and pumping unit across the land he conveys, by appropriate provisions in the offer to sell and in the deed to the United States. In ``water rights'' States, this reservation will be ``for the exercise of established water rights, although no right to use water is created hereby.'' (This phraseology is to be incorporated in the reservation.) The reservation will also include any pertinent provisions considered essential by the Division or District Engineer, such as requirement to install the pipeline underground and at a specified depth.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Reservations of this nature will also be permitted in those cases where acquisition is by condemnation. In these acquisitions, the reservation may be recited in the complaint and declaration of taking, whenever full agreement except as to just compensation has been reached, or it may permitted later by stipulation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> When the project is located in an area in which the Bureau of Reclamation is developing, or planning to develop, irrigation districts or systems, prior coordination with the Bureau will provide that copies of all deeds and final condemnation judgments which recite reservations under this paragraph will be furnished to the local office of the Bureau. Thereafter, the Bureau of Reclamation will be responsible for supervising the exercise of the easements to insure compliance with Reclamation laws.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Plans to provide for irrigation will be fully covered in the Real Estate Design Memorandum.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Acquisitions in which these rights are to be reserved must, of course, be

based on an appraisal of the fair market value of the estate to be acquired. Since the appraisal would probably be made originally on the basis that there would be no reservation, revision must be prepared whenever the reservation appears to be appropriate, to reflect the reduction in severance damages or other financial advantage accruing to the Government. Consideration of counteroffers which include proposals for these reservations by the landowner will be based on and compared with the appraised fair market value of the estate proposed to be acquired. Deposits with a declaration of taking will be based on the appraised fair market value of the estate to be acquired by the condemnation action.</p>
