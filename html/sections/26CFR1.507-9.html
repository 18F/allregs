                                Sec. 1.507-9  Abatement of taxes.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. The Commissioner may at his discretion abate the  unpaid portion of the assessment of any tax imposed by section 507(c),  or any liability in respect thereof, if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(A)</em> (other than in  clauses (vii) or (viii)) each of which has been in existence and so  described for a continuous period of at least 60 calendar months, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, (3), and (7) shall apply to  distributions under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. Since section  507(g) provides only for the abatement of tax imposed under section  507(c), no tax imposed under any provision of chapter 42 shall be abated  under section 507(g). Where the taxpayer files a petition with the Tax  Court with respect to a notice of deficiency regarding any tax under  section 507(c), such tax shall be treated as having been assessed for  the purposes of abatement of such tax under section 507(g) and the  regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> State proceedings. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Commissioner may at his discretion  abate the unpaid portion of the assessment of any tax imposed by section  507(c), or any liability in respect thereof, under the procedures  outlined in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph. Such tax may  not be abated by the Commissioner unless he determines that corrective  action as defined in paragraph (c) of this section has been taken. The  Commissioner may not abate by reason of section 507(g) any amount of  such tax which has already been collected since only the unpaid portion  thereof can be abated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>. Where such  agreements are obtained, action with respect to the assessment and  collection of such tax may be suspended to the extent not inconsistent  with this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon receipt of certification from the appropriate State officer  that action has been ordered or approved by a court of competent  jurisdiction, the Commissioner may abate the unpaid portion of the  assessment of tax imposed by section 507(c), or any liability in respect  thereof, if in his judgment such action is corrective action within the  meaning of paragraph (c) of this section. In the event that such action  is not corrective action, the Commissioner may in his discretion again  suspend action on the assessment and collection of such tax until  corrective action is obtained, or if in his judgment corrective action  cannot be obtained, he may resume the assessment and collection of such  tax.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(3)</em>. Except  where assets of the terminated private foundation are transferred to an  organization described in section 509(a) (1) through (4) the State is  required to take such action to assure that the provisions of section  508(e)(1) (A) and (B) are applicable to the terminated foundation (or  any transferee) with respect to such assets as if such organization were  a private foundation. Thus, the governing instrument of such  organization must include provisions with respect to such assets:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requiring its income therefrom for each taxable year to be  distributed at such time and in such manner as not to subject such  organization to tax under section 4942 (as if the organization were a  private foundation),</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prohibiting such organization from engaging in any act of self- dealing (as defined in section 4941(d) as if the organization were a  private foundation),</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Prohibiting such organization from retaining any excess business  holdings (as defined in section 4943(c) as if the organization were a  private foundation),</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Prohibiting such organization from making any investments in  such manner as to subject such organization to tax under section 4944  (as if the organization were a private foundation), and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> of this  paragraph apply to be subject to such rules whether or not there are  such provisions in such terminated private foundation's governing  instrument.
