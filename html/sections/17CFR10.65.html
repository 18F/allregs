                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Reporting and transcription. Hearings for the purpose of taking  evidence shall be recorded and transcribed in written form under the  supervision of the Administrative Law Judge by a reporter employed by  the Commission for that purpose. The original transcript shall be a part  of the record and shall be the sole official transcript. Copies of  transcripts, except those portions granted non-public treatment, shall  be available from the reporter at rates not to exceed the maximum rates  fixed by the contract between the Commission and the reporter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Corrections. Any party may submit a timely request to the  Administrative Law Judge to correct the transcript. Corrections may be  submitted to the Administrative Law Judge by stipulation of the parties,  or by motion by any party, and upon notice to all parties to the  proceeding, the Administrative Law Judge may specify corrections of the  transcript. A copy of such specification shall be furnished to all  parties and made a part of the record. Corrections shall be made by the  official reporter, who shall furnish substitute pages of the transcript,  under the usual certificate of the reporter, for insertion in the  official record. The original uncorrected pages shall be retained in the  files of the Proceedings Clerk.  [41 FR 2511, Jan. 16, 1976, as amended at 60 FR 54802, Oct. 26, 1995]</p>
