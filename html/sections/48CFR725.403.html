                            <p class="depth0">(48 CFR) FAR 25.4 establishes procedures for purchases under the  Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (including GATT's Agreement on Government  Procurement) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Under  both such agreements, USAID's contracts for the purpose of providing  foreign assistance are not subject to the procedures set forth in (48  CFR) FAR 25.4. In contrast, USAID's operating expense-type  administrative purchases (i.e., purchases for the direct benefit and use  of USAID) are subject to the procedures in (48 CFR) FAR 25.4, unless  otherwise exempted by one of the exemptions specified in (48 CFR) FAR  25.4.
