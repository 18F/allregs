                            <p class="depth0">If you produce Tier 3 or later Category 3 engines that are certified under this part, you must test them as described in this subpart, except as specified in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must test each engine at the sea trial of the vessel in which it is installed or within the first 300 hours of operation, whichever occurs first. Since you must test each engine, the provisions of Sec. Sec.  1042.310 and 1042.315(b) do not apply for Category 3 engines. If we determine that an engine failure under this subpart is caused by defective components or design deficiencies, we may revoke or suspend your certificate for the engine family as described in Sec.  1042.340. If we determine that an engine failure under this subpart is caused only by incorrect assembly, we may suspend your certificate for the engine family as described in Sec.  1042.325. If the engine fails, you may continue operating only to complete the sea trial and return to port. It is a violation of 40 CFR 1068.101(b)(1) to operate the vessel further until you remedy the cause of failure. Each two-hour period of such operation constitutes a separate offense. A violation lasting less than two hours constitutes a single offense.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You are only required to measure NOX emissions. You do not need to measure HC, CO or PM emissions under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you are unable to operate the engine at the test points for the specified duty cycle, you may approximate

these points consistent with the specifications of section 6 of Appendix 8 to the NOX Technical Code (incorporated by reference in Sec.  1042.910) and show compliance with the alternate installed-engine standard of Sec.  1042.104(g). You must obtain EPA approval of your test procedure prior to testing the engine. Include in your request a description of your basis for concluding that the engine cannot be tested at the actual test points of the specified duty cycle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You may measure NOX emissions at additional test points for the purposes of the continuous NOX monitoring requirements of Sec.  1042.110(d). If you do, you must report these values along with your other test results. Describe in your application for certification how you plan to use these values for continuous NOX monitoring.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You may ask to measure emissions according to the Direct Measurement and Monitoring method specified in section 6.4 of the NOX Technical Code (incorporated by reference in Sec.  1042.910).
