If an alien spouse is present in a lawful status other than the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, such status will be a factor evaluated in determining whether the family's situation is sufficiently stable to support a finding that the applicant is suitable as the adoptive parents of a Convention adoptee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligibility to file a Form I-800. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the following persons may file a Form I-800:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An unmarried United States citizen who is at least 25 years old and who is habitually resident in the United States, as determined under 8 CFR 204.303(a); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A married United States citizen, who is habitually resident in the United States as determined under 8 CFR 204.303(a), and whose spouse will also adopt the child the citizen seeks to adopt.
