For example, if a person receives social security benefits under the Supplemental Security Income provisions of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1301 et seq., those benefits are not covered transactions and, therefore, are not affected if the person is excluded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Federal employment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A transaction that the OPM needs to respond to a national or agency-recognized emergency or disaster.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A permit, license, certificate, or similar instrument issued as a means to regulate public health, safety, or the environment, unless the OPM specifically designates it to be a covered transaction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> An incidental benefit that results from ordinary governmental operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Any other transaction if the application of an exclusion to the transaction is prohibited by law.</p>
