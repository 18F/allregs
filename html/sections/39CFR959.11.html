                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Amendments proposed prior to the hearing shall be filed with the  Recorder. Amendments proposed thereafter shall be filed with the  presiding officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> By consent of the parties, a pleading may be amended at any  time. Also, a party may move to amend a pleading at any time prior to  the close of the hearing and, provided that the amendment is reasonably  within the scope of the proceeding initiated by the petition, the  presiding officer shall make such ruling on the motion as he or she  deems fair and equitable to the parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When issues not raised by the pleadings, but reasonably within  the scope of the proceedings initiated by the petition, are tried by  express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all  respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings. Such   amendments as may be necessary to make the pleadings conform to the  evidence, and to raise such issues, shall be allowed at any time upon  the motion of any party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a party objects to the introduction of evidence at the  hearing on the ground that it is not within the issues made by the  pleadings, but fails to satisfy the presiding officer that an amendment  of the pleadings would prejudice the objecting party on the merits, the  presiding officer may allow the amendment and may grant a continuance to  enable the objecting party to rebut the evidence presented.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The presiding officer may, upon reasonable notice and upon such  terms as are just, permit service of supplemental pleadings setting  forth transactions, occurrences, or events which have happened since the  date of the pleading sought to be supplemented and which are relevant to  any of the issues involved.
