The following actions have been determined not to have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment, either individually or cumulatively. They will not be subject to environmental assessments or impact statements. It must be emphasized that even though these actions are excluded from further environmental reviews under NEPA, they are not excluded from either the policy considerations contained in Secs. 1940.303 through 1940.305 of this subpart or from compliance with other applicable local, State, or Federal environmental laws. Also, the actions preceded by an asterisk (*) are not excluded from further review depending upon whether in some cases they would be located within, or in other cases, potentially affect:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A floodplain,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A wetland,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Important farmlands, or prime forestlands or rangelands,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A listed species or critical habitat for an endangered species,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A property that is listed on or may be eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> An area within an approved State coastal zone management program,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> A coastal barrier or a portion of a barrier within the Coastal Barrier Resources System,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> A river or portion of a river included in, or designated for, potential addition to the Wild and Scenic Rivers System,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> A sole source aquifer recharge area, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> A State water quality standard (including designated and/or existing beneficial uses and antidegradation requirements).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Whether location within one of the preceding resource areas is sufficient to require a further review or a potential impact to one of them must also be identified to require a review is determined by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's completion of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1940-22 in accordance with the FMI and Sec. 1940.317 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When the categorical exclusion classification is lost, as specified in Sec. 1940.317 of this subpart, the action must be reviewed under the requirements of paragraph (g) of that section.

If any of these waste production, handling, treatment, disposal or compliance criteria cannot be met, a Class I assessment must be initiated to include a narrative discussion of the types and quantities of wastes produced and the adequacy of the treatment, storage, and disposal practices, if the involved wastes meet the criteria for a Class I assessment contained in Sec. 1940.311(b)(3)(iii) of this subpart.
