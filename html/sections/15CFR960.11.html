                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each license issued for the operation of a system shall require the licensee to comply with the Act and the regulations in this part. The licensee shall ensure that its license information is kept current and accurate. A licensee's failure to notify NOAA in a timely manner of any changes to that information on which the determination to issue the license or a subsequent licensing action was or will be made may result in penalties for noncompliance being levied, pursuant to Section 203(a)(3) of the Act</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following conditions, as a minimum, shall be included in all licenses:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The licensee shall operate its system in a manner that preserves the national security and observes the foreign policy and international obligations of the United States. Specific limitations on operational performance, including, but not limited to, limitations on data collection and dissemination, as appropriate, will be specified in each license.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The licensee shall maintain operational control from a location within the United States at all times, including the ability to override all commands issued by any operations centers or stations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The licensee will maintain and make available to the Assistant Administrator records of system tasking, operations and other data as specified in the license for the purposes of monitoring and compliance. Periodic reporting and record keeping requirements will be specified in the license. The licensee shall allow the Assistant Administrator access, at all reasonable times, to all facilities which comprise the remote sensing space system for the purpose of conducting license monitoring and compliance inspections.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The licensee may be required by the Secretary to limit data collection

and/or distribution by the system as determined to be necessary to meet significant national security or significant foreign policy concerns, or international obligations of the United States, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Interagency MOU Fact Sheet found in Appendix 2 of this part. During such limitations, the licensee shall, on request, provide unenhanced restricted images on a commercial basis exclusively to the U.S. Government using U.S. government-approved rekeyable encryption on the down-link and shall use a data down-link format that allows the U.S. Government access to these data during such periods.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A licensee shall notify the Assistant Administrator of its intent to enter into any significant or substantial foreign agreement, and shall submit this agreement for review in accordance with Sec. 960.8. The proposed agreement may not be implemented by the licensee until the licensee has been advised by the Assistant Administrator that the document's provisions are acceptable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Notification of any agreement that provides for an on-going or a continuous relationship serves as notification of specific transactions carried out within the scope of that agreement for purposes of the regulations in this part and the Act. Such notification does not relieve a licensee of any obligation under any other laws including U.S. export laws or regulations to secure necessary U.S. Government authorizations and/or licenses, to provide notification, or to comply with other requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A licensee seeking to enter a foreign agreement that would require the modification of the terms of an existing license shall submit a license amendment, as provided in Sec. 960.7.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In accordance with Section 201(e) of the Act and Sec. 960.12, a licensee shall make available on reasonable commercial terms and conditions, in accordance with the Act and Sec. 960.12, any unenhanced data designated by the Assistant Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A licensee shall provide to the U.S. Government, upon request, a complete list of all archived, unenhanced data which has been generated by its licensed system which is not already maintained in a public catalog. Any information on this list which is deemed proprietary by the licensee should be so noted by the licensee when the list is provided to the U.S. Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A licensee shall make available unenhanced data requested by the Department of the Interior on reasonable cost terms and conditions as agreed by the licensee and the Department of the Interior. After the expiration of any exclusive right to sell, or after an agreed amount of time, the Department of Interior shall make these data available to the public at the cost of fulfilling user requests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Before purging any licensed data in its possession, the licensee shall offer such data to the National Satellite Land Remote Sensing Data Archive at the cost of reproduction and transmission. The Department of the Interior shall make these data available immediately to the public at the cost of fulfilling user requests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> A licensee shall make available to the government of any country (including the United States) upon request by that government, unenhanced data collected by its system concerning the territory under the jurisdiction of such government. The data shall be provided as soon as the licensee is able to distribute the data commercially or as soon as the licensee has processed them into a format that the licensee uses for its own purposes, whichever occurs sooner, on reasonable terms and conditions. However, no data shall be provided to the sensed state if such release is contrary to U.S. national security concerns, foreign policy or international obligations or is otherwise prohibited by law, e.g., where transactions with the sensed state are prohibited by the laws of the United States. The U.S. Government may require, as a specific license condition, coordination with NOAA prior to fulfilling specific sensed state requests for unenhanced data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> A licensee shall inform the Assistant Administrator immediately of any operational deviation or proposed deviation of the system which would violate the conditions of the license. If advance notice is not possible because of an emergency posing an imminent and substantial threat to human life,

property, the environment or the system itself, the licensee shall notify the Assistant Administrator of the deviation as soon as circumstances permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> A licensee shall dispose of any satellites operated by the licensee upon termination of operations under the license in a manner satisfactory to the President. The licensee shall obtain approval from the Assistant Administrator of all plans and procedures for the disposition of satellites as part of the application process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> The licensee shall submit a Data Protection Plan to the Assistant Administrator for review and approval. The licensee's Data Protection Plan shall contain the process to protect data and information throughout the entire cycle of tasking, operations, processing, archiving and dissemination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the operating license restricts the distribution of certain data and imagery to the U.S. Government or U.S. Government-approved customers, including data whose public distribution is limited for 24 hours after collection, the Data Protection Plan should also provide for secure delivery of restricted data and imagery to U.S. Government-approved customer facilities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Communications links that may require protection include, but are not limited to: Telemetry, tracking and commanding; narrowband and wideband data, including satellite platform and sensor data, imagery, and metadata; and terrestrial delivery methods including electronic and physical package delivery.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The licensee's Data Protection Plan must be approved by NOAA before the licensee's remote sensing space system may be launched. NOAA encourages the licensee's early submission and review of the Data Protection Plan to avoid any negative impacts on its system's development and launch schedule.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The Assistant Administrator may require the licensee to revise its Data Protection Plan if the system is altered from what was originally licensed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> A license is not an asset of the licensee and shall not be mortgaged, sold or pledged as collateral.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Assistant Administrator may waive any of the conditions in Sec. 960.11(b) upon a showing of good cause and following consultations with the appropriate agencies.</p>
