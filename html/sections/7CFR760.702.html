Subsequent crops, replacement crops, reseeded crops, and replanted crops are not eligible crops under this part and no revision of the Report of Acreage that would increase an eligibility for payment will be permitted to produce that effect.</p><p class="depth0">Crop year means for 2009:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> For insurable crops, the crop year as defined according to the applicable crop insurance policy;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> For NAP covered crops, the crop year as provided in part 1437 of this title.</p><p class="depth0">Disaster means excessive moisture or related condition, resulting from any of the following: flood, flash flooding, excessive rain, moisture, humidity, severe storms, thunderstorms, ground saturation or standing water, hail, winter storms, ice storms, snow, blizzard, hurricane, typhoons, tropical storms, and cold wet weather.

Expected production may be used to assist producers in determining whether the producer has a crop or crops that suffered a qualifying loss of five percent and to determine whether that crop is eligible for CAP benefits.</p><p class="depth0">Historic yield means, for a producer on a farm, the higher of the county average yield or the producer's approved yields for eligible crops on the farm.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> An insured producer's yield will be the higher of the county average yield listed or the approved federal crop insurance APH, for the disaster year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> A NAP producer's yield will be the higher of the county average yield or

NAP approved yield for the disaster year.</p><p class="depth2">Replacement crop means the planting or approved prevented planting of any crop for harvest following the failed planting or prevented planting of a crop of long grain rice, medium or short grain rice, upland cotton, soybeans, or sweet potatoes not in a recognized double-cropping sequence.
