                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each boiler, including superheater, reheater, economizer,  auxiliary boiler, low-pressure heating boiler, and unfired steam boiler,  must be available for examination by the marine inspector at intervals  specified by Table 61.05-10, and more often if necessary, to determine  that the complete unit is in a safe and satisfactory condition. When a  hydrostatic test is required, the marine inspector may examine all  accessible parts of the boiler while it is under pressure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The owner, master, or person in charge of the vessel shall give  ample notice to the cognizant Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, so  that a marine inspector may witness the tests and make the required  inspections.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Firetube boilers which cannot be entered or which cannot be  satisfactorily examined internally, all boilers of lap seam construction  and all boilers to which extensive repairs have been made or the  strength of which the marine inspector has any reason to question, shall  be subjected to a hydrostatic test of 1\1/2\ times the maximum allowable  working pressure. All other boilers shall be subjected to a hydrostatic  test of 1\1/4\ times the maximum allowable working pressure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In applying hydrostatic pressure to boilers, arrangements shall  be made to prevent main and auxiliary stop valves from being  simultaneously subjected to the hydrostatic pressure on one side and  steam pressure on the other side.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the marine inspector has reason to believe that the boiler  has deteriorated to any appreciable extent under the bottom where it  rests on saddles or foundations, he shall cause the boiler to be lifted  to such position that it can be thoroughly examined, provided the  examination cannot be made otherwise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The marine inspector may require any boiler to be drilled or  gaged to determine actual thickness any time its safety is in doubt. At  the first inspection for certification after a firetube or flue boiler  has been installed for 10 years, it shall be gaged to determine the  extent of deterioration. Thickness will be measured at or near the  waterline, at the bottom and at such other places deemed necessary by  the marine inspector. Examination may be by drilling or a nondestructive  means acceptable to the marine inspector. Prior to the use of a  nondestructive method of examination, the user shall demonstrate to the  marine inspector that results having an accuracy within plus or minus 5  percent are consistently obtainable when using specimens similar to  those to be examined on the boiler.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If the thickness is found to be less than the original thickness  upon which the maximum allowable working pressure was based, it shall be  recalculated. The thickness of the thinnest measured portion shall be  used in this calculation. Either the design formulas given in this  subchapter or the ones in effect when the boiler was contracted for or  built may normally be used in this recalculation. In no case will an  increase in the pressure allowed be made.</p><p class="depth2">Table 61.05-10--Inspection Intervals for Boilers \1 2 3\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Any</p><p class="depth2">Firetube boiler    Watertube     firetube     Firetube</p><p class="depth2">=150     boiler      boiler for   boiler <150</p><p class="depth2">psi                       propulsion       psi ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hydro Test:</p><p class="depth2">Passenger Vessel..................................             2.5            2.5            1           2.5</p><p class="depth2">Other Vessel......................................             2.5            5              1           5 Fireside Inspection...................................             1              2.5            1           2.5 Waterside Inspection..................................             1              2.5            1           2.5 Boiler Safety-Valve Test..............................             1              2.5            1           1 Valves Inspection.....................................             5              5              5           5 Studs and Bolts Inspection............................            10             10             10          10 Mountings Inspection..................................            10             10             10          10 Steam Gauge Test......................................             2.5            2.5          2.5           2.5 Fusible Plug Inspection...............................             2.5   ............          2.5           2.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ All intervals are in years. \2\ Where the 2.5-year interval is indicated: two tests or inspections must occur within any five-year period,</p><p class="depth2">and no more than three years may elapse between any test or inspection and its immediate predecessor. \3\ Intervals for hybrid boilers are the same as for firetube boilers.
