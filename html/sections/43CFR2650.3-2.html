Pursuant to section 22(c) of the Act, on any  lands to be conveyed to village or regional corporations, any person who  prior to August 31, 1971, initiated a valid mining claim or location,  including millsites, under the general mining laws and recorded notice  thereof with the appropriate State or local office, shall not be  challenged by the United States as to his possessory rights, if all  requirements of the general mining laws are met. However, the validity  of any unpatented mining claim may be contested by the United States,  the grantee of the United States or its successor in interest, or by any  person who may initiate a private contest. Contest proceedings and  appeals therefrom shall be to the Interior Board of Land Appeals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Patent requirements met. An acceptable mineral patent  application must be filed with the appropriate Bureau of Land Management  office not later than December 18, 1976, on lands conveyed to village or  regional corporations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon a showing that a mineral survey cannot be completed by  December 18, 1976, the filing of an application for a mineral survey,  which states on its face that it was filed for the purpose of proceeding  to patent, will constitute   an acceptable mineral patent application, provided all applicable  requirements under the general mining laws have been met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The failure of an applicant to prosecute diligently his  application for mineral patent to completion will result in the loss of  benefits afforded by section 22(c) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The appropriate office of the Bureau of Land Management shall  give notice of the filing of an application under this section to the  village or regional corporation which has selection rights in the land  covered by the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Patent requirements not met. Any mineral patent application  filed after December 18, 1976, on land conveyed to any village or  regional corporation pursuant to this Act, will be rejected for lack of  departmental jurisdiction.
