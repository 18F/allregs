and an extraordinary and lasting financial hardship shall be extraordinary as described above and may be expected to endure for the foreseeable future.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In applying this test in the case of attempted recovery by repayment, a substantial period of time shall be 30 days, and the foreseeable future shall be at least three months. In applying this test in the case of proposed recoupment from other benefits, a substantial period of time and the foreseeable future shall be the longest potential period of benefit entitlement as seen at the time of the request for a waiver determination. In making these determinations, the State agency shall take into account all potential income of the person or individual and the person's or individual's firm, organization, or family and all cash resources available or potentially available to the person or individual and the person's or individual's firm, organization, or family in the time period being considered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Determinations granting or denying waivers of overpayments shall be made only on request for a waiver determination.

Any amount recovered by a State agency under this section shall be deposited into the Federal fund or account from which payment was made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Procedural requirements.
