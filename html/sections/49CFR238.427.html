Generally when two or more violations of these regulations are discovered with respect to a single unit of passenger equipment that is placed or continued in service by a railroad, the appropriate penalties set forth above are aggregated up to a maximum of $16,000 per day. However, failure to perform, with respect to a particular unit of passenger equipment, any of the inspections and tests required under subparts D and F of this part will be treated as a violation separate and distinct from, and in addition to, any substantive violative conditions found on that unit of passenger equipment. Moreover, the Administrator reserves the right to assess a penalty of up to $105,000 for any violation where circumstances warrant. See 49 CFR part 209, appendix A.</p><p class="depth2">Failure to observe any condition for movement of defective equipment set forth in Sec. 238.17 will deprive the railroad of the benefit of the movement-for-repair provision and make the railroad and any responsible individuals liable for penalty under the particular regulatory section(s) concerning the substantive defect(s) present on the unit of passenger equipment at the time of movement.</p><p class="depth2">Failure to observe any condition for the movement of passenger equipment containing defective safety appliances, other than power brakes, set forth in Sec. 238.17(e) will deprive the railroad of the movement-for-repair provision and make the railroad and any responsible individuals liable for penalty under the particular regulatory section(s) contained in part 231 of this chapter or Sec. 238.429 concerning the substantive defective condition.</p><p class="depth2">The penalties listed for failure to perform the exterior and interior mechanical inspections and tests required under Sec. 238.303 and Sec. 238.305 may be assessed for each unit of passenger equipment contained in a train that is not properly inspected.
