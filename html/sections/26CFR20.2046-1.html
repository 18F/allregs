If the  decedent died after November 30, 1983, and before August 9, 1984, or, in  cases where the valuation date of the decedent's gross estate is before  May 1, 1989, if, on December 1, 1983, the decedent was mentally  incompetent so that the disposition of the decedent's property could not  be changed, and the decedent died on or after December 1, 1983, without  having regained competency to dispose of the decedent's property, or if  the decedent died within 90 days of the date on which the decedent first  regained competency, the fair market value of annuities, life estates,  terms for years, remainders, and reversions included in the gross estate  of such decedent is their present value determined under either this  section or Sec. 20.2031-7A(c), at the option of the taxpayer. The value  of annuities issued by companies regularly engaged in their sale, and of  insurance policies on the lives of persons other than the decedent, is  determined under Sec. 20.2031-8. The fair market value of a remainder  interest in a charitable remainder unitrust, as defined in Sec. 1.664-3  of this chapter, is its present value determined under Sec. 1.664-4 of  this chapter. The fair market value of a life interest or term for years  in a charitable remainder unitrust is the fair market value of the  property as of the date of valuation less the fair market value of the  remainder interest on such date determined under Sec. 1.664-4 of this  chapter. The fair market value of the interests in a pooled income fund,  as defined in Sec. 1.642(c)-5 of this chapter, is their value  determined under Sec. 1.642(c)-6 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The present value of an annuity, life estate, remainder, or  reversion determined under this section which is dependent on the  continuation or termination of the life of one person is computed by the  use of Table A in paragraph (d)(6) of this section. The   present value of an annuity, term for years, remainder, or reversion  dependent on a term certain is computed by the use of Table B in  paragraph (d)(6) of this section. If the interest to be valued is  dependent upon more than one life or there is a term certain concurrent  with one or more lives, see paragraph (d)(5) of this section. For  purposes of the computations described in this section, the age of a  person is to be taken as the age of that person at his or her nearest  birthday.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In all examples set forth in this section, the decedent is  assumed to have died on or after August 9, 1984, with the valuation date  of the decedent's gross estate before May 1, 1989, and to have been  competent to change the disposition of the property on December 1, 1983.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example (1). The decedent received, under the terms of the  decedent's father's will an annuity of $10,000 a year payable annually  for the life of the decedent's elder brother. At the time the decedent  died, an annual payment had just been made. The brother at the  decedent's death was 40 years eight months old. By reference to Table A,  the figure in column 2 opposite 41 years, the number nearest to the  brother's actual age, is found to be 9.1030. The present value of the  annuity at the date of the decedent's death is, therefore, $91,030  ($10,000x9.1030).</p><p class="depth0">Example (2). The decedent was entitled to receive an annuity of  $10,000 a year payable annually throughout a term certain. At the time  the decedent died, the annual payment had just been made and five more  annual payments were still to be made. By reference to Table B, it is  found that the figure in column 2 opposite five years is 3.7908. The  present value of the annuity is, therefore, $37,908 ($10,000x3.7808).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. The facts are the same as those contained in example (1)  set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, except that the  annuity is payable semiannually. The aggregate annual amount, $10,000,  is multiplied by the factor 9.1030 and the product multiplied by 1.0244.  The present value of the annuity at the date of the decedent's death is,  therefore, $93,251.13 ($10,000x9.1030x1.0244).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. The decedent was entitled to receive an annuity of $50 a  month during the life of another person. The decedent died on the date  the payment was due. At the date of the decedent's death, the person  whose life measures the duration of the annuity was 50 years of age. The  value of the annuity at the date of the decedent's death is $50 plus the  product of $50x12x8.4743 (see Table A)x1.0450 (See paragraph (d)(2)(ii)  of this section). That is $50 plus $5,313.39, or $5,363.39.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> may be illustrated by  the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. The decedent was the beneficiary of an annuity of $50 a  month. On the day a payment was due, the decedent died. There were 300  payments to be made, including the payment due. The value of the annuity  as of the date of decedent's death is the product of $50x12x9.0770 (see  Table B)x1.0534, or $5,737.03.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> may be illustrated  by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. The decedent or the decedent's estate was entitled to  receive the income from a fund of $50,000 during the life of the  decedent's elder brother. Upon the brother's death, the remainder is to  go to B. The brother was 31 years, five months old at the time of  decedent's death. By reference to Table A the figure in column 3  opposite 31 years is found to be 0.95254. The present value of the  decedent's interest is, therefore, $47,627 ($50,000x0.95254).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> may be illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. The decedent was entitled to receive certain property worth  $50,000 upon the death of the decedent's elder sister, to whom the  income was bequeathed for life. At the time of the decedent's death, the  elder sister was 31 years five months old. By reference to Table A the  figure in column 4 opposite 31 years is found to be .04746. The present  value of the remainder interest at the date of the decedent's death is,  therefore, $2,373 ($50,000x.04746).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Actuarial computations by the Internal Revenue Service. If the  valuation of the interest involved is dependent upon the continuation or  the termination of more than one life or upon a term certain concurrent  with one or more lives a special factor must be used. The factor is to  be computed on the basis of interest at the rate of 10 percent a year,  compounded annually, and life contingencies determined, as to each  person involved, from the values of lx that are set forth in column 2 of  Table LN of paragraph (d)(6). Table LN contains values of lx taken from  the life table for the total population appearing as Table 1 of United  States Life Tables: 1969-71, published by the Department of Health and  Human Services, Public Health Service. Many special factors involving  one and two lives may be found in or computed with the use of the tables  contained in Internal Revenue Service Publication 723E, ``Actuarial  Values II: Factors at 10 Percent Involving One and Two Lives,'' (12-83).  This publication is no longer   available for purchase from the Superintendent of Documents. However, it  may be obtained by requesting a copy from: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (IRS  Publication 723E), room 5228, Internal Revenue Service, POB 7604, Ben  Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044. However, if a special factor is  required in the case of an actual decedent, the Commissioner will  furnish the factor to the executor upon request. The request must be  accompanied by a statement of the date of birth of each person, the  duration of whose life may affect the value of the interest, and by  copies of the relevant instruments. Special factors are not furnished  for prospective transfers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Tables.

These factors are derived by using the appropriate section  7520 interest rate and, if applicable, the mortality component for the  valuation date of the interest that is being valued. See Sec. Sec.  20.7520-1 through 20.7520-4.

Sec. 20.7520-1(b) and 20.7520- 2(a)(2)) and the appropriate actuarial tables under either paragraph  (e)(4) or paragraph (f)(4) of this section, at the option of the  decedent's executor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of paragraphs (f)(2)(i) and (f)(2)(ii) of this  section, where the decedent's executor is given the option to use the  appropriate actuarial tables under either paragraph (e)(4) or paragraph  (f)(4) of this section, the decedent's executor must use the same  actuarial table with respect to each individual transaction and with  respect to all transfers occurring on the valuation date (for example,  gift and income tax charitable deductions with respect to the same  transfer must be determined based on the same tables, and all assets  includible in the gross estate and/or estate tax deductions claimed must  be valued based on the same tables).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Publications and actuarial computations by the Internal Revenue  Service.

Box 7604, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044. If a  special factor is required in the case of an actual decedent, the  Internal Revenue Service may furnish the factor to the executor upon a  request for a ruling. The request for a ruling must be accompanied by a  recitation of the facts including a statement of the date of birth for  each measuring life, the date of the decedent's death, any other  applicable dates, and a copy of the will, trust, or other relevant  documents. A request for a ruling must comply with the instructions for  requesting a ruling published periodically in the Internal Revenue  Bulletin (see Sec. Sec. 601.201 and 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b)) and include  payment of the required user fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em>, and Table B, Table J, and  Table K set forth in Sec. 20.2031-7(d)(6) must be used in the  application of the provisions of this section when the section 7520  interest rate component is between 4.2 and 14 percent.
