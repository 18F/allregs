in plan components or other plan content that guide management of resources on the plan area may be needed. The development of the plan monitoring program must be coordinated with the regional forester and Forest Service State and Private Forestry and Research and Development.

Monitoring questions and associated indicators must be designed to inform the management of resources on the plan area, including by testing relevant assumptions, tracking relevant changes, and measuring management effectiveness and progress toward achieving or maintaining the plan's desired conditions or objectives. Questions and indicators should be based on one or more desired conditions, objectives, or other plan components in the plan, but not every plan component needs to have a corresponding monitoring question.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The plan monitoring program should be coordinated and integrated with relevant broader-scale monitoring strategies (paragraph (b) of this section) to ensure that monitoring is complementary and efficient, and that information is gathered at scales appropriate to the monitoring questions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Subject to the requirements of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the responsible official has the discretion to set the scope and scale of the plan monitoring program, after considering:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Information needs identified through the planning process as most critical for informed management of resources on the plan area; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The financial and technical capabilities of the Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Each plan monitoring program must contain one or more monitoring questions and associated indicators addressing each of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The status of select watershed conditions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The status of select ecological conditions including key characteristics of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The status of focal species to assess the ecological conditions required under Sec. 219.9.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The status of a select set of the ecological conditions required under Sec. 219.9 to contribute to the recovery of federally listed threatened and endangered species, conserve proposed and candidate species, and maintain a viable population of each species of conservation concern.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The status of visitor use, visitor satisfaction, and progress toward meeting recreation objectives.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Measurable changes on the plan area related to climate change and other stressors that may be affecting the plan area.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Progress toward meeting the desired conditions and objectives in the plan, including for providing multiple use opportunities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> The effects of each management system to determine that they do not substantially and permanently impair the productivity of the land (16 U.S.C. 1604(g)(3)(C)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A range of monitoring techniques may be used to carry out the monitoring requirements in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> This section does not apply to projects or activities.
