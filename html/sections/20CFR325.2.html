                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Registering as unemployed. To claim unemployment benefits for any day, an employee must register as unemployed by doing the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Apply for unemployment benefits and employment service in accordance with Sec. 325.3;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> File a claim in accordance with Sec. 325.4; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provide any other information that the Board needs to properly adjudicate his or her right to unemployment benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No benefits payable without registration. No unemployment benefits shall be paid to any otherwise qualified employee with respect to any day claimed as a day of unemployment, and no waiting period credit shall be allowed, until such time as the employee has complied with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When a registration period may begin. When registering for unemployment benefits, an employee may claim benefits for any calendar day on which he or she is unemployed and believes himself or herself to be eligible for benefits. A registration period may begin

as early as the first calendar day on which an employee is unemployed following his or her last day of work even though such first calendar day would have been a rest day if the employee had not become unemployed. However, a registration period may not begin with any calendar day with respect to which an employee has received or will receive remuneration.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. An employee whose rest days are Saturday and Sunday is laid off on Friday, September 2, after working his regular shift on that day. His first 14-day registration period could start as early as Saturday, September 3. A registration period starting on September 3 would end on September 16. If he continues to be unemployed, his next registration period could begin September 17 and end September 30, and so forth.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. An employee whose rest days are Saturday and Sunday is laid off on Friday, September 2, but he decides to take two weeks' vacation pay covering days through Friday, September 16. Because he will have received remuneration for days through September 16, his claim for unemployment benefits could begin on Saturday, September 17, if he continues to be unemployed after his vacation ends.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. An employee whose rest days are Saturday and Sunday is laid off on Monday, September 5, after working his regular shift on that day. His first 14-day registration period could begin on Tuesday, September 6, the first day on which he was unemployed following his last day of work.
