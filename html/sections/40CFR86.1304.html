                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section numbering. The model year of initial applicability is  indicated by the section number. The digits following the hyphen  designate the first model year for which a section is applicable. The  section continues to apply to subsequent model years unless a later  model year section is adopted. (Example: Sec. 86.13xx-2004 applies to  the 2004 and subsequent model years. If a Sec. 86.13xx-2007 is  promulgated it would apply beginning with the 2007 model year;  Sec. 86.13xx-2004 would apply to model years 2004 through 2006.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A section reference without a model year suffix refers to the  section applicable for the appropriate model year.
