                                Sec. 3861.2  Surveys: Specific.

Sec. 3861.2-1  Particulars to be observed in mineral surveys.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The following particulars should be observed in the survey of every mining claim:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The exterior boundaries of the claim, the number of feet claimed along the vein, and, as nearly as can be ascertained, the direction of the vein, and the number of feet claimed on the vein in each direction from the point of discovery or other well-defined place on the claim should be represented on the plat of survey and in the field notes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The intersection of the lines of the survey with the lines of conflicting prior surveys should be noted in the field notes and represented upon the plat.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Conflicts with unsurveyed claims, where the applicant for survey does not claim the area in conflict, should be shown by actual survey.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The total area of the claim embraced by the exterior boundaries should be stated, and also the area in conflict with each intersecting survey, substantially as follows:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Acres------------------------------------------------------------------------Total area of claim.............................................   10.50Area in conflict with survey No. 302............................    1.56Area in conflict with survey No. 948............................    2.33Area in conflict with Mountain Maid lode mining claim,              1.48</p><p class="depth0">unsurveyed.....................................................------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> It does not follow that because mining surveys are required to exhibit all conflicts with prior surveys the area of conflict with prior surveys the area of conflict are to be excluded. The field notes and plat are made a part of the application for patent, and care should be taken that the description does not inadvertently exclude portions intended to be retained. The application for patent should state the portions to be excluded in express terms.



Sec. 3861.2-2  Certificate of expenditures and improvements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The claimant at the time of filing the application for patent, or at any time within the 60 days of publication, is required to file with the authorized officer a certificate of the office cadastral engineer that not less than $500 worth of labor has been expended or improvements made, by the applicant or his grantors, upon each location embraced in the application, or if the application embraces several contiguous locations held in common, that an amount equal to $500 for each location has been so expended upon, and for the benefit of, the entire group; that the plat filed by the claimant is correct; that the field notes of the survey, as filed, furnish such an accurate description of the claim as will, if incorporation in a patent, serve to identify the premises fully, and that such reference is made therein to natural objects or permanent monuments as will perpetuate and fix the locus thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In case of a lode and mill-site claim in the same survey the expenditure of $500 must be shown upon the lode claim.


Sec. 3861.2-3  Mineral surveyor's report of expenditures and improvements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In the mineral surveyor's report of the value of the improvements all actual expenditures and mining improvements made by the claimant or his grantors, having a direct relation to the development of the claim, must be included in the estimate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The expenditures required may be made from the surface or in running a tunnel, drifts, or crosscuts for the development of the claim. Expenditures for drill holes for the purpose of prospecting and securing data upon which further development of a group of lode mining claims held in common may be based are available toward meeting the statutory provision requiring an expenditure of $500 as a basis for patent as to all of the claims of the group situated in close proximity to such common improvement. Improvements of any other character, such as buildings, machinery, or roadways, must be excluded from the estimate, unless it is shown clearly that they are associated with actual excavations, such as cuts, tunnels, shafts, etc., are essential to the practical development of and actually facilitate the extraction of mineral from the claim.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Improvements made by a former locator who has abandoned his claim cannot be included in the estimate, but should be described and located in the notes and plat.


Sec. 3861.2-4  Supplemental proof of expenditures and improvements.</p><p class="depth0">If the value of the labor and improvements upon a mineral claim is less than $500 at the time of survey the mineral surveyor may file with the cadastral engineer supplemental proof showing $500 expenditure made prior to the expiration of the period of publication.


Sec. 3861.2-5  Amended mineral surveys.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Inasmuch as amended surveys are ordered only by special instructions from the Bureau of Land Management, and the conditions and circumstances peculiar to each separate case and the object sought by the required amendment, alone govern all special matters relative to the manner of making such survey and the form and subject matter to be embraced in the field notes thereof, but few general rules applicable to all cases can be laid down.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The expense of amended surveys, including amendment of plat and field notes, and office work in the Bureau of Land Management office will be borne by the claimant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The amended survey must be made in strict conformity with, or be embraced within, the lines of the original survey. If the amended and original surveys are identical, that fact must be clearly and distinctly stated in the field notes. If not identical, a bearing and distance must be given from each established corner of the amended survey to the corresponding corner of the original survey. The lines of the original survey, as found upon the ground, must be laid down upon the preliminary plat in such manner as to contrast and show their relation to the lines of the amended survey.</p>
