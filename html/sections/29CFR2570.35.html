If so, the  applicant must provide a brief statement describing the investigation,  examination, litigation or controversy. The Department reserves the  right to require the production of additional information or  documentation concerning any of the above matters.

(For purposes of this  paragraph, the information required by paragraph (a)(16) of this section  relates solely to other pooled fund transactions with, and investments  in, parties in interest involved in the exemption transaction which are  also sponsors of plans which invest in the pooled fund.);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The following information must also be furnished--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The estimated number of plans that are participating (or will  participate) in the pooled fund; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The minimum and maximum limits imposed by the pooled fund (if  any) on the portion of the total assets of each plan that may be  invested in the pooled fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Additional requirements for applications for individual  exemption involving pooled funds in which certain plans participate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> This paragraph applies to any application for an individual  exemption involving one or more pooled funds in which any plan  participating therein--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Invests an amount which exceeds 20% of the total assets of the  pooled fund, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Covers employees of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The party sponsoring or maintaining the pooled fund, or any  affiliate of such party, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any fiduciary with investment discretion over the pooled fund's  assets, or any affiliate of such fiduciary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The exemption application must include, with respect to each  plan described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the information  required by paragraphs (a)(1) through (3), (a)(5) through (7), (a)(10),  (a)(12) through (16), and (a)(18) and (19), of this section. The  information required by this paragraph must be furnished in reference to  the plan's investment in the pooled fund (e.g., the names, addresses and  taxpayer identifying numbers of all fiduciaries responsible for the  plan's investment in the pooled fund (Sec. 2570.35(a) (10)), the  percentage of the assets of the plan invested in the pooled fund  (Sec. 2570.35(a)(12)), whether the plan's investment in the pooled fund  has been consummated or will be consummated only if the exemption is  granted (Sec. 2570.35(a)(13)), etc.).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The information required by paragraph (c)(4) of this section  is in addition to the information required by paragraphs (c)(2) and (3)  of this section relating to information furnished by reference to the  pooled fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The special rule and the additional requirements described in  paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section do not apply to an  individual exemption request solely for the investment by a plan in a  pooled fund. Such an application must provide the information required  by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Retroactive exemptions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Generally, the Department will favorably consider requests for  retroactive relief, in all exemption applications, only where the  safeguards necessary for the grant of a prospective exemption were in  place at the time at which the parties entered into the transaction. An  applicant for a retroactive exemption must have acted in good faith by  taking reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the plan from abuse  and unnecessary risk at the time of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Among the factors that the Department would take into account in  making a finding that an applicant acted in good faith include the  following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The participation of an independent fiduciary acting on behalf  of the plan who is qualified to negotiate, approve and monitor the  transaction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The existence of a contemporaneous appraisal by a qualified  independent appraiser or reference to an objective third party source,  such as a stock or bond index;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The existence of a bidding process or evidence of comparable  fair market transactions with unrelated third parties;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> That the applicant has submitted an accurate and complete  application for exemption containing documentation of all necessary and  relevant facts and representations upon which the applicant relied. In  this regard, additional weight will be given to facts and  representations which are prepared and certified by a source independent  of the applicant;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> That the applicant has submitted evidence that the plan  fiduciary did not engage in an act or transaction knowing that such act  or transaction was prohibited under section 406 of ERISA and/or section  4975 of the Code. In this regard, the Department will accord appropriate  weight to the submission of a contemporaneous, reasoned legal opinion of  counsel, upon which the plan fiduciary relied in good faith before  entering the act or transaction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> That the applicant has submitted a statement of the  circumstances which prompted the submission of the application for  exemption and the steps taken by the applicant with regard to the  transaction upon discovery of the violation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> That the applicant has submitted a statement, prepared and  certified by an independent person familiar with the types of  transactions for which relief is requested, demonstrating that the terms  and conditions of the transaction (including, in the case of an  investment, the return in fact realized by the plan) were at least as  favorable to the plan as that obtainable in a similar transaction with  an unrelated party; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Such other undertakings and assurances with respect to the  plan and   its participants that may be offered by the applicant which are relevant  to the criteria under section 408(a) of ERISA and section 4975(c)(2) of  the Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Department, as a general matter, will not favorably consider  requests for retroactive exemptions where transactions or conduct with  respect to which an exemption is requested resulted in a loss to the  plan. In addition, the Department will not favorably consider requests  for exemptions where the transactions are inconsistent with the general  fiduciary responsibility provisions of sections 403 or 404 of ERISA or  the exclusive benefit requirements of section 401(a) of the Code.</p>
