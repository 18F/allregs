                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For each capture system subject to an operating limit in Sec. 63.7690(b)(1), you must install, operate, and maintain a CPMS according to the requirements in Sec. 63.7741(a) and the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If you use a flow measurement device to monitor the operating limit parameter, you must at all times monitor the hourly average rate (e.g., the hourly average actual volumetric flow rate through each separately ducted hood or the average hourly total volumetric flow rate at the inlet to the control device).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Dampers that are manually set and remain in the same position are exempt from the requirement to install and operate a CPMS. If dampers are not manually set and remain in the same position, you must make a visual check at least once every 24 hours to verify that each damper for the capture system is in the same position as during the initial performance test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For each negative pressure baghouse or positive pressure baghouse equipped with a stack that is applied to meet any PM or total metal HAP emissions limitation in this subpart, you must at all times monitor the relative change in PM loadings using a bag leak detection system according to the requirements in Sec. 63.7741(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For each baghouse, regardless of type, that is applied to meet any PM or total metal HAP emissions limitation in this subpart, you must conduct inspections at their specified frequencies according to the requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (8) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Monitor the pressure drop across each baghouse cell each day to ensure pressure drop is within the normal operating range identified in the manual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Confirm that dust is being removed from hoppers through weekly visual inspections or other means of ensuring the proper functioning of removal mechanisms.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Check the compressed air supply for pulse-jet baghouses each day.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Monitor cleaning cycles to ensure proper operation using an appropriate methodology.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Check bag cleaning mechanisms for proper functioning through monthly visual inspections or equivalent means.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Make monthly visual checks of bag tension on reverse air and shaker-type baghouses to ensure that bags are

not kinked (kneed or bent) or lying on their sides. You do not have to make this check for shaker-type baghouses using self-tensioning (spring-loaded) devices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Confirm the physical integrity of the baghouse through quarterly visual inspections of the baghouse interior for air leaks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Inspect fans for wear, material buildup, and corrosion through quarterly visual inspections, vibration detectors, or equivalent means.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For each wet scrubber subject to the operating limits in Sec. 63.7690(b)(2), you must at all times monitor the 3-hour average pressure drop and scrubber water flow rate using CPMS according to the requirements in Sec. 63.7741(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For each combustion device subject to the operating limit in Sec. 63.7690(b)(3), you must at all times monitor the 15-minute average combustion zone temperature using a CPMS according to the requirements of Sec. 63.7741(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For each combustion device subject to the operating limit in Sec. 63.7690(b)(4), you must at all times monitor the 3-hour average combustion zone temperature using CPMS according to the requirements in Sec. 63.7741(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> For each wet acid scrubber subject to the operating limits in Sec. 63.7690(b)(5),</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must at all times monitor the 3-hour average scrubbing liquid flow rate using CPMS according to the requirements of Sec. 63.7741(e)(1); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must at all times monitor the 3-hour average pH of the scrubber blowdown using CPMS according to the requirements in Sec. 63.7741(e)(2) or measure and record the pH of the scrubber blowdown once per production cycle using a pH probe and meter according to the requirements in Sec. 63.7741(e)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> For one or more automated conveyor and pallet cooling lines and automated shakeout lines at a new iron and steel foundry subject to the VOHAP emissions limit in Sec. 63.7690(a)(10), you must at all times monitor the 3-hour average VOHAP concentration using a CEMS according to the requirements of Sec. 63.7741(g).
