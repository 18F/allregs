                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pipelines greater than 8\5/8\ inches in diameter and  installed in water depths of less than 200 feet shall be buried to a  depth of at least 3 feet unless they are located in pipeline congested  areas or seismically active areas as determined by the Regional  Supervisor. Nevertheless, the Regional Supervisor may require burial of  any pipeline if the Regional Supervisor determines that such burial will  reduce the likelihood of environmental degradation or that the pipeline  may constitute a hazard to trawling operations or other uses. A trawl  test or diver survey may be required to determine whether or not  pipeline burial is necessary or to determine whether a pipeline has been  properly buried.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pipeline valves, taps, tie-ins, capped lines, and repaired  sections that could be obstructive shall be provided with at least 3  feet of cover unless the Regional Supervisor determines that   such items present no hazard to trawling or other operations. A  protective device may be used to cover an obstruction in lieu of burial  if it is approved by the Regional Supervisor prior to installation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Pipelines shall be installed with a minimum separation of 18  inches at pipeline crossings and from obstructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Pipeline risers installed after April 1, 1988, shall be  protected from physical damage that could result from contact with  floating vessels. Riser protection on pipelines installed on or before  April 1, 1988, may be required when the Regional Supervisor determines  that significant damage potential exists.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pipelines shall be pressure tested with water at a stabilized  pressure of at least 1.25 times the MAOP for at least 8 hours when  installed, relocated, uprated, or reactivated after being out-of-service  for more than 1 year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prior to returning a pipeline to service after a repair, the  pipeline shall be pressure tested with water or processed natural gas at  a minimum stabilized pressure of at least 1.25 times the MAOP for at  least 2 hours.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Pipelines shall not be pressure tested at a pressure which  produces a stress in the pipeline in excess of 95 percent of the  specified minimum-yield strength of the pipeline. A temperature recorder  measuring test fluid temperature synchronized with a pressure recorder  along with deadweight test readings shall be employed for all pressure  testing. When a pipeline is pressure tested, no observable leakage shall  be allowed. Pressure gauges and recorders shall be of sufficient  accuracy to verify that leakage is not occurring.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Regional Supervisor may require pressure testing of  pipelines to verify the integrity of the system when the Regional  Supervisor determines that there is a reasonable likelihood that the  line has been damaged or weakened by external or internal conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When a pipeline is repaired utilizing a clamp, the clamp shall  be a full encirclement clamp able to withstand the anticipated pipeline  pressure.</p>
