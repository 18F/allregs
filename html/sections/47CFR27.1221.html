                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Interference protection will be afforded to BRS and EBS on a station-by-station basis based on the heights of the stations in the LBS and UBS and also on height benchmarking, although the heights of antennas utilized are not restricted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Height benchmarking. Height benchmarking is defined for pairs of base stations, one in each of two proximate geographic service areas (GSAs). The height benchmark, which is defined in meters (hbm) for a particular base station relative to a base station in another GSA, is equal to the distance, in kilometers, from the base station along a radial to the nearest point on the GSA boundary of the other base station squared (Dkm\2\) and then divided by 17. That is, hb (m) = Dkm\2\/17. A base station antenna will be considered to be within its applicable height benchmark relative to another base station if the height in meters of its centerline of radiation above average elevation (HAAE) calculated along the straight line between the two base stations in accordance with Sec. 24.53(b) and (c) of this chapter does not exceed the height benchmark (hbm). A base station antenna will be considered to exceed its

applicable height benchmark relative to another base station if the HAAE of its centerline of radiation calculated along the straight line between the two base stations in accordance with Sec. 24.53(b) and (c) of this chapter exceeds the height benchmark (hbm).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Protection for receiving antennas not exceeding the height benchmark. Absent agreement between the two licensees to the contrary, if a transmitting antenna of one BRS/EBS licensee's base station exceeds its applicable height benchmark and such licensee is notified by another BRS/EBS licensee that it is generating an undesired signal level in excess of -107 dBm/5.5 megahertz at the receiver of a co-channel base station that is within its applicable height benchmark, then the licensee of the base station that exceeds its applicable height benchmark shall either limit the undesired signal at the receiver of the protected base station to -107dBm/5.5 megahertz or less or reduce the height of its transmission antenna to no more than the height benchmark. If the interfering base station has been modified to increase the EIRP transmitted in the direction of the protected base station, it shall be deemed to have commenced operations on the date of such modification. Such corrective action shall be completed no later than:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> 24 hours after receiving such notification, if the base station that exceeds its height benchmark commenced operations after the station that is within its applicable height benchmark; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> 90 days after receiving such notification, if the base station that exceeds its height commenced operations prior to the station that is within its applicable height benchmark. For purposes of this section, if the interfering base station has been modified to increase the EIRP transmitted in the direction of the victim base station, it shall be deemed to have commenced operations on the date of such modification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No Protection from a transmitting antenna not exceeding the height benchmark. The licensee of a base station transmitting antenna less than or equal to its applicable height benchmark shall not be required pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section to limit that antennas undesired signal level to -107dBm/5.5 megahertz or less at the receiver of any co-channel base station.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> No protection for a receiving-antenna exceeding the height benchmark. The licensee of a base station receive antenna that exceeds its applicable height benchmark shall not be entitled pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section to insist that any co-channel base station limit its undesired signal level to -107dBm/5.5 megahertz or less at the receiver.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Information exchange. A BRS/EBS licensee shall provide the geographic coordinates, the height above ground level of the center of radiation for each transmit and receive antenna, and the date transmissions commenced for each of the base stations in its GSA within 30 days of receipt of a request from a co-channel BRS/EBS licensee with an operational base station located in a proximate GSA. Information shared pursuant to this section shall not be disclosed to other parties except as required to ensure compliance with this section.
