                            <p class="depth0">Any member of the public may inspect or copy records described in  Sec. 303.5(b) in the public reading room during regular business hours.  Because it will sometimes be impossible to produce records or copies of  records on short notice, a person who wishes to inspect or copy records  shall arrange a time in advance, by telephone or letter request made to  the Peace Corps FOIA Officer. Persons submitting a request by telephone  for a record in the public reading room will be notified whether a  written request would be advisable to aid in the identification and  expeditious processing of the records sought. Written requests should  identify the records sought in the manner described in Sec. 303.8(b)  and should request a specific date for inspecting the records. The  requester will be advised as promptly as possible if, for any reason, it  may not be possible to make the records sought available on the date  requested.  [79 FR 19818, Apr. 10, 2014]</p>
