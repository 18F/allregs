Self-employment income is the amount of your net  earnings from self-employment that is subject to social security tax and  counted for social security benefit purposes. The term self-employment  income means the net earnings from self-employment you derive in a  taxable year, except as described in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Maximum self-employment income. (1) The term self-employment  income does not include that part of your net earnings from self- employment that exceeds (or that part of your net earnings from self- employment which, when added to the wages you received in that taxable  year, exceeds)--  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Taxable year                            Amount ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Ending before 1955.........................................       $3,600</p><p class="depth0">Ending in 1955 through 1958................................        4,200 Ending in 1959 through 1965................................        4,800 Ending in 1966 and 1967....................................        6,600 Ending after 1967 and beginning before 1972................        7,800 Beginning in 1972..........................................        9,000 Beginning in 1973..........................................       10,800 Beginning in 1974..........................................       13,200 Beginning in 1975..........................................       14,100 Beginning in 1976..........................................       15,300 Beginning in 1977..........................................       16,500 Beginning in 1978..........................................       17,700 Beginning in 1979..........................................       22,900 Beginning in 1980..........................................       25,900 Beginning in 1981..........................................       29,700 Beginning in 1982..........................................       32,400 Beginning in 1983..........................................       35,700 Beginning in 1984..........................................       37,800 Beginning in 1985..........................................       39,600 Beginning in 1986..........................................       42,000 Beginning in 1987..........................................       43,800 Beginning in 1988..........................................       45,000 Beginning in 1989..........................................       48,000 Beginning in 1990..........................................       51,300 Beginning in 1991..........................................       53,400 Beginning in 1992..........................................       55,500 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For the purpose of this paragraph the term wages includes  remuneration paid to an employee for services covered by an agreement  entered into under section 218 of the Act, or an agreement entered into  under section 3121(l) of the Code, which would be wages under section  209 of Act if the services were considered employment under section  210(a) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Minimum net earnings from self employment. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Self-employment  income does not include your net earnings from self-employment when the  amount of those earnings for the taxable year is less than $400. If you  have only $300 of net earnings from self-employment for the taxable year  you would not have any self-employment income. (Special rules apply if  you are paid $100 or more and work for a church or church-controlled  organization that has exempted its employees (see Sec. 404.1068(f)).)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If you have net earnings from self-employment of $400 or more  for the taxable year you may have less than $400 of creditable self- employment income. This occurs where your net earnings from self- employment is $400 or more for a taxable year and the amount of your net  earnings from self-employment plus the amount of the wages paid to you  during that taxable year exceed the maximum creditable earnings for a  year. For example, if you had net earnings from self-employment of  $1,000 for 1978, and were also paid wages of $17,500 during 1978, your  creditable self-employment income for 1978 would be $200.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Nonresident aliens. A nonresident alien has self-employment  income only if coverage is provided under a totalization agreement [see  Sec. 404.1913]. We do not consider an individual who is a resident of  the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the  Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or American Samoa to be a  nonresident alien.
