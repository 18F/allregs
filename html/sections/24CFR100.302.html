                            <p class="depth0">The provisions regarding familial status in this part shall not apply to housing provided under any Federal or State program that the Secretary determines is specifically designed and operated to assist elderly persons, as defined in the State or Federal program.


Sec. 100.303  62 or over housing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The provisions regarding familial status in this part shall not apply to housing intended for, and solely occupied by, persons 62 years of age or older. Housing satisfies the requirements of this section even though:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There are persons residing in such housing on September 13, 1988 who are under 62 years of age, provided that all new occupants are persons 62 years of age or older;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There are unoccupied units, provided that such units are reserved for occupancy by persons 62 years of age or over;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> There are units occupied by employees of the housing (and family members residing in the same unit) who are under 62 years of age provided they perform substantial duties directly related to the management or maintenance of the housing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (a) of this section:</p><p class="depth2">Example (1): John and Mary apply for housing at the Vista Heights apartment complex which is an elderly housing complex operated for persons 62 years of age or older. John is 62 years of age. Mary is 59 years of age. If Vista Heights wishes to retain its ``62 or over'' exemption it must refuse to rent to John and Mary because Mary is under 62 years of age. However, if Vista Heights does rent to John and Mary, it might qualify for the ``55 or over'' exemption in Sec. 100.304.</p><p class="depth2">Example (2): The Blueberry Hill retirement community has 100 dwelling units. On September 13, 1988, 15 units were vacant and 35 units were occupied with at least one person who is under 62 years of age. The remaining 50 units were occupied by persons who were all 62 years of age or older. Blueberry Hill can qualify for the ``62 or over'' exemption as long as all units that were occupied after September 13, 1988 are occupied by persons who were 62 years of age or older. The people under 62 in the 35 units previously described need not be required to leave for Blueberry Hill to qualify for the ``62 or over'' exemption.</p>
