                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This subpart C applies in lieu of subpart B of this part  exclusively to credit unions defined in paragraph (b) of this section as  ``new'' pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1790d(b)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> New credit union defined. A ``new'' credit union for purposes of  this subpart is a federally-insured credit union that both has been in  operation for less   than ten (10) years and has total assets of not more than $10 million. A  credit union which exceeds $10 million in total assets may become  ``new'' if its total assets subsequently decline below $10 million while  it is still in operation for less than 10 years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of spin-offs. A credit union formed as the result of a  ``spin-off'' of a group from the field of membership of an existing  credit union is deemed to be in operation since the effective date of  the ``spin-off.'' A credit union whose total assets decline below $10  million because a group within its field of membership has been ``spun- off'' is deemed ``new'' if it has been in operation less than 10 years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Actions to evade prompt corrective action. If the NCUA Board  determines that a credit union was formed, or was reduced in asset size  as a result of a ``spin-off,'' or was merged, primarily to qualify as  ``new'' under this subpart, the credit union shall be deemed subject to  prompt corrective action under subpart A of this part.</p>
