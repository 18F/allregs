program?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Threat identification. An operator must identify and evaluate all potential threats to each covered pipeline segment. Potential threats that an operator must consider include, but are not limited to, the threats listed in ASME/ANSI B31.8S (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 192.7), section 2, which are grouped under the following four categories:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Time dependent threats such as internal corrosion, external corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Static or resident threats, such as fabrication or construction defects;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Time independent threats such as third party damage and outside force damage; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Human error.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Data gathering and integration. To identify and evaluate the potential threats to a covered pipeline segment, an operator must gather and integrate existing data and information on the entire pipeline that could be relevant to the covered segment. In performing this data gathering and integration, an operator must follow the requirements in ASME/ANSI B31.8S, section 4. At a minimum, an operator must gather and evaluate the set of data specified in Appendix A to ASME/ANSI B31.8S, and consider both on the covered segment and similar non-covered segments, past incident history, corrosion control records, continuing surveillance records, patrolling records, maintenance history, internal inspection records and all other conditions specific to each pipeline.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Risk assessment. An operator must conduct a risk assessment that follows ASME/ANSI B31.8S, section 5, and considers the identified threats for each covered segment. An operator must use the risk assessment to prioritize the covered segments for the baseline and continual reassessments (Secs. 192.919, 192.921, 192.937), and to determine what additional preventive and mitigative measures are needed (Sec. 192.935) for the covered segment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Plastic transmission pipeline. An operator of a plastic transmission pipeline must assess the threats to each covered segment using the information in sections 4 and 5 of ASME B31.8S, and consider any threats unique to the integrity of plastic pipe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Actions to address particular threats. If an operator identifies any of the following threats, the operator must take the following actions to address the threat.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Third party damage. An operator must utilize the data integration required in paragraph (b) of this section and ASME/ANSI B31.8S, Appendix A7 to determine the susceptibility of each

covered segment to the threat of third party damage. If an operator identifies the threat of third party damage, the operator must implement comprehensive additional preventive measures in accordance with Sec. 192.935 and monitor the effectiveness of the preventive measures. If, in conducting a baseline assessment under Sec. 192.921, or a reassessment under Sec. 192.937, an operator uses an internal inspection tool or external corrosion direct assessment, the operator must integrate data from these assessments with data related to any encroachment or foreign line crossing on the covered segment, to define where potential indications of third party damage may exist in the covered segment.</p><p class="depth3">An operator must also have procedures in its integrity management program addressing actions it will take to respond to findings from this data integration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cyclic fatigue. An operator must evaluate whether cyclic fatigue or other loading condition (including ground movement, suspension bridge condition) could lead to a failure of a deformation, including a dent or gouge, or other defect in the covered segment. An evaluation must assume the presence of threats in the covered segment that could be exacerbated by cyclic fatigue. An operator must use the results from the evaluation together with the criteria used to evaluate the significance of this threat to the covered segment to prioritize the integrity baseline assessment or reassessment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Manufacturing and construction defects. If an operator identifies the threat of manufacturing and construction defects (including seam defects) in the covered segment, an operator must analyze the covered segment to determine the risk of failure from these defects. The analysis must consider the results of prior assessments on the covered segment. An operator may consider manufacturing and construction related defects to be stable defects if the operating pressure on the covered segment has not increased over the maximum operating pressure experienced during the five years preceding identification of the high consequence area. If any of the following changes occur in the covered segment, an operator must prioritize the covered segment as a high risk segment for the baseline assessment or a subsequent reassessment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Operating pressure increases above the maximum operating pressure experienced during the preceding five years;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> MAOP increases; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The stresses leading to cyclic fatigue increase.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> ERW pipe. If a covered pipeline segment contains low frequency electric resistance welded pipe (ERW), lap welded pipe or other pipe that satisfies the conditions specified in ASME/ANSI B31.8S, Appendices A4.3 and A4.4, and any covered or noncovered segment in the pipeline system with such pipe has experienced seam failure, or operating pressure on the covered segment has increased over the maximum operating pressure experienced during the preceding five years, an operator must select an assessment technology or technologies with a proven application capable of assessing seam integrity and seam corrosion anomalies. The operator must prioritize the covered segment as a high risk segment for the baseline assessment or a subsequent reassessment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Corrosion. If an operator identifies corrosion on a covered pipeline segment that could adversely affect the integrity of the line (conditions specified in Sec. 192.933), the operator must evaluate and remediate, as necessary, all pipeline segments (both covered and non-covered) with similar material coating and environmental characteristics. An operator must establish a schedule for evaluating and remediating, as necessary, the similar segments that is consistent with the operator's established operating and maintenance procedures under part 192 for testing and repair.
