                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Limited work authorization submitted as part of complete construction permit or combined license application. Each applicant for a construction permit or combined license applying for a limited work authorization under Sec. 50.10(d) of this chapter in a complete application under 10 CFR 2.101(a)(1) through (a)(4), shall submit with its application a separate document, entitled, ``Applicant's Environmental Report--Limited Work Authorization Stage,'' which is in addition to the environmental report required by Sec. 51.50 of this part. Each environmental report must also contain the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the activities proposed to be conducted under the limited work authorization;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A statement of the need for the activities; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of the environmental impacts that may reasonably be expected to result from the activities, the mitigation measures that the applicant proposes to implement to achieve the level of environmental impacts described, and a discussion of the reasons for rejecting mitigation measures that could be employed by the applicant to further reduce environmental impacts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Phased application for limited work authorization and construction permit or combined license. If the construction permit or combined license application is filed in accordance with Sec. 2.101(a)(9) of this chapter, then the environmental report for part one of the application may be limited to a discussion of the activities proposed to be conducted under the limited work authorization. If the scope of the environmental report for part one is so limited, then part two of the application must include the information required by Sec. 51.50, as applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Limited work authorization submitted as part of an early site permit application. Each applicant for an early site permit under subpart A of part 52 of this chapter requesting a limited work authorization shall submit with

its application the environmental report required by Sec. 51.50(b). Each environmental report must contain the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the activities proposed to be conducted under the limited work authorization;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A statement of the need for the activities; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of the environmental impacts that may reasonably be expected to result from the activities, the mitigation measures that the applicant proposes to implement to achieve the level of environmental impacts described, and a discussion of the reasons for rejecting mitigation measures that could be employed by the applicant to further reduce environmental impacts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limited work authorization request submitted by early site permit holder. Each holder of an early site permit requesting a limited work authorization shall submit with its application a document entitled, ``Applicant's Environmental Report--Limited Work Authorization under Early Site Permit,'' containing the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the activities proposed to be conducted under the limited work authorization;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A statement of the need for the activities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of the environmental impacts that may reasonably be expected to result from the activities, the mitigation measures that the applicant proposes to implement to achieve the level of environmental impacts described, and a discussion of the reasons for rejecting mitigation measures that could be employed by the applicant to further reduce environmental impacts; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any new and significant information for issues related to the impacts of construction of the facility that were resolved in the early site permit proceeding with respect to the environmental impacts of the activities to be conducted under the limited work authorization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A description of the process used to identify new and significant information regarding NRC's conclusions in the early site permit environmental impact statement. The process must be a reasonable methodology for identifying this new and significant information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Limited work authorization for a site where an environmental impact statement was prepared, but the facility construction was not completed. If the limited work authorization is for activities to be conducted at a site for which the Commission has previously prepared an environmental impact statement for the construction and operation of a nuclear power plant, and a construction permit was issued but construction of the plant was never completed, then the applicant's environmental report may incorporate by reference the earlier environmental impact statement. In the event of such referencing, the environmental report must identify:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any new and significant information material to issues related to the impacts of construction of the facility that were resolved in the construction permit proceeding for the matters required to be addressed in paragraph (a) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the process used to identify new and significant information regarding the NRC's conclusions in the construction permit environmental impact statement. The process must use a reasonable methodology for identifying this new and significant information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Environmental report. An environmental report submitted in accordance with this section must separately evaluate the environmental impacts and proposed alternatives attributable to the activities proposed to be conducted under the limited work authorization. At the option of the applicant, the ``Applicant's Environmental Report--Limited Work Authorization Stage,'' may contain the information required to be submitted in the environmental report required under Sec. 51.50, which addresses the impacts of construction and operation for the proposed facility (including the environmental impacts attributable to the limited work authorization), and discusses the overall costs and benefits balancing for the proposed action.
