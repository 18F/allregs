                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Participants in State, local, or private nonprofits programs. A  participant in a State, local, or private nonprofit program receiving  support from the Corporation is considered an eligible employee of the  program's project sponsor under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993  (29 CFR part 825) if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The participant has served for at least 12 months and 1,250  hours during the year preceding the start of the leave; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The program's project sponsors engages in commerce or any  industry or activity affecting commerce, and employs at least 50  employees for each working day during 20 or more calendar workweeks in  the current or preceding calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Participants in Federal programs. Participants in Federal  programs operated by the Corporation or by another Federal agency will  be considered Federal employees for the purposes of the Family and  Medical Leave Act if the participants have completed 12 months of  service and the project sponsor is an employing agency as defined in 5  U.S.C 6381 et seq.; such participants therefore will be eligible for the  same family and medical leave benefits afforded to such Federal  employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(1)</em>  and (2) of this section the entitlement to leave expires 12 months after  the birth or placement of such child): (1) The birth of a child to a  participant;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The placement of a child with a participant for adoption or  foster care;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The serious illness of a participant's spouse, child or parent;  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A participant's serious health condition that makes that  participant unable to perform his or her essential service duties (a  serious health condition is an illness or condition that requires either  inpatient care or continuing treatment by a health care provider).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Intermittent leave or reduced service. The program, serving as  the project sponsor, may allow a participant to take intermittent leave  or reduce his or her service hours due to the birth of or placement of a  child for adoption or foster care. The participant may also take leave  to care for a seriously ill immediate family member or may take leave  due to his or her own serious illness whenever it is medically  necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Alternate placement. If a participant requests intermittent  leave or a reduced service hours due to a serious illness or a family  member's sickness, and the need for leave is foreseeable based on  planned medical treatment, the program, or project sponsor may  temporarily transfer the participant to an alternative service position  if the participant: (1) Is qualified for the position; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Receives the same benefits such as stipend or living allowance  and the position better accommodates the participants recurring periods  of leave.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Certification of cause. A program, or project sponsor may  require that the participant support a leave request with a  certification from the health care provider of the participant or the  participant's family member. If a program sponsor requests a  certification, the participant must provide it in a timely manner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Continuance of coverage. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If a State, local or private  program provides for health insurance for the full-time participant, the  sponsor must continue to provide comparable health coverage at the same  level and conditions that coverage would have been provided for the  duration of the participant's leave.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the Federal program provides health insurance coverage for  the full-time participant, the sponsor must also continue to provide the  same health care coverage for the duration of the participant's leave.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Failure to return. If the participant fails to return to the  program at the end of leave for any reason other than continuation,  recurrence or onset of a serious health condition or other circumstances  beyond his or her control, the program may recover the premium that he  or she paid during any period of unpaid leave.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Applicability to term of service. Any absence, due to family and  medical leave, will not be counted towards the participant's term of  service.</p>
