                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of determining the aggregate total amount of assets under Section 7A(a)(2)(A), Section 7A(a)(2)(B)(i), Sec. 801.13(b), and Sec. 802.4:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Cash shall not be considered an asset of the person from which it is acquired; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Neither voting or nonvoting securities nor obligations referred to in section 7A(c)(2) shall be considered assets of another person from which they are acquired.</p><p class="depth2">Examples: 1. Assume that acquiring person ``A'' acquires voting securities of issuer X from ``B,'' a person unrelated to X. Under this paragraph, the acquisition is treated only as one of voting securities, requiring ``A'' and ``X'' to comply with the requirements of the act, rather than one in which ``A'' acquires the assets of ``B,'' requiring ``A'' and ``B'' to comply. See also example 2 to Sec. 801.30. Note that for purposes of section 7A(a)(2)--that is, for the next regularly prepared balance sheet of ``A'' referred to in Sec. 801.11--the voting securities of X must be reflected after their acquisition; see Sec. 801.11(c)(2).</p><p class="depth2">2. In the previous example, if ``A'' acquires nonvoting securities of X from ``B,'' then under this section the acquisition would be treated only as one of nonvoting securities of X (and would be exempt under section 7A(c)(2)), rather than one in which ``A'' acquires assets of ``B,'' requiring ``A'' and ``B'' to comply. Again, the nonvoting securities of X would have to be reflected in ``A's'' next regularly prepared balance sheet for purposes of section 7A(a)(2).</p><p class="depth2">3. In example 1, assume that ``B'' receives only cash from ``A'' in exchange for the voting securities of X. Under this section, ``B's'' acquisition of cash is not an acquisition of the ``assets'' of ``A,'' and ``B'' is not required to file notification as an acquiring person.
