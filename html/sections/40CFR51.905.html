An area designated nonattainment for the 8-hour NAAQS that is a maintenance area for the 1-hour NAAQS at the time of designation for the 8-hour NAAQS for that area remains subject to the obligation to implement the applicable requirements as defined in Sec. 51.900 (f) to the extent such obligations are required by the approved SIP, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. Applicable measures in the SIP must continue to be implemented; however, if these measures were shifted to contingency measures prior to designation for the 8-hour NAAQS for the area, they may remain as contingency measures, unless the measures are required to be implemented by the CAA by virtue of the area's requirements under the 8-hour NAAQS. The State may not remove such measures from the SIP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> 8-Hour NAAQS Attainment/1-Hour NAAQS Nonattainment--(i) Obligations in an approved SIP. For an area that is 8-hour NAAQS attainment/1-hour NAAQS nonattainment, the State may request that obligations under the applicable requirements of Sec. 51.900(f) be shifted to contingency measures, consistent with sections 110(l) and 193 of the CAA, after revocation of the 1-hour NAAQS; however, the State cannot remove the obligations from the SIP. For such areas, the State may request that the nonattainment NSR provisions be removed from the SIP on or after the date of revocation of the 1-hour NAAQS and need not be shifted to contingency measures subject to paragraph (e)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Obligations in an approved SIP. For an area that is 8-hour NAAQS attainment/1-hour NAAQS nonattainment, the State may request that obligations under the applicable requirements of Sec. 51.900(f) be shifted to contingency measures, consistent with sections 110(l) and 193 of the CAA, after revocation of the 1-hour NAAQS; however, the State cannot remove the obligations from the SIP.

For areas initially designated attainment for the 8-hour NAAQS, and designated nonattainment for the 1-hour NAAQS at the time of designation for the 8-hour NAAQS, the State shall submit no later than 3 years after the area's designation for the 8-hour NAAQS, a maintenance plan for the 8-hour NAAQS in accordance with section 110(a)(1) of the CAA. The maintenance plan must provide for continued maintenance of the 8-hour NAAQS for 10 years following designation and must include contingency measures. This provision does not apply to areas redesignated from nonattainment to attainment for the 8-hour NAAQS pursuant to CAA section 107(d)(3); such areas are subject to the maintenance plan requirement in section 175A of the CAA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> 8-Hour NAAQS Attainment/1-Hour NAAQS Maintenance--(i) Obligations in an approved SIP. For an 8-hour NAAQS attainment/1-hour NAAQS maintenance area, the State may request that obligations under the applicable requirements of Sec. 51.900(f) be shifted to contingency measures, consistent with sections 110(l) and 193 of the CAA, after revocation of the 1-hour NAAQS; however, the State cannot remove the obligations from the SIP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Obligations in an approved SIP. For an 8-hour NAAQS attainment/1-hour NAAQS maintenance area, the State may request that obligations under the applicable requirements of Sec. 51.900(f) be shifted to contingency measures, consistent with sections 110(l) and 193 of the CAA, after revocation of the 1-hour NAAQS; however, the State cannot remove the obligations from the SIP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Maintenance Plans for the 8-hour NAAQS. For areas initially designated attainment for the 8-hour NAAQS and subject to the maintenance plan for the 1-hour NAAQS at the time of designation for the 8-hour NAAQS, the State shall submit no later than 3 years after the area's designation for the 8-hour NAAQS, a maintenance plan for the 8-hour NAAQS in accordance with section 110(a)(1) of the CAA. The maintenance plan must provide for continued maintenance of the 8-hour NAAQS for 10 years following designation and must include contingency measures. This provision does not apply to areas redesignated from nonattainment to attainment for the 8-hour NAAQS pursuant to section 107(d)(3); such areas

are subject to the maintenance plan requirement in section 175A of the CAA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Does attainment of the ozone NAAQS affect the obligations under paragraph (a) of this section? A State remains subject to the obligations under paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(2) of this section until the area attains the 8-hour NAAQS. After the area attains the 8-hour NAAQS, the State may request such obligations be shifted to contingency measures, consistent with sections 110(l) and 193 of the CAA; however, the State cannot remove the obligations from the SIP. Once an area attains the 1-hour NAAQS, the section 172 and 182 contingency measures under the 1-hour NAAQS can be shifted to contingency measures for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS and must remain in the SIP until the area is redesignated to attainment for the 1997 8-hour NAAQS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Which portions of an area designated for the 8-hour NAAQS remain subject to the obligations identified in paragraph (a) of this section?

Upon revocation of the 1-hour NAAQS, an area with an approved 1-hour maintenance plan under section 175A of the CAA may modify the maintenance plan: To remove the obligation to submit a maintenance plan for the 1-hour NAAQS 8 years after approval of the initial 1-hour maintenance plan; and to remove the obligation to implement contingency measures upon a violation of the 1-hour NAAQS. However, such requirements will remain enforceable as part of the approved SIP until such time as EPA approves a SIP revision removing such obligations. The EPA shall not approve a SIP revision requesting these modifications until the State submits and EPA approves an attainment demonstration for the 8-hour NAAQS for an area initially designated nonattainment for the 8-hour ozone NAAQS or a maintenance SIP for the 8-hour NAAQS for an area initially designated attainment for the 8-hour NAAQS. Any revision to such SIP must meet the requirements of section 110(l) and 193 of the CAA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Maintenance plans. Upon revocation of the 1-hour NAAQS, an area with an approved 1-hour maintenance plan under section 175A of the CAA may modify the maintenance plan: To remove the obligation to submit a maintenance plan for the 1-hour NAAQS 8 years after approval of the initial 1-hour maintenance plan; and to remove the obligation to implement contingency measures upon a violation of the 1-hour NAAQS. However, such requirements will remain enforceable as part of the approved SIP until such time as EPA approves a SIP revision removing such obligations. The EPA shall not approve a SIP revision requesting these modifications until the State submits and EPA approves an attainment demonstration for the 8-hour NAAQS for an area initially designated nonattainment for the 8-hour ozone NAAQS or a maintenance SIP for the 8-hour NAAQS for an area initially designated attainment for the 8-hour NAAQS. Any revision to such SIP must meet the requirements of section 110(l) and 193 of the CAA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Findings of failure to attain the 1-hour NAAQS. (i) Upon revocation of the 1-hour NAAQS for an area, EPA is no longer obligated--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Upon revocation of the 1-hour NAAQS for an area, EPA is no longer obligated--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> To determine pursuant to section 181(b)(2) or section 179(c) of the CAA whether an area attained the 1-hour NAAQS by that area's attainment date for the 1-hour NAAQS; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> To reclassify an area to a higher classification for the 1-hour NAAQS based upon a determination that the area failed to attain the 1-hour NAAQS by the area's attainment date for the 1-hour NAAQS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)-(iii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Conformity determinations for the 1-hour NAAQS. Upon revocation of the 1-hour NAAQS for an area, conformity determinations pursuant to section 176(c) of the CAA are no longer required for the 1-hour NAAQS. At that time, any provisions of applicable SIPs that require conformity determinations in such areas for the 1-hour NAAQS will no longer be enforceable pursuant to section 176(c)(5) of the CAA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> What is the continued applicability of the NOX SIP Call after revocation of the 1-hour NAAQS? The NOX SIP Call shall continue to apply after revocation of the 1-hour NAAQS. Control obligations approved into the SIP pursuant to 40 CFR 51.121 and 51.122 may be

modified by the State only if the requirements of Sec. Sec. 51.121 and 51.122, including the statewide NOX emission budgets, continue to be met and the State makes a showing consistent with section 110(l) of the CAA.
