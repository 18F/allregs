After OCGFC has evaluated all elements of a claim as stated in the Proof of Loss, the Authorized Official will issue, and provide the Claimant with a copy of, the Authorized Official's Determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Claimant's options upon issuance of the Authorized Official's determination. Not later than 120 days after the date that appears on the Authorized Official's Determination, the Claimant must either accept the findings by submitting a Release and Certification Form to FEMA or initiate an Administrative Appeal in accordance with Sec. 295.41. The CGFAA requires that Claimants sign the Release and Certification Form to receive payment on their claims (except for partial payments). The Claimant will receive payment of compensation awarded by the Authorized Official after FEMA receives the completed Release and Certification Form. If the Claimant does not either submit a Release and Certification Form to FEMA or initiate an Administrative Appeal no later than 120 Days after the date that appears on the Authorized Official's Determination, he or she will be conclusively presumed to have accepted the Authorized Official's Determination. The Director of OCGFC may modify the deadlines set forth in this subsection at the request of a Claimant for good cause shown.</p>
