For purposes of part 4 of this chapter, ``Leona Valley'' is a term of viticultural significance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Approved maps. The four United States Geological Survey 1:24,000 scale topographic maps used to determine the boundary of the Leona Valley viticultural area are titled:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ritter Ridge, Calif., 1958; Photorevised 1974;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sleepy Valley, CA, 1995;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Del Sur, CA, 1995; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Lake Hughes, CA, 1995.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Boundary.
