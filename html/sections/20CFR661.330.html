                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The State may use any local entity that meets the requirements of WIA section 117(i) to perform the functions of the Local Board. WIA section 117(i) requires that such entity:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Was established to serve the local area (or the service delivery area that most closely corresponds to the local area);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Was in existence on December 31, 1997;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> Is a Private Industry Council established under section 102 of the Job Training Partnership Act, as in effect on December 31, 1997; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is a Private Industry Council established under section 102 of the Job Training Partnership Act, as in effect on December 31, 1997; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is substantially similar to the Local Board described in WIA section 117 (a), (b), and (c) and (h)(1) and (2); and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Includes, at a minimum, two or more representatives of business in the local area and two or more representatives of labor organizations nominated by local labor federations or employees in the local area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> If the Governor certifies an alternative entity to perform the functions of the Local Board; the State workforce investment plan must demonstrate that the alternative entity meets the requirements of WIA section 117(i), set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the Governor certifies an alternative entity to perform the functions of the Local Board; the State workforce investment plan must demonstrate that the alternative entity meets the requirements of WIA section 117(i), set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the alternative entity does not provide for representative membership of each of the categories of required Local Board membership under WIA section 117(b), including all of the One-stop partner programs, the local workforce investment plan must explain the manner in which the Local Board will ensure an ongoing role for the unrepresented membership group in the local workforce investment system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Local Board may provide an ongoing role for an unrepresented membership group, including entities carrying out One-stop partner programs, by means such as regularly scheduled consultations with entities within the unrepresented membership groups, by providing an opportunity for input into the local plan or other policy development by unrepresented membership groups, or by establishing an advisory committee of unrepresented membership groups. The Local Board must enter into good faith negotiations over the terms of the MOU with all entities carrying out One-stop partner programs, including programs not represented on the alternative entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the membership structure of an alternative entity is significantly changed after December 31, 1997, the entity will no longer be eligible to perform the functions of the Local Board. In such case, the chief elected official(s) must establish a new Local Board which meets all of the criteria of WIA section 117(a), (b), and (c) and (h)(1) and (2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A significant change in the membership structure includes any significant change in the organization of the alternative entity or in the categories of entities represented on the alternative entity which requires a change to the alternative entity's charter or a similar document that defines the formal organization of the alternative entity, regardless of whether the required change to the document has or has not been made. A significant change in the membership structure is considered to have occurred when members are added to represent groups not previously represented on the entity. A significant change in the membership structure is not considered to have occurred when additional members are added to an existing membership category, when non-voting members (including a Youth

Council) are added, or when a member is added to fill a vacancy created in an existing membership category.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In 20 CFR parts 660 through 671, all references to the Local Board must be deemed to also apply to an alternative entity used by a local area.
