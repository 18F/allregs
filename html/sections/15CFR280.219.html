                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Cases may be settled before service of a charging letter. In cases in which settlement is reached before service of a charging letter, a proposed charging letter will be prepared, and a settlement proposal consisting of a settlement agreement and order will be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for approval and signature. If the Assistant Secretary does not approve the proposal, he/she will notify the parties and the case will proceed as though no settlement proposal had been made. If the Assistant Secretary approves the proposal, he/she will issue an appropriate order, and no action will be required by the administrative law judge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cases may also be settled after service of a charging letter. (1) If the case is pending before the administrative law judge, the ALJ shall stay the proceedings for a reasonable period of time, usually not to exceed 30 days,

upon notification by the parties that they have entered into good faith settlement negotiations. The administrative law judge may, in his/her discretion, grant additional stays. If settlement is reached, a proposal will be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for approval and signature. If the Assistant Secretary approves the proposal, he/she will issue an appropriate order, and notify the administrative law judge that the case is withdrawn from adjudication. If the Assistant Secretary does not approve the proposal, he/she will notify the parties and the case will proceed to adjudication by the administrative law judge as though no settlement proposal had been made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the case is pending before the administrative law judge, the ALJ shall stay the proceedings for a reasonable period of time, usually not to exceed 30 days,

If the Under Secretary approves the proposal, he/she will issue an appropriate order. If the Under Secretary does not approve the proposal, the case will proceed to final decision in accordance with Section 280.623 of this part, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any order disposing of a case by settlement may suspend the administrative sanction imposed, in whole or in part, on such terms of probation or other conditions as the signing official may specify. Any such suspension may be modified or revoked by the signing official, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Sec. 280.218(c) of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any respondent who agrees to an order imposing any administrative sanction does so solely for the purpose of resolving the claims in the administrative enforcement proceeding brought under this part. This reflects the fact that the Department has neither the authority nor the responsibility for instituting, conducting, settling, or otherwise disposing of criminal proceedings. That authority and responsibility is vested in the Attorney General and the Department of Justice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Cases that are settled may not be reopened or appealed.
