Space used for storage, study, conservation and, if exhibited, any exhibition must not be used for non-curatorial purposes that would endanger or damage the collection;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Keep the collection under physically secure conditions within storage, laboratory, study and any exhibition areas by:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Having the physical plant meet local electrical, fire, building, health and safety codes;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Having an appropriate and operational fire detection and suppression system;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Having an appropriate and operational intrusion detection and deterrent system;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Having an adequate emergency management plan that establishes procedures for responding to fires, floods, natural disasters, civil unrest, acts of violence, structural failures and failures of mechanical systems within the physical plant;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Providing fragile or valuable items in a collection with additional security such as locking the items in a safe, vault or museum specimen cabinet, as appropriate;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Limiting and controlling access to keys, the collection and the physical plant; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Inspecting the physical plant in accordance with Sec. 79.11 of this part for possible security weaknesses and environmental control problems, and taking necessary actions to maintain the integrity of the collection;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Require staff and any consultants who are responsible for managing and preserving the collection to be qualified museum professionals;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Handle, store, clean, conserve and, if exhibited, exhibit the collection in a manner that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is appropriate to the nature of the material remains and associated records;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Protects them from breakage and possible deterioration from adverse temperature and relative humidity, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, dust, soot, gases, mold, fungus, insects, rodents and general neglect; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Preserves data that may be studied in future laboratory analyses.
