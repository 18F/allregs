                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> State agency responsibilities. If suitable employment as described in Sec. 617.22(a)(1), is not otherwise available to an individual or group of individuals, it is the responsibility of the State agency to explore, identify, develop and secure training opportunities and to establish linkages with other public and private agencies, Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs), employers, and Workforce Investment Act (WIA) service delivery area (SDA) grant recipients, as appropriate, which return adversely affected workers to employment as soon as possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Firm-specific retraining program. To the extent practicable before referring an adversely affected worker to approved training, the State agency shall consult with the individual's adversely affected firm and certified or recognized union, or other authorized representative, to develop a retraining program that meets the firm's staffing needs and preserves or restores the employment relationship between the individual and the firm. The fact that there is no need by other employers in the area for individuals in a specific occupation for which training is undertaken shall not preclude the development of an individual retraining program for such occupation with the adversely affected firm.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Methods of training. Adversely affected workers may be provided either one or a combination of the following methods of training:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Insofar as possible, priority will be given to on-the-job training, which includes related education necessary to acquire skills needed for a position within a particular occupation, in the firm or elsewhere pursuant to Sec. Sec. 617.24, 617.25, and 617.26, including training for which the firm pays the costs. This ensures that on-the-job training provides the skills necessary for the individual to obtain employment in an occupation rather than a particular job at a specific site; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Institutional training, with priority given to providing the training in public area vocational education schools if it is determined that such schools are at least as effective and efficient as other institutional alternatives, pursuant to Sec. Sec. 617.24, 617.25, and 617.26.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Standards and procedures. The State agency shall document the standards and procedures used to select occupations and training institutions in which training is approved. Such occupations and training shall offer a reasonable expectation (not necessarily a prior guarantee) of employment following such training.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Standards. The State agency shall approve training in occupations for which an identifiable demand exists either in the local labor market or in other labor markets for which relocation planning has been implemented. If practicable, placement rates and employer reviews of curriculum shall be used as guides in the selection of training institutions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Procedures. In determining the types of training to be provided, the State agency shall consult with local employers, appropriate labor organizations, WIBs and other WIA One-Stop partners, WIBs, local educational organizations, local apprenticeship programs, local advisory councils established under the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act, and post-secondary institutions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exclusions. In determining suitable training the State agency shall exclude certain occupations, where:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Lack of employment opportunities exist as substantiated by job orders and other pertinent labor market data; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The occupation provides no reasonable expectation of permanent employment.
