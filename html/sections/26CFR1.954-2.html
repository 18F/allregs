If any portion of income, gain or loss from a transaction is described in more than one category of foreign personal holding company income (as described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section), that portion of income, gain or loss is treated solely as income, gain or loss from the category of foreign personal holding company income with the highest priority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If any portion of income, gain or loss from a transaction is described in more than one category of foreign personal holding company income (as described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section), that portion of income, gain or loss is treated solely as income, gain or loss from the category of foreign personal holding company income with the highest priority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Priority of categories.

Under paragraphs (e), (f), (g) and (h) of this section, transactions in certain property give rise to gain or loss included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income if the controlled foreign corporation holds that property for a particular use or purpose. The use or purpose for which property is held is that use or purpose for which it was held for more than one- half of the period during which the controlled foreign corporation held the property prior to the disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

If a principal purpose of a change in use or purpose of property was to avoid including gain or loss in the computation of foreign personal holding company income, all the gain or loss from the disposition of the property is treated as foreign personal holding company

income. A purpose may be a principal purpose even though it is outweighed by other purposes (taken together or separately).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Hedging transactions. The provisions of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section shall not apply to bona fide hedging transactions, as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section. A transaction will be treated as a bona fide hedging transaction only so long as it satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (a)(3).</p><p class="depth0">Example. At the beginning of taxable year 1, CFC, a controlled foreign corporation, purchases a building for investment. During taxable years 1 and 2, CFC derives rents from the building that are included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. At the beginning of taxable year 3, CFC changes the use of the building by terminating all leases and using it in an active trade or business. At the beginning of taxable year 4, CFC sells the building at a gain. The building was not used in an active trade or business of CFC for more than one-half of the period during which it was held by CFC. Therefore, the building is considered to be property that gives rise to rents, as described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, and gain from the sale is included in the computation of CFC's foreign personal holding company income under paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Definitions and special rules. The following definitions and special rules apply for purposes of computing foreign personal holding company income under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Interest. The term interest includes all amounts that are treated as interest income (including interest on a tax-exempt obligation) by reason of the Internal Revenue Code or Income Tax Regulations or any other provision of law. For example, interest includes stated interest, acquisition discount, original issue discount, de minimis original issue discount, market discount, de minimis market discount, and unstated interest, as adjusted by any amortizable bond premium or acquisition premium.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Bona fide hedging transaction--(A) Definition. The term bona fide hedging transaction means a transaction that meets the requirements of Sec. 1.1221-2 (a) through (d) and that is identified in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, except that in applying Sec. 1.1221-2(b)(1), the risk being hedged may be with respect to ordinary property, section 1231 property, or a section 988 transaction. A transaction that hedges the liabilities, inventory or other assets of a related person (as defined in section 954(d)(3)), that is entered into to assume or reduce risks of a related person, or that is entered into by a person other than a person acting in its capacity as a regular dealer (as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section) to reduce risks assumed from a related person, will not be treated as a bona fide hedging transaction. For an illustration of how this rule applies with respect to foreign currency transactions, see paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Definition. The term bona fide hedging transaction means a transaction that meets the requirements of Sec. 1.1221-2 (a) through (d) and that is identified in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, except that in applying Sec. 1.1221-2(b)(1), the risk being hedged may be with respect to ordinary property, section 1231 property, or a section 988 transaction. A transaction that hedges the liabilities, inventory or other assets of a related person (as defined in section 954(d)(3)), that is entered into to assume or reduce risks of a related person, or that is entered into by a person other than a person acting in its capacity as a regular dealer (as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section) to reduce risks assumed from a related person, will not be treated as a bona fide hedging transaction. For an illustration of how this rule applies with respect to foreign currency transactions, see paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Identification. The identification requirements of this section shall be satisfied if the taxpayer meets the identification and recordkeeping requirements of Sec. 1.1221-2(f). However, for bona fide hedging transactions entered into prior to March 7, 1996 the identification and recordkeeping requirements of Sec. 1.1221-2 shall not apply. Rather, for bona fide hedging transactions entered into on or after July 22, 1988 and prior to March 7, 1996 the identification and recordkeeping requirements shall be satisfied if such transactions are identified by the close of the fifth day after the day on which they are entered into. For bona fide hedging transactions entered into prior to July 22, 1988, the identification and recordkeeping requirements shall be satisfied if such transactions are identified reasonably contemporaneously with the date they are entered into, but no later than within the normal period prescribed under the method of accounting of the controlled foreign corporation used for financial reporting purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Effect of identification and non-identification--(1) Transactions identified. If a taxpayer identifies a transaction as a bona fide hedging transaction for purposes of this section, the identification is binding with respect

to any loss arising from such transaction whether or not all of the requirements of paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(A) of this section are satisfied. Accordingly, such loss will be allocated against income that is not subpart F income (or, in the case of an election under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, against the category of subpart F income to which it relates) and apportioned among the categories of income described in section 904(d)(1). If the transaction is not in fact a bona fide hedging transaction described in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, however, then any gain realized with respect to such transaction shall not be considered as gain from a bona fide hedging transaction. Accordingly, such gain shall be treated as gain from the appropriate category of foreign personal holding company income. Thus, the taxpayer's identification of the transaction as a hedging transaction does not itself operate to exclude gain from the appropriate category of foreign personal holding company income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Inadvertent identification. Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(C)(1) of this section, if the taxpayer identifies a transaction as a bona fide hedging transaction for purposes of this section, the characterization of the loss is determined as if the transaction had not been identified as a bona fide hedging transaction if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The transaction is not a bona fide hedging transaction (as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(A) of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The identification of the transaction as a bona fide hedging transaction was due to inadvertent error; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> All of the taxpayer's transactions in all open years are being treated on either original or, if necessary, amended returns in a manner consistent with the principles of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Transactions not identified. Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(4)(ii)(C)(4) and (5) of this section, the absence of an identification that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(B) of this section is binding and establishes that a transaction is not a bona fide hedging transaction. Thus, subject to the exceptions, the characterization of gain or loss is determined without reference to whether the transaction is a bona fide hedging transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Inadvertent error. If a taxpayer does not make an identification that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, the taxpayer may treat gain or loss from the transaction as gain or loss from a bona fide hedging transaction if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The transaction is a bona fide hedging transaction (as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(A) of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The failure to identify the transaction was due to inadvertent error; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> All of the taxpayer's bona fide hedging transactions in all open years are being treated on either original or, if necessary, amended returns as bona fide hedging transactions in accordance with the rules of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Anti-abuse rule. If a taxpayer does not make an identification that satisfies all the requirements of paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(B) of this section but the taxpayer has no reasonable grounds for treating the transaction as other than a bona fide hedging transaction, then loss from the transaction shall be treated as realized with respect to a bona fide hedging transaction. Thus, a taxpayer may not elect to exclude loss from its proper characterization as a bona fide hedging transaction. The reasonableness of the taxpayer's failure to identify a transaction is determined by taking into consideration not only the requirements of paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(A) of this section but also the taxpayer's treatment of the transaction for financial accounting or other purposes and the taxpayer's identification of similar transactions as hedging transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Inventory and similar property--(A) Definition. The term inventory and similar property (or inventory or similar property) means property that is stock in trade of the controlled foreign corporation or other property of a kind that would properly be included in the inventory of the controlled foreign corporation if on hand at the close of the taxable year (if the controlled foreign corporation were a domestic corporation), or property held by the controlled foreign corporation primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Definition. The term inventory and similar property (or inventory or similar property) means property that is stock in trade of the controlled foreign corporation or other property of a kind that would properly be included in the inventory of the controlled foreign corporation if on hand at the close of the taxable year (if the controlled foreign corporation were a domestic corporation), or property held by the controlled foreign corporation primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Hedging transactions. A bona fide hedging transaction with respect to inventory or similar property (other than a transaction described in section 988(c)(1) without regard to section 988(c)(1)(D)(i)) shall be treated as a transaction in inventory or similar property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Regular dealer. The term regular dealer means a controlled foreign corporation that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Regularly and actively offers to, and in fact does, purchase property from and sell property to customers who are not related persons (as defined in section 954(d)(3)) with respect to the controlled foreign corporation in the ordinary course of a trade or business; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Regularly and actively offers to, and in fact does, enter into, assume, offset, assign or otherwise terminate positions in property with customers who are not related persons (as defined in section 954(d)(3)) with respect to the controlled foreign corporation in the ordinary course of a trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Dealer property--(A) Definition. Property held by a controlled foreign corporation is dealer property if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The controlled foreign corporation is a regular dealer in property of such kind (determined under paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The property is held by the controlled foreign corporation in its capacity as a dealer in property of such kind without regard to whether the property arises from a transaction with a related person (as defined in section 954(d)(3)) with respect to the controlled foreign corporation. The property is not held by the controlled foreign corporation in its capacity as a dealer if the property is held for investment or speculation on its own behalf or on behalf of a related person (as defined in section 954(d)(3)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Securities dealers. If a controlled foreign corporation is a licensed securities dealer, only the securities that it has identified as held for investment in accordance with the provisions of section 475(b) or section 1236 will be considered to be property held for investment or speculation under this section. A licensed securities dealer is a controlled foreign corporation that is both a securities dealer, as defined in section 475, and a regular dealer, as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section, and that is either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Registered as a securities dealer under section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or as a Government securities dealer under section 15C(a) of such Act; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Licensed or authorized in the country in which it is chartered, incorporated, or organized to purchase and sell securities from or to customers who are residents of that country. The conduct of such securities activities must be subject to bona fide regulation, including appropriate reporting, monitoring, and prudential (including capital adequacy) requirements, by a securities regulatory authority in that country that regularly enforces compliance with such requirements and prudential standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Hedging transactions. A bona fide hedging transaction with respect to dealer property shall be treated as a transaction in dealer property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of paragraphs (a)(4)(ii), (iv) and (v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> CFC1 and CFC2 are related controlled foreign corporations (within the meaning of section 954(d)(3)) located in Countries F and G, respectively. CFC1 and CFC2 regularly purchase securities from and sell securities to customers who are not related persons with respect to CFC1 or CFC2 (within the meaning of section 954(d)(3)) in the ordinary course of their businesses and regularly and actively hold themselves out as being willing to, and in fact do, enter into either side of options, forward contracts, or other financial instruments. CFC1 uses securities that are traded in securities markets in Country G to hedge positions that it enters into with customers located in Country F. CFC1 is not a member of a securities exchange in Country G, so it purchases such securities from CFC2 and unrelated persons that are registered as securities dealers in Country G and that are members of Country G securities exchanges. Such hedging transactions qualify as bona fide hedging transactions under paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Transactions that CFC1 and CFC2 enter into with each other do not affect the determination of whether they are regular dealers. Because CFC1 and CFC2 regularly purchase securities from and sell securities to

customers who are not related persons within the meaning of section 954(d)(3) in the ordinary course of their businesses and regularly and actively hold themselves out as being willing to, and in fact do, enter into either side of options, forward contracts, or other financial instruments, however, they qualify as regular dealers in such property within the meaning of paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section. Moreover, because CFC1 purchases securities from CFC2 as bona fide hedging transactions with respect to dealer property, the securities are dealer property under paragraph (a)(4)(v)(C) of this section. Similarly, because CFC2 sells securities to CFC1 in the ordinary course of its business as a dealer, the securities are dealer property under paragraph (a)(4)(v)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> CFC is a controlled foreign corporation located in Country B. CFC serves as the currency coordination center for the controlled group, aggregating currency risks incurred by the group and entering into hedging transactions that transfer those risks outside of the group. CFC regularly and actively holds itself out as being willing to, and in fact does, enter into either side of options, forward contracts, or other financial instruments with other members of the same controlled group. CFC hedges risks arising from such transactions by entering into transactions with persons who are not related persons (within the meaning of section 954(d)(3)) with respect to CFC. However, CFC does not regularly and actively hold itself out as being willing to, and does not, enter into either side of transactions with unrelated persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> CFC is not a regular dealer in property under paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section and its options, forwards, and other financial instruments are not dealer property within the meaning of paragraph (a)(4)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Debt instrument. The term debt instrument includes bonds, debentures, notes, certificates, accounts receivable, and other evidences of indebtedness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Special rules applicable to distributive share of partnership income--(i) [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certain other exceptions applicable to foreign personal holding company income. To determine the extent to which a controlled foreign corporation's distributive share of an item of income of a partnership is foreign personal holding company income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The exceptions contained in section 954(c) that are based on whether the controlled foreign corporation is engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business, including section 954(c)(2) and paragraphs (b)(2) and (6), (e)(1)(ii) and (3)(ii), (iii) and (iv), (f)(1)(ii), (g)(2)(ii), and (h)(3)(ii) of this section, shall apply only if any such exception would have applied to exclude the income from foreign personal holding company income if the controlled foreign corporation had earned the income directly, determined by taking into account only the activities of, and property owned by, the partnership and not the separate activities or property of the controlled foreign corporation or any other person;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A controlled foreign corporation's distributive share of partnership income will not be excluded from foreign personal holding company income under the exception contained in section 954(h) unless the controlled foreign corporation is an eligible controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 954(h)(2) (taking into account the income of the controlled foreign corporation and any partnerships or other qualified business units, within the meaning of section 989(a), of the controlled foreign corporation, including the controlled foreign corporation's distributive share of partnership income) and the partnership, of which the controlled foreign corporation is a partner, generates qualified banking or financing income within the meaning of section 954(h)(3) (taking into account only the income of the partnership);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A controlled foreign corporation's distributive share of partnership income will not be excluded from foreign personal holding company income under the exception contained in section 954(i) unless the controlled foreign corporation is a qualifying insurance company, as defined in section 953(e)(3), and the income of the partnership would have been qualified insurance income, as defined in section 954(i)(2), if received by the controlled foreign corporation directly. See Sec. 1.952-1(g)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The application of paragraph (a)(5)(ii) is demonstrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. B Corp, a Country C corporation, is a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 957(a). B Corp is an 80 percent partner of RKS Partnership, a Country D partnership whose principal office is located in Country D. RKS Partnership is a qualified business unit of B Corp, within the meaning of section 989(a). B Corp,

including income earned through RKS Partnership, derives more than 70 percent of its gross income directly from the active and regular conduct of a lending or finance business, within the meaning of section 954(h)(4), from transactions in various countries with customers which are not related persons. Thus, B Corp is predominantly engaged in the active conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business within the meaning of section 954(h)(2)(A)(i). B Corp conducts substantial activity with respect to such business within the meaning of section 954(h)(2)(A)(ii). RKS Partnership derives more than 30 percent of its income from the active and regular conduct of a lending or finance business, within the meaning of section 954(h)(4), from transactions with customers which are not related persons and which are located solely within the home country of RKS Partnership, Country D. B Corp's distributive share of RKS Partnership's income from its lending or finance business will satisfy the special rule for income derived in the active conduct of banking, financing, or similar business of section 954(h). B Corp is an eligible controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 954(h)(2) and RKS Partnership generates qualified banking or financing income within the meaning of section 954(h)(3). B Corp does not have any foreign personal holding company income with respect to its distributive share of RKS Partnership income attributable to its lending or finance business income earned in Country D.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. D Corp, a Country F corporation, is a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 957(a). D Corp is a qualifying insurance company, within the meaning of section 953(e)(3), that is engaged in the business of issuing life insurance contracts. D Corp has reserves of $100x, all of which are allocable to exempt contracts, and $10x of surplus, which is equal to 10 percent of the reserves allocable to exempt contracts. D Corp contributed the $100x of reserves and $10x of surplus to DJ Partnership in exchange for a 40-percent partnership interest. DJ Partnership is an entity organized under the laws of Country G and is treated as a partnership under the laws of Country G and Country F. DJ Partnership earns $30x of investment income during the taxable year that is received from persons who are not related persons with respect to D Corp, within the meaning of section 954(d)(3). D Corp's distributive share of this investment income is $12x. This income is treated as earned by D Corp in Country F under the tax laws of Country F and meets the definition of exempt insurance income in section 953(e)(1). This $12x of investment income would be qualified insurance income, under section 954(i)(2), if D Corp had received the income directly, because the $110x invested by D Corp in DJ Partnership is equal to D Corp's reserves allocable to exempt contracts under section 954(i)(2)(A) and allowable surplus under section 954(i)(2)(B)(ii). Thus, D Corp's distributive share of DJ Partnership's income will be excluded from foreign personal holding company income under section 954(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Effective date. This paragraph (a)(5) applies to taxable years of a controlled foreign corporation beginning on or after July 23, 2002.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Dividends, interest, rents, royalties, and annuities--(1) In general. Foreign personal holding company income includes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Foreign personal holding company income includes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Dividends, except certain dividends from related persons as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section and distributions of previously taxed income under section 959(b);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Interest, except export financing interest as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section and certain interest received from related persons as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Rents and royalties, except certain rents and royalties received from related persons as described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section and rents and royalties derived in the active conduct of a trade or business as defined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Annuities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exclusion of certain export financing interest--(i) In general. Foreign personal holding company income does not include interest that is export financing interest. The term export financing interest means interest that is derived in the conduct of a banking business and is export financing interest as defined in section 904(d)(2)(G). Solely for purposes of determining whether interest is export financing interest, property is treated as manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted in the United States if it is so treated under Sec. 1.927(a)-1T(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Foreign personal holding company income does not include interest that is export financing interest. The term export financing interest means interest that is derived in the conduct of a banking business and is export financing interest as defined in section 904(d)(2)(G). Solely for purposes of determining whether interest is export financing interest, property is treated as manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted in the United States if it is so treated under Sec. 1.927(a)-1T(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exceptions. Export financing interest does not include income from related party factoring that is treated as interest under section 864(d)(1) or (6) after the application of section 864(d)(7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Conduct of a banking business. For purposes of this section, export financing interest is considered derived in the conduct of a banking business if, in

connection with the financing from which the interest is derived, the corporation, through its own officers or staff of employees, engages in all the activities in which banks customarily engage in issuing and servicing a loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> DS, a domestic corporation, manufactures property in the United States. In addition to selling inventory (property described in section 1221(1)), DS occasionally sells depreciable equipment it manufactures for use in its trade or business, which is property described in section 1221(2). Less than 50 percent of the fair market value, determined in accordance with section 904(d)(2)(G), of each item of inventory or equipment sold by DS is attributable to products imported into the United States. CFC, a controlled foreign corporation with respect to which DS is a related person (within the meaning of section 954(d)(3)), provides loans described in section 864(d)(6) to unrelated persons for the purchase of property from DS. This property is purchased exclusively for use or consumption outside the United States and outside CFC's country of incorporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If, in issuing and servicing loans made with respect to purchases from DS of depreciable equipment used in its trade or business, which is property described in section 1221(2) in the hands of DS, CFC engages in all the activities in which banks customarily engage in issuing and servicing loans, the interest accrued from these loans would be export financing interest meeting the requirements of this paragraph (b)(2) and, thus, not included in foreign personal holding company income. However, interest from the loans made with respect to purchases from DS of property that is inventory in the hands of DS cannot be export financing interest because it is treated as income from a trade or service receivable under section 864(d)(6) and the exception under section 864(d)(7) does not apply. Thus the interest from loans made with respect to this inventory is included in foreign personal holding company income under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> DS, a domestic corporation, wholly owns two controlled foreign corporations organized in Country A, CFC1 and CFC2. CFC1 purchases from DS property that DS manufactures in the United States. CFC1 uses the purchased property as a component part of property that CFC1 manufactures in Country A within the meaning of Sec. 1.954-3(a)(4). CFC2 provides loans described in section 864(d)(6) to unrelated persons in Country A for the purchase of the property that CFC1 manufactures in Country A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The interest accrued from the loans by CFC2 is not export financing interest as defined in section 904(d)(2)(G) because the property sold by CFC1 is not manufactured in the United States under Sec. 1.927(a)-1T(c). No portion of the interest is export financing interest as defined in this paragraph (b)(2). The full amount of the interest is, therefore, included in foreign personal holding company income under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Treatment of tax exempt interest. For taxable years of a controlled foreign corporation beginning after March 3, 1997, foreign personal holding company income includes all interest income, including interest that is described in section 103 (see Sec. 1.952-2(c)(1)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Exclusion of dividends or interest from related persons--(i) In general--(A) Corporate payor.

For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4), if a partnership with one or more corporate partners makes a payment of interest, a corporate partner will be treated as the payor of the interest--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the interest payment gives rise to a partnership item of deduction under the Internal Revenue Code or Income Tax Regulations, to the extent that the item of deduction is allocable to the corporate partner under section 704(b); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the interest payment does not give rise to a partnership item of deduction under the Internal Revenue Code or Income Tax Regulations, to the extent that a partnership item reasonably related to the payment would be allocated to that partner under an

existing allocation under the partnership agreement (made pursuant to section 704(b)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exceptions--(A) Dividends. Dividends are excluded from foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (b)(4) only to the extent that they are paid out of earnings and profits that are earned or accumulated during a period in which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The stock on which dividends are paid with respect to which the exclusion is claimed was owned by the recipient controlled foreign corporation directly, or indirectly through a chain of one or more subsidiaries each of which meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each of the requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section is satisfied or, to the extent earned or accumulated during a taxable year of the related foreign corporation ending on or before December 31, 1962, during a period in which the payor was a related corporation as to the controlled foreign corporation and the other requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section were substantially satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> This paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) is illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. A, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of B, a corporation created and organized under the laws of Country Y, and C, a corporation created and organized under the laws of Country X. The taxable year of each of the corporations is the calendar year. In Year 1, B earns $100 of income from the sale of products in Country Y that it manufactured in Country Y. C had no earnings and profits in Year 1. On January 1 of Year 2, A contributes all of the stock of B and C to Newco, a Country Y corporation, in exchange for all of the stock of Newco. Neither B nor C earns any income in Year 2, but at the end of Year 2 B distributes the $100 accumulated earnings and profits to Newco. Newco's income from the distribution, $100, is foreign personal holding company income because the earnings and profits distributed by B were not earned or accumulated during a period in which the stock of B was owned by Newco and in which each of the requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section was satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Interest paid out of adjusted foreign base company income or insurance income--(1) In general. Interest may not be excluded from the foreign personal holding company income of the recipient under this paragraph (b)(4) to the extent that the deduction for the interest is allocated under Sec. 1.954-1(a)(4) and (c) to the payor's adjusted gross foreign base company income (as defined in Sec. 1.954-1(a)(3)), adjusted gross insurance income (as defined in Sec. 1.954-1(a)(6)), or any other category of income included in the computation of subpart F income under section 952(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rule for corporations that are both recipients and payors of interest. If a controlled foreign corporation is both a recipient and payor of interest, the interest that is received will be characterized before the interest that is paid. In addition, the amount of interest paid or accrued, directly or indirectly, by the controlled foreign corporation to a related person (as defined in section 954(d)(3)) shall be offset against and eliminate any interest received or accrued, directly or indirectly, by the controlled foreign corporation from that related person. In a case in which the controlled foreign corporation pays or accrues interest to a related person, as defined in section 954(d)(3), and also receives or accrues interest indirectly from the related person, the smallest interest payment is eliminated and the amounts of all other interest payments are reduced by the amount of the smallest interest payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Coordination with sections 864(d) and 881(c). Income of a controlled foreign corporation that is treated as interest under section 864(d)(1) or (6), or that is portfolio interest, as defined by section 881(c), is not excluded from foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(3)(A)(i) and this paragraph (b)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Trade or business requirement. Except as otherwise provided under this paragraph (b)(4), the principles of section 367(a) apply for purposes of determining whether the payor has a trade or business in its country of incorporation and whether its assets are used in that trade or business. Property purchased or produced for use in a trade or business is not considered used in a trade or business before it is placed in service or after it is retired from service as determined in accordance with the principles of sections 167 and 168.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Substantial assets test. A substantial part of the assets of the payor will be considered to be used in a trade or

business located in the payor's country of incorporation for a taxable year only if the average value of the payor's assets for such year that are used in the trade or business and are located in such country equals more than 50 percent of the average value of all the assets of the payor (including assets not used in a trade or business). The average value of assets for the taxable year is determined by averaging the values of assets at the close of each quarter of the taxable year. The value of assets is determined under paragraph (b)(4)(v) of this section, and the location of assets used in a trade or business of the payor is determined under paragraphs (b)(4)(vi) through (xi) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Valuation of assets. For purposes of determining whether a substantial part of the assets of the payor are used in a trade or business in its country of incorporation, the value of assets shall be their fair market value (not reduced by liabilities), which, in the absence of affirmative evidence to the contrary, shall be deemed to be their adjusted basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Location of tangible property--(A) In general. Tangible property (other than inventory and similar property as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section, and dealer property as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(v) of this section) used in a trade or business is considered located in the country in which it is physically located.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general.

For this purpose, the country in which the activities connected to the use or exploitation of the property are conducted is the country in which the expenses associated with these activities are incurred. Expenses incurred in connection with the use or exploitation of an item of intangible property are included in the computation provided by this paragraph (b)(4) if they would be deductible under section 162 or includible in inventory costs or the cost of goods sold if the payor were a domestic corporation. If the payor conducts such activities through an agent or independent contractor, then the expenses incurred by the payor with respect to the agent or independent contractor shall be deemed to be incurred by the payor in the country in which the expenses of the agent or independent contractor were incurred by the agent or independent contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Intangible property (other than inventory and similar property as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section, dealer property as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(v) of this section, and debt instruments) is considered located entirely in the payor's country of incorporation for a quarter of the taxable year only if the payor conducts all of its activities in connection with the use or exploitation of the property in that country during that entire quarter. For this purpose, the country in which the activities connected to the use or exploitation of the property are conducted is the country in which the expenses associated with these activities are incurred. Expenses incurred in connection with the use or exploitation of an item of intangible property are included in the computation provided by this paragraph (b)(4) if they would be deductible under section 162 or includible in inventory costs or the cost of goods sold if the payor were a domestic corporation. If the payor conducts such activities through an agent or independent contractor, then the expenses incurred by the payor with respect to the agent or independent contractor shall be deemed to be incurred by the payor in the country in which the expenses of the agent or independent contractor were incurred by the agent or independent contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Exception for property located in part in the payor's country of incorporation. If the payor conducts its activities in connection with the use or exploitation of an item of intangible property, including goodwill (other than inventory and similar property, dealer property and debt instruments) during a quarter of the taxable year both in its country of incorporation and elsewhere, then the value of the intangible considered located in the payor's country of incorporation during that quarter is a percentage of the value of the item as of the close of the quarter. That percentage equals the ratio that the expenses incurred by the payor (described in paragraph (b)(4)(vii)(A) of this section) during the entire quarter by reason of activities that are connected with the use or exploitation of the item of intangible property and are conducted in the payor's country of incorporation bear to all expenses incurred by the payor during the entire quarter by reason of all such activities worldwide.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Location of inventory and dealer property--(A) In general. Inventory and similar property, as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section, and

dealer property, as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(v) of this section, are considered located entirely in the payor's country of incorporation for a quarter of the taxable year only if the payor conducts all of its activities in connection with the production and sale, or purchase and resale, of such property in its country of incorporation during that entire quarter. If the payor conducts such activities through an agent or independent contractor, then the location of such activities is the place in which they are conducted by the agent or independent contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general.

If the payor conducts such activities through an agent or independent contractor, then the location of such activities is the place in which they are conducted by the agent or independent contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Inventory and dealer property located in part in the payor's country of incorporation. If the payor conducts its activities in connection with the production and sale, or purchase and resale, of inventory or similar property or dealer property during a quarter of the taxable year both in its country of incorporation and elsewhere, then the value of the inventory or similar property or dealer property considered located in the payor's country of incorporation during each quarter is a percentage of the value of the inventory or similar property or dealer property as of the close of the quarter. That percentage equals the ratio that the costs and expenses incurred by the payor during the entire quarter by reason of activities connected with the production and sale, or purchase and resale, of inventory or similar property or dealer property that are conducted in the payor's country of incorporation bear to all costs or expenses incurred by the payor during the entire quarter by reason of all such activities worldwide. A cost incurred in connection with the production and sale or purchase and resale of inventory or similar property or dealer property is included in this computation if it--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Would be included in inventory costs or otherwise capitalized with respect to inventory or similar property or dealer property under section 61, 263A, 471, or 472 if the payor were a domestic corporation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Would be deductible under section 162 if the payor were a domestic corporation and is definitely related to gross income derived from such property (but not to all classes of gross income derived by the payor) under the principles of Sec. 1.861-8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Location of debt instruments. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4), debt instruments, other than debt instruments that are inventory or similar property (as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section) or dealer property (as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(v) of this section) are considered to be used in a trade or business only if they arise from the sale of inventory or similar property or dealer property by the payor or from the rendition of services by the payor in the ordinary course of a trade or business of the payor, and only until such time as interest is required to be charged under section 482. Debt instruments that arise from the sale of inventory or similar property or dealer property during a quarter are treated as having the same location, proportionately, as the inventory or similar property or dealer property held during that quarter. Debt instruments arising from the rendition of services in the ordinary course of a trade or business are considered located on a proportionate basis in the countries in which the services to which they relate are performed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Treatment of certain stock interests. Stock in a controlled foreign corporation (lower-tier corporation) that is incorporated in the same country as the payor and that is more than 50-percent owned, directly or indirectly, by the payor within the meaning of section 958(a) shall be considered located in the payor's country of incorporation and, solely for purposes of section 954(c)(3), used in a trade or business of the payor in proportion to the value of the assets of the lower-tier corporation that are used in a trade or business in the country of incorporation.

However, such an organization will be considered substantial in relation to the amount of rents if active leasing expenses, as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, equal or exceed 25 percent of the adjusted leasing profit, as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section. In addition, for purposes of aircraft or vessels leased in foreign commerce, an organization will be considered substantial if active leasing expenses, as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, equal or exceed 10 percent of the adjusted leasing profit, as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section. For purposes of paragraphs (c)(1)(iv) and (c)(2) of this section and Sec. 1.956-2(b)(1)(vi), the term aircraft or vessels includes component parts, such as engines that are leased separately from an aircraft or vessel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Active leasing expenses. The term active leasing expenses means the deductions incurred by an organization of the lessor in a foreign country that are properly allocable to rental income and that would be allowable under section 162 to the lessor if it were a domestic corporation, other than--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Deductions for compensation for personal services rendered by shareholders of, or related persons (as defined in section 954(d)(3)) with respect to, the lessor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Deductions for rents paid or accrued;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Deductions that, although generally allowable under section 162, would be specifically allowable to the lessor (if the lessor were a domestic corporation) under any section of the Internal Revenue Code other than section 162; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Deductions for payments made to agents or independent contractors with respect to the leased property other than payments for insurance, utilities and other expenses for like services, or for capitalized repairs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Adjusted leasing profit.

For purposes of paragraphs (c)(1)(iv) and (c)(2)(ii) of this section, an aircraft or vessel is considered to be leased in foreign commerce if the aircraft or vessel is used in foreign commerce and is used predominantly outside the United States. An aircraft or vessel is considered to be used in foreign commerce if it is used for the transportation of property or passengers between a port (or airport) in the United States and a port (or airport) in a foreign country or between foreign ports (or airports). An aircraft or vessel will be considered to be used predominantly outside the United States if more than 50 percent of the miles traversed during the taxable year in the use of the aircraft or vessel are traversed outside the United States or if the aircraft or vessel is located outside the United States more than 50 percent of the time during the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Leases acquired by the CFC lessor.

However, if any person is claiming a benefit with respect to an acquired lease pursuant to section 921 or 114 of the Internal Revenue Code or section 101(d) of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, (Pub. L. 108-357 (118 Stat. 1418) (2004)), the rents from such lease, notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(6) and (c) of this section, are ineligible for the exception in section 954(c)(2)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Marketing of leases. Paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section can apply whether a lessor is engaged in the marketing of leases as a form of financing or is engaged in marketing the property as such, and regardless of whether the lease is classified as a finance lease or an operating lease for financial accounting purposes, so long as such lease is treated as a lease for Federal income tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The application of this paragraph (c) is illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Controlled foreign corporation A is regularly engaged in the production of office machines which it sells or leases to others and services. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the rental income of Corporation A from these leases is derived in the active conduct of a trade or business for purposes of section 954(c)(2)(A).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Controlled foreign corporation D purchases motor vehicles which it leases to others. In the conduct of its short-term leasing of such vehicles in foreign country X, Corporation D owns a large number of motor vehicles in country X which it services and repairs, leases motor vehicles to customers on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis, maintains offices and service facilities in country X from which to lease and service such vehicles, and maintains therein a sizable staff of its own administrative, sales, and service personnel. Corporation D also leases in country X on a long-term basis, generally for a term of one year, motor vehicles that it owns. Under the terms of the long-term leases, Corporation D is required to repair and service, during the term of the lease, the leased motor vehicles without cost to the lessee. By the maintenance in country X of office, sales, and service facilities and its complete staff of administrative, sales, and service personnel, Corporation D maintains and operates an organization therein that is regularly engaged in the business of marketing and servicing the motor vehicles that are leased. The deductions incurred by such organization satisfy the 25-percent test of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section; thus, such organization is substantial in relation to the rents Corporation D receives from leasing the motor vehicles. Therefore, under paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, such rents are derived in the active conduct of a trade or business for purposes of section 954(c)(2)(A).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Controlled foreign corporation E owns a complex of apartment buildings that it has acquired by purchase. Corporation E engages a real estate management firm to lease the apartments, manage the buildings and pay over the net rents to Corporation E. The rental income of Corporation E from such leases is not derived in the active conduct of a trade or business for purposes of section 954(c)(2)(A).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Controlled foreign corporation F acquired by purchase a twenty-story office building in a foreign country, three floors of which it occupies and the rest of which it leases. Corporation F acts as rental agent for the leasing of offices in the building and employs a substantial staff to perform other management and maintenance functions. Under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the rents received by Corporation F from such leasing operations are derived in the active conduct of a trade or business for purposes of section 954(c)(2)(A).</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Controlled foreign corporation G owns equipment that it ordinarily uses to perform contracts in foreign countries to drill oil wells. For occasional brief and irregular periods it is unable to obtain contracts requiring immediate performance sufficient to employ all such equipment. During such a period it sometimes leases such idle equipment temporarily. After the expiration of such temporary leasing of the property, Corporation G continues the use of such equipment in the performance of its own drilling contracts. Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, rents Corporation G receives from such leasing of idle equipment are derived in the active conduct of a trade or business for purposes of section 954(c)(2)(A).</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that controlled foreign corporation D purchases aircraft which it leases to others. If Corporation D incurs active leasing expenses, as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, equal to or in excess of 10 percent of its adjusted leasing profit, as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section, the organization maintained and operated by Corporation D in country X is substantial in relation to the amount of rents Corporation D receives from leasing the aircraft. Therefore, under paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, such rents are derived in the active

conduct of a trade or business for purposes of section 954(c)(2)(A). If a particular aircraft subject to lease was not leased by the lessee corporation in foreign commerce, for example, because 50 percent or less of the miles during the taxable year were traversed outside the United States and the aircraft was located in the United States for 50 percent or more of the taxable year, Corporation D is not prevented from otherwise showing that it actively carries on a trade or business with regard to the rents derived from that aircraft under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, based on its facts and circumstances or a showing that active leasing expenses equal or exceed 25 percent of the adjusted leasing profit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Excluded royalties--(1) Active conduct of a trade or business.

For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, whether an organization in a foreign country is substantial in relation to the amount of royalties is determined based on all of the facts and circumstances. However, such an organization will be considered substantial in relation to the amount of royalties if active licensing expenses, as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, equal or exceed 25 percent of the adjusted licensing profit, as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Active licensing expenses. The term active licensing expenses means the deductions incurred by an organization of the licensor in a foreign country that are properly allocable to royalty income and that would be allowable under section 162 to the licensor if it were a domestic corporation, other than--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Deductions for compensation for personal services rendered by shareholders of, or related persons (as defined in section 954(d)(3)) with respect to, the licensor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Deductions for royalties paid or incurred;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Deductions that, although generally allowable under section 162, would be specifically allowable to the licensor (if the controlled foreign corporation were a domestic corporation) under any section of the Internal Revenue Code other than section 162; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Deductions for payments made to agents or independent contractors with respect to the licensed property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Adjusted licensing profit.

The application of this paragraph (d) is illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Controlled foreign corporation A, through its own staff of employees, owns and operates a research facility in foreign country X. At the research facility, employees of Corporation A who are scientists, engineers, and technicians regularly perform experiments, tests, and other technical activities, that ultimately result in the issuance of

patents that it sells or licenses. Under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, royalties received by Corporation A for the privilege of using patented rights that it develops as a result of such research activity are derived in the active conduct of a trade or business for purposes of section 954(c)(2)(A), but only so long as the licensor is regularly engaged in the development, creation or production of, or in the acquisition of and addition of substantial value to, property of such kind.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume that Corporation A in Example 1, in addition to receiving royalties for the use of patents that it develops, receives royalties for the use of patents that it acquires by purchase and licenses to others without adding any value thereto. Corporation A generally consummates royalty agreements on such purchased patents as the result of inquiries received by it from prospective licensees when the fact becomes known in the business community, as a result of the filing of a patent, advertisements in trade journals, announcements, and contacts by employees of Corporation A, that Corporation A has acquired rights under a patent and is interested in licensing its rights. Corporation A does not, however, maintain and operate an organization in a foreign country that is regularly engaged in the business of marketing the purchased patents. The royalties received by Corporation A for the use of the purchased patents are not derived in the active conduct of a trade or business for purposes of section 954(c)(2)(A).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Controlled foreign corporation B receives royalties for the use of patents that it acquires by purchase. The primary business of Corporation B, operated on a regular basis, consists of licensing patents that it has purchased raw from inventors and, through the efforts of a substantial staff of employees consisting of scientists, engineers, and technicians, made susceptible to commercial application. For example, Corporation B, after purchasing patent rights covering a chemical process, designs specialized production equipment required for the commercial adaptation of the process and, by so doing, substantially increases the value of the patent. Under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, royalties received by Corporation B from the use of such patent are derived in the active conduct of a trade or business for purposes of section 954(c)(2)(A).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Controlled foreign corporation C receives royalties for the use of a patent that it developed through its own staff of employees at its facility in country X. Corporation C has developed no other patents. It does not regularly employ a staff of scientists, engineers or technicians to create new products to be patented. Further, it does not purchase and license patents developed by others to which it has added substantial value. The royalties received by Corporation C are not derived from the active conduct of a trade or business for purposes of section 954(c)(2)(A).</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Controlled foreign corporation D finances independent persons in the development of patented items in return for an ownership interest in such items from which it derives a percentage of royalty income, if any, subsequently derived from the use by others of the protected right. Corporation D also attempts to increase its royalty income from such patents by contacting prospective licensees and rendering to licensees advice that is intended to promote the use of the patented property. Corporation D does not, however, maintain and operate an organization in a foreign country that is regularly engaged in the business of marketing the patents. Royalties received by Corporation D for the use of such patents are not derived in the active conduct of a trade or business for purposes of section 954(c)(2)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Certain property transactions--(1) In general--(i) Inclusions.

Section 1.954-1(c)(1)(ii) provides for the treatment of losses in excess of gains from the sale or exchange of property described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Dual character property. Property may, in part, constitute property that gives rise to certain income as described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section or, in part, constitute property that does not give rise to any income as described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. However, property that is described in paragraph (e)(1)(i)(B) of this section cannot be dual character property. Dual character property must be treated as two separate properties for purposes of paragraph (e)(2) or (3) of this section. Accordingly, the sale or exchange of such dual character property will give rise to gain or loss that in part must be included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under paragraph (e)(2) or (3) of this section, and in part is excluded from such computation. Gain or loss from the disposition of dual character property must be bifurcated under this paragraph (e)(1)(iv) pursuant to the method that most reasonably reflects the relative uses of the property. Reasonable methods may include comparisons in terms of gross income generated or the physical division of the property. In the case of real property, the physical division of the property will in most cases be the most reasonable method available. For example, if a controlled foreign corporation owns an office building, uses 60 percent of the building in its trade or business, and rents out the other 40 percent, then 40 percent of the gain recognized on the disposition of the property would reasonably be treated as gain that is included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (e)(1). This paragraph (e)(1)(iv) addresses the contemporaneous use of property for dual purposes.

The term qualified active sale means the sale of commodities in the active conduct of a commodities business as a producer, processor, merchant or handler of commodities if substantially all of the controlled foreign corporation's business is as an active producer, processor, merchant or handler of commodities. The sale of commodities held by a controlled foreign corporation other than in its capacity as an active producer, processor, merchant or handler of commodities is not a qualified active sale.

To protect itself against increases in the price of aluminum used in the machinery it manufactures, CFC1 enters into futures purchase contracts for the delivery of aluminum. These futures purchase contracts are bona fide hedging transactions. As CFC1 purchases aluminum and component parts containing significant amounts of aluminum in the spot market for use in its business, it closes out an equivalent amount of aluminum futures purchase contracts by entering into offsetting aluminum futures sales contracts. The aluminum futures purchase contracts are qualified hedging transactions as defined in paragraph (f)(2)(v)(A) of this section.

These forward purchase contracts are bona fide hedging transactions. As CFC2 purchases aviation fuel in the spot market for use in its business, it closes out an equivalent amount of its forward purchase contracts for cash pursuant to a contractual provision that permits CFC2 to terminate the contract and make or receive a one-time payment representing the contract's fair market value. The aviation fuel forward purchase contracts are qualified hedging transactions as defined in paragraph (f)(2)(v)(A) of this section. Accordingly, any gain or loss on such aviation fuel forward purchase contracts is excluded from the computation of foreign personal holding company income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Effective date.

The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (g)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> CFC1 and CFC2 are controlled foreign corporations located in Country B, and are members of the same controlled

group. CFC1 is engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business that does not produce any subpart F income. CFC2 serves as the currency coordination center for the controlled group, aggregating currency risks incurred by the group and entering into hedging transactions that transfer those risks outside of the group. Pursuant to this arrangement, and to hedge the currency risk on a non-interest bearing receivable incurred by CFC1 in the normal course of its business, on Day 1 CFC1 enters into a forward contract to sell Japanese Yen to CFC2 in 30 days. Also on Day 1, CFC2 enters into a forward contract to sell Yen to unrelated Bank X on Day 30. CFC2 is not a regular dealer in Yen spot and forward contracts, and the Yen is not the functional currency for either CFC1 or CFC2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because the forward contract entered into by CFC1 to sell Yen hedges a transaction entered into in the normal course of CFC1's business that does not give rise to subpart F income, it qualifies as a bona fide hedging transaction as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section. Therefore, CFC1's foreign exchange gain or loss from that forward contract will not be treated as foreign personal holding company income or loss under this paragraph (g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Because the forward contract to purchase Yen was entered into by CFC2 in order to assume currency risks incurred by CFC1 it does not qualify as a bona fide hedging transaction, as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section.

The receivables have a face amount of $100, and after 30 days bear stated interest equal to at least 120 percent of the applicable Federal short-term rate (determined as of the date the receivables are acquired by FS). FS purchases the receivables from X for $95 on Day

1 and collects $100 plus stated interest from the obligor under the receivables on Day 40. Income (other than stated interest) derived by FS from the factored receivables is factoring income within the meaning of paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section and, therefore, is income equivalent to interest.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that, rather than collecting $100 plus stated interest from the obligor under the factored receivables on Day 40, FS sells the receivables to controlled foreign corporation Y on Day 15 for $97. Both the income derived by FS on the factored receivables and the income derived by Y (other than stated interest) on the receivables are factoring income within the meaning of paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section, and therefore, constitute income equivalent to interest.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that FS purchases the receivables from X for $98 on Day 30.

The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that it is anticipated that all principal will be paid by the obligor of the receivables by Day 30. Income derived by FS from this maturity factoring of the receivables is excluded from factoring income under paragraph (h)(4)(ii)(C) of this section and, therefore, does not give rise to income equivalent to interest.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that FS sells the factored receivables to Y for $99 on Day 45, at which time stated interest is accruing on the unpaid balance of $100. Because interest was accruing at the time Y acquired the receivables at a rate equal to at least 120 percent of the applicable Federal short-term rate, income derived by Y from the factored receivables is excluded from factoring income under paragraph (h)(4)(ii)(B) of this section and, therefore, does not give rise to income equivalent to interest.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. DP, a domestic corporation engaged in an integrated credit card business, owns all of the outstanding stock of FS, a controlled foreign corporation. On Day 1, individual A uses a credit card issued by DP to purchase shoes priced at $100 from X, a foreign corporation unrelated to DP, FS, or A. On Day 7, X transfers the receivable (which does not bear stated interest) arising from A's purchase to FS in exchange for $95. FS collects $100 from A on Day 45.

That expense is allocated and apportioned to, and reduces, subpart F income to the extent provided in section 954(b)(5) and Secs. 1.861-9T through 1.861-12T and 1.954-1(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 1994, CFC, a controlled foreign corporation with the

United States dollar as its functional currency, purchases at face value a 10-year debt instrument issued by Corporation A having a $100 principal amount and bearing a floating rate of interest set at LIBOR plus one percentage point payable on December 31st of each year. CFC subsequently determines that it would prefer receiving a fixed rate of return. Accordingly, on January 1, 1995, CFC enters into a 9-year interest rate swap agreement with Corporation B whereby Corporation B promises to pay CFC on December 31st of each year an amount equal to 10 percent on a notional principal amount of $100. In exchange, CFC promises to pay Corporation B an amount equal to LIBOR plus one percentage point on the notional principal amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On December 31, 1995, CFC receives $9 of interest income from Corporation A with respect to the debt instrument. On the same day, CFC receives a total of $10 from Corporation B and pays $9 to Corporation B with respect to the interest rate swap.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The $9 of interest income is foreign personal holding income under section 954(c)(1). Pursuant to Sec. 1.446-3(d), CFC recognizes $1 of swap income for its 1995 taxable year that is also foreign personal holding company income because it is income equivalent to interest under paragraph (h)(2)(i)(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> CFC, a controlled foreign corporation, purchases commodity X on the spot market for $100 and, contemporaneously, enter into a 3-month forward contract to sell commodity X for $104, a price set by the forward market.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Assuming that substantially all of CFC's expected return is attributable to the time value of the net investment, as described in section 1258(c)(1), the transaction is a conversion transaction under section 1258(c). Accordingly, any gain treated as ordinary income under section 1258(a) will be foreign personal holding company income because it is income equivalent to interest under paragraph (h)(2)(i)(E) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Effective/applicability date. The last two sentences of paragraph (c)(2)(ii), and paragraphs (c)(2)(v) through (vii) and (c)(3) Example 6 of this section apply to taxable years of controlled foreign corporations beginning on or after May 2, 2006, and for taxable years of United States shareholders with or within which such taxable years of the controlled foreign corporations end. Taxpayers may elect to apply the last two sentences of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) and paragraphs (c)(2)(v) through (vii) to taxable years of controlled foreign corporations beginning after December 31, 2004, and for taxable years of United States shareholders with or within which such taxable years of the controlled foreign corporations end. If an election is made to apply Sec. 1.956-2(b)(1)(vi) to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2004, then the election must also be made for paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) and (c)(2)(v) through (vii) of this section.
