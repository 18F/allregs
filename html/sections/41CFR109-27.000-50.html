An example is office supplies, purchased from a commercial vendor, that are needed for immediate use instead of purchasing in bulk for future use, storing in warehouses, and issuing to customers by use of a requisitioning system. Systems contracting and just-in-time contracting are synonymous.</p><p class="depth2">Subpart 109	27.1_Stock Replenishment</p>
