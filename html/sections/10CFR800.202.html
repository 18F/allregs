Costs incurred by the borrower prior to the effective date of the loan agreement, and allowable under Sec. 800.200, may be credited toward the borrower's share of costs if, in DOE's judgment, they were primarily related to the bid or proposal, but shall not be reimbursed from the loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The borrower shall make periodic reports regarding the bid or proposal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The borrower shall maintain good standing under Federal, State and local laws and regulations applicable to the conduct of its business, including current payment of all taxes, fees and other charges and all requisite licenses and other governmental authorization necessary for the continued operation of the business throughout the term of the loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The borrower shall remain a minority business enterprise throughout the term of the loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The borrower shall return funds disbursed, but not required together with accrued interest thereon, to DOE, or to the servicing agent, if applicable, when its bid or proposal is ready for submission.
