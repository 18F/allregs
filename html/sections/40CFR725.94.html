                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Claims applicable to the period prior to commencement of  manufacture or import for general commercial use--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> MCAN, TME, Tier I  certification, and Tier II exemption request requirements. Any person  who submits a MCAN, TME, Tier I certification, or Tier II exemption  request should strictly limit confidentiality claims to that information  which is confidential and proprietary to the business.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If any information in the submission is claimed as confidential  business information, the submitter must substantiate each claim by  submitting written answers to the questions in paragraphs (c), (d), and  (e) of this section at the time the person submits the information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the submitter does not provide written substantiation as  required in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the submission will be  considered incomplete and the review period will not begin in accordance  with Sec. 725.33.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> TERA requirements. Any person who submits a TERA, should  strictly limit confidentiality claims to that information which is  confidential and proprietary to the business. If any information in such  a submission is claimed as confidential business information, the  submitter must have available for each of those claims, and agree to  furnish to EPA upon request, written answers to the questions in  paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Claims applicable to the period after commencement of  manufacture or import for general commercial use. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a submitter  claimed portions of the microorganism identity confidential in the MCAN  and wants the identity to be listed on the confidential Inventory, the  claim must be reasserted and substantiated at the time the Notice of  Commencement (NOC) is submitted under Sec. 725.190. Otherwise, EPA will  list the specific microorganism identity on the public Inventory.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The submitter must substantiate the claim for confidentiality of  the microorganism identity by answering all of the questions in  paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) in this section. In addition, the following  questions must be answered:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> What harmful effects to the company's or institution's  competitive position, if any, would result if EPA publishes on the  Inventory the identity of the microorganism? How could a competitor use  such information given the fact that the identity of the microorganism  otherwise would appear on the TSCA Inventory with no link between the  microorganism and the company or institution? How substantial would the  harmful effects of disclosure be? What is the causal relationship  between the disclosure and the harmful effects?</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Has the identity of the microorganism been kept confidential to  the extent that competitors do not know it is being manufactured or  imported for general commercial use by anyone?</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> General questions. The following questions must be answered in  detail for each confidentiality claim:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For what period of time is a claim of confidentiality being  asserted? If the claim is to extend until a certain event   or point in time, indicate that event or time period. Explain why the  information should remain confidential until such point.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Briefly describe any physical or procedural restrictions within  the company or institution relating to the use and storage of the  information claimed as confidential. What other steps, if any, apply to  use or further disclosure of the information?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Has the information claimed as confidential been disclosed to  individuals outside of the company or institution? Will it be disclosed  to such persons in the future? If so, what restrictions, if any, apply  to use or further disclosure of the information?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Does the information claimed as confidential appear, or is it  referred to, in any of the following questions? If the answer is yes to  any of these questions, indicate where the information appears and  explain why it should nonetheless be treated as confidential.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Advertising or promotional materials for the microorganism or  the resulting end product?</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Material safety data sheets or other similar materials for the  microorganism or the resulting end product?</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Professional or trade publications?</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Any other media available to the public or to competitors?</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Patents?</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Local, State, or Federal agency public files?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Has EPA, another Federal agency, a Federal court, or a State  made any confidentiality determination regarding the information claimed  as confidential? If so, provide copies of such determinations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For each type of information claimed confidential, describe the  harm to the company's or institution's competitive position that would  result if this information were disclosed. Why would this harm be  substantial? How could a competitor use such information? What is the  causal connection between the disclosure and harm?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If EPA disclosed to the public the information claimed as  confidential, how difficult would it be for the competitor to enter the  market for the resulting product? Consider such constraints as capital  and marketing cost, specialized technical expertise, or unusual  processes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Microorganism identity and production method. If confidentiality  claims are asserted for the identity of the microorganism or information  on how the microorganism is produced, the following questions must be  answered:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Has the microorganism or method of production been patented in  the U.S. or elsewhere? If so, why is confidentiality necessary?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Does the microorganism leave the site of production or testing  in a form which is accessible to the public or to competitors? What is  the cost to a competitor, in time and money, to develop appropriate use  conditions? What factors facilitate or impede product analysis?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For each additional type of information claimed as confidential,  explain what harm would result from disclosure of each type of  information if the identity of the microorganism were to remain  confidential.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Health and safety studies of microorganisms. If confidentiality  claims are asserted for information in a health or safety study of a  microorganism, the following questions must be answered:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Would the disclosure of the information claimed confidential  reveal: confidential process information, or information unrelated to  the effects of the microorganism on health and the environment. Describe  the causal connection between the disclosure and harm.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Does the company or institution assert that disclosure of the  microorganism identity is not necessary to interpret any health and  safety studies which have been submitted? If so, explain how a less  specific identity would be sufficient to interpret the studies.</p>
