                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Description. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Swiss cheese, emmentaler cheese, is the food  prepared by the procedure set forth in paragraph (a)(3) of this section,  or by any other procedure which produces a finished cheese having the  same physical and chemical properties. It has holes or eyes developed  throughout the cheese. The minimum milkfat content is 43 percent by  weight of the solids and the maximum moisture content is 41 percent by  weight, as determined by the methods described in Sec. 133.5. The dairy  ingredients used may be pasteurized. Swiss cheese is at least 60 days  old.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If pasteurized dairy ingredients are used, the phenol equivalent  value of 0.25 gram of swiss cheese is not more than 3 micrograms as  determined by the method described in Sec. 133.5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this section may be added during the procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Optional ingredients. The following safe and suitable  ingredients may be used:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Dairy ingredients. Milk, nonfat milk, or cream, as defined in  Sec. 133.3, used alone or in combination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Clotting enzymes. Rennet and/or other clotting enzymes of  animal, plant, or microbial origin.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other optional ingredients. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Coloring.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Calcium chloride in an amount not more than 0.02 percent  (calculated as anhydrous calcium chloride) by weight of the dairy  ingredients, used as a coagulation aid.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Enzymes of animal, plant, or microbial origin, used in curing  or flavor development.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Antimycotic agents, the cumulative levels of which shall not  exceed good manufacturing practice, may be added to the surface of the  cheese.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Benzoyl peroxide or a mixture of benzoyl peroxide with potassium  alum, calcium sulfate, and magnesium carbonate used to bleach the dairy  ingredients. The weight of the benzoyl peroxide is not more than 0.002  percent of the weight of the milk being bleached, and the weight of the  potassium alum, calcium sulfate, and magnesium carbonate, singly or  combined, is not more than six times the weight of the benzoyl peroxide  used. If milk is bleached in this manner, vitamin A is added to the curd  in such quantity as to compensate for the vitamin A or its precursors  destroyed in the bleaching process, and artificial coloring is not used.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Hydrogen peroxide, followed by a sufficient quantity of  catalase preparation to eliminate the hydrogen peroxide. The weight of  the hydrogen peroxide shall not exceed 0.05 percent of the weight of the  milk and the weight of the catalase shall not exceed 20 parts per  million of the weight of the milk treated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Nomenclature. The name of the food is ``swiss cheese'', or  alternatively, ``emmentaler cheese''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Label declaration. Each of the ingredients used in the food  shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of  parts 101 and 130 of this chapter, except that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Enzymes of animal, plant, or microbial origin may be declared as  ``enzymes''; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The dairy ingredients may be declared, in descending order of  predominance, by the use of the terms ``milkfat and nonfat milk'' or  ``nonfat milk and milkfat'', as appropriate.
