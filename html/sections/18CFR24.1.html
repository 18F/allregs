The declaration shall give the name and post office  address of the person to whom correspondence in regard to it shall be  addressed, and shall be accompanied by:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A brief description of the proposed project and its purposes,  including such data as maximum height of the dams, a storage capacity  curve of the reservoir or reservoirs showing the maximum, average, and  minimum operating pool levels, the initial and ultimate installed  capacity of the project, the rated horsepower and head on the turbines,  and a curve of turbine discharge versus output at average and minimum  operating heads.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A general map (one tracing and three prints) of any  convenient size and scale, showing the stream or streams to be utilized  and the approximate location and the general plan of the project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Also a detailed map of the proposed project area showing all  Federal lands, and lands owned by States, if any, occupied by the  project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A profile of the river within the vicinity of the project  showing the location of the proposed project and any existing  improvements in the river.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A duration curve and hydrograph for the natural and proposed  regulated flows at the dam site. Furnish references to the published  stream flow records used and submit copies of any unpublished records  used in preparation of these curves.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A definite statement of the proposed method of utilizing  storage or pondage seasonally, weekly and daily, during periods of low  and normal flows after the plant is in operation and the system load has  grown to the extent that the capacity of the plant is required to meet  the load. For example, furnish:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Hydrographs covering a 10-day low water period showing the  natural flow of the stream and the effect thereon caused by operations  of the proposed power plant:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Similar hydrographs covering a 10-day period during which the  discharge of the stream approximates average recorded yearly flow, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Similar hydrographs covering a low water year using average  monthly flows.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A system load curve, both daily and monthly, and the position on  the load curve that the proposed project would have occupied had it been  in operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A proposed annual rule of operation for the storage reservoir or  reservoirs.
