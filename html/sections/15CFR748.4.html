                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> License applicant--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Export transactions. Only a person in the  United States may apply for a license to export items from the United  States. The applicant must be the exporter, who is the U.S. principal  party in interest with the authority to determine and control the  sending of items out of the United States, except for Encryption License  Arrangements (ELA) (see Sec. 750.7(d) of the EAR). See definition of  ``exporter'' in part 772 of the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Routed export transactions. The U.S. principal party in interest  or the duly authorized U.S. agent of the foreign principal party in  interest may   apply for a license to export items from the United States. Prior to  submitting an application, the agent that applies for a license on  behalf of the foreign principal party in interest must obtain a power of  attorney or other written authorization from the foreign principal party  in interest. See Sec. 758.3(b) and (d) of the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reexport transactions. The U.S. or foreign principal party in  interest, or the duly authorized U.S. agent of the foreign principal  party in interest, may apply for a license to reexport controlled items  from one country to another. Prior to submitting an application, an  agent that applies for a license on behalf of a foreign principal party  in interest must obtain a power-of-attorney or other written  authorization from the foreign principal party in interest, unless there  is a preexisting relationship by ownership, control, position of  responsibility or affiliation. See power-of-attorney requirements in  paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disclosure of parties on license applications and the power of  attorney--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Disclosure of parties. License applicants must disclose  the names and addresses of all parties to a transaction. When the  applicant is the U.S. agent of the foreign principal party in interest,  the applicant must disclose the fact of the agency relationship, and the  name and address of the agent's principal. If there is any doubt about  which persons should be named as parties to the transaction, the  applicant should disclose the names of all such persons and the  functions to be performed by each in Block 24 of the application. Note  that when the foreign principal party in interest is the ultimate  consignee or end-user, the name and address need not be repeated in  Block 24. See ``Parties to the transaction'' in Sec. 748.5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Power of attorney or other written authorization--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>  Requirement. An agent must obtain a power of attorney or other written  authorization from the principal party in interest, unless there is a  preexisting relationship by ownership, control, position of  responsibility or affiliation, prior to preparing or submitting an  application for a license, when acting as either:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> An agent, applicant, licensee and exporter for a foreign  principal party in interest in a routed transaction; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> An agent who prepares an application for export on behalf of a  U.S. principal party in interest who is the actual applicant, licensee  and exporter in an export transaction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Application. Block 7 of the application (documents on file with  applicant) must be marked ``other'' and Block 24 (Additional  information) must be marked ``748.4(b)(2)'' to indicate that the power  of attorney or other written authorization is on file with the agent.  See Sec. 758.3(d) for power of attorney requirement, and see also part  762 of the EAR for recordkeeping requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Prohibited from applying for a license. No person convicted of a  violation of any statute specified in section 11(h) of the Export  Administration Act, as amended, at the discretion of the Secretary of  Commerce, may apply for any license for a period up to 10 years from the  date of the conviction. See Sec. 766.25 of the EAR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Prior action on a shipment. If you have obtained a license  without disclosure of the facts described in this section, the license  will be deemed to have been obtained without disclosure of all facts  material to the granting of the license and the license so obtained will  be deemed void. See part 764 of the EAR for other sanctions that may  result in the event a violation occurs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Licenses for items subject to detention or seizure. If you  submit a license application for items that you know have been detained  or seized by the Office of Export Enforcement or by the U.S. Customs  Service, you must disclose this fact to BIS when you submit your license  application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Licenses for items previously exported. You may not submit a  license application to BIS covering a shipment that is already laden  aboard the exporting carrier, exported or reexported. If such export or  reexport should not have been made without first securing a license  authorizing the shipment, you must send a letter of explanation to the  Office of Export Enforcement, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th and  Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., H4520, Washington, D.C., 20230. The letter   must state why a license was not obtained and disclose all facts  concerning the shipment that would normally have been disclosed on the  license application. You will be informed of any action and furnished  any instructions by the Office of Export Enforcement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Multiple shipments. Your license application need not be limited  to a single shipment, but may represent a reasonable estimate of items  to be shipped throughout the validity of the license. Do not wait until  the license you are using expires before submitting a new application.  You may submit a new application prior to the expiration of your current  license in order to ensure uninterrupted shipping.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Second application. You may not submit a second license  application covering the same proposed transaction while the first is  pending action by BIS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Resubmission. If a license application is returned without  action to you by BIS or your application represents a transaction  previously denied by BIS, and you want to resubmit the license  application, a new license application must be completed in accordance  with the instructions contained in Supplement No. 1 to part 748. Cite  the Application Control Number on your original application in Block 24  on the new license application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Emergency processing. Applicants may request emergency  processing of license applications by contacting the Outreach and  Educational Services Division of the Office of Exporter Services by  telephone on (202) 482-4811 or by facsimile on (202) 482-2927. Refer to  the Application Control Number when making emergency processing  requests. BIS will expedite its evaluation, and attempt to expedite the  evaluations of other government agencies, of a license application when,  in its sole judgement, the circumstances justify emergency processing.  Emergency processing is not available for Special Comprehensive License  applications. See Sec. 750.7(g) of the EAR for the limit on the  validity period of emergency licenses.
