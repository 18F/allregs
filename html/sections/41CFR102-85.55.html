They are intended to reflect a full mutual understanding of the financial terms and agreement of the parties. The OA describes the actual space and services to be provided and all associated actual costs to the customer during the term of occupancy. The OA does not include any general provisions or terms contained in this part. OAs typically describe the following, depending on whether the space is leased or Federally owned:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Assigned square footage;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Shell Rent and term of occupancy;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Amortized amount of customer allowance used;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Operating costs and escalations;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> One time charges; e.g., lump sum payments by the customer;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Real estate tax and escalations;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Parking and escalations;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Additional/reduced services;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Security services and associated Rent;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Joint use space and associated Rent;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> PBS fee;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Customer rights and provisions for occupancy after OA expiration;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Cancellation provisions if different from this part or the customer service guides;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Any special circumstances associated with the occupancy, such as environmental responsibilities, unusual use restrictions, or agreements with local authorities;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Emergency relocations;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Clauses specific to the agreement;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Other Rent, e.g., charges for antenna sites, land;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Agency standard clauses; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> General clauses defining the obligations of both parties.</p>
