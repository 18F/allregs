                            <p class="depth0">Safety zones may be established around OCS facilities being constructed, maintained, or operated on the Outer Continental Shelf to promote the safety of life and property on the facilities, their appurtenances and attending vessels, and on the adjacent

waters within the safety zones. Regulations adopted for safety zones may extend to the prevention or control of specific activities and access by vessels or persons, and include measures to protect the living resources of the sea from harmful agents. The regulations do not encompass the operating equipment or procedures used in the drilling for and production of oil, gas, or other minerals, or the transportation of oil, gas, or other minerals by pipeline except as they relate to the safety of life and property on OCS facilities and on the waters adjacent to OCS facilities or to the protection of the living resources of the sea within a safety zone from harmful agents.</p>
