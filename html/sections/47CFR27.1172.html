                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Disputes arising out of the cost-sharing plan, such as disputes  over the amount of reimbursement required, must be brought, in the first  instance, to the clearinghouse for resolution. To the extent that  disputes cannot be resolved by the clearinghouse, parties are encouraged  to use expedited Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) procedures, such  as binding arbitration, mediation, or other ADR techniques.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Evidentiary requirement. Parties of interest contesting the  clearinghouse's   determination of specific cost-sharing obligations must provide  evidentiary support to demonstrate that their calculation is reasonable  and made in good faith. Specifically, these parties are expected to  exercise due diligence to obtain the information necessary to prepare an  independent estimate of the relocation costs in question and to file the  independent estimate and supporting documentation with the  clearinghouse.</p>
