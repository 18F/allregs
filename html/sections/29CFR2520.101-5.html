For this purpose, a single-employer plan is a small plan if it meets the exception in section 303(g)(2)(B) of the Act, and a multiemployer plan is a small plan if it had 100 or fewer participants on each day during the plan year preceding the notice year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Manner of furnishing notice. (1) [Reserved.]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> [Reserved.]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A funding notice must be furnished to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation in a manner consistent with the requirements of part 4000 of title IV of the Act. The date that the notice is furnished to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation is determined consistent with that part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Persons entitled to notice. Persons entitled to a funding notice under this section are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each participant covered under the plan on the last day of the notice year;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each beneficiary receiving benefits under the plan on the last day of the notice year;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each alternate payee under the plan on the last day of the notice year;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each labor organization representing participants under the plan on the last day of the notice year;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In the case of a multiemployer plan, each employer that, as of the last day of the notice year, is a party to the collective bargaining agreement(s) pursuant to which the plan is maintained or who otherwise may be subject to withdrawal liability pursuant to section 4203 of the Act; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Special rules and definitions for material effect disclosures. (1) The term ``current plan year'' means the plan year after the notice year. Thus, for example, if the notice year is January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, then the current plan year would be January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term ``current plan year'' means the plan year after the notice year. Thus, for example, if the notice year is January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, then the current plan year would be January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An event described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section is recognized as ``taking effect'' in the current plan year if the effect of the event is taken into account for the first time for funding under section 430 or 431 of the Internal Revenue Code, as applicable, in such year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An event described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section has a ``material effect'' if it results, or is projected to result, in an increase or decrease of five percent or more in the value of assets or liabilities from the valuation date of the notice year. For this measurement, calculate assets and liabilities in the same manner as under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An event described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section has a ``material effect'' if, in the judgment of the plan's enrolled actuary, the effect of the event is considered material for purposes of the plan's funding status under section 430 or 431, as applicable, of the Internal Revenue Code, without regard to paragraph (g)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An event described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section is ``known'' only if it is known by the plan administrator

prior to 120 days before the due date of the notice. Thus, if an event otherwise described in paragraph (b)(7) first becomes known to a plan administrator 120 days or less before the due date of a notice, the plan administrator is not required to explain, or project the effect of, the event in that notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The term ``other known event'' includes, but is not limited to, an extension of coverage under the existing terms of the plan to a new group of employees; a plan merger, consolidation, or spinoff pursuant to regulations under section 414(l) of the Internal Revenue Code; or, a shutdown of any facility, plant, store, or such other similar corporate event that creates immediate eligibility for benefits that would not otherwise be immediately payable for participants separating from service. The term does not include market fluctuations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> With respect to events described in paragraph (g)(4) of this section, the plan administrator may, instead of projecting the effect on plan liabilities to the end of the current plan year, include an explanation why the event is considered material by the enrolled actuary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the special rules and definitions of paragraph (g) of this section:</p><p class="depth3">Example. Plan Y is a single-employer calendar year plan. Company X, the sponsor of Plan Y, adopts an amendment on June 1, 2017, offering a subsidized early retirement benefit to participants age 50 or older who retire on or after September 1, 2017 and before March 1, 2018. The amendment increases the liabilities of Plan Y by an amount greater than 5% of the value of Plan Y's liabilities on January 1, 2017. Company X does not make an election under Code section 412(d)(2) to accelerate recognition of the event for funding. The amendment is taken into account for the first time under section 430 of the Code as of the January 1, 2018 valuation date. Therefore, the amendment is recognized as taking effect under the final rule in 2018. Since the amendment adopted on June 1, 2017, is known more than 120 days prior to the April 30, 2018 due date of the 2017 funding notice, the amendment must be disclosed in the 2017 funding notice under paragraph (b)(7) of the final regulations as a material effect event taking effect in 2018 (i.e., the current plan year).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Model notices. (1) The appendices to this section contain a model notice for single-employer plans and a model notice for multiemployer plans. These models are intended to assist plan administrators in discharging their notice obligations under this section. Use of a model notice is not mandatory. However, subject to paragraph (h)(2) of this section, use of a model notice will be deemed to satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(11) and paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The appendices to this section contain a model notice for single-employer plans and a model notice for multiemployer plans.

For purposes of this section, the term ``notice year'' means the plan year to which the notice relates. For example, for a calendar year plan that must furnish its 2010 funding notice no later than the 120th day of 2011, the ``notice year'' is the 2010 plan year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Alternative method of compliance for furnishing notice to PBGC for certain single-employer plans. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the plan administrator of a single-employer plan is not required to furnish a notice to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation annually if, based on the data described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section for the notice year, plan liabilities do not exceed total plan assets by more than $50 million, provided that the plan administrator furnishes the latest available funding notice to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation within 30 days of a written request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Alternative method of compliance for multiemployer plans terminated by mass withdrawal. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, for plan years beginning after the date specified in section 4041A(b)(2) of the Act, an alternative method of compliance is available in the case of a multiemployer plan that terminates as a result of the withdrawal of every employer from the plan or the cessation of the obligation of all employers to contribute under the plan, as described in section 4041A(a)(2) of the Act. Under this alternative method, the plan administrator shall furnish annually to

each person described in paragraph (f)(1) through (3) of this section a notice that complies with paragraphs (c), (d), (e), and (k)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, for plan years beginning after the date specified in section 4041A(b)(2) of the Act, an alternative method of compliance is available in the case of a multiemployer plan that terminates as a result of the withdrawal of every employer from the plan or the cessation of the obligation of all employers to contribute under the plan, as described in section 4041A(a)(2) of the Act.
