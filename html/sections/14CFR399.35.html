It is the policy of the Board  to grant STP for tariffs that state lower fares, rates, or charges and  any rules affecting only those lower fares, rates, or charges, except  that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Board will not grant STP to match a tariff filed on  statutory notice; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Board will not grant STP if the proposed fares, rates,  charges, or rules raise significant questions of lawfulness, that is,  could reasonably be expected to be found unjust or unreasonable,  unjustly discriminatory, unduly preferential, unduly prejudicial, or  predatory, under current statutory or Board guidelines. In these  situations, if the carrier files the tariff on statutory notice and at  the same time applies for STP to advance the tariff's effective date,  the Board will use its best efforts to act within 15 days to grant or  deny STP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Higher fares or rates. For tariffs that state higher fares or  rates, and any rules affecting only those fares or rates, the Board's  policy on STP is, except in unusual or emergency circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To grant STP if the resulting fares or rates are within a  statutory or Board-established zone of fare or rate flexibility; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Otherwise, to deny STP.
