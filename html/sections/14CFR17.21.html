                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Other than for the resolution of preliminary or dispositive  matters, the Adjudicative Process for protests will be commenced by the  ODRA Director pursuant to Sec. 17.17(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Director of the ODRA shall appoint a DRO or a Special Master  to conduct the adjudication proceedings, develop the administrative  record, and prepare findings and recommendations for review of the ODRA  Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The DRO or Special Master may conduct such proceedings and  prepare procedural orders for the proceedings as deemed appropriate; and  may require additional submissions from the parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Product Team response to the protest will be due to be filed  and served ten (10) business days from the commencement of the ODRA  Adjudication process. The Product Team response shall consist of a  written chronological, supported statement of proposed facts, and a  written presentation of applicable legal or other defenses.   The Product Team response shall cite to and be accompanied by all  relevant documents, which shall be chronologically indexed, individually  tabbed, and certified as authentic and complete. A copy of the response  shall be furnished so as to be received by the protester and any  intervenor(s) on the same date it is filed with the ODRA. In all cases,  the Product Team shall indicate the method of service used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Comments of the protester and the intervenor on the Product Team  response will be due to be filed and served five (5) business days after  their receipt of the response. Copies of such comments shall be provided  to the other participating parties by the same means and on the same  date as they are furnished to the ODRA. Comments may include any  supplemental relevant documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The ODRA may alter the schedule for filing of the Product Team  response and the comments for good cause or to accommodate the  circumstances of a particular protest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The DRO or Special Master may convene the parties and/or their  representatives, as needed for the Adjudicative Process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If, in the sole judgment of the DRO or Special Master, the  parties have presented written material sufficient to allow the protest  to be decided on the record presented, the DRO or Special Master shall  have the discretion to decide the protest on that basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The parties may engage in limited, focused discovery with one  another and, if justified, with non-parties, so as to obtain information  relevant to the allegations of the protest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The DRO or Special Master shall manage the discovery process,  including limiting its length and availability, and shall establish  schedules and deadlines for discovery, which are consistent with  timeframes established in this part and with the FAA policy of providing  fair and expeditious dispute resolution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The DRO or Special Master may also direct the parties to  exchange, in an expedited manner, relevant, non-privileged documents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where justified, the DRO or Special Master may direct the taking  of deposition testimony, however, the FAA dispute resolution process  does not contemplate extensive discovery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The use of interrogatories and requests for admission is not  permitted in ODRA bid protests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Where parties cannot voluntarily reach agreement on a discovery- related issue, they may timely seek assistance from an ODRA ADR neutral  or may file an appropriate motion with the ODRA. Parties may request a  subpoena.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Discovery requests and responses are not part of the record and  will not be filed with the ODRA, except in connection with a motion or  other permissible filing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Unless timely objection is made, documents properly filed with  the ODRA will be deemed admitted into the administrative record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Hearings are not typically held in bid protests. The DRO or  Special Master may conduct hearings, and may limit the hearings to the  testimony of specific witnesses and/or presentations regarding specific  issues. The DRO or Special Master shall control the nature and conduct  of all hearings, including the sequence and extent of any testimony.  Hearings will be conducted:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where the DRO or Special Master determines that there are  complex factual issues in dispute that cannot adequately or efficiently  be developed solely by means of written presentations and/or that  resolution of the controversy will be dependent on his/her assessment of  the credibility of statements provided by individuals with first-hand  knowledge of the facts; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Upon request of any party to the protest, unless the DRO or  Special Master finds specifically that a hearing is unnecessary and that  no party will be prejudiced by limiting the record in the adjudication  to the parties' written submissions. All witnesses at any such hearing  shall be subject to cross-examination by the opposing party and to  questioning by the DRO or Special Master.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The Director of the ODRA may review the status of any protest in  the Adjudicative Process with the DRO or Special Master.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> After the closing of the administrative record, the DRO or  Special   Master will prepare and submit findings and recommendations to the ODRA  that shall contain the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Findings of fact;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Application of the principles of the AMS, and any applicable law  or authority to the findings of fact;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A recommendation for a final FAA order; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If appropriate, suggestions for future FAA action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> In preparing findings and recommendations in protests, the DRO  or Special Master, using the preponderance of the evidence standard,  shall consider whether the Product Team actions in question were  consistent with the requirements of the AMS, had a rational basis, and  whether the Product Team decision was arbitrary, capricious or an abuse  of discretion. Notwithstanding the above, allegations that government  officials acted with bias or in bad faith must be established by clear  and convincing evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> The DRO or Special Master has broad discretion to recommend a  remedy that is consistent with Sec. 17.23.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> A DRO or Special Master shall submit findings and  recommendations only to the Director of the ODRA or the Director's  designee. The findings and recommendations will be released to the  parties and to the public upon issuance of the final FAA order in the  case. If an ODRA protective order was issued in connection with the  protest, or if a protest involves proprietary or competition-sensitive  information, a redacted version of the findings and recommendations,  omitting any protected information, shall be prepared wherever possible  and released to the public, as soon as is practicable, along with a copy  of the final FAA order. Only persons admitted by the ODRA under the  protective order and Government personnel shall be provided copies of  the unredacted findings and recommendations that contain proprietary or  competition-sensitive information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Other than communications regarding purely procedural matters or  ADR, there shall be no substantive ex parte communication between ODRA  personnel and any principal or representative of a party concerning a  pending or potentially pending matter. A potential or serving ADR  neutral may communicate on an ex parte basis to establish or conduct the  ADR.</p>
