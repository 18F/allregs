Sec. 20.6324A-1  Special lien for estate tax deferred under section 6166 or 6166A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. If the executor of an estate of a decedent dying after December 31, 1976, makes an election under section 6166 or 6166A (as in effect prior to its repeal by the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981) to defer the payment of estate tax, the executor may make an election under section 6324A. An election under section 6324A will cause a lien in favor of the United States to attach to the estate's section 6166 lien property, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. This lien is in lieu of the bonds required by sections 2204 and 6165 and in lieu of any lien under section 6324 on the same property with respect to the same estate. The value of the property which the district director may require under section 6324A as section 6166 lien property may not exceed the sum of the deferred amount (as defined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section) and the required interest amount (as defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section). The unpaid portion of the deferred amount (plus any unpaid interest, additional amount, addition to tax, assessable penalty, and cost attributable to the deferred amount) shall be a lien in favor of the United States on the section 6166 lien property. See Sec. 301.6324A-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration) for provisions relating to the election of and agreement to the special lien for estate tax deferred under section 6166 or 6166A (as in effect prior to its repeal by the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Section 6166 lien property--(1) In general. Section 6166 lien property consists of those interests in real and personal property designated in the agreement referred to in section 6324A (c) (see paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.6324A-1 of this chapter). An interest in property may be designated as section 6166 lien property only to the extent such interest can be expected to survive the deferral period (as defined in paragraph (e)(3) of this section). Property designated, however, need not be property included in the decedent's estate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Section 6166 lien property consists of those interests in real and personal property designated in the agreement referred to in section 6324A (c) (see paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.6324A-1 of this chapter). An interest in property may be designated as section 6166 lien property only to the extent such interest can be expected to survive the deferral period (as defined in paragraph (e)(3) of this section). Property designated, however, need not be property included in the decedent's estate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Maximum value of required property. The fair market value of the property required by the district director to be designated as section 6166 lien property with respect to any estate shall not be greater than the sum of the deferred amount and the required interest amount, as these terms are defined in paragraphs (e) (1) and (2) of this section. However, the parties to the agreement referred to in section 6324A (c) may voluntarily designate property having a fair market value in excess of that sum. The fair market value of the section 6166 lien property shall be determined as of the date prescribed in section 6151(a) (without regard to any extension) for payment of the estate tax. Such value must take into account any encumbrance on the property (such as a mortgage or a lien under section 6324B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Additional lien property may be required. If, at any time, the unpaid portion of the deferred amount and the required interest amount exceeds the fair market value of the section 6166 lien property, the district director may require the addition of property to the

agreement in an amount up to such excess. When additional property is required, the district director shall make notice and demand upon the agent designated in the agreement setting forth the amount of additional property required. Property having the required value (or other security equal to the required value must be added to the agreement within 90 days after notice and demand from the district director. Failure to comply with the demand within the 90-day period shall be treated as an act accelerating payment of installments under section 6166(g) or 6166A(h) (as in effect prior to its repeal by the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Partial substitution of bond. See paragraph (c) of Sec. 301.6324A-1 of this chapter for rules relating to the partial substitution of a bond for the lien where the value of property designated as section 6166 lien property is less than the amount of unpaid estate tax plus interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Special rules--(1) Period of lien. The lien under section 6324A arises at the earlier of the date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Period of lien. The lien under section 6324A arises at the earlier of the date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The executor is discharged from liability under section 2204; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Notice of lien is filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6323(f)-1 of this chapter.
The section 6324A lien continues until the liability for the deterred amount is satisfied or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time. The provisions of Sec. 301.6325-1(c), relating to release of lien or discharge of property, shall apply to this paragraph (c)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Requirement that lien be filed. The lien imposed by section 6324A is not valid against a purchaser (as defined in paragraph (f) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1), holder of a security interest (as defined in paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1), mechanic's lienor (as defined in paragraph (b) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1), or judgment lien creditor (as defined in paragraph (g) of Sec. 301.6323(h)-1) until notice of the lien is filed. Once filed, the notice of lien remains effective without being refiled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Priorities. Although a notice of lien under section 6324A had been properly filed, that lien is not valid--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To the extent provided in section 6323(b)(6), relating to real property tax and special assessment liens, regardless of whether such liens came into existence before or after the filing of the notice of Federal tax lien;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of any real property subject to a lien for repair or improvement, as against a mechanic's lienor, whether or not such lien came into existence before or after the notice of tax lien was filed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> As against any security interest set forth in section 6323(c)(3), relating to real property construction or improvement financing agreements, regardless whether such security interest came into existence before or after filing of the notice of tax lien.
However, paragraphs (c)(3) (ii) and (iii) of this section shall not apply to any security interest that came into existence after the date of filing of notice (in a manner similar to a notice filed under section 6323(f)) that payment of the deferred amount has been accelerated under section 6166(g) or 6166A(h) (as in effect prior to its repeal by the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Release or discharge of lien. For rules relating to release of the lien imposed by section 6324A or discharge of the section 6166 lien property, see section 6325 and Sec. 301.6325-1 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Definitions. For purposes of section 6324A of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Deferred amount. The deferred amount is the aggregate amount of estate tax deferred under section 6166 or 6166A (as in effect prior to its repeal by the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981) determined as of the date prescribed by section 6151(a) for payment of the estate tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Required interest amount. The required interest amount is the aggregate amount of interest payable over the first four years of the deferral period. For purposes of computing the required interest amount, the interest rate prescribed by section 6621 in effect on the date prescribed by section 6151(a) for payment of the estate tax shall be used for computing the interest for the first four years of the deferral period. The 4-percent interest rate prescribed by section 6601(j) shall apply to the extent provided in that section. For purposes of computing interest during deferral periods beginning after December 31, 1982, interest shall be compounded daily.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Deferral period. The deferral period is the period for which the payment of tax is deferred pursuant to the election under section 6166 or 6166A (as in effect prior to its repeal by the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Application of definitions. In the case of a deficiency, a separate deferred amount, required interest amount, and deferral period shall be determined as of the due date of the first installment after the deficiency is prorated to installments under section 6166 or 6166A (as in effect prior to its repeal by the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981).

Sec. 20.6324B-1  Special lien for additional estate tax attributable to farm, etc., valuation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. In the case of an estate of a decedent dying after December 31, 1976, which includes any interest in qualified real property, if the executor elects to value part or all of such property pursuant to section 2032A, a lien arises in favor of the United States on the property to which the election applies. The lien is in the amount equal to the adjusted tax difference attributable to such interest (as defined by section 2032A(c)(2)(B)). The term ``qualified real property'' means qualified real property as defined in section 2032A(b), qualified replacement property within the meaning of section 2032A(h)(3)(B), and qualified exchange property within the meaning of section 2032A(i)(3). The rules set forth in the regulations under section 2032A shall apply in determining whether this section is applicable to otherwise qualified real property held by a partnership, corporation or trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Period of lien. The lien shall arise at the time the executor files an election under section 2032A. It shall remain in effect until one of the following occurs:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The liability for the additional estate tax under section 2032A(c) with respect to such interest has been satisfied; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Such liability has become unenforceable by reason of lapse of time; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The district director is satisfied that no further liability for additional estate tax with respect to such interest may arise under section 2032A(c), i.e., the required time period has elapsed since the decedent's death without the occurrence of an event described in section 2032A(c)(1), or the qualified heir (as defined in section 2032A(e)(1)) had died.
For procedures regarding the release or subordination of liens or discharge of property from liens, see Sec. 301.6325-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Substitution of security for lien. The district director may, upon written application of the qualified heir (as defined in section 2032A(e) (1)) acquiring any interest in qualified real property to which a lien imposed by section 6324B attaches, issue a certificate of discharge of any or all property subject to such lien, after receiving a bond or other security in an amount or value determined by the district director as sufficient security for the maximum potential liability for additional estate tax with respect to such interest. Any bond shall be in the form and with the security prescribed in Sec. 301.7101-1 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Special rules. The rules set forth in section 6324A(d) (1), (3), and (4), and the regulations thereunder, shall apply with respect to a lien imposed by section 6324B as if it were a lien imposed by section 6324A.
