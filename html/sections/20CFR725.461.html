                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If all parties waive their right to appear before the  administrative law judge, it shall not be necessary for the  administrative law judge to give notice of, or conduct, an oral hearing.  A waiver of the right to appear shall be made in writing and filed with  the Chief Administrative Law Judge or the administrative law judge  assigned to hear the case. Such waiver may be withdrawn by a party for  good cause shown at any time prior to the mailing of the decision in the  claim. Even though all of the parties have filed a waiver of the right  to appear, the administrative law judge may, nevertheless, after giving  notice of the time and place, conduct a hearing if he or she believes  that the personal appearance and testimony of the party or parties would  assist in ascertaining the facts in issue in the claim. Where a waiver  has been filed by all parties, and they do not appear before the  administrative law judge personally or by representative, the  administrative law judge shall make a record of the relevant documentary  evidence submitted in accordance with this part and any further written  stipulations of the parties. Such documents and stipulations shall be  considered the evidence of record in the case and the decision shall be  based upon such evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 725.456(a), the unexcused failure of  any party to attend a hearing shall constitute a waiver of such party's  right to present evidence at the hearing, and may result in a dismissal  of the claim (see Sec. 725.465).</p>
