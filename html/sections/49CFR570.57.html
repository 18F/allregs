                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The following requirements apply to vehicles with air brake and air- over-hydraulic brake systems. Trailer(s) must be coupled to a truck or  truck-tractor for the purpose of this inspection, except as noted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Air brake system integrity. The air brake system shall  demonstrate integrity by meeting the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> With the vehicle in a stationary position, compressed air  reserve shall be sufficient to permit one full service brake  application, after the engine is stopped and with the system fully  charged, without lowering reservoir pressure more than 20 percent below  the initial reading.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The air brake system compressor shall increase the air pressure  in the reservoir(s) from the level developed after the test prescribed  in Sec. 570.57(a)(1) to the initial pressure noted before the full  brake application, with the engine running at the manufacturer's maximum  recommended number of revolutions per minute with the compressor  governor in the cut-off position, in not more than 30 seconds for  vehicles manufactured prior to March 1, 1975. For vehicles, manufactured  on or after March 1, 1975, the time allowed for air pressure buildup  shall not exceed 45 seconds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The warning device (visual or audible) connected to the brake  system air pressure source shall be activated when air pressure is  lowered to an activating level that is not less than 50 psi. For  vehicles manufactured to conform to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety  Standard No. 121, the low-pressure indicator shall be activated when air  pressure is lowered to an activating level that is not less than 60 psi.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The governor cut-in pressure shall be not lower than 80 psi, and  the cut-out pressure shall be not higher than 135 psi, unless other  values are recommended by the vehicle manufacturer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Air brake pressure shall not drop more than 2 psi in 1 minute  for single vehicles or more than 3 psi in 1 minute for combination  vehicles, with the engine stopped and service brakes released. There may  be an additional 1 psi drop per minute for each additional towed  vehicle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> With the reservoir(s) fully charged, air pressure shall not drop  more than 3 psi in 1 minute for single vehicles or more than 4 psi in 1  minute for combination vehicles, with the engine stopped and service  brakes fully applied. There may be an additional 1 psi drop per minute  for each additional towed vehicle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The compressor drive belt shall not be badly worn or frayed and  belt-tension shall be sufficient to prevent slippage.  Inspection procedure. With the air system charged, open the drain cocks  in the service and supply reservoir on the truck or truck-tractor. Note  the pressure at which the visual or audible warning device connected to  the low-pressure indicator is activated. Close the drain cocks, and,  with the trailer(s) uncoupled, check air pressure buildup at the  manufacturer's recommended engine speed. Observe the time required to  raise the air pressure from 85 to 100 psi. Continue running the engine  until the governor cuts out and note the pressure. Reduce engine speed  to idle, couple the trailer(s), if applicable, and make a series of  brake applications. Note the pressure at which the governor cuts in.  Increased engine speed to fast idle and charge the system to its  governed pressure. Stop the engine and record the pressure drop in psi  per minute with brakes released and with brakes fully applied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Air brake system hoses, tubes and connections. Air system tubes,  hoses and connections shall not be restricted, cracked or improperly  supported, and the air hose shall not be abraded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inspection procedure. Stop the engine and examine air hoses,  tubes and connections visually for conditions specified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Air-over-hydraulic brake subsystem integrity. The air-over- hydraulic brake subsystem shall demonstrate integrity by meeting the  following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> to the initial pressure noted before the full  brake application, with the engine running at the manufacturer's  recommended number of revolutions per minute and the compressor governor  in the cut-out position, in not more than 30 seconds for vehicles  manufactured prior to March 1, 1975. For vehicles manufactured on or  after March 1, 1975, the time for air pressure build up shall not exceed  45 seconds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The warning device (visual or audible) connected to the brake  system air pressure source shall be activated when the air pressure is  lowered to not less than 50 psi.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The governor cut-in pressure shall be not lower than 80 psi, and  the cut-out pressure shall not be higher than 135 psi, unless other  values are recommended by the vehicle manufacturer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Air brake pressure shall not drop more than 2 psi in 1 minute  for single vehicles or more than 3 psi in 1 minute for combination  vehicles, with the engine stopped and service brakes released. Allow a  1-psi drop per minute for each additional towed vehicle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> With the reservoir(s) fully charged, air pressure shall not drop  more than 3 psi in 1 minute for single vehicles or more than 4 psi in 1  minute for combination vehicles, with the engine stopped and service  brakes fully applied. Allow a 1-psi pressure drop in 1 minute for each  additional towed vehicle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The compressor drive belt shall not be badly worn or frayed and  belt tension shall be sufficient to prevent slippage.  Inspection procedure. With the air system charged, open the drain cocks  in the service and supply reservoir on the truck or truck-tractor. Note  the pressure at which the visual or audible warning device connected to  the low pressure indicator is activated. Close the drain cocks and, with  the trailers uncoupled, check air pressure buildup at the manufacturer's  recommended engine speed. Observe the time required to raise the air  pressure from 85 to 100 psi. Continue running the engine until the  governor cuts out and note the pressure. Reduce engine speed to idle,  couple trailers, and make a series of brake applications. Note the  pressure at which the governor cuts in. Increase engine speed to fast  idle and charge the system to its governed pressure. Stop the engine and  record the pressure drop in psi per minute with brakes released and with  brakes fully applied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Air-over-hydraulic brake subsystem hoses, master cylinder, tubes  and connections. System tubes, hoses and connections shall not be  cracked or improperly supported, the air and hydraulic hoses shall not  be abraded and the master cylinder shall not show signs of leakage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inspection procedure. Stop the engine and examine air and  hydraulic brake hoses, brake master cylinder, tubes and connections  visually for conditions specified.
