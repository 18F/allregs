                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A prevailing wage rate is a wage rate that is paid to an  experienced worker not disabled for the work to be performed. The  Department recognizes that there may be more than one wage rate for a  specific type of work in a given area. An employer must be able   to demonstrate that the rate being used as prevailing for determining a  commensurate wage was objectively determined according to the guidelines  contained in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An employer whose work force primarily consists of nondisabled  workers or who employs more than a token number of nondisabled workers  doing similar work may use as the prevailing wage the wage rate paid to  that employer's experienced nondisabled employees performing similar  work. Where an agency places a worker or workers with disabilities on  the premises of an employer described above, the wage paid to the  employer's experienced workers may be used as prevailing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An employer whose work force primarily consists of workers  disabled for the work to be performed may determine the prevailing wage  by ascertaining the wage rates paid to the experienced nondisabled  workers of other employers in the vicinity. Such data may be obtained by  surveying comparable firms in the area that employ primarily nondisabled  workers doing similar work. The firms surveyed must be representative of  comparable firms in terms of wages paid to experienced workers doing  similar work. The appropriate size of such a sample will depend on the  number of firms doing similar work but should include no less than three  firms unless there are fewer firms doing such work in the area. A  comparable firm is one which is of similar size in terms of employees or  which competes for or bids on contracts of a similar size or nature.  Employers may contact other sources such as the Bureau of Labor  Statistics or private or State employment services where surveys are not  practical. If similar work cannot be found in the area defined by the  geographic labor market, the closest comparable community may be used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The prevailing wage rate must be based upon the wage rate paid  to experienced nondisabled workers as defined elsewhere in these  regulations. Employment services which only provide entry level wage  data are not acceptable as sources for prevailing wage information as  required in these regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> There is no prescribed method for tabulating the results of a  prevailing wage survey. For example, either a weighted or unweighted  average would be acceptable provided the employer is consistent in the  methodology used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The prevailing wage must be based upon work utilizing similar  methods and equipment. Where the employer is unable to obtain the  prevailing wage for a specific job to be performed on the premises, such  as collating documents, it would be acceptable to use as the prevailing  wage the wage paid to experienced individuals employed in similar jobs  such as file clerk or general office clerk, requiring the same general  skill levels.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The following information should be recorded in documenting the  determination of prevailing wage rates:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Date of contact with firm or other source;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Name, address, and phone number of firm or other source  contacted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Individual contacted within firm or source;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Title of individual contacted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Wage rate information provided;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Brief description of work for which wage information is  provided;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Basis for the conclusion that wage rate is not based upon an  entry level position. (See also Sec. 525.10(c).)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> A prevailing wage may not be less than the minimum wage  specified in section 6(a) of FLSA.</p>
