                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. This section contains regulations for the Business  and Industry Buydown (BIB) loan program. The purpose of this program is  to provide   loan guarantees with reduced interest rates to the borrowers, under the  authority of Public Law 103-50 (107 Stat. 241). All provisions of  Subparts A and E of this part apply to BIB loans except as provided in  this section. All forms used in connection with a BIB loan will be those  used with other B&I; loans, except as provided in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Location of applicants. Businesses eligible for BIB loans shall  be located within the area covered by the Presidential disaster  declaration related to Hurricanes Andrew or Iniki or Typhoon Omar.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Interest rate. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the interest rate charged by the lender  (note rate) on a BIB loan is a variable rate in accordance with Sec.  1980.423 of this subpart, the base rate must be the prime rate as  published in the Wall Street Journal and the note rate must not exceed  the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal by more than 100  basis points. If the note rate is fixed, it must not exceed by more than  100 basis points the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal  on the day the Loan Note Guarantee is issued.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The note rate for a BIB loan must be the same for the entire  loan, including both the guaranteed and unguaranteed portion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Interest rate buydown. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To be eligible for a BIB loan, the  business must provide evidence and the lender and FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 must determine that, at least for the  first year of the loan, the business will not have adequate cash flow to  meet all of its financial obligations including the required payments on  the proposed loan at the note rate, but that it can meet all obligations  if the interest rate is reduced by 100 basis points.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> During the first year after a Loan Note Guarantee is issued for  a BIB loan, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will  pay one percentage point of interest on the loan directly to the lender,  thereby reducing the interest due from the borrower by this amount. This  interest payment shall be applied to both the guaranteed and  unguaranteed portion of the loan pro ratably according to FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Interest payments by FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 may continue in subsequent years if the borrower's cash flow  is insufficient to pay all obligations including the required payments  on the proposed loan at the note rate. On or about each yearly  anniversary of the promissory note the lender may submit a request to  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for continued  interest payments, along with current profit and loss and cash flow  statements and cash flow projections to show that the continued payments  are needed for another year. FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 will promptly review the material submitted, determine  whether the continued interest payments by FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 are needed to provide for sufficient cash flow  in the coming year, and notify the lender in writing of the  determination. Once interest payments by FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 are terminated because the borrower's cash flow  is determined to be sufficient to pay the note rate, such payments will  not be made in subsequent years even if the cash flow decreases.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> This section does not authorize interest payments by FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 on B&I; loans other than those  approved under this section. To be eligible for interest payments by  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, the loan must be  designated as a BIB loan when approved and funded from funds authorized  by Public Law 103-50.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Duration of BIB loan program. No BIB loan will be obligated  after September 30, 1994.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Administrative procedures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A lender that wants a B&I;  application considered under BIB authorities should so indicate by  notation on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  449-1 or by letter submitted with the Form FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 449-1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will  identify a loan as a BIB loan by notation in the   top margin of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  449-29 and by the ``type of assistance'' code listed on Form FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1940-3, in accordance with the  Forms Manual Insert.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will set  out the interest buydown provisions in accordance with this section in  the Conditional Commitment for Guarantee. When the Loan Note Guarantee  is issued, the lender and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 will execute Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 1980-48, ``Business and Industry Interest Rate Buydown  Agreement.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The lender will request the interest payment from FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 by submitting Form FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1980-23, ``Request for  Business and Industry Interest Buydown Payment,'' to the FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 servicing office. Each request  must cover exactly 1 year and be filed within 30 days after the  anniversary date of the promissory note, except when interest buydown is  terminated between anniversary dates. The FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 servicing office will review each request for  consistency with FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  regulations and the Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 1980-48 and, if the claim is valid, will approve it and forward  it to the Finance Office for issuance of the payment to the lender.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Termination of interest buydown. When FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 purchases a portion of a loan, interest  buydown will cease on the entire loan. Interest buydown will also cease  upon termination of the Loan Note Guarantee or assumption/transfer of  the loan. In the event of any action that causes the interest buydown to  terminate, the lender will submit a claim on Form FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 1980-23 for interest buydown payments  through the date of termination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Loan purposes--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Refinancing. Section 1980.452 Administrative  C.1. (d) of this subpart does not apply to BIB loans if refinancing is  needed as a direct consequence of the disaster. In such cases, the  lender may be allowed to bring previously unguaranteed exposure under  the guarantee. No loan will be refinanced unless the current market  value of the collateral is at least equal to the amount of the loan to  be refinanced plus any new loan amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Agriculture. Section 1980.412 (e) of this subpart does not apply  to BIB loans. BIB loans may be guaranteed for agriculture production,  which means the cultivation, production (growing), and harvesting,  either directly or through integrated operations, of agricultural  products (crops, animals, birds, and marine life, either for fiber or  food for human consumption), and disposal or marketing thereof, the  raising, housing, feeding (including commercial custom feedlots),  breeding, hatching, control and/or management of farm or domestic  animals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other eligible businesses. Eligible types of businesses also  include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Commercial nurseries primarily engaged in the production of  ornamental plants and trees and other nursery products such as bulbs,  florists' greens, flowers, shrubbery, flower and vegetable seeds, sod,  and the growing of vegetables from seed to the transplant stage.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Forestry which includes establishments primarily engaged in the  operation of timber tracts, tree farms, forest nurseries, and related  activities such as reforestation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The growing of mushrooms or hydroponics.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Recreation and tourism. Loans may be guaranteed for tourist or  recreation facilities except for hotels, motels, bed and breakfasts,  race tracks, gambling, or golf courses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Meat processing facilities. The provisions of Sec. 1980.411  (a)(8) of this subpart will not apply to BIB loans. Loans, including  working capital or debt refinancing, may be guaranteed for businesses  engaged in meat or poultry processing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Small Business Administration. Section 1980.451 (c) of this  subpart will not apply to BIB loans. Applicants eligible   for Small Business Administration assistance will be advised of the  availability of that assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Loan guarantee limits. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec.  1980.420 of this subpart, the guarantee percentage on any BIB loan will  not exceed 80 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Credit quality analysis. In analyzing the credit quality of a  proposed loan to a business that has lost assets to a natural disaster,  primary emphasis will be placed on the operating history of the  business, rather than its current financial condition. If the business  has a sound, profitable and successful history prior to the disaster and  there are reasonable projections to ensure it can operate successfully  in the future, the proposed loan may be approved even if disaster losses  have caused somewhat less equity and/or collateral than would normally  be expected for a B&I; loan guarantee. If the business appears to have  had an unprofitable operation or inadequate cash flow prior to the  disaster, the proposed loan guarantee will not be approved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Equity requirements. The equity requirements of Sec. 1980.441  of this subpart do not apply to BIB loans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Collateral. Section 1980.443 Administrative A. 2., 3., and 4. of  this subpart will not apply to BIB loans. Collateral may be considered  at its current market value without discount. Work-in-process inventory  may be valued at the estimated market value of the finished product. All  costs of producing the finished product must be included in the cash  flow analysis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Conditional approval. A Form FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 449-14 may be issued prior to receipt of specific  items needed to complete an application package provided:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The lender and/or borrower demonstrates to the Government's  satisfaction that it has a need for a prompt indication of the  availability of the proposed loan guarantee and the conditions under  which a guarantee are available;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The specific items missing from the application package will  take considerable time to obtain;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The lender requests a commitment prior to providing the items;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The attachment to Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354 449-14 clearly states that the commitment is conditioned on  satisfactory completion of the missing item(s) and a guarantee will not  be issued unless all conditions of these regulations are met; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> No Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  449-14 will be issued prior to the obligation date established with the  Finance Office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Financial statements. All requirements of Sec. 1980.451(i)(13)  of this subpart will apply except that for BIB loans minimum annual  financial statements will be required as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For nonagricultural borrowers with a B&I; indebtedness of  $500,000 or less, an annual compilation by an independent certified  public accountant or by an independent public accountant licensed and  certified on or before December 31, 1970.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For nonagricultural borrowers with a B&I; indebtedness of  $500,001 through $1 million, an annual review by an independent  certified public accountant or by an independent public accountant  licensed and certified on or before December 31, 1970.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For nonagricultural borrowers with a B&I; indebtedness of more  than $1 million, an annual audited financial statement by an independent  certified public accountant or by an independent public accountant  licensed and certified on or before December 31, 1970.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All agricultural loans will require annual financial statements  per Sec. 1980.113 of subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Agriculture loans. The following additional provisions apply to  BIB loan guarantees for businesses engaged in agriculture production:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General policy. Paragraph (p) of this section contains the  regulations for making BIB loans to farmers for agricultural purposes.  BIB loans made for agricultural purposes are subject to the provisions  in subparts A and E of this part except as specified. In addition,  certain sections of subpart B of this part referenced in this section  are applicable subject to the limitations outlined in this section.  Several key loan processing and loan servicing requirements stipulated  in subpart B of this   part do not apply to loans made to borrowers under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Farm size. Loan guarantees may be made under the BIB program  without regard to the size of the farming operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Filing and processing preapplications and applications. If the  applicant has already developed material for an FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 Farmer Programs loan or if the financial  and production information required by Sec. 1980.113 of subpart B of  this part is needed to document repayment ability or is required by the  lender, Sec. 1980.113 of subpart B of this part may apply with the  following exceptions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Lines of credit will not be guaranteed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the application is submitted solely for a farm as defined in  Sec. 1980.106(b) of subpart B of this part, Form FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 1980-25, ``Farmer Programs  Application,'' or Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law  103-354 449-1, will be used as an application for assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Evaluation of applications. If the application is developed and  processed in accordance with Sec. 1980.113 of subpart B of this part,  the provisions outlined in Sec. 1980.114 of subpart B of this part  apply with the following exceptions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Timeframe requirements for the evaluation of applications and  references to the Approved Lender Program are not applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> County Committee reviews of applications processed under this  section will not be required.

However, such installment will be due  and payable within 6 years from the date of the debt instrument and at  least annually thereafter. Interest will not be deferred and will be due  at least annually from the date of the debt instrument. In granting a  deferral of principal payment, the loan approval official must document  based on pro forma financial statements and the nature of the crop that  the deferral of payments is necessary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The lender must ensure that loan repayment is scheduled to  eliminate the possibility of a balloon payment at the end of the loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Agriculture BIB loan purposes. Loans may be made only for the  following purposes:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Operating purposes as outlined in Sec. 1980.175 (c)(1) of  Subpart B of this part except for those stipulated in Sec.  1980.175(c)(1)(iv) and (vii).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Real estate purposes as outlined in Sec. 1980.180 (c) of  Subpart B of this part except for those stipulated in Sec. 1980.180  (c)(1) and (4).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Refinancing in accordance with paragraph (h)(1) of this  section and Sec.
