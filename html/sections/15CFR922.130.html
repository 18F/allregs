                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The first area consists of an area of  approximately 4016 square nautical miles (nmi) of coastal and ocean  waters, and submerged lands thereunder, in and surrounding Monterey Bay  off the central coast of California. The northern terminus of the  Sanctuary boundary is located along the southern boundary of the Gulf of  the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary (GFNMS) beginning at Rocky  Point just south of Stinson Beach in Marin County. The Sanctuary  boundary follows the GFNMS boundary westward to a point approximately 29  nmi offshore from Moss Beach in San Mateo County. The Sanctuary boundary  then extends southward in a series of arcs, which generally follow the  500 fathom isobath, to a point approximately 27 nmi offshore of Cambria,  in San Luis Obispo County. The Sanctuary boundary then extends eastward  towards shore until it intersects the Mean High Water Line (MHWL) along  the coast near Cambria. The Sanctuary boundary then follows the MHWL  northward to the northern terminus at Rocky Point. The shoreward  Sanctuary boundary excludes a small area between Point Bonita and Point  San Pedro. Pillar Point Harbor, Santa Cruz Harbor, Monterey Harbor, and  Moss Landing Harbor are all excluded from the Sanctuary shoreward from  the points listed in appendix A except for Moss Landing Harbor, where  all of Elkhorn Slough east of the Highway One bridge, and west of the  tide gate at Elkhorn Road and toward the center channel from the MHWL is  included within the Sanctuary, excluding areas within the Elkhorn Slough  National Estuarine Research Reserve. Exact coordinates for the seaward  boundary and harbor exclusions are provided in appendix A to this  subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Davidson Seamount Management Zone is also part of the  Sanctuary. This area, bounded by geodetic lines connecting a rectangle  centered on the top of the Davidson Seamount, consists of approximately  585 square nmi of ocean waters and the submerged lands thereunder. The  shoreward boundary of this portion of the Sanctuary is located  approximately 65 nmi off the coast of San Simeon in San Luis Obispo  County. Exact coordinates for the Davidson Seamount Management Zone  boundary are provided in appendix F to this subpart.</p>
