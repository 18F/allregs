                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(6)</em> of this section. Where multiple compliance options are  provided, the options may be used in combination for different  wastewater streams and/or for different compounds (e.g., Table 8 versus  Table 9 compounds) in the same wastewater streams, except where  otherwise provided in this section. Once a Group 1   wastewater stream or residual removed from a Group 1 wastewater stream  has been treated in accordance with this subpart, it is no longer  subject to the requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Existing source. If the wastewater stream, at an existing  source, is Group 1 for Table 9 compounds, comply with Sec. 63.138(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> New source. If the wastewater stream, at a new source, is Group  1 for Table 8 compounds, comply with Sec. 63.138(c). If the wastewater  stream, at a new source, is Group 1 for Table 9 compounds, comply with  Sec. 63.138(b). If the wastewater stream, at a new source, is Group 1  for Table 8 and Table 9 compounds, comply with both Sec. 63.138(b) and  Sec. 63.138(c).</p><p class="depth3">Note to paragraph (a)(2):</p><p class="depth3">The requirements for Table 8 and/or Table 9 compounds are similar  and often identical.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Biological treatment processes. Biological treatment processes  in compliance with this section may be either open or closed biological  treatment processes as defined in Sec. 63.111. An open biological  treatment process in compliance with this section need not be covered  and vented to a control device as required in Sec. 63.133 through  Sec. 63.137 of this subpart. An open or a closed biological treatment  process in compliance with this section and using Sec. 63.145(f) or  Sec. 63.145(g) of this subpart to demonstrate compliance is not subject  to the requirements of Sec. 63.133 through Sec. 63.137 of this subpart.  A closed biological treatment process in compliance with this section  and using Sec. 63.145(e) of this subpart to demonstrate compliance shall  comply with the requirements of Sec. 63.133 through Sec. 63.137 of this  subpart. Waste management units upstream of an open or closed biological  treatment process shall meet the requirements of Sec. 63.133 through  Sec. 63.137 of this subpart, as applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Performance tests and design evaluations. If design steam  stripper option (Sec. 63.138(d)) or Resource Conservation and Recovery  Act (RCRA) option (Sec. 63.138(h)) is selected to comply with this  section, neither a design evaluation nor a performance test is required.  For any other non-biological treatment process, and for closed  biological treatment processes as defined in Sec. 63.111 of this  subpart, the owner or operator shall conduct either a design evaluation  as specified in Sec. 63.138(j), or a performance test as specified in  Sec. 63.145, of this subpart. For each open biological treatment process  as defined in Sec. 63.111 of this subpart, the owner or operator shall  conduct a performance test as specified in Sec. 63.145 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth3">Note to paragraph (a)(4):</p><p class="depth3">Some open biological treatment processes may not require a  performance test. Refer to Sec. 63.145(h) and table 36 of this subpart  to determine whether the biological treatment process meets the criteria  that exempt the owner or operator from conducting a performance test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Control device requirements. When gases are vented from the  treatment process, the owner or operator shall comply with the  applicable control device requirements specified in Sec. 63.139 and  Sec. 63.145 (i) and (j), and the applicable leak inspection provisions  specified in Sec. 63.148, of this subpart. This requirement does not  apply to any open biological treatment process that meets the mass  removal requirements. Vents from anaerobic biological treatment  processes may be routed through hard-piping to a fuel gas system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Residuals: general. When residuals result from treating Group 1  wastewater streams, the owner or operator shall comply with the  requirements for residuals specified in Sec. 63.138(k) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)(i)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For combinations of treatment processes, the wastewater  stream shall be conveyed by hard-piping between the treatment processes.

The owner or operator shall include this information as part of  the treatment process description reported in the Notification of  Compliance Status.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The performance test or design evaluation shall determine  compliance across the combination of treatment processes or control  devices. If a performance test is conducted, the ``inlet'' shall be the  point at which the wastewater stream or residual enters the first  treatment process, or the vented gas stream enters the first control  device. The ``outlet'' shall be the point at which the treated  wastewater stream exits the last treatment process, or the vented gas  stream exits the last control device.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For combinations of treatment processes, each treatment  process shall meet the applicable requirements of Sec. 63.133 through  Sec. 63.137 of this subpart except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of  this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The owner or operator shall identify, and keep a record of, the  combination of treatment processes, including identification of the  first and last treatment process. The owner or operator shall include  this information as part of the treatment process description reported  in the Notification of Compliance Status.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The owner or operator shall determine the mass removed or  destroyed by each treatment process. The performance test or design  evaluation shall determine compliance for the combination of treatment  processes by adding together the mass removed or destroyed by each  treatment process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)</em> of this section for the control of Table 9 compounds at  new or existing sources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Reduce, by removal or destruction, the total concentration of  Table 9 compounds to a level less than 50 parts per million by weight as  determined by the procedures specified in Sec. 63.145(b) of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> This option shall not be used when the treatment process is a  biological treatment process.
