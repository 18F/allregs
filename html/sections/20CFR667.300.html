All States and other direct grant recipients must  report financial, participant, and performance data in accordance with  instructions issued by DOL. Required reports must be submitted no more  frequently than quarterly within a time period specified in the  reporting instructions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Subrecipient reporting. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A State or other direct grant  recipient may impose different forms or formats, shorter due dates, and  more frequent reporting requirements on subrecipients. However, the  recipient is required to meet the reporting requirements imposed by DOL.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a State intends to impose different reporting requirements,  it must describe those reporting requirements in its State WIA plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Financial reports. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each grant recipient must submit  financial reports.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2))</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reported expenditures and program income, including any profits  earned, must be on the accrual basis of accounting and cumulative by  fiscal year of appropriation. If the recipient's accounting records are  not normally kept on the accrual basis of accounting, the recipient must  develop accrual information through an analysis of the documentation on  hand.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Due date. Financial reports and participant data reports are due  no later than 45 days after the end of each quarter unless otherwise  specified in reporting instructions. A final financial report is  required 90 days after the expiration of a funding period or the  termination of grant support.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Annual performance progress report.

Sanctions related to State performance or failure to submit these  reports timely cannot result in a total grant reduction of more than  five percent. Any sanction would be in addition to having to repay the  amount of any incentive funds granted based on the invalid report.</p>
