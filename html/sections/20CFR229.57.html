The spouse overall minimum benefit amount, after adjustment for the family maximum and for age, is reduced by the employee-only overall minimum rate on the spouse's own earnings record (the employee benefit adjusted for age and social security benefits) plus the amount of any social security benefit payable to the spouse on other than the empoyee's earnings record.</p>
