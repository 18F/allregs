                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As has been noted above, the term ``agriculture'' includes other  practices performed by a farmer or on a farm as an incident to or in  conjunction with the farming operations conducted by such farmer or on  such farm in addition to the practices listed in section 3(f). The  selling (including selling at roadside stands or by mail order and house  to house selling) by a farmer and his employees of his agricultural  commodities, dairy products, etc., is such a practice provided it does  not amount to a separate business. Other such practices are office work  and maintenance and protective work. Section 3(f) includes, for example,  secretaries, clerks, bookkeepers, night watchmen, maintenance workers,  engineers, and others who are employed by a farmer or on a farm if their  work is part of the agricultural activity and is subordinate to the  farming operations of such farmer or on such farm. (Damutz v. Pinchbeck,  66 F. Supp. 667, aff'd. 158 F. 2d 882). Employees of a farmer who repair  the mechanical implements used in farming, as a subordinate and  necessary task incident to their employer's farming operations, are  within section 3(f). It makes no difference that the work is done by a  separate labor force in a repair shop maintained for the purpose,   where the size of the farming operations is such as to justify it. Only  employees engaged in the repair of equipment used in performing  agricultural functions would be within section 3(f), however; employees  repairing equipment used by the employer in industrial or other  nonfarming activities would be outside the scope of agriculture. (Maneja  v. Waialua, 349 U.S. 254.) The repair of equipment used by other farmers  in their farming operations would not qualify as an agricultural  practice incident to the farming operations of the farmer employing the  repair workers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following are other examples of practices which may qualify  as ``agriculture'' under the secondary meaning in section 3(f), when  done on a farm, whether done by a farmer or by a contractor for the  farmer, so long as they do not relate to farming operations on any other  farms: The operation of a cook camp for the sole purpose of feeding  persons engaged exclusively in agriculture on that farm; artificial  insemination of the farm animals; custom corn shelling and grinding of  feed for the farmer; the packing of apples by portable packing machines  which are moved from farm to farm packing only apples grown on the  particular farm where the packing is being performed; the culling,  catching, cooping, and loading of poultry; the threshing of wheat; the  shearing of sheep; the gathering and baling of straw.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> It must be emphasized with respect to all practices performed on  products for which exemption is claimed that they must be performed only  on the products produced or raised by the particular farmer or on the  particular farm (Mitchell v. Huntsville Nurseries, 267 F. 2d 286; Bowie  v. Gonzalez, 117 F. 2d 11; Mitchell v. Hunt, 263 F. 2d 913; NLRB v. Olaa  Sugar Co., 242 F. 2d 714; Farmers Reservoir Co. v. McComb, 337 U.S. 755;  Walling v. Peacock Corp., 58 F. Supp. 880; Lenroot v. Hazelhurst  Mercantile Co., 153 F. 2d 153; Jordan v. Stark Bros. Nurseries, 45 F.  Supp. 769).</p>
