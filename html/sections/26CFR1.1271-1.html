                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Intention to call before maturity--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes  of section 1271(a)(2), all or a portion of gain realized on a sale or  exchange of a debt instrument to which section 1271 applies is treated  as interest income if there was an intention to call the debt instrument  before maturity. An intention to call a debt instrument before maturity  means a written or oral agreement or understanding not provided for in  the debt instrument between the issuer and the original holder of the  debt instrument that the issuer will redeem the debt instrument before  maturity. In the case of debt instruments that are part of an issue, the  agreement or understanding must be between the issuer and the original  holders of a substantial amount of the debt instruments in the issue. An  intention to call before maturity can exist even if the intention is  conditional (e.g., the issuer's decision to call depends on the  financial condition of the issuer on the potential call date) or is not  legally binding. For purposes of this section, original holder means the  first holder (other than an underwriter or dealer that purchased the  debt instrument for resale in the ordinary course of its trade or  business).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> does not apply to--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A debt instrument that is publicly offered (as defined in Sec.  1.1275-1(h));</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A debt instrument to which section 1272(a)(6) applies (relating  to certain interests in or mortgages held by a REMIC, and certain other  debt instruments with payments subject to acceleration); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A debt instrument sold pursuant to a private placement  memorandum that is distributed to more than ten offerees and that is  subject to the sanctions of section 12(2) of the Securities Act of 1933  (15 U.S.C. 77l) or the prohibitions of section 10(b) of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78j).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Short-term obligations--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Under sections 1271  (a)(3) and (a)(4), all or a portion of the gain realized on the sale or  exchange of a short-term government or nongovernment obligation is  treated as interest income. Sections 1271 (a)(3) and (a)(4), however, do  not apply to any short-term obligation subject to section 1281. See  Sec. 1.1272-1(f) for rules to determine if an obligation is a short- term obligation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Method of making elections. Elections to accrue on a constant  yield basis under sections 1271 (a)(3)(E) and (a)(4)(D) are made on an  obligation-by-obligation basis by reporting the transaction on the basis  of daily compounding on the taxpayer's timely filed Federal income tax  return for the year of the sale or exchange. These elections are  irrevocable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> or OID under section  1271(a)(4), any reasonable counting convention may be used (e.g., 30  days per month/360 days per year).
