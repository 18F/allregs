                                Sec. 1.466-1  Method of accounting for the redemption cost of qualified
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. Section 466 permits taxpayers who elect to use the  method of accounting description in section 466 to deduct the redemption  cost (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) of qualified discount  coupons (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) outstanding at the  end of the taxable year and redeemed during the redemption period  (within the meaning of   paragraph (d)(2) of this section) in addition to the redemption cost of  qualified discount coupons redeemed during the taxable year which were  not deducted for a prior taxable year. For the taxable year in which the  taxpayer first uses this method of accounting, the taxpayer is not  allowed to deduct the redemption costs of qualified discount coupons  redeemed during the taxable year that would have been deductible for the  prior taxable year had the taxpayer used this method of accounting for  such prior year. (See paragraph (e) of this section for rules describing  how this amount should be taken into account.) A taxpayer must use the  accrual method of accounting for any trade or business for which an  election is made under section 466. Furthermore, the taxpayer must make  an election in accordance with the rules in section 466(d) and  Sec. 1.466-3 for that trade or business. The method of accounting in  section 466 is applicable only to the taxpayer's redemption of qualified  discount coupons. Section 466 does not apply to trading stamps or  premium coupons, which are subject to the method of accounting in  Sec. 1.451-4, or to discount coupons that are not qualified discount  coupons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Redemption costs--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Costs deductible under section 466. The  deduction allowed by section 466 applies only to the redemption cost of  qualified discount coupons. The term ``redemption cost'' means an amount  equal to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The lesser of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount of the discount stated on the coupon, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The cost incurred by the taxpayer for paying the discount; plus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount payable to the retailer (or other person redeeming  the coupon from the person receiving the price discount) for services in  redeeming the coupon.  The amount payable to the retailer or other person for services in  redeeming the coupon is allowed only if the amount payable is stated on  the coupon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Costs not deductible under section 466. The term ``redemption  cost'' includes only the amounts stated in paragraph (b)(1) of this  section. Amounts other than those mentioned in paragraph (b)(1) of this  section cannot be deducted under the method of accounting described in  section 466 even though such amounts are incurred in relation to the  redemption of qualified discount coupons. Therefore, those amounts must  be taken into account as if section 466 did not apply. Examples of such  amounts are fees paid to the redemption center or clearinghouse and  amounts payable to the retailer in excess of the amount stated on the  coupon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Qualified discount coupons--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. In order for a  discount coupon (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section) to  be considered a qualified discount coupon, all of the following  requirements must be met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The coupon must have been issued by and must be redeemable by  the taxpayer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The coupon must allow a discount on the purchase price of  merchandise or other tangible personal property;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The face amount of the coupon must not exceed five dollars;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The coupon, by its terms, may not be used with other coupons to  bring about a price discount reimbursable by the issuer of more than  five dollars with respect to any item; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> There must exist a redemption chain (as defined in paragraph  (c)(2)(ii) of this section) with respect to the coupon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definitions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Discount coupon. A discount coupon is a sales  promotion device used to encourage the purchase of a specific product by  allowing a purchaser of that product to receive a discount on its  purchase price. The term ``discount coupon'' does not include trading  stamps or premium coupons, which are subject to the method of accounting  in Sec. 1.451-4. A discount coupon may or may not be issued as part of a  prior purchase. A discount coupon normally entitles its holders to  receive nothing more than a reduction in the sales price of one of the  issuer's products. The discount may be stated in terms of a cash amount,  a percentage or fraction of the purchase price, a ``two for the price of  one'' deal, or any other similar provision. A discount coupon need not  be printed on paper in the form usually associated with coupons; it may  be a token or other object so long as it functions as a coupon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Redemption chain. A redemption chain exists when the issuer  redeems the coupon from some person other than the customer who used the  coupon to receive the price discount. Thus, in order to be treated as a  qualified discount coupon, the coupon must not be issued by the person  that initially redeems the coupon from the customer. For purposes of  determining whether a redemption chain exists, corporations that are  members of the same controlled group of corporations (as defined in  section 1563(a)) as the issuer of the coupon shall be treated as the  issuer. Thus, if the issuer of the coupon and the retailer that  initially redeems the coupon from the customer are members of the same  controlled group of corporations, the coupon shall not be treated as a  qualified discount coupon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Deduction for coupons redeemed during the redemption period--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  General rule. Two special conditions must be met before the cost of  redeeming qualified discount coupons during the redemption period can be  deducted from the taxpayer's gross income for the taxable year preceding  the redemption period. First, the qualified discount coupons must have  been outstanding at the close of such taxable year. Second, the  qualified discount coupons must have been received by the taxpayer  before the close of the redemption period for that taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Redemption period. The taxpayer can select any redemption period  so long as the period does not extend longer than 6 months after the  close of the taxapayer's taxable year. A change in the redemption period  so selected shall be treated as a change in method of accounting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Coupons received. The deduction provided for in section  466(a)(1) is limited to the redemption costs associated with coupons  that are actually received by the taxpayer within the redemption period.  For purposes of this paragraph, if the issuer uses a redemption agent or  clearinghouse to group, count, and verify coupons after they have been  redeemed by a retailer, the coupons received by the redemption agent or  clearinghouse will be  considered to have been received by the issuer. Nothing in section 466,  however, allows deductions to be made on the basis of estimated  redemptions, whether such estimates are made by either the issuer or  some other party.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Transitional adjustment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. An election to change  from some other method of accounting for the redemption of discount  coupons to the method of accounting described in section 466 is a change  in method of accounting that requires a transitional adjustment. Unless  the taxpayer can qualify for a waiver of the suspense account  requirement as provided for in section 373(c) of the Revenue Act of 1978  (92 Stat. 2865), the taxpayer should compute the transitional adjustment  described in section 481(a)(2) according to the rules contained in this  section. This adjustment should be taken into account according to the  special rules in subsections (e) and (f) of section 466.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> would result in a net increase in  taxable income of $100 for 1980. Under these facts, A should increase  taxable income for 1980 and each of the next nine taxable years by $10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Suspense account--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. In the case of a transitional  adjustment that would result in a net decrease in taxable income under  section 481(a)(2) for the year of change, in lieu of applying section  481, the taxpayer must establish a separate suspense account for each  trade or business for which the taxpayer has made an election to use  section 466. The computation of the initial opening balance in the  suspense account is described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this  section. An initial adjustment to gross income for the year of election  is described in paragaph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.   Annual adjustments to the suspense account are described in paragraph  (e)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, and gross income adjustments are  described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B) of this section. Examples are  provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section. The effect of the suspense  account is to defer some part of, or all of, the deduction of the  transitional adjustment until the taxpayer no longer redeems discount  coupons in connection with the trade or business to which the suspense  account relates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Establishing a suspense account--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Initial opening balance.  To compute the initial opening balance of the suspense account for the  first taxable year for which the election to use section 466 is  effective, the taxpayer must determine the dollar amount of the  deduction that would have been allowed for qualified discount coupon  redemption costs during the redemption period for each of the three  immediately preceding taxable years had the election to use section 466  been in effect for those years. The initial opening balance of the  suspense account is the largest such dollar amount reduced by the sum of  the adjustments attributable to the change in method of accounting that  increase income for the year of change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Initial year adjustment. If, in computing the initial opening  balance, the largest dollar amount of deduction that would have been  allowed in any of the three prior years exceeds the actual cost of  redeeming qualified discount coupons received during the redemption  period following the close of the year immediately preceding the year of  election, the excess is included in income in the year of election.  Section 481(b) does not apply to this increase in gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Annual adjustments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Adjustment to the suspense account.  Adjustments are made to the suspense account each year to account for  fluctuations in coupon redemptions. To compute the annual adjustment,  the taxpayer must determine the amount to be deducted under section  466(a)(1) for the taxable year. If the amount is less than the opening  balance in the suspense account for the taxable year, the balance in the  suspense account is reduced by the difference. Conversely, if such  amount is greater than the opening balance in the suspense account for  the taxable year, the account is increased by the difference (but not to  an amount in excess of the initial opening balance described in  paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section). Therefore, the balance in the  suspense account will never be greater than the initial opening balance  in the suspense account determined in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this  section. However, the balance in the suspense account after adjustments  may be less than this initial opening balance in the suspense account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Gross income adjustments. Adjustments to the suspense account  for years subsequent to the year of the election also produce  adjustments in the taxpayer's gross income. Adjustments which reduce the  balance in the suspense account reduce gross income for the year in  which the adjustment to the suspense account is made. Adjustments which  increase the balance in the suspense account increase gross income for  the year in which the adjustment to the suspense account is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. (i) The provisions of paragraph (e)(3) of this section  may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Assume that the issuer of qualified discount coupons  makes a timely election under section 466 for its taxable year ending  December 31, 1979, and does not select a coupon redemption period  shorter than the statutory period of 6 months. Assume further that the  taxpayer's qualified discount coupon redemption costs in the first 6  months of 1977, 1978, and 1979 were $7, $13, and $8 respectively, and  that the accounting change adjustments that increase income for 1979 are  $10. Since the accounting change adjustment that increases income for  1979, ($10), is greater than the taxpayer's discount coupon redemptions  during the first 6 months of 1979 ($8), the net section 481(a)(2)  adjustment for the year of change results in a positive adjustment.  Because of this, a suspense account is not required. The taxpayer should  instead follow the rules in section 466(f) and in paragraph (e)(2) of  this section in order to take this positive transitional adjustment into  account.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that the  sum of the accounting change adjustments that increase income for 1979  is equal to $2. Under these facts the initial opening balance in the  suspense account on January 1, 1979 would be $11 (that is, the largest  dollar amount of qualified coupon redemption costs in the pertinent   years ($13), reduced by the sum of the accounting change adjustments  that increase income in the year of change ($2)). Since the coupon  redemption costs taken into account in determining the initial opening  balance ($13 in 1979) exceed the actual redemption costs in the first 6  months of the taxable year for which the election is first effective ($8  in 1979), the excess of $5 is added to gross income for the year of  election (1979).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume, in addition to the facts of Example 2, that  coupon redemption costs during the redemption period for the 1979  taxable year are $7. Since the qualifying redemption costs ($7) during  the redemption period for the taxable year are less than the opening  balance in the suspense account ($11) the taxpayer must reduce the  suspense account balance by the difference ($4). The taxpayer is also  allowed to take a deduction equal to the amount of this adjustment to  the suspense account. Thus, the net amount deductible for the 1979  taxable year after taking into account the coupon redemptions during the  redemption period, the amount deductible because of the decrease in the  suspense account, and the initial year adjustment determined in Example  2 is $6 ($7+$4-$5).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Assume, in addition to the facts of Example 3, that  coupon redemption costs during the redemption period for the 1980  taxable year are $10. Since the qualifying redemption costs during the  redemption period for the taxable year ($10) exceed the opening balance  of the suspense account at the beginning of the taxable year ($7), the  suspense account must be increased by the difference ($3). The taxpayer  must also include $3 in gross income for the taxable year. Thus, the net  amount deductible for the 1980 taxable year is $7 ($10-$3).</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Assume, in addition to the facts of Example 4, that  coupon redemption costs during the redemption period for the 1981  taxable year are $12. Since the qualifying redemption costs for the 1961  taxable year ($12) exceed the opening balance of the suspense account at  the beginning of the taxable year ($10), the suspense account must be  increased by the difference ($2) but not above the initial opening  balance ($11). Thus, the taxpayer will increase the balance by $1. The  taxpayer must also include $1 in gross income for the taxable year.  Thus, the net amount deductible for the 1981 taxable year is $11 ($12- $1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The following table summarizes examples (2) through (5):  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Years ending Dec. 31--</p><p class="depth0">-----------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">1977   1978   1979   1980   1981   1982 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Facts:</p><p class="depth0">Actual coupon redemption       $7    $13     $8     $7    $10    $12</p><p class="depth0">costs in first six months</p><p class="depth0">Accounting change           .....  .....      2  .....  .....  .....</p><p class="depth0">adjustments that increase</p><p class="depth0">income in year of change.</p><p class="depth0">-----------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Net adjustment decreasing   .....  .....      6  .....  .....  .....</p><p class="depth0">income in year of change</p><p class="depth0">under sec. 481(a)(2).....</p><p class="depth0">----------------------------------------- Adjustment to suspense</p><p class="depth0">account:</p><p class="depth0">Opening balance...........  .....  .....     11      7     10     11</p><p class="depth0">Addition to account.......  .....  .....  .....      3      1  .....</p><p class="depth0">Reduction to account......  .....  .....

If a transfer of  substantially all the assets of a trade or business in which discount  coupons are redeemed is made to an acquiring corporation, and if the  acquiring corporation determines its bases in these assets, in whole or  part, with reference to the basis of these assets in the hands of the  transferor, then for the purposes of section 466(e) the principles of  section 381 and Sec. 1.381(c)(4)-1 will apply. The application of this  rule is not limited to the transactions described in section 381(a).   Thus, the rule also applies, for example, to transactions described in  section 351.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rules. If, in the case of a transaction described in  paragraph (f)(1) of this section, an acquiring corporation acquires  assets that were used in a trade or business that was not subject to a  section 466 election from a transferor that is owned or controlled  directly (or indirectly through a chain of corporations) by the same  interests, and if the acquiring corporation uses the acquired assets in  a trade or business for which the acquiring corporation later makes an  election to use section 466, then the acquiring corporation must  establish a suspense account by taking into account not only its own  experience but also the transferor's experience when the transferor held  the assets in its trade or business. Furthermore, the transferor is not  allowed a deduction for qualified discount coupons redeemed after the  date of the transfer attributable to discount coupons issued by the  transferor before the date of the transfer. Such redemptions shall be  considered to be made by the acquiring corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Example. The provisions of paragraph (f)(2) of this section may  be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Corporation S, a calendar year taxpayer, is a wholly owned  subsidiary of Corporation P, a calendar year taxpayer. On December 31,  1982, S acquires from P sustantially all of the assets used in a trade  or business in which qualified disount coupons are redeemed. P had not  made an election under section 466 with respect to the redemption costs  of the qualified discount coupons issued in connection with that trade  or business. S makes an election to use section 466 for its taxable year  ending December 31, 1983, for the trade or business in which the  acquired assets are used, and selects a redemption period of 6 months.  Assume that P's qualified discount coupon redemption costs in the first  6 months of 1981 and 1982 were $120 and $140 respectively. Assume  further that S's qualified discount coupon redemption costs in the first  6 months of 1983 were $130, and that there are no accounting change  adjustments that increase income with respect to the election. S must  establish a suspense account by taking into account the largest dollar  amount of deductions that would have been allowed under section  466(a)(1) for the 3 immediately preceding taxable years of P, including  both P's and S's experience with respect to costs actually incurred  during the redemption periods relating to those years. Thus, the initial  opening balance of S's suspense account is $140. S must also make an  initial year adjustment of $10 ($140-$130), which S must include in  income for S's taxable year ending December 31, 1983. P may not take a  deduction for the qualified coupon redemptions made after December 31,  1982, that are attributable to coupons issued by P before December 31,  1982. Thus, none of the $130 qualified discount coupon redemption costs  incurred by S during the first six months of 1983 may be deducted by P.
