                                731.770  OMB Circular A-122, cost principles for nonprofit
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Paragraph 6 of the transmittal letter for OMB Circular A-122  specifies that ``Agencies shall designate a liaison official to serve as  the agency representative on matters relating to the implementation of  this Circular.'' The Director, Bureau for Management, Office of  Acquisition and Assistance, has been so designated. The Bureau for  Management, Office of Acquisition and Assistance, Cost Audit Support  Division, Overhead and Special Cost and Contract Close-Out Branch (M/ OAA/CAS/OCC) provides staff assistance to the Director concerning OMB  Circular A-122. M/OAA/CAS/OCC is also responsible for obtaining  cognizance under the criteria in the transmittal letter for OMB Circular  A-122; for liaison with other cognizant agencies; for authorizing  exclusion of OMB Circular A-122 coverage for a particular nonprofit  organization pursuant to paragraph 5 of the OMB Circular A-122  transmittal letter; and for advice and assistance in applying OMB  Circular A-122 cost principles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Paragraph 4b of the OMB Circular A-122 transmittal letter  contains a definition of prior approval as follows:</p><p class="depth2">Prior approval means securing the awarding agency's permission in  advance to incur costs for those items that are designated as requiring  prior approval by OMB Circular A-122. Generally, this permission will be  in writing. Where an item of cost requiring prior approval is specified  in the budget of an award, approval of the budget constitute approval of  that cost.   Consequently, an award containing a budget constitutes prior approval of  the direct cost item in the budget, unless otherwise annotated.  Accordingly, award budgets should be appropriately annotated  substantially as follows:</p><p class="depth2">Inclusion of any cost in the line item budget of this award does not  obviate the requirement for prior approval of cost items designated as  requiring prior approval by OMB Circular A-122 ; or</p><p class="depth2">In accordance with the requirements to OMB Circular No. A-122,  approval is granted to incur costs for (name specific item or items)  which are included in the budget of this award.
