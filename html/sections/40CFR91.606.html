                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Engines comprising a test sample will be selected at the location and in the manner specified in the test order. If a manufacturer determines that the test engines cannot be selected in the manner specified in the test order, an alternative selection procedure may be employed, provided the manufacturer requests approval of the alternative procedure prior to the start of test sample selection, and the Administrator approves the procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The manufacturer must produce and assemble the test engines of the family selected for testing using its normal production and assembly process for engines to be distributed into commerce. If, between the time the manufacturer is notified of a test order and the time the manufacturer finishes selecting test engines, the manufacturer implements any change(s) in its production or assembly processes, including quality control, which may reasonably be expected to affect the emissions of the engines selected, then the manufacturer must, during the audit, inform the Administrator of such changes. If the test engines are selected at a location where they do not have their operational and emission control systems installed, the test order will specify the manner and location for selection of components to complete assembly of the engines. The manufacturer must assemble these components onto the test engines using normal assembly and quality control procedures as documented by the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No quality control, testing, or assembly procedures will be used on the test engine or any portion thereof, including parts and subassemblies, that have not been or will not be used during the production and assembly of all other engines of that family, unless the Administrator approves the modification in production or assembly procedures pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The test order may specify that an EPA enforcement officer(s) or authorized representative(s), rather than the manufacturer, select the test engines according to the method specified in the test order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The order in which test engines are selected determines the order in which test results are to be used in applying the sampling plan in accordance with Sec. 91.608.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The manufacturer must keep on hand all untested engines, if any, comprising the test sample until a pass or fail decision is reached in accordance with Sec. 91.608(e). The manufacturer may ship any tested engine which has not failed the requirements as set forth in Sec. 91.608(b). However, once the manufacturer ships any test engine, it relinquishes the prerogative to conduct retests as provided in Sec. 91.607(i).</p>
