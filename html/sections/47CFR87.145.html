                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each transmitter must be certificated for use in these services,  except as listed in paragraph (c) of this section. However, aircraft  stations which transmit on maritime mobile frequencies must use  transmitters certificated for use in ship stations in accordance with  part 80 of this chapter. Certification under part 80 is not required for  aircraft earth stations transmitting on maritime mobile-satellite  frequencies. Such stations must be certificated under part 87.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Some radio equipment installed on air carrier aircraft must meet  the requirements of the Commission and the requirements of the FAA. The  FAA requirements may be obtained from the FAA, Aircraft Maintenance  Division, 800 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC 20591.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The equipment listed below is exempted from certification. The  operation of transmitters which have not been certificated must not  result in harmful interference due to the failure of those transmitters  to comply with technical standards of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Flight test station transmitters for limited periods where  justified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> U.S. Government transmitters furnished in the performance of a  U.S. Government contract if the use of certificated equipment would  increase the cost of the contract or if the transmitter will be  incorporated in the finished product. However, such equipment must meet  the technical standards contained in this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ELTs verified in accordance with Sec. 87.147(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Signal generators when used as radionavigation land test  stations (MTF).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Aircraft earth stations must correct their transmit frequencies  for Doppler effect relative to the satellite. The transmitted signal may  not deviate more than 335 Hz from the desired transmit frequency. (This  is a root sum square error which assumes zero error for the received  ground earth station signal and includes the AES transmit/receive  frequency reference error and the AES automatic frequency control  residual errors.) The applicant must attest that the equipment provides  adequate Doppler effect compensation and where applicable, that  measurements have been made that demonstrate compliance. Submission of  data demonstrating compliance is not required unless requested by the  Commission.  [63 FR 36607, July 7, 1998, as amended at 69 FR 32881, June 14, 2004]</p>
