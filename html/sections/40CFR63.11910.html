                            <p class="depth0">You must comply with the requirements specified in Table 3 to this  subpart for each storage vessel in HAP service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> through (4) of this section. If you  elect to use a fixed roof storage vessel vented to a closed vent system  and control device, the closed vent system and control device must meet  the requirements in Secs. 63.11925 through 63.11950.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Design requirements. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The fixed roof must be installed in a  manner such that there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open  spaces between roof section joints or between the interface of the roof  edge and the tank wall.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each opening in the fixed roof must be equipped with a closure  device designed to operate such that when the closure device is secured  in the closed position there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps, or  other open spaces in the closure device or between the perimeter of the  opening and the closure device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Operating requirements. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as specified in paragraph  (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the fixed roof must be installed with each  closure device secured in the closed position.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)(A)</em> and (B)  of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A closure device may be opened or the roof may be removed when  needed to provide access.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A conservation vent that vents to the atmosphere is allowed  during normal operations to maintain the tank internal operating  pressure within tank design specifications. Normal operating conditions  that may require these devices to open are during those times when the  internal pressure of the storage vessel is outside the internal pressure  operating range for the storage vessel as a result of loading or  unloading operations or diurnal ambient temperature fluctuations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)(A)</em> and (B) of this section. You must keep the records  specified in Sec. 63.11990(b)(6).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Do not add material to the storage vessel during periods of  planned routine maintenance.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Limit periods of planned routine maintenance for each control  device to no more than 360 hours per year (hr/yr).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inspection and monitoring requirements. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Visually inspect the  fixed roof and its closure devices for defects initially and at least  once per calendar year except as specified in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of  this section. Defects include, but are not limited to, visible cracks,  holes, or gaps in the roof sections or between the roof and the wall of  the storage vessel; broken, cracked or otherwise damaged seals, or  gaskets on closure devices; and broken or missing hatches, access  covers, caps or other closure devices.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)(A)</em> and (B) of this  section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> You prepare and maintain at the plant site written documentation  that identifies all parts of the fixed roof that are unsafe to inspect  and explains why such parts are unsafe to inspect.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> You develop and implement a written plan and schedule to conduct  inspections the next time alternative storage capacity becomes available  and the storage vessel can be emptied or temporarily removed from  service, as necessary, to complete the inspection. The required  inspections must be performed as frequently as practicable but do not  need to be performed more than once per calendar year. You must maintain  a copy of the written plan and schedule at the plant site.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> except as provided in  paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Repair of a defect may be delayed beyond 45 days if you  determine that repair of the defect requires emptying or temporary  removal from service of the storage vessel and no alternative storage  capacity is available at the site to accept the removed material. In  this case, repair the defect the next time alternative storage capacity  becomes available and the storage vessel can be emptied or temporarily  removed from service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you elect to use an internal floating roof storage vessel or  external floating roof storage vessel to comply with the requirements  specified in Table 3 to this subpart, you must meet all requirements of  Secs. 63.1060 through 63.1067 of subpart WW of this part for internal  floating roof storage vessels or external floating roof storage vessels,  as applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> through (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whenever the pressure vessel is in hazardous air pollutants  (HAP) service, you must operate the pressure vessel as a closed system  that does not vent to the atmosphere, e.g., during filling, emptying and  purging. The vent stream during filling, emptying and   purging must meet the requirements of Sec. 63.11925(a) and (b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each opening in the pressure vessel must be equipped with a  closure device designed to operate such that when the closure device is  secured in the closed position there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps  or other open spaces in the closure device or between the perimeter of  the opening and the closure device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All potential leak interfaces must be monitored annually for  leaks using the procedures specified in Sec. 63.11915 and you may adjust  for background concentration. You must comply with the recordkeeping  provisions specified in Sec. 63.11990(b)(4) and the reporting provisions  specified in Sec. 63.11985(a)(1), (b)(1), and (b)(10).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Pressure vessel closure devices must not discharge to the  atmosphere. Any such release (e.g., leak) constitutes a violation of  this rule. You must submit to the Administrator as part of your  compliance report the information specified in Sec. 63.11985(b)(10).  This report is required even if you elect to follow the procedures  specified in Sec. 63.11895 to establish an affirmative defense.</p>
