The pressure drop must be monitored at least every 5 minutes during the test and hourly averages recorded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The owner or operator may augment the data obtained under paragraph (a)(4) of this section by conducting multiple performance tests to establish a range of compliant operating parameter values. The lowest value of this range would be selected as the operating parameter monitoring value. The use of historic compliance data may be used to establish the compliant operating parameter value if the previous values were recorded during performance tests using the same test methods specified in this subpart and established as required in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Compliance demonstration with opacity standards. (1)(i) The owner or operator subject to Sec. 63.1653 must conduct initial opacity observations of the shop building to demonstrate compliance with the applicable opacity standards according to Sec. 63.6(h)(5), which addresses the conduct of opacity or visible emission observations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In conducting the opacity observations of the shop building, the observer must limit his or her field of view to the area of the shop building roof monitor that corresponds to the placement of the affected submerged arc furnaces.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The owner or operator must conduct the opacity observations according to EPA Method 9 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, for a minimum of 60 minutes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> When demonstrating initial compliance with the shop building opacity standard, as required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the owner or operator must simultaneously establish parameter values for one of the following: the control system fan motor amperes and all capture system damper positions, the total volumetric flow rate to the air pollution control device and all capture system damper positions, or volumetric flow rate through each separately ducted hood that comprises the capture system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When demonstrating initial compliance with the shop building opacity standard, as required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the owner or operator must simultaneously establish parameter values for one of the following: the control system fan motor amperes and all capture system damper positions, the total volumetric flow rate to the air pollution control device and all capture system damper positions, or volumetric flow rate through each separately ducted hood that comprises the capture system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The owner or operator may petition the Administrator to reestablish these parameters whenever he or she can demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that the submerged arc furnace operating conditions upon which the parameters were previously established are no longer applicable. The values of these parameters determined during the most recent demonstration of compliance must be maintained at the appropriate level for each applicable period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator must demonstrate continuing compliance with the opacity standards by following the monitoring requirements specified in Sec. 63.1657(c) and the reporting and recordkeeping requirements specified in Sec.
