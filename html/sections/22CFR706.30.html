                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. OPIC ordinarily will respond to requests within twenty business days unless the request involves unusual circumstances as described in subparagraph (d) of this section. The response time will commence on the date that the request is received by the FOIA Office, but in any event not later than ten working days after the request is first received by OPIC. Any time tolled under paragraph (c) of this section does not count against OPIC's response time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Multitrack processing. OPIC has a track for requests that are granted expedited processing, in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. All non-expedited requests are processed on the regular track in the order they are received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Tolling of response time. OPIC may toll its response time once to seek clarification of a request in accordance with Sec. 706.11(b) or as needed to resolve fee issues in accordance with Sec. Sec. 706.22(c) and 706.23(d). The response time will resume upon OPIC's receipt of the requester's clarification or upon resolution of the fee issue.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Unusual circumstances. Whenever the statutory time limits for processing cannot be met because of ``unusual circumstances'' as defined in the FOIA, and OPIC extends the time limits on that basis, OPIC will notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which processing of the request can be expected to be completed. This notice will be sent before the expiration of the twenty day period to respond. Where the extension exceeds ten working days, the requester will be provided an opportunity to modify the request or agree to an alternative time period for processing. OPIC will make its designated FOIA contact and its FOIA

Public Liaison available for this purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Aggregating requests. For the purposes of satisfying unusual circumstances under the FOIA, OPIC may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. OPIC will not aggregate multiple requests that involve unrelated matters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Expedited processing. (1) Requests and appeals will be processed on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requests and appeals will be processed on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A request for expedited processing may be made at any time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. For example, under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that he or she is a person whose primary activity or occupation is information dissemination. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request--one that extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. A requester cannot satisfy the ``urgency to inform'' requirement solely by demonstrating that numerous articles have been published on a given subject. OPIC may waive the formal certification requirement at its discretion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> OPIC shall notify the requester within ten calendar days of the receipt of a request for expedited processing of its decision whether to grant or deny expedited processing. If expedited processing is granted, the request shall be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and shall be processed as soon as practicable. If OPIC denies expedited processing, any appeal of that decision which complies with the procedures set forth in Sec. 706.33 shall be acted on expeditiously.</p>
