Sec. 1.465-1T  Aggregation of certain activities (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. A partner in a partnership or an S corporation shareholder may aggregate and treat as a single activity--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The holding, production, or distribution of more than one motion picture film or video tape by the partnership or S corporation,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The farming (as defined in section 464 (e)) of more than one farm by the partnership or S corporation,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The exploration for, or exploitation of, oil and gas resources with respect to more than one oil and gas property by the partnership or S corporation, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The exploration for, or exploitation of, geothermal deposits (within the meaning of section 613(e)(3)) with respect to more than one geothermal property by the partnership or S corporation.
Thus, for example, if a partnership or S corporation is engaged in the activity of exploring for, or exploiting, oil and gas resources with respect to 10 oil and gas properties, a partner or S corporation shareholder may aggregate those properties and treat the aggregated oil and gas activities as a single activity. If that partnership or S corporation also is engaged in the activity of farming with respect to two farms, the partner or shareholder may aggregate the farms and treat the aggregated farming activities as a single separate activity. Except as provided in section 465(c)(2)(B)(ii), the partner or shareholder cannot aggregate the farming activity with the oil and gas activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Effective date. This section shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1983 and before January 1, 1985.
