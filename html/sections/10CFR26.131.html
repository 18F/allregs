                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each validity test result from the licensee testing facility  must be based on performing either a validity screening test or an  initial validity test, or both, on one or more aliquots of a urine  specimen. The licensee testing facility shall forward any specimen that  yields a questionable validity screening or initial validity test result  to the HHS-certified laboratory for further testing. Licensee testing  facilities need not perform validity screening tests before conducting  initial validity tests of a specimen.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> At a minimum, the licensee testing facility shall test each  urine specimen for creatinine, pH, and one or more oxidizing  adulterants. Licensees and other entities may not specify more stringent  cutoff levels for validity screening and initial validity tests than  those specified in this section. If tests or observations indicate one  or more of the following from either a validity screening test or an  initial validity test, the licensee testing facility shall forward the  specimen to the HHS-certified laboratory for additional testing:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Creatinine is less than 20 milligrams (mg) per deciliter (dL);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The pH of the specimen is either less than 4.5 or equal to or  greater than 9, using either a colorimetric pH test with a dynamic range  of 2 to 12 or pH meter that is capable of measuring pH to one decimal  place (for initial validity tests), or colorimetric pH tests, dipsticks,  and pH paper (for pH validity screening tests) that have a narrow  dynamic range;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Nitrite or other oxidant concentration is equal to or greater  than 200 micrograms (mcg) per mL or equal to or greater than 200 mcg/mL  nitrite-equivalents using either a nitrite colorimetric test or a  general oxidant colorimetric test;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The possible presence of an oxidizing adulterant (e.g., chromium  (VI), pyridine (pyridinium chlorochromate)) is determined using either a  general oxidant colorimetric test (with a cutoff equal to or greater  than 50 mcg/mL chromium (VI)-equivalents) or a chromium (VI)  colorimetric test (chromium (VI) concentration equal to or greater than  50 mcg/mL);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The possible presence of halogen (e.g., bleach, iodine,  fluoride) is determined using a general oxidant colorimetric test (with  a cutoff equal to or greater than 200 mcg/mL nitrite-equivalents or  equal to or greater than 50 mcg/mL chromium (VI)-equivalents), a halogen  colorimetric test (halogen concentration equal to or greater than the  limit of detection (LOD)), or the odor of the specimen;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The possible presence of glutaraldehyde is determined using  either an aldehyde test (aldehyde present) or the characteristic  immunoassay response is observed on one or more drug immunoassay tests;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The possible presence of a surfactant is determined by using a  surfactant colorimetric test with a cutoff equal to or greater than 100  mcg/mL dodecylbenzene sulfonate-equivalent or a foam/shake test; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The specimen shows evidence of adulterants, including, but not  limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Abnormal physical characteristics;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Reactions or responses characteristic of an adulterant obtained  during the validity screening or initial test; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A possible unidentified interfering substance or adulterant,  demonstrated by interference occurring on the immunoassay drug tests on  two separate aliquots (i.e., valid immunoassay drug test results cannot  be obtained).</p>
