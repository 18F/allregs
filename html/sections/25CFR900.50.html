As a result, subcontracts should contain a provision informing the recipient that their award is funded with Indian Self-Determination Act funds and that the recipient is responsible for identifying and ensuring compliance with applicable Federal laws, regulations, and Executive Orders. The Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization may, through negotiation, identify all or a portion of such requirements in the self-determination contract and, if so identified, these requirements should be identified in subcontracts.</p><p class="depth0">Property Management System Standards</p>
