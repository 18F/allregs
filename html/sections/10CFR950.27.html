                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The Department shall pay the covered costs associated with a Standby Support Contract in accordance with the Claim Determination issued by the Claims Administrator under Sec. 950.24 or the Final Claim Determination under Sec. 950.34, provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Neither the sponsor's claim for covered costs nor any other document submitted to support the underlying claim is fraudulent, collusive, made in bad faith, dishonest or otherwise designed to circumvent the purposes of the Act and regulations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The losses submitted for payment are within the scope of coverage issued by the Department under the terms and conditions of the Standby Support Contract as specified in subpart B of this part; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The procedures specified in this subpart have been followed and all conditions for payment have been met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adjustments to Payments. In the event of fraud or miscalculation, the Department may subsequently adjust, including an adjustment obligating the sponsor to repay any payment made under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Suspension of payment for covered costs. If the Department paid or is paying covered costs under paragraph (a) of this section, and subsequently makes a determination that a sponsor has failed to meet any of the requirements for payment specified in paragraph (a) of this section for a particular covered cost, the Department may suspend payment of covered costs pending investigation and audit of the sponsor's covered costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Amount payable. The Department's share of compensation for the initial two reactors is 100 percent of the covered costs of covered delay but not more than the coverage in the contract or $500 million per contract, whichever is less; and for the subsequent four reactors, not more than 50 percent of the covered costs of the covered delay but not more than the coverage in the contract or $250 million per contract, whichever is less. The Department's share of compensation for the subsequent four reactors is further limited in that the payment is for covered costs of a covered delay that occurs after the initial 180-day period of covered delay.</p>
