                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)))</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Your taxable year is presumed to be a calendar year until you  show to our satisfaction that you have a different taxable year. If you  are self-employed, your taxable year is a calendar year unless you have  a different taxable year for the purposes of subtitle A of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986. In either case, the number of months in a taxable  year is not affected by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The date a claim for Social Security benefits is filed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Attainment of any particular age;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Marriage or the termination of marriage; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Adoption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The month of death is counted as a month of the deceased  beneficiary's taxable year in determining whether the beneficiary had  excess earnings for the year under Sec. 404.430. For beneficiaries who  die after November 10, 1988, we use twelve as the number of months to  determine whether the beneficiary had excess earnings for the year under  Sec. 404.430.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Wages, as defined in Sec. 404.429(c), are charged as earnings  for the months and year in which you rendered the services. Net earnings  or net losses from self-employment count as earnings or losses in the  year for which such earnings or losses are reportable for Federal income  tax purposes.
