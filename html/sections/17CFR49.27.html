Intentional misstatements or omissions of material fact may constitute federal criminal violations (7 U.S.C. Sec. 13 and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1001) or grounds for disqualification from registration.</p><p class="depth3">DEFINITIONS</p><p class="depth3">Unless the context requires otherwise, all terms used in this Form SDR have the same meaning as in the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended, and in the Regulations of the Commission thereunder.</p><p class="depth3">For the purposes of this Form SDR, the term ``Applicant'' shall include any applicant for registration as a swap data repository or any registered swap data repository that is amending Form SDR.</p><p class="depth3">GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS</p><p class="depth3">1. Form SDR and Exhibits thereto are to be filed with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission by Applicants for registration as a swap data repository, or by a registered swap data repository amending such registration, pursuant to Section 21 of the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder. Upon the filing of an application for registration, the Commission will publish notice of the filing and afford interested persons an opportunity to submit written data, views and arguments concerning such application. No application for registration shall be effective unless the Commission, by order, grants such registration.</p><p class="depth3">2. Individuals' names shall be given in full (Last Name, First Name, Middle Name).</p><p class="depth3">3. Signatures must accompany each copy of the Form SDR filed with the Commission. If this Form SDR is filed by a corporation, it must be signed in the name of the corporation by a principal officer duly authorized; if filed by a limited liability company, this Form SDR must be signed in the name of the limited liability company by a member duly authorized to sign on the limited liability company's behalf; if filed by a partnership, this Form SDR must be signed in the name of the partnership by a general partner authorized; if filed by an unincorporated organization or association which is not a partnership, it must be signed in the name of the organization or association by the managing agent, i.e., a duly authorized person who directs, manages or who participates in the directing or managing of its affairs.</p><p class="depth3">4. If Form SDR is being filed as an initial application for registration, all applicable items must be answered in full. If any item is not applicable, indicate by ``none,'' ``not applicable,'' or ``N/A'' as appropriate.</p><p class="depth3">5. Under Section 21 of the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder, the Commission is authorized to solicit the information required to be supplied by this form from Applicants for registration as a swap data repository and from registered swap data repositories amending their registration. Disclosure of the information specified on this form is mandatory prior to processing of an application for registration as a swap data repository. The information will be used for the principal purpose of determining whether the Commission should grant or deny registration to an Applicant. The Commission may determine that additional information is required from the Applicant in order to process its application.

An Applicant is therefore encouraged to supplement this Form SDR with any additional information that may be significant to its operation as a swap data repository and to the Commission's review of its application. A Form SDR which is not prepared and executed in compliance with applicable requirements and instructions may be returned as not acceptable for filing. Acceptance of this Form SDR, however, shall not constitute any finding that the Form SDR has been filed as required or that the information submitted is true, current or complete.</p><p class="depth3">6. Except in cases where confidential treatment is requested by the Applicant and granted by the Commission pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and Commission Regulation Sec. 145.9, information supplied on this form will be included routinely in the public files of the Commission and will be available for inspection by any interested person. The Applicant must identify with particularity the information in these exhibits that will be subject to a request for confidential treatment and supporting documentation for such request pursuant to Commission Regulations Sec. 40.8, and Sec. 145.9.</p><p class="depth3">UPDATING INFORMATION ON THE FORM SDR</p><p class="depth3">1. Section 21 requires that if any information contained in Items 1 through 17, 23, 29, and Item 53 of this application, or any supplement or amendment thereto, is or becomes inaccurate for any reason, an amendment must be filed promptly, unless otherwise specified, on Form SDR correcting such information.</p><p class="depth3">2. Registrants filing Form SDR as an amendment (other than an annual amendment) need file only the first page of Form SDR, the signature page (Item 13), and any pages on which an answer is being amended, together with such exhibits as are being amended. The submission of an amendment represents that all unamended items and exhibits remain true, current and complete as previously filed.</p><p class="depth3">ANNUAL AMENDMENT ON THE FORM SDR</p><p class="depth3">Annual amendments on the Form SDR shall be submitted within 60 days of the end of the Applicant's fiscal year. Applicants must complete the first page and provide updated information or exhibits.</p><p class="depth3">An Applicant may request an extension of time for submitting the annual amendment with the Secretary of the Commission based on substantial, undue hardship. Extensions for filing annual amendments may be granted at the discretion of the Commission.</p><p class="depth3">WHERE TO FILE</p><p class="depth3">File registration application and appropriate exhibits electronically with the Commission at the Washington, D.C. headquarters in a format and in the manner specified by the Secretary of the Commission.
