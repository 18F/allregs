In the event either  the Secretary or the employer objects to the use of a Settlement Judge  procedure, such procedure shall not be imposed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Length of voluntary settlement procedures. The settlement  procedures under this section shall be for a period not to exceed 45  days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Mandatory settlement--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applicability.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of  these rules, upon the docketing of the notice of contest the Chief  Administrative Law Judge shall assign to the Settlement Part any case  which satisfies the criteria set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this  section. The Chief Administrative Law Judge shall appoint a Settlement  Judge, who shall be a Judge other than the one assigned to hear and  decide the case, except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Discovery proceedings to be followed by settlement proceedings.  The Settlement Judge shall issue a discovery scheduling order and  supervise all discovery proceedings. At the conclusion of discovery the  Settlement Judge will conduct settlement proceedings during a period not  to exceed 60 days. If, at the conclusion of the settlement proceedings  the case has not been settled the Settlement Judge shall promptly notify  the Chief Administrative Law Judge in accordance with paragraph (f) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Powers and duties of Settlement Judges. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Judge shall  confer with the parties on subjects and issues of whole or partial  settlement of the case and seek resolution of as many of the issues as  is feasible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Judge may require the parties to provide statements of the  issues in controversy and the factual predicate for each party's  position on each issue and may enter other orders as appropriate to  facilitate the proceedings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In voluntary settlement proceedings the Judge may allow or  suspend discovery during the settlement proceedings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Judge may suggest privately to each attorney or other  representative of a party what concessions his or her client should  consider and assess privately with each attorney or other representative  the reasonableness of the party's case or settlement position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Judge may, with the consent of the parties, conduct such  other settlement proceedings as may aid in the settlement of the case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Settlement conference--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General.

The Settlement Judge may also require  that the party's representative be accompanied by an official of the  party having full settlement authority on behalf of the party. The  parties and their representatives or attorneys are expected to be  completely candid with the Settlement Judge so that he may properly  guide settlement discussions. The failure to be present at a settlement  conference or otherwise to comply with the orders of the Settlement  Judge or the refusal to cooperate fully within the spirit of this rule  may result in the imposition of sanctions under Sec. 2200.101.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Confidentiality of settlement proceedings. All statements made  and all information presented during the course of settlement  proceedings under this section shall be regarded as confidential and  shall not be divulged outside of these proceedings except with the  consent of the parties. The Settlement Judge shall issue appropriate  orders to protect confidentiality of settlement proceedings. The  Settlement Judge shall not divulge any statements or information  presented during private negotiations with a party or his representative  during settlement proceedings except with the consent of that party. No  evidence of statements or conduct in settlement proceedings under this  section within the scope of Federal Rule of Evidence 408, no notes or  other material prepared by or maintained by the Settlement Judge in  connection with settlement proceedings, and no communications between  the Settlement Judge and the Chief Administrative Law Judge in  connection with settlement proceedings including the report of the  Settlement Judge under paragraph (f) of this section, will be admissible  in any subsequent hearing except by stipulation of the parties.  Documents disclosed in the settlement proceeding may not be used in  litigation unless obtained through appropriate discovery or subpoena.  With respect to the Settlement Judge's participation in settlement  proceedings, the Settlement Judge shall not discuss the merits of the  case with any other person, nor appear as a witness in any hearing of  the case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Record of settlement proceedings. No material of any form  required to be held confidential under paragraph (d)(3) of this section  shall be considered part of the official case record required to be  maintained under section 12(g) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. 661(g), nor shall  any such material be open to public inspection as required by section  12(g), unless the parties otherwise stipulate. With the exception of an  order approving the terms of any partial settlement agreed to between  the parties as set forth in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the  Settlement Judge shall not file or cause to be filed in the official  case record any material in his possession relating to these settlement  proceedings, including but not limited to communications with the Chief  Administrative Law Judge and his report under paragraph (f) of this  section, unless the parties otherwise stipulate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Report of Settlement Judge. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Settlement Judge shall  promptly notify the Chief Administrative Law Judge in writing of the  status of the case at the conclusion of the settlement period or such  time that he determines further negotiations would be fruitless. If the  Settlement Judge has made such a determination and a settlement  agreement is not achieved   within 45 days for voluntary settlement proceedings or 60 days for  mandatory settlement proceedings, the Settlement Judge shall then advise  the Chief Administrative Law Judge in writing. The Chief Administrative  Law Judge may then in his discretion allow an additional period of time,  not to exceed 30 days, for further proceedings under this section. If at  the expiration of the period allotted under this paragraph the  Settlement Judge has not approved a full settlement, he shall furnish to  the Chief Administrative Law Judge copies of any written stipulations  and orders embodying the terms of any partial settlement the parties  have reached.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At the termination of the settlement period without a full  settlement, the Chief Administrative Law Judge shall promptly assign the  case to an Administrative Law Judge other than the Settlement Judge or  Chief Administrative Law Judge for appropriate action on the remaining  issues. If all the parties, the Settlement Judge and the Chief  Administrative Law Judge agree, the Settlement Judge may be retained as  the Hearing Judge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Non-reviewability. Notwithstanding the provisions of  Sec. 2200.73 regarding interlocutory review, any decision concerning the  assignment of any Judge and any decision by the Settlement Judge to  terminate settlement proceedings under this section is not subject to  review, appeal, or rehearing.
