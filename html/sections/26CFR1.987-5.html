                                Sec. 1.987-5  Transition rules for certain qualified business units beginning before January 1, 1987.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Applicability--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. This section applies to qualified  business unit (QBU) branches of United States persons, whose functional  currency (as defined in section 985 of the Code and the regulations  thereunder) is other than the United States dollar (dollar) and that  used a profit and loss method of accounting for their last taxable year  beginning before January 1, 1987. Generally, a profit and loss method of  accounting is any method of accounting under which the taxpayer  calculates the profits of a QBU branch in its functional currency and  translates the net result into dollars. For all taxable years beginning  after December 31, 1986, such QBU branches must use the profit and loss  method of accounting as described in section 987, except to the extent  otherwise provided in regulations under section 985 or any other  provision of the Code. See Sec. 1.989(c)-1 regarding transition rules  for QBU branches of United States persons that have a nondollar  functional currency and that used a net worth method of   accounting for their last taxable year beginning before January 1, 1987.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Insolvent QBU branches. A taxpayer may apply the principles of  this section to a QBU branch that used a profit and loss method of  accounting for its last taxable year beginning before January 1, 1987,  whose $E pool (as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section) is  negative. For taxable years beginning on or after October 25, 1991, the  principles of this section shall apply to insolvent QBU branches.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General rules. Generally, section 987 gain or loss occurs when a  QBU branch makes a remittance. A remittance is considered to be made  from one or more functional currency pools under rules provided in  paragraph (c) of this section. In general, the amount of section 987  gain or loss from a remittance equals the difference between the dollar  value of the functional currency adjusted basis of the property remitted  and the portion of the dollar basis in the applicable pool. Section 987  gain or loss is calculated under a 4-step procedure described in  paragraph (d) of this section. Section 987 gain or loss attributable to  a remittance is realized and must be recognized in the taxable year of  the remittance except to the extent otherwise provided in regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Determining the pool(s) from which a remittance is made--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Remittances made during taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986,  and before October 25, 1991. A remittance made during taxable years  beginning after December 31, 1986 and before October 25, 1991, first  represents an amount of the QBU branch's post-86 profits pool (including  functional currency profits for the current taxable year determined  without regard to remittances made during the current year). To the  extent the functional currency amount of the remittance exceeds the  post-86 profits pool, it is considered to come out of the EQ pool.  Paragraph (d)(2) of this section describes the EQ pool and the post-86  profits pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Remittances made in taxable years beginning on or after October  25, 1991. For remittances made in taxable years beginning on or after  October 25, 1991, the post-86 profits and EQ pools are combined into one  pool called the equity pool. Therefore, remittances made during those  taxable years will only come from the equity pool. The dollar basis of,  and section 987 gain or loss on, such remittances shall be calculated  utilizing the principles set forth in paragraphs (d)(4) and (5) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Calculation of section 987 gain or loss--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. This  paragraph (d) describes the 4-step procedure for calculating section 987  gain or loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Step 1--Calculate the amount of the functional currency pools-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> EQ pool--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Beginning pool. The beginning amount of the EQ pool is  equal to the functional currency adjusted bases of a QBU branch's assets  less the functional currency amount of the QBU branch's liabilities at  the end of the taxpayer's last taxable year beginning before January 1,  1987, as these amounts are determined under the rules of paragraphs (e)  and (f) of the section. The district director may allow for additional  adjustments to the beginning amount of the EQ pool to prevent the  recognition of section 987 gain or loss due to factors unrelated to the  movement of exchange rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Adjusting the EQ pool. The EQ pool is increased by the  functional currency amount of any transfer (as determined under section  987) to the QBU branch made during the current taxable year or any prior  taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986. If the transfer is made  in a nonfunctional currency, this amount is translated into the QBU  branch's functional currency at the spot rate (determined under the  principles of section 988 and the regulations thereunder) on the date of  the transfer. The method for determining the rate must be applied  consistently each quarter. The EQ pool is decreased by the functional  currency amount of any remittance (as determined under section 987) made  during a prior taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986, that is  considered remitted from the EQ pool under paragraph (c) of this  section. The EQ pool must also be decreased by any transfer from the QBU  branch that is not a remittance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Post-86 profits pool. The amount of a QBU branch's post-86  profits pool is calculated at the end of each taxable year beginning  after December 31, 1986. The opening balance of the post-86   profits pool at the beginning of the first taxable year beginning after  December 31, 1986, is zero. The post-86 profits pool is increased by the  functional currency amount of the QBU branch's profits (determined under  section 987) for the taxable year. The post-86 profits pool is decreased  by the functional currency amount of the QBU branch's losses (determined  under section 987) for the taxable year and the amount of any  remittances by the QBU branch during the taxable year from the post-86  profits pool as provided under paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Adjustments to the equity pool. For remittances made in  taxable years beginning on or after October 25, 1991 under paragraph  (c)(2) of this section, the post-86 profits and EQ pools are combined  into one pool called the equity pool. Additions to and subtractions from  the equity pool shall be made utilizing the principles of paragraphs  (d)(2)(i)(B) and (ii) of this section. For example, remittances shall  reduce the equity pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Step 2--Calculate the dollar basis of the pools--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Dollar  basis of the EQ pool--(A) Beginning dollar basis. The beginning dollar  basis of the EQ pool (hereinafter referred to as the $E pool) equals:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The dollar amount of all the QBU branch's profits reported on  the taxpayer's income tax returns for taxable years beginning before  January 1, 1987, plus the total dollar amount of all transfers to the  QBU branch during that period (properly reflected on the taxpayer's  books), less</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The dollar amount of all the QBU branch's losses reported on the  taxpayer's income tax returns for such years, and the total dollar basis  of all remittances and all transfers made by the QBU branch during that  period (properly reflected on the taxpayer's books).  A QBU branch's profits and losses shall be properly adjusted for foreign  taxes of the QBU branch.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Adjusting the $E pool. The $E pool is increased by the dollar  amount of any transfers to the QBU branch made during the current  taxable year or any prior taxable year beginning after December 31,  1986. If a transfer is made in a currency other than the dollar, the  amount of the currency is translated into dollars at the spot rate  (determined under the principles of section 988 and the regulations  thereunder) on the date of the transfer. The $E pool is decreased by the  dollar basis of any remittance made during a prior taxable year  beginning after December 31, 1986, that is considered remitted from the  $E pool under paragraphs (c) and (d)(4) of these section. The $E pool is  also reduced by the amount of a transfer (other than a remittance) from  the QBU branch translated into dollars at the spot rate (determined  under the principles of section 988 and the regulations thereunder) on  the date of the transfer. The method for determining the spot rate must  be applied consistently to all transfers to and from a QBU branch.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Dollar basis of the post-86 profits pool. The amount of a QBU  branch's dollar basis in the post-86 profits pool (the $P pool) is  calculated at the end of each taxable year beginning after December 31,  1986. The opening balance of the $P pool at the beginning of the first  taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986, is zero. The $P pool is  increased by the functional currency amount of the QBU branch's profits  (determined under section 987) for the taxable year translated into  dollars at the weighted average exchange rate (as defined in Sec. 1.989  (b)-1) for the year. The $P pool is decreased by the functional currency  amount of the QBU branch's losses (determined under section 987) for the  taxable year translated into dollars at the weighted average exchange  rate for the year and by the dollar basis of any remittances made by the  QBU branch during the taxable year from the post-86 profits pool under  paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Combination of the $E and the $P pools. For taxable years  beginning on or after October 25, 1991 the $P and the $E pools are  combined into one pool called the basis pool. Additions to and  subtractions from the basis pool shall be made utilizing the principles  set forth in paragraphs (d)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Step 3--Calculation of the dollar basis of a remittance. For all  taxable years beginning after December 31,   1986, the dollar basis of a remittance is calculated using the following  formula: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC09OC91.064</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Step 4--Calculation of the section 987 gain or loss on a  remittance. Section 987 gains or loss equals the difference between--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The dollar amount of the remittance, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The dollar basis of the remittance as calculated under  paragraph (d)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Functional currency adjusted basis of QBU branch assets acquired  in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Basis of asset.  For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, the functional  currency adjusted basis of a QBU branch asset acquired in a taxable year  beginning before January 1, 1987, is the functional currency basis of  the asset at the date of acquisition, as adjusted according to United  States tax principles. The functional currency adjusted basis of an  asset for which a functional currency basis was not determined at the  date of acquisition is the nonfunctional currency basis of the asset at  the date of acquisition multiplied by the spot exchange rate on the date  of acquisition, as adjusted according to United States tax principles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Adjustment to basis of asset. Any future adjustments to the  functional currency adjusted basis of such an asset are determined with  respect to the appropriate functional currency adjusted basis of the  asset as determined under this paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Functional currency amount of QBU branch liabilities acquired in  taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987. For the first taxable  year beginning after December 31, 1986, the amount of a QBU branch  liability incurred in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1987,  is the functional currency amount of the liability at the date incurred,  as adjusted according to United States tax principles. The functional  currency amount of a liability for which a functional currency amount  was not determined at the date incurred is the nonfunctional currency  amount of the liability at the date incurred multiplied by the spot  exchange rate on the date incurred, as adjusted according to the United  States tax principles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Examples. The provisions of this section are illustrated by the  following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1: (i) Facts. U.S. is a domestic corporation. B, a QBU  branch of U.S., operates in country X and was established in 1985. B's  functional currency is the FC. U.S. is on a calendar taxable year and,  prior to January 1, 1987, accounted for the operations of B by the  profit and loss method of accounting as set forth in Rev. Rul. 75-107,  1975-1 C.B. 32. B's books and records were kept according to United  States tax principles. B received a transfer of $2,000 in 1985, and had  profits of $3,000 in 1985 and $5,000 in 1986. B made a remittance in  1986, the dollar basis of which was $1,000. As of December 31, 1986, the  adjusted basis of B's functional currency assets exceeded the functional  currency amount of its liabilities by 15,000 FC (the beginning pool of  EQ). Under section 987, B has profits of 8,000 FC in 1987, which are  worth $1,000 when translated at the weighted average exchange rate for  1987 as required by sections 987(2) and 989(b)(4). B has no profits or  loss in 1988. There are no transfers to B in 1987 and 1988. B remits  18,000 FC in 1988. Under section 987, the appropriate exchange rate for  the 1988 remittance is 10 FC/$1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Calculation of section 987 loss on remittance--(A) Post-86  profits. Under paragraph (c)(i) of this section, the 18,000 FC  remittance comes first out of the post-86 profits pool (8,000 FC) and  second out of EQ (10,000 FC). The loss on the 1988 remittance out of the  post-86 profits pool equals:  Dollar value of post-86 profits remitted - Dollar basis of post-86</p><p class="depth0">profits remitted= (8,000 FC x 10 FC/$1) - $1,000 = $800 - $1,000 = <=$200loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> EQ. Under paragraph (d) of this section, U.S. calculates 987  gain or loss on the 10,000 FC remittance of EQ from B as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Step 1. The total EQ pool equals 15,000 FC (the functional currency  adjusted bases of its assets less the functional currency amount of its  liabilities as of December 31, 1986). There are no adjustments necessary  under paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Step 2. The $E pool is $9,000 (the $2,000 transfer in 1985 plus  profits of $3,000 in 1985 and $5,000 in 1986 and less than $1,000 basis  of the 1986 remittance). There are no adjustments necessary under  paragraph (d)(3)(i)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Step 3. The entire 10,000 FC remittance is deemed to come out of EQ.</p><p class="depth0">Step 4. The dollar basis of the EQ remitted equals: N x $E  determined under paragraph (d)(3)(i)= [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC09OC91.065   Where: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC09OC91.066</p><p class="depth0">Step 5.

D is a domestic corporation. B, a QBU branch  of D, operates in country X. B's functional currency is the FC. At the  end of B's last taxable year beginning before October 25, 1991, B's EQ  pool equals 15,000 FC and B's post-86 profits pool equals 8,000 FC. B's  $E amount equals $9,000, and the $P pool equals $1,000. In B's first  taxable year beginning on or after October 25, 1991, B remits 18,000 FC.
