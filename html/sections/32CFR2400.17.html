Information classified pursuant to  Executive Order 12356 and prior orders shall be declassified or  downgraded as soon as national security considerations permit. Decisions  concerning declassification shall be based on the loss of sensitivity of  the information with the passage of time or on the occurrence of an  event which permits declassification. When information is reviewed for  declassification pursuant to this regulation, that information shall be  declassified unless the designated declassification authority determines  that the information continues to meet the classification requirements  prescribed in Sec. 2400.9 of this part despite the passage of time. The  Office of Science and Technology Policy officials shall coordinate their  review of classified information with other agencies that have a direct  interest in the subject matter.</p>
