You must use all the data collected during all other periods in assessing compliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A monitoring malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not considered malfunctions.</p>
