Setting up and use of temporary or portable blinds by hunters

will be permitted on Hatteras and Ocracoke Islands.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Minimum distance between blinds on Seashore land and ponds within the designated hunting areas will be 300 yards unless other conditions, such as natural screening, justify a shorter distance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Hunting on Ocracoke Island will be permitted and managed in the same manner as Hatteras Island.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> ``Jump shooting'' of waterfowl will be permitted only on Hatteras and Ocracoke Islands and is prohibited within 300 yards of any blind.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Properly licensed and authorized guides may provide hunting guide service within the designated hunting areas in the Seashore.
