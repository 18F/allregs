This permit by rule only authorizes the permittee  to construct or modify and to operate the permitted source at the  location listed in the Notification of Coverage for that permitted  source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Liability. This permit by rule does not release the permittee  from any liability for compliance with other applicable federal and  tribal environmental laws and regulations, including the CAA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Severability. The provisions of this permit by rule are  severable. If any portion of this permit by rule is held invalid, the  remaining terms and conditions of this permit by rule shall remain valid  and in force.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Compliance. The permittee must comply with all provisions of  this permit, including emission limitations that apply to the affected  emissions units at the permitted source. Noncompliance with any permit  by rule provision is a violation of the permit by rule and may  constitute a violation   of the CAA; is grounds for an enforcement action; and is grounds for the  reviewing authority to revoke and terminate the permitted source's  coverage under this permit by rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)/Prevention of  Significant Deterioration (PSD) Protection. The permitted source must  not cause or contribute to a NAAQS violation or, in an attainment area,  must not cause or contribute to a PSD increment violation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Unavailable defense. It is not a defense for the permittee in  an enforcement action that it would have been necessary to halt or  reduce the permitted activity in order to maintain compliance with the  provisions of this permit by rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Property rights. The permit by rule does not convey any  property rights of any sort or any exclusive privilege.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Information requests. You, as the permittee, shall furnish to  the reviewing authority, within 30 days unless another timeframe is  specified by the EPA, any information that the reviewing authority may  request in writing to determine whether cause exists for revising,  revoking and reissuing, or terminating coverage under the permit by rule  or to determine compliance with the permit by rule.
