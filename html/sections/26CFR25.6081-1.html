                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Under section 6075(b)(2), an automatic six-month extension of time granted to a donor to file the donor's return of income under Sec. 1.6081-4 of this chapter shall be deemed also to be a six-month extension of time granted to file a return on Form 709, ``United States Gift (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return.'' If a donor does not obtain an extension of time to file the donor's return of income under Sec. 1.6081-4 of this chapter, the donor will be allowed an automatic 6-month extension of time

to file Form 709 after the date prescribed for filing if the donor files an application under this section in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. In the case of an individual described in Sec. 1.6081-5(a)(5) or (6) of this chapter, the automatic 6-month extension of time to file Form 709 will run concurrently with the extension of time to file granted pursuant to Sec. 1.6081-5 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requirements. To satisfy this paragraph (b), a donor must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Submit a complete application on Form 8892, ``Payment of Gift/GST Tax and/or Application for Extension of Time To File Form 709,'' or in any other manner prescribed by the Commissioner;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> File the application on or before the later of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date prescribed for filing the return; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The expiration of any extension of time to file granted pursuant to Sec. 1.6081-5 of this chapter; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> File the application with the Internal Revenue Service office designated in the application's instructions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No extension of time for the payment of tax. An automatic extension of time for filing a return granted under paragraph (a) of this section will not extend the time for payment of any tax due on such return.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Termination of automatic extension. The Commissioner may terminate an extension at any time by mailing to the donor a notice of termination at least 10 days prior to the termination date designated in such notice. The Commissioner must mail the notice of termination to the address shown on the Form 8892, or to the donor's last known address. For further guidance regarding the definition of last known address, see Sec. 301.6212-2 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Penalties. See section 6651 for failure to file a gift tax return or failure to pay the amount shown as tax on the return.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effective/applicability dates. This section is applicable for applications for an extension of time to file Form 709 filed after July 1, 2008.
