                                Sec. 1.6042-1  Return of information as to dividends paid in calendar
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirement of return--(1) In general. Except as provided in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph, every domestic corporation, or foreign corporation engaged in business within the United States or having an office or place of business or a fiscal or paying agent in the United States, making payments during any calendar year before 1963 of $10 or more of dividends and distributions (other than distributions in liquidation) to any shareholder who is an individual (citizen or resident of the United States), a resident fiduciary, or a resident partnership any member of which is a citizen or resident shall file for the calendar year a return setting forth the amount of such payments for such calendar year. A separate return on Form 1099, showing the name and address of the payer and the shareholder, and the amount paid, shall be prepared with respect to each shareholder. These returns shall be accompanied by transmittal Form 1096.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as provided in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph, every domestic corporation, or foreign corporation engaged in business within the United States or having an office or place of business or a fiscal or paying agent in the United States, making payments during any calendar year before 1963 of $10 or more of dividends and distributions (other than distributions in liquidation) to any shareholder who is an individual (citizen or resident of the United States), a resident fiduciary, or a resident partnership any member of which is a citizen or resident shall file for the calendar year a return setting forth the amount of such payments for such calendar year. A separate return on Form 1099, showing the name and address of the payer and the shareholder, and the amount paid, shall be prepared with respect to each shareholder. These returns shall be accompanied by transmittal Form 1096.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Federal land bank associations and certain other corporations. A corporation described in section 501(c) (12), (15), or (16), or section 521(b)(1), or a Federal land bank association or a production credit association, making a payment of a dividend, or a distribution, to any shareholder in any calendar year before 1963 shall file an information return with respect to such payments when they total $100 or more during the calendar year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Savings and loan associations, etc. A savings and loan association, a cooperative bank, a homestead association, a credit union, or a building and loan association is required to file an information return with respect to distributions made to a shareholder during any calendar year before 1963 only if the amount thereof paid to the shareholder during the calendar year, or such amount when aggregated with other payments made to the shareholder during such year of interest, rents, royalties, annuities, pensions, and other gains, profits, and income, as described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of Sec. 1.6041-1, totals $600 or more. For this purpose, the term ``distributions to a shareholder'' includes periodical distributions of earnings on running installment shares of stock paid or credited by a building and loan association to its holders of that class of stock, and the sum received upon withdrawal from a building and loan association in excess of the amounts paid in on account of membership fees and stock subscriptions, consisting of accumulated profits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nontaxable or partly nontaxable distributions. In the case of a distribution which is made from a depletion or depreciation reserve, or which for any other reason is deemed by the corporation to be nontaxable or partly nontaxable to its shareholders, the corporation shall fill in the information on both sides of Form 1096.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Information as to actual owner--(1) In general. When the person receiving a

payment with respect to which an information return is required under authority of the Code is not the actual owner of the income received, the name and address of the actual owner or payee shall be furnished upon demand of the person paying the income, and in default of a compliance with such demand the payee becomes liable for the penalties provided. See section 7203. Dividends on stock are prima facie the income of the record owner of the stock. If a record owner of stock who is not the actual owner thereof receives dividends on such stock in any calendar year before 1963, he shall file a Form 1087 disclosing the name and address of the actual owner or payee, the name of the issuing corporation, the number of shares of such stock, and the amount of dividends received with respect to such stock during the calendar year. (For the reporting by a nominee of dividends received by him on behalf of another person in any calendar year after 1962, see Sec. 1.6042-2.) Unless such a disclosure is made the record owner will be held liable for any tax based upon such dividends. A separate Form 1087 shall be filed by the record owner for each of the stockholdings of each actual owner for whom he acts as nominee. However, where the record owner is a banking institution, trust company, or brokerage firm, it may, provided it maintains such records as will permit a prompt substantiation of each payment of dividends made to the actual owner, file one Form 1087 for each actual owner for whom it acts as nominee and report thereon the total amount of the dividends paid to such actual owner (without itemization as to the issuing company, class of stock, etc.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general.

The filing of Form 1087 is not required if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The record owner is required to file a fiduciary return on Form 1041, or a withholding return on Form 1042, disclosing the name and address of the actual owner or payee;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The actual owner or payee is a nonresident alien individual, foreign partnership, or foreign corporation and the tax has been withheld at the source before receipt of the dividends by the record owner;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The record owner is a banking institution, a trust company, or a brokerage firm which prepares the individual income tax return of the actual owner, provided the verification on the return with respect to the preparation thereof is executed by such record owner;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The record owner is a nominee of a banking institution or trust company exercising trust powers, and such banking institution or trust company is required to file a fiduciary return on Form 1041 which reflects the name and address of the actual owner or payee;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The actual owner is an organization exempt from taxation under section 501(a) and is exempt from the requirement of filing a return under section 6033 and paragraph (g) of Sec. 1.6033-1; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The record owner is a banking institution or trust company exercising trust powers, or a nominee thereof, and the actual owner is an organization exempt from taxation under section 501(a) for which such banking institution or trust company files an annual return.

See Sec. 1.1441-1, relating to withholding of tax on nonresident alien individuals, and Sec. 1.1442-1, relating to withholding of tax on nonresident foreign corporations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Time and place for filing. Returns made under this section on Forms 1096 and 1099 and Form 1087 for any calendar year shall be filed on or before February 28 of the following year with any of the Internal Revenue Service Centers, the addresses of which are listed in the instructions for such forms.
