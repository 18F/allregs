The first compliance report must include the percentage of within-concentration batches, as described in Sec. 63.2171(b), for the first 12-month calculation period described in Sec. 63.2171(b)(3). It must also include a percentage for each subsequent 12-month calculation period, as described in Sec. 63.2171(b)(4), ending on a calendar month that falls within the first compliance period. (For example, if the compliance date for your source is October 15, 2003, the first compliance report would cover the period from October 15, 2003 to December 31, 2004. It would contain percentages for the 12-month periods ending October 31, 2004; November 30, 2004; and December 31, 2004.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The first compliance report must be postmarked or delivered no later than July 31 or January 31, whichever date follows the end of the first 12 calendar months after the compliance date that is specified for your affected source in Sec. 63.2133.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each subsequent compliance report must cover the semiannual reporting period from January 1 through June 30 or the semiannual reporting period from July 1 through December 31. Each subsequent compliance report must include the percentage of within-concentration batches for each 12-month calculation period ending on a calendar month that falls within the reporting period. (For example, if the compliance date for your source is October 15, 2003, the second compliance report would cover the period from January 1, 2005 through June 30, 2005. It would contain percentages for the 12-month periods ending January 31, 2005; February 28, 2005; March 31, 2005; April 30, 2005; May 31, 2005; and June 30, 2005.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each subsequent compliance report must be postmarked or delivered no later than July 31 or January 31, whichever date is the first date following the end of the semiannual reporting period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For each affected source that is subject to permitting regulations pursuant to 40 CFR part 70 or part 71, and if the permitting authority has established dates for submitting semiannual reports pursuant to 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(a)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR 71.6(a)(3)(a)(iii)(A), you may submit the first and subsequent compliance reports according to the dates the permitting authority has established instead of according to the dates in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The compliance report must contain the information listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Company name and address.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Statement by a responsible official with that official's name, title, and
