                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The regulations in Secs. 15.217 through 15.257 provide alternatives to the general radiated emission limits for intentional radiators operating in specified frequency bands. Unless otherwise stated, there are no restrictions as to the types of operation permitted under these sections.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In most cases, unwanted emissions outside of the frequency bands shown in these alternative provisions must be attenuated to the emission limits shown in Sec. 15.209. In no case shall the level of the unwanted emissions from an intentional radiator operating under these additional provisions exceed the field strength of the fundamental emission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Intentional radiators operating under the alternative provisions to the general emission limits, as contained in Secs. 15.217 through 15.257 and in subpart E of this part, must be designed to ensure that the 20 dB bandwidth of the emission, or whatever bandwidth may otherwise be specified in the specific rule section under which the equipment operates, is contained within the frequency band designated in the rule section under which the equipment is operated. In the case of intentional radiators operating under the provisions of subpart E, the emission bandwidth may span across multiple contiguous frequency bands identified in that subpart. The requirement to contain the designated bandwidth of the emission within the specified frequency band includes the effects from frequency sweeping, frequency hopping and other modulation techniques that may be employed as well as the frequency stability of the transmitter over expected variations in temperature and supply voltage. If a frequency stability is not

specified in the regulations, it is recommended that the fundamental emission be kept within at least the central 80% of the permitted band in order to minimize the possibility of out-of-band operation.
