                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Voting securities. (1) Subject to the provisions of Sec. 801.15, and paragraph (a)(3) of this section, all voting securities of the issuer which will be held by the acquiring person after the consummation of an acquisition shall be deemed voting securities held as a result of the acquisition. The value of such voting securities shall be the sum of the value of the voting securities to be acquired, determined in accordance with Sec. 801.10(a), and the value of the voting securities held by the acquiring person prior to the acquisition, determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Subject to the provisions of Sec. 801.15, and paragraph (a)(3) of this section, all voting securities of the issuer which will be held by the acquiring person after the consummation of an acquisition shall be deemed voting securities held as a result of the acquisition. The value of such voting securities shall be the sum of the value of the voting securities to be acquired, determined in accordance with Sec. 801.10(a), and the value of the voting securities held by the acquiring person prior to the acquisition, determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The value of voting securities of an issuer held prior to an acquisition shall be--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the security is traded on a national securities exchange or is authorized to be quoted in an interdealer quotation system of a national securities association registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, the market price calculated in accordance with Sec. 801.10(c)(1); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section is not applicable, the fair market value determined in accordance with Sec. 801.10(c)(3).</p><p class="depth4">Examples: 1. Assume that acquiring person ``A'' holds in excess of $50 million (as adjusted) of the voting securities of X, and is to acquire another $1 million of the same voting securities. Since under paragraph (a) of

this section all voting securities ``A'' will hold after the acquisition are held ``as a result of'' the acquisition, ``A'' will hold in excess of $50 million (as adjusted) of the voting securities of X as a result of the acquisition. ``A'' must therefore observe the requirements of the act before making the acquisition, unless the present acquisition is exempt under Section 7A(c), Sec. 802.21 or any other rule.</p><p class="depth4">2. See Sec. 801.15 and the examples to that rule.</p><p class="depth4">3. See Sec. 801.20 and the examples to that rule.</p><p class="depth4">4. On January 1, company A acquired in excess of $50 million (as adjusted) of voting securities of company B. ``A'' and ``B'' filed notification and observed the waiting period for that acquisition. Company A plans to acquire $1 million of assets from company B on May 1 of the same year. Under Sec. 801.13(a)(3), ``A'' and ``B'' do not aggregate the value of the earlier acquired voting securities to determine whether the acquisition is subject to the act. Therefore, the value of the acquisition is $1 million and it is not reportable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Voting securities held by the acquiring person prior to an acquisition shall not be deemed voting securities held as a result of that subsequent acquisition if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The acquiring person is, in the subsequent acquisition, acquiring only assets; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The acquisition of the previously acquired voting securities was subject to the filing and waiting requirements of the act (and such requirements were observed) or was exempt pursuant to Sec. 802.21.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Assets. (1) All assets to be acquired from the acquired person shall be assets held as a result of the acquisition. The value of such assets shall be determined in accordance with Sec. 801.10(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All assets to be acquired from the acquired person shall be assets held as a result of the acquisition. The value of such assets shall be determined in accordance with Sec. 801.10(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the acquiring person signs a letter of intent or agreement in principle to acquire assets from an acquired person, and within the previous 180 days the acquiring person has</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Signed a letter of intent or agreement in principle to acquire assets from the same acquired person, which is still in effect but has not been consummated, or has acquired assets from the same acquired person which it still holds; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The previous acquisition (whether consummated or still contemplated) was not subject to the requirements of the Act; then for purposes of the size-of-transaction test of Section 7A(a)(2), both the acquiring and the acquired persons shall treat the assets that were the subject of the earlier letter of intent or agreement in principal as though they are being acquired as part of the present acquisition. The value of any assets which are subject to this paragraph is determined in accordance with Sec. 801.10(b).</p><p class="depth4">Examples: 1. On day 1, A enters into an agreement with B to acquire assets valued at $45 million. On day 90, A and B sign a letter of intent pursuant to which A will acquire additional assets from B, valued at $45 million. The original transaction has not closed, however, the agreement is still in effect. For purposes of the size-of-transaction test in Section 7A(a)(2), A must aggregate the value of both of its acquisitions and file prior to acquiring the assets if the aggregate value exceeds $50 million (as adjusted).</p><p class="depth4">2. On March 30, A enters into a letter of intent to acquire assets of B valued at $45 million. On January 31, earlier the same year, A closed on an acquisition of assets of B valued at $45 million. For purposes of the size-of-transaction test in Section 7A(a)(2), A must aggregate the value of both of its acquisitions and file prior to acquiring the assets of B if the aggregate value exceeds $50 million (as adjusted).</p><p class="depth4">3. On day 1, A enters into an agreement with B to acquire assets valued in excess of $50 million (as adjusted). A and B file notification and observe the waiting period. On day 60, A signs a letter of intent to acquire an additional $40 million of assets from B. Because the earlier acquisition was subject to the requirements of the Act, A does not aggregate the two acquisitions of assets and is free to acquire the additional assets of B without filing an additional notification.</p><p class="depth4">4. On day 1, A consummates an acquisition of assets of B valued at $45 million. On day 60, A consummates a sale of the same assets to an unrelated third party. On day 120, A enters into an agreement to acquire additional assets of B valued at $45 million. Because A no longer holds the assets from the previous acquisition, no aggregation of the two asset acquisitions is required and A may acquire all of the additional assets without filing notification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> Non-corporate interests. In an acquisition of non-corporate interests, any previously acquired non-corporate interests in the same unincorporated entity is aggregated with the newly acquired interests. The value of such an acquisition is determined in accordance with Sec. 801.10(d) of these rules.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Non-corporate interests. In an acquisition of non-corporate interests, any previously acquired non-corporate interests in the same unincorporated entity is aggregated with the newly acquired interests. The value of such an acquisition is determined in accordance with Sec. 801.10(d) of these rules.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other assets or voting securities of the same acquired person. An acquisition

of non-corporate interests which does not confer control of the unincorporated entity is not aggregated with any other assets or voting securities which have been or are currently being acquired from the same acquired person.</p><p class="depth3">Examples: 1. A currently has the right to 30 percent of the profits in LLC. B has the right to the remaining 70 percent. A acquires an additional 30 percent interest in LLC from B for $90 million in cash. As a result of the acquisition, A is deemed to now have a 60 percent interest in LLC. The current acquisition is valued at $90 million, the acquisition price. The value of the 30 percent interest that A already holds is the fair market value of that interest. The value for size-of-transaction purposes is the sum of the two.</p><p class="depth3">2. A acquires the following from B: (1) All of the assets of a subsidiary of B; (2) all of the voting securities of another subsidiary of B; and (3) a 30 percent interest in an LLC which is currently wholly-owned by B. In determining the size-of-transaction, A aggregates the value of the voting securities and assets of the subsidiaries that it is acquiring from B, but does not include the value of the 30 percent interest in the LLC, pursuant to Sec. 801.13(c)(2).
