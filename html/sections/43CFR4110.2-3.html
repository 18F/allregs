                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Transfers of grazing preference in whole or in part are subject  to the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The transferee shall meet all qualifications and requirements of  Sec. Sec. 4110.1, 4110.2-1, and 4110.2-2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The transfer applications under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this  section shall evidence assignment of interest and obligation in range  improvements authorized on public lands under Sec. 4120.3 and  maintained in conjunction with the transferred preference (see Sec.  4120.3-5). The terms and conditions of the cooperative range improvement  agreements and range improvement permits are binding on the transferee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The transferee shall accept the terms and conditions of the  terminating grazing permit or lease (see Sec. 4130.2) with such  modifications as he may request which are approved by the authorized  officer or with such modifications as may be required by the authorized  officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The transferee shall file an application for a grazing permit or  lease to the extent of the transferred preference simultaneously with  filing a transfer application under paragraph (b) or (c) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If base property is sold or leased, the transferee shall within  90 days of the date of sale or lease file with BLM a properly executed  transfer application showing the base property and the grazing  preference, in animal unit months, attached to that base property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a grazing preference is being transferred from one base  property to another base property, the transferor shall own or control  the base property from which the grazing preference is being transferred  and file with the authorized officer a properly completed transfer  application for approval. No transfer will be allowed without the  written consent of the owner(s), and any person or entity holding an  encumbrance of the base property from which the transfer is to be made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> At the date of approval of a transfer, the existing grazing  permit or lease shall terminate automatically and without notice to the  extent of the transfer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If an unqualified transferee acquires rights in base property  through operation of law or testamentary disposition, such transfer will  not affect the grazing preference or any outstanding grazing permit or  lease, or preclude the issuance or renewal of a grazing permit or lease  based on such property for a period of 2 years after the transfer.  However, such a transferee shall qualify under paragraph (a) of this  section within the 2-year period or the grazing preference shall be  subject to cancellation. The authorized officer may grant extensions of  the 2-year period where there are delays solely attributable to probate  proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Transfers shall be for a period of not less than 3 years unless  a shorter term is determined by the authorized officer to be consistent  with management and resource condition objectives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Failure of either the transferee or the transferor to comply  with the regulations of this section may result in rejection of the  transfer application or cancellation of grazing preference.
