                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rules of allocation. As provided in Sec. 287.17, if  amounts on deposit in a construction reserve fund are expended,  obligated, or withdrawn for construction, reconstruction,  reconditioning, or acquisition of new vessels, or for the liquidation of  purchase-money indebtedness of such vessels, the portion thereof which  represents gain shall be applied in reduction of the basis of such new  vessels. The rules   set forth below in this paragraph shall apply in allocating the  unrecognized gain to the amounts so expended, obligated, or withdrawn:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the ``net proceeds'' of a sale or ``net indemnity'' in  respect of a loss are deposited in more than one deposit, the portion  thereof representing unrecognized gain shall be considered as having  been deposited first.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Amounts expended, obligated, or withdrawn from the construction  reserve fund shall be applied against amounts deposited in the order of  deposit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If any deposit consists in part of gain not recognized under  section 511(c) of the Act, then any expenditure, obligation, or  withdrawal applied against such deposit shall be considered to consist  of gain in the same proportion that the part of the deposit which  constitutes gain bears to the total amount of the deposit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Date of obligation. The date funds are obligated under a  contract for the construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or  acquisition of new vessels, or for the liquidation of purchase-money  indebtedness on such vessels, rather than the date of payment from the  fund, will determine the order of application against the deposits in  the fund. When a contract for the construction, reconstruction,  reconditioning, or acquisition of new vessels, or for the liquidation of  purchase-money indebtedness on such vessels is entered into, amounts on  deposit in the construction reserve fund will be deemed to be obligated  to the extent of the amount of the taxpayer's liability under the  contract. Deposits will be deemed to be so obligated in the order of  deposit, each new contract obligating the earliest deposit not  previously expended, obligated, or withdrawn. If the liability under the  contract exceeds the amount in the construction reserve fund, the  contract will be deemed to obligate, to the extent of that part of such  excess not otherwise satisfied, the earliest deposit or deposits  thereafter made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Illustration. The foregoing rules are illustrated in the  following example:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A taxpayer who makes his returns on the calendar year  basis sells a vessel in 1963 for $1,000,000, realizing a gain of  $400,000. Payment of $100,000 is received in March 1963 when the  contract is signed, and the balance of $900,000 is received in June 1963  on delivery of the vessel. The $1,000,000 is deposited in a construction  reserve fund in July 1963. In December 1963, the taxpayer also deposits  $150,000, representing earnings of that year. In 1964, he sells another  vessel for $1,000,000, realizing a gain of $250,000. The sale price of  $1,000,000 is received on delivery of the vessel in February 1964, and  deposited in the construction reserve fund in March 1964. In September  1964, the taxpayer purchases for cash out of the construction reserve  fund a new vessel for $1,750,000. To the cost of this vessel must be  allocated the 1963 deposits of $1,150,000 and $600,000 of the March 1964  deposit. This leaves in the fund $400,000 of the March 1964 deposit. The  amount of the unrecognized gain to be applied against the basis of the  new vessel is $550,000, computed as follows: Gain of $400,000  represented in the 1963 deposits, plus the same proportion of the  $250,000 gain represented in the March 1964 deposit ($1,000,000) which  the amount ($600,000) allocated to the vessel is of the amount of the  deposit, i.e., $400,000 plus 600,000/1,000,000 of $250,000 or $150,000,  a total of $550,000. This reduces the basis of the new vessel to  $1,200,000 ($1,750,000 less $550,000).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In 1965, the taxpayer sells a third vessel for $3,000,000,  realizing a gain of $900,000. The $3,000,000 is received and deposited  in the construction reserve fund in June 1965, making a total in the  fund of $3,400,000. In December 1965, the taxpayer contracts for the  construction of a second new vessel to cost a maximum of $3,200,000,  thereby obligating that amount of the fund, and in June 1966, receives  permission to withdraw the unobligated balance amounting to $200,000. To  the cost of the second new vessel must be allocated the $400,000 balance  of the March 1964 deposit and $2,800,000 of the June 1965 deposit. The  unrecognized gain to be applied against the basis of such new vessel is  that proportion of the gain represented in each deposit which the  portion of the deposit allocated to the vessel bears to the amount of  such deposit, i.e., 400,000/1,000,000 of $250,000, or $100,000 plus  2,800,000/3,000,000 of $900,000, or $840,000 making a total of $940,000.  The $200,000 withdrawal is applied against the June 1965 deposit and the  portion thereof which represents gain will be recognized as income for  1965, the year in which realized. The computation of the recognized gain  is as follows: 200,000/3,000,000 of $900,000, or $60,000.</p>
