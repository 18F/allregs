                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Assign each engine a unique identification number and  permanently affix, engrave, or stamp it on the engine in a legible way.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> At the time of manufacture, affix a permanent and legible label  identifying each engine. The label must be--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Attached in one piece so it is not removable without being  destroyed or defaced. However, you may use two-piece labels for engines  below 19 kW if there is not enough space on the engine to apply a one- piece label.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Secured to a part of the engine needed for normal operation and  not normally requiring replacement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Durable and readable for the engine's entire life.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Written in English.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The label must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Include the heading ``EMISSION CONTROL INFORMATION''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Include your full corporate name and trademark. You may identify  another company and use its trademark instead of yours if you comply  with the provisions of Sec.  1039.640.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Include EPA's standardized designation for the engine family  (and subfamily, where applicable).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> State the power category or subcategory from Sec.  1039.101 or  Sec.  1039.102 that determines the applicable emission standards for the  engine family. For engines at or above 37 kW and below 56 kW from model  years 2008 through 2012, and for engines less than 8 kW utilizing the  provision at Sec.  1039.101(c), you must state the applicable PM  standard for the engine family.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> State the engine's displacement (in liters); however, you may  omit this from the label if all the engines in the engine family have  the same per-cylinder displacement and total displacement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> State the date of manufacture [DAY (optional), MONTH, and YEAR];  however, you may omit this from the label if you stamp, engrave, or  otherwise permanently identify it elsewhere on the engine, in which case  you must also describe in your application for certification where you  will identify the date on the engine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> State the FELs to which the engines are certified if  certification depends on the ABT provisions of subpart H of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Identify the emission-control system. Use terms and  abbreviations as described in 40 CFR 1068.45. You may omit this  information from the label if there is not enough room for it and you  put it in the owners manual instead.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> For diesel-fueled engines, unless otherwise specified in Sec.   1039.104(e)(2), state: ``ULTRA LOW SULFUR FUEL ONLY'.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Identify any additional requirements for fuel and lubricants  that do not involve fuel-sulfur levels. You may omit this information  from the label if there is not enough room for it and you put it in the  owners manual instead.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> State the useful life for your engine family if we approve a  shortened useful life under Sec.  1039.101(g)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> State: ``THIS ENGINE COMPLIES WITH U.S. EPA REGULATIONS FOR  [MODEL YEAR] NONROAD DIESEL ENGINES.''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> For engines above 560 kW, include the following things:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For engines certified to the emission standards for generator- set engines, add the phrase ``FOR GENERATOR SETS AND OTHER  APPLICATIONS''.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For all other engines, add the phrase ``NOT FOR USE IN A  GENERATOR SET''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> If your engines are certified only for constant-speed  operation, state ``USE IN CONSTANT-SPEED APPLICATIONS ONLY''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> For engines with one or more approved auxiliary emission  control devices for emergency equipment applications under Sec.   1039.115(g)(4), the statement: ``THIS ENGINE IS FOR INSTALLATION IN  EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT ONLY.'' Note that this   label requirement does not apply for engines that include emergency  AECDs under Sec.  1039.665 rather than Sec.  1039.115(g)(4).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You may add information to the emission control information  label to identify other emission standards that the engine meets or does  not meet (such as European standards). You may also add other  information to ensure that the engine will be properly maintained and  used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(2)</em>, create a separate  label with the statement: ``ULTRA LOW SULFUR FUEL ONLY''. Permanently  attach this label to the equipment near the fuel inlet or, if you do not  manufacture the equipment, take one of the following steps to ensure  that the equipment will be properly labeled:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provide the label to the equipment manufacturer and include the  appropriate information in the emission-related installation  instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Confirm that the equipment manufacturers install their own  complying labels.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> You may ask us to approve modified labeling requirements in this  part 1039 if you show that it is necessary or appropriate. We will  approve your request if your alternate label is consistent with the  requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If you obscure the engine label while installing the engine in  the equipment such that the label cannot be read during normal  maintenance, you must place a duplicate label on the equipment. If  others install your engine in their equipment in a way that obscures the  engine label, we require them to add a duplicate label on the equipment  (see 40 CFR 1068.105); in that case, give them the number of duplicate  labels they request and keep the following records for at least five  years:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Written documentation of the request from the equipment  manufacturer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The number of duplicate labels you send for each engine family  and the date you sent them.
