In addition, upon a finding by HUD that the public entity has failed to comply substantially with any provision of the Act with respect to either the pledged grants or the guaranteed loan funds or program income, HUD may take action against the pledged grants as provided in Sec.  570.913 and/or may take action as provided in the contract for loan guarantee assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> State-assisted public entities.
