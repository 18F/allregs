                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Recovery is considered to be against equity or good conscience  if a person, in reliance on payments made to him or her or on notice  that payment would be made, relinquished a significant and valuable  right (Example 1 of this section) or changed his or her position to his  or her substantial detriment (Example 2 of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An individual's ability to repay an overpayment is not material  to a finding that recovery would be against equity or good conscience  but is relevant with respect to the credibility of a claim of  detrimental reliance under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example (1). After being informed by the Board that he had been  credited with sufficient years of railroad service to retire at age 60,  an employee quit his railroad job and applied for benefits under the  Railroad Retirement Act. He receives benefits for six months when it is  discovered that he had insufficient railroad service to retire at age 60  and was not entitled to the benefits he received. His annuity was  terminated. Because the employee gave up his seniority rights when he  quit his railroad job, he cannot get his job back. It is determined that  the employee was not at fault in causing the overpayments. In this  situation recovery of the overpayment would be against equity or good  conscience because the overpaid individual gave up a valuable right.</p><p class="depth2">Example (2). A widow, having been awarded annuities for herself and  her daughter, entered her daughter in a private school. The widow did  not have substantial assets and her income, apart from the annuities she  received in the amounts payable, would not have been sufficient for her  to have undertaken the obligation to send her daughter to private  school. In order to pay for the schooling she took out a loan and used  the monthly annuities to pay interest and principal on the loan. After  the widow and her daughter had received payments for almost a year, the  deceased employee was found not to have been insured under the Railroad  Retirement Act. Therefore, all payments to the widow and child were  erroneous and the annuities were terminated. It is determined that the  widow was not at fault in causing the overpayment. Having incurred a  financial obligation (the school loan) toward which the benefits had  been applied, the widow was in a worse position financially than if she  and her daughter had never been entitled to benefits. In this situation,  the recovery of the overpayment would be against equity or good  conscience.</p>
