                                Sec. 644.475  Excessing Army military and Air Force property.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The procedures for placing buildings and improvements in excess  status are set forth in AR 405-90 and AFR 87-4. In instances of land  acquisition where buildings and improvements were acquired incident  thereto, DEs are designated by the Chief of Engineers under AR 405-90 to  make disposition of this property. Coordination with the installation  commander concerned is required. When, under AFR 87-4, the responsible  DE is called upon by the Air Force Command to furnish an estimate of the  value of buildings and improvements for the purpose of determining the  approval authority for excessing the property, no formal appraisal will  be made. If, in his opinion, the total property exceeds a value of  $50,000, he will furnish only a rough estimate of its value in round  figures. If the property is, in his opinion, of a value of $50,000 or  less, he will limit his statement to this fact and will not specify an  estimated valuation.</p>
