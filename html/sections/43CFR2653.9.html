                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>, (b), or (c), 16(b) or 19 of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A regional corporation may select a total area in excess of its  entitlement   to ensure that it will obtain its entitlement in the event of any  conflicts. Any acreage in excess of its entitlement shall be identified  as alternate selections and shall be numerically ordered on a section by  section basis to indicate selection preference.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Selections need not be contiguous but must be made along section  lines in reasonably compact tracts of at least 5,760 acres, not  including any unavailable land contained therein. The exterior  boundaries of such tracts shall be in linear segments of not less than  two miles in length, except where adjoining unavailable lands or where  shorter segments are necessary to follow section lines where township  lines are offset along standard parallels caused by the convergence of  the meridians. However, selected tracts may contain less than 5,760  acres where there is good cause shown for such selection, taking into  consideration good land management planning and principles for the  potentially remaining public lands, and which would not leave unduly  fragmented tracts of such public lands. Each tract selected shall not be  considered to be reasonably compact if (1) it excludes other lands for  selection within its exterior boundaries, or (2) an isolated tract of  public land of less than 1,280 acres remains after selection of the  total entitlement. Regional corporations shall not be precluded from  selecting less than 5,760 acres where the entire tract available for  selection constitutes less than 5,760 acres. Selection shall conform as  nearly as practicable to the United States land survey system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notice of the filing of such selections, including the date by  which any protest of the selection should be filed, shall be published  once in the Federal Register and one or more newspapers of general  circulation in Alaska once a week for three consecutive weeks by the  Bureau of Land Management. Any protest to the application should be  filed in the Bureau of Land Management office in which such selections  were filed within the time specified in the notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Appeals from decisions made by the Bureau of Land Management  with respect to such selections shall be made to the Board of Land  Appeals in accordance with 43 CFR part 4, subpart E.  [41 FR 14740, Apr. 7, 1976, as amended at 41 FR 49487, Nov. 9, 1976]</p>
