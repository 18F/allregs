                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Agreement-mandatory only. Subject to the provisions of paragraph  (d) of this section, any State having an agreement with the Social  Security Administration (SSA) under Sec. 416.2001(c) may enter into an  administration agreement with SSA under which SSA will make the  mandatory minimum supplementary payments on behalf of such State. An  agreement under Sec. 416.2001(c) and an administration agreement under  this paragraph may be consolidated into one agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Agreement--mandatory and optional payments. Subject to the  provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, any State may enter into an  agreement with SSA under which the State will provide both mandatory and  optional State supplementary payments and elect Federal administration  of such State supplementary payment programs. If SSA agrees to  administer such State's optional supplementary payments, the State must  also have SSA administer its mandatory minimum supplementary payments  unless the State is able to provide sufficient justification for  exemption from this requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Administration--combination. Any State may enter into an  agreement with SSA under which the State will provide mandatory minimum  supplementary payments and elect Federal administration of such payments  while providing optional State supplementary payments which it shall  administer itself. If the State chooses to administer such payment  itself, it may establish its own criteria for determining eligibility  requirements as well as the amounts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Conditions of administration agreement. The State and SSA may,  subject to the provisions of this subpart, enter into a written  agreement, in such form and containing such provisions not inconsistent  with this part as are found necessary by SSA, under which SSA will  administer the State supplementary payments on behalf of a State (or  political subdivision). Under such an agreement between SSA and a State,  specific Federal and State responsibilities for administration and  fiscal responsibilities will be stipulated. The regulations in effect  for the supplemental security income program shall be applicable in the  Federal administration of State supplementary payments except as may  otherwise be provided in this subpart as found by SSA to be necessary  for the effective and efficient administration of both the basic Federal  benefit and the State supplementary payment. If the State elects options  available under this subpart (specified in Secs. 416.2015-416.2035),  such options must be specified in the administration agreement.
