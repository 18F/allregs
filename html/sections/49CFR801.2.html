                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In implementing 5 U.S.C. 552, it is the policy of the NTSB to  make information available to the public to the greatest extent  possible, consistent with the mission of the NTSB. Information the NTSB  routinely provides to the public as part of a regular NTSB activity  (such as press releases and information disclosed on the NTSB's public  Web site) may be provided to the public without compliance with this  part. In addition, as a matter of policy, the NTSB may make  discretionary disclosures of records or information otherwise exempt  from disclosure under the FOIA whenever disclosure would not foreseeably  harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption; however, this policy  does not create any right enforceable in court.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Given the NTSB's stated policy of providing as much information  as possible regarding general NTSB operations and releasing documents  involving investigations, the NTSB strongly encourages requesters  seeking information to check the NTSB's Web site for such information  before submitting a FOIA request. For every investigation in which the  NTSB has determined the probable cause of an accident, the NTSB's docket  management system will include a ``public docket'' containing  documentation that the investigator-in-charge deemed pertinent to the  investigation. Requesters may obtain these public dockets without  submitting a FOIA request. The NTSB encourages all requesters to review  the public docket materials before submitting a FOIA request.</p>
