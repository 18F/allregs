                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a  furnisher must conduct a reasonable investigation of a direct dispute if  it relates to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The consumer's liability for a credit account or other debt with  the furnisher, such as direct disputes relating to whether there is or  has been identity theft or fraud against the consumer, whether there is  individual or joint liability on an account, or whether the consumer is  an authorized user of a credit account;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The terms of a credit account or other debt with the furnisher,  such as direct disputes relating to the type of account, principal  balance, scheduled payment amount on an account, or the amount of the  credit limit on an open-end account;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The consumer's performance or other conduct concerning an  account or other relationship with the furnisher, such as direct  disputes relating to the current payment status, high balance, date a  payment was made, the amount of a payment made, or the date an account  was opened or closed; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any other information contained in a consumer report regarding  an account or other relationship with the furnisher that bears on the  consumer's creditworthiness, credit standing, credit capacity,  character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of  living.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions. The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section do  not apply to a furnisher if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The direct dispute relates to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The consumer's identifying information (other than a direct  dispute relating to a consumer's liability for a credit account or other  debt with the furnisher, as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this  section) such as name(s), date of birth, Social Security number,  telephone number(s), or address(es);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The identity of past or present employers;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Inquiries or requests for a consumer report;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Information derived from public records, such as judgments,  bankruptcies, liens, and other legal matters (unless provided by a  furnisher with an account or other relationship with the consumer);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Information related to fraud alerts or active duty alerts; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Information provided to a consumer reporting agency by another  furnisher; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The furnisher has a reasonable belief that the direct dispute is  submitted by, is prepared on behalf of the consumer by, or is submitted  on a form supplied to the consumer by, a credit repair organization, as  defined in 15 U.S.C. 1679a(3), or an entity that would be a credit  repair organization, but for 15 U.S.C. 1679a(3)(B)(i).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Direct dispute address. A furnisher is required to investigate a  direct dispute only if a consumer submits a dispute notice to the  furnisher at:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The address of a furnisher provided by a furnisher and set forth  on a consumer report relating to the consumer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An address clearly and conspicuously specified by the furnisher  for submitting direct disputes that is provided to the consumer in  writing or electronically (if the consumer has agreed to the electronic  delivery of information from the furnisher); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any business address of the furnisher if the furnisher has not  so specified and provided an address for submitting direct disputes  under paragraphs (c)(1) or (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Direct dispute notice contents. A dispute notice must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sufficient information to identify the account or other  relationship that is in dispute, such as an account number and the name,  address, and telephone number of the consumer, if applicable;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The specific information that the consumer is disputing and an  explanation of the basis for the dispute; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All supporting documentation or other information reasonably  required by the furnisher to substantiate the   basis of the dispute. This documentation may include, for example: A  copy of the relevant portion of the consumer report that contains the  allegedly inaccurate information; a police report; a fraud or identity  theft affidavit; a court order; or account statements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Duty of furnisher after receiving a direct dispute notice. After  receiving a dispute notice from a consumer pursuant to paragraphs (c)  and (d) of this section, the furnisher must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conduct a reasonable investigation with respect to the disputed  information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Review all relevant information provided by the consumer with  the dispute notice;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Complete its investigation of the dispute and report the results  of the investigation to the consumer before the expiration of the period  under section 611(a)(1) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C.  1681i(a)(1)) within which a consumer reporting agency would be required  to complete its action if the consumer had elected to dispute the  information under that section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the investigation finds that the information reported was  inaccurate, promptly notify each consumer reporting agency to which the  furnisher provided inaccurate information of that determination and  provide to the consumer reporting agency any correction to that  information that is necessary to make the information provided by the  furnisher accurate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Frivolous or irrelevant disputes. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A furnisher is not  required to investigate a direct dispute if the furnisher has reasonably  determined that the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant. A dispute  qualifies as frivolous or irrelevant if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The consumer did not provide sufficient information to  investigate the disputed information as required by paragraph (d) of  this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The direct dispute is substantially the same as a dispute  previously submitted by or on behalf of the consumer, either directly to  the furnisher or through a consumer reporting agency, with respect to  which the furnisher has already satisfied the applicable requirements of  the Act or this section; provided, however, that a direct dispute is not  substantially the same as a dispute previously submitted if the dispute  includes information listed in paragraph (d) of this section that had  not previously been provided to the furnisher; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The furnisher is not required to investigate the direct  dispute because one or more of the exceptions listed in paragraph (b) of  this section applies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notice of determination. Upon making a determination that a  dispute is frivolous or irrelevant, the furnisher must notify the  consumer of the determination not later than five business days after  making the determination, by mail or, if authorized by the consumer for  that purpose, by any other means available to the furnisher.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Contents of notice of determination that a dispute is frivolous  or irrelevant. A notice of determination that a dispute is frivolous or  irrelevant must include the reasons for such determination and identify  any information required to investigate the disputed information, which  notice may consist of a standardized form describing the general nature  of such information.
