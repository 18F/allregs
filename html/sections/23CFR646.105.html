                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Contractors may be subject to liability with respect to bodily  injury to or death of persons, and injury to, or destruction of  property, which may be suffered by persons other than their own  employees as a result of their operations in connection with  construction of highway projects located in whole or in part within  railroad right-of-way and financed in whole or in part with Federal  funds. Protection to cover such liability of contractors shall be  furnished under regular contractors' public liability and property  damage insurance policies issued in the names of the contractors. Such  policies shall be so written as to furnish protection to contractors  respecting their operations in performing work covered by their  contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where a contractor sublets a part of the work on any project to  a subcontractor, the contractor shall be required to secure insurance  protection in his own behalf under contractor's public liability and  property damage insurance policies to cover any liability imposed on him  by law for damages because of bodily injury to, or death of, persons and  injury to, or destruction of, property as a result of work undertaken by  such subcontractors. In addition, the contractor shall provide for and  on behalf of any such subcontractors protection to cover like liability  imposed upon the latter as a result of their operations by means of  separate and individual contractor's public liability and property  damage policies; or, in the alternative, each subcontractor shall  provide satisfactory insurance on his own behalf to cover his individual  operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The contractor shall furnish to the State highway department  evidence satisfactory to such department and to the FHWA that the  insurance coverages required herein have been provided. The contractor  shall also furnish a copy of such evidence to the railroad or railroads  involved. The insurance specified shall be kept in force until all work  required to be performed shall have been satisfactorily completed and  accepted in accordance with the contract under which the construction  work is undertaken.</p>
