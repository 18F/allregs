                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. General policies for allowable costs are addressed in 2  CFR 200.101, 200.102, 200.400-200.475.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Eligible Management Costs--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Grantee. States are eligible to  receive management costs consisting of a maximum of 10 percent of the  planning and project activities awarded to the State,   each fiscal year under FMA and SRL, respectively. These costs must be  included in the application to FEMA. An Indian tribal government  applying directly to FEMA is eligible for management costs consisting of  a maximum of 10 percent of grants awarded for planning and project  activities under the SRL and FMA programs respectively.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Subgrantee. Subapplicants may include a maximum of 5 percent of  the total funds requested for their subapplication for management costs  to support the implementation of their planning or project activity.  These costs must be included in the subapplication to the State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Indirect costs. Indirect costs of administering the FMA and SRL  programs are eligible as part of the 10 percent management costs for the  grantee or the 5 percent management costs of the subgrantee, but in no  case do they make the recipient eligible for additional management costs  that exceed the caps identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. In  addition, all costs must be in accordance with the provisions of 2 CFR  parts 200 and 3002.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Pre-award costs. FEMA may fund eligible pre-award planning or  project costs at its discretion and as funds are available. Grantees and  subgrantees may be reimbursed for eligible pre-award costs for  activities directly related to the development of the project or  planning proposal. These costs can only be incurred during the open  application period of the respective grant program. Costs associated  with implementation of the activity but incurred prior to grant award  are not eligible. Therefore, activities where implementation is  initiated or completed prior to award are not eligible and will not be  reimbursed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Duplication of benefits. Grant funds may not duplicate benefits  received by or available to applicants, subapplicants and project  participants from insurance, other assistance programs, legal awards, or  any other source to address the same purpose. Such individual or entity  must notify the grantee and FEMA of all benefits that it receives or  anticipates from other sources for the same purpose. FEMA will reduce  the subgrant award by the amounts available for the same purpose from  another source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Negligence or other tortious conduct. FEMA grant funds are not  available where an applicant, subapplicant, other project participant,  or third party's negligence or intentional actions contributed to the  conditions to be mitigated. If the applicant, subapplicant, or project  participant suspects negligence or other tortious conduct by a third  party for causing such condition, they are responsible for taking all  reasonable steps to recover all costs attributable to the tortious  conduct of the third party. FEMA generally considers such amounts to be  duplicated benefits available for the same purpose, and will treat them  consistent with paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> FEMA grant funds are not available to satisfy or reimburse for  legal obligations, such as those imposed by a legal settlement, court  order, or State law.  [72 FR 61738, Oct. 31, 2007, as amended at 79 FR 76084, Dec. 19, 2014]</p>
