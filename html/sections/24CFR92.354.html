                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Every contract for the construction (rehabilitation  or new construction) of housing that includes 12 or more units assisted  with HOME funds must contain a provision requiring the payment of not  less than the wages prevailing in the locality, as predetermined by the  Secretary of Labor pursuant to the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 3141), to  all laborers and mechanics employed in the development of any part of  the housing. Such contracts must also be subject to the overtime  provisions, as applicable, of the Contract Work Hours and Safety  Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 3701).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The contract for construction must contain these wage provisions  if HOME funds are used for any project costs in Sec. 92.206, including  construction or nonconstruction costs, of housing with 12 or more HOME- assisted units. When HOME funds are only used to assist homebuyers to  acquire single-family housing, and not for any other project costs, the  wage provisions apply to the construction of the housing if there is a  written agreement with the owner or developer of the housing that HOME  funds will be used to assist homebuyers to buy the housing and the  construction contract covers 12 or more housing units to be purchased  with HOME assistance. The wage provisions apply to any construction  contract that includes a total of 12 or more HOME-assisted units,  whether one or more than one project is covered by the construction  contract. Once they are determined to be applicable, the wage provisions  must be contained in the construction contract so as to cover all  laborers and mechanics employed in the development of the entire  project, including portions other than the assisted units. Arranging  multiple construction contracts within a single project for the purpose  of avoiding the wage provisions is not permitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Participating jurisdictions, contractors, subcontractors, and  other participants must comply with regulations issued under these acts  and with other Federal laws and regulations pertaining to labor  standards, as applicable. Participating jurisdictions shall be  responsible for ensuring compliance by contractors and subcontractors  with labor standards described in this section. In accordance with  procedures specified by HUD, participating jurisdictions shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Ensure that bid and contract documents contain required labor  standards provisions and the appropriate Department of Labor wage  determinations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Conduct on-site inspections and employee interviews;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Collect and review certified weekly payroll reports;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Correct all labor standards violations promptly;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Maintain documentation of administrative and enforcement  activities; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Require certification as to compliance with the provisions of  this section before making any payment under such contracts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Volunteers. The prevailing wage provisions of paragraph (a) of  this section do not apply to an individual who receives no compensation  or is paid expenses, reasonable benefits, or a nominal fee to perform  the services for which the individual volunteered and who is not  otherwise employed at any time in the construction work. See 24 CFR part  70.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sweat equity. The prevailing wage provisions of paragraph (a) of  this section do not apply to members of an eligible family who provide  labor in exchange for acquisition of a property for homeownership or  provide labor in lieu of, or as a supplement to, rent payments.
