                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> License Requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A license is required for anti- terrorism purposes to export or reexport to Iran any item for which AT  column 1 or AT column 2 is indicated in the Country Chart column of the  applicable ECCN or any item described in ECCNs 1C350, 1C355, 1C395,  2A994, 2D994 and 2E994. See paragraph (a)(5) of this section for  controls maintained by the Department of the Treasury. See Sec. 746.7  of the EAR for additional EAR license requirements that apply to Iran.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Secretary of State has designated Iran as a country whose  Government has repeatedly provided support for acts of international  terrorism.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In support of U.S. foreign policy applicable to terrorism- supporting countries, the EAR imposes anti-terrorism license  requirements on exports and reexports to Iran pursuant to sections 6(j)  and 6(a) of the Export Administration Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Section 6(j) anti-terrorism controls. Section 6(j) requirements  apply to all exports and reexports destined to the police, military or  other sensitive end-users of items listed on the Commerce Control List  (Supp. No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) for which any listed reason for  control in the applicable ECCN is NS (national security), CB (chemical  or biological weapons proliferation), MT (missile proliferation), NP  (nuclear weapons proliferation) or an Export Control Classification  Number ending in ``18'' (military related items). BIS may not issue a  license for a transaction subject to section 6(j) controls until 30 days  after the notification described in Section 6(j)(2) of the Export  Administration Act is delivered to the committees of Congress specified  in that section. License applications for all other items controlled  under section 6(a) are also reviewed to determine whether section 6(j)  applies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Section 6(a) anti-terrorism controls. Section 6(a) requirements  apply to all exports and reexports regardless of the end user of items  described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Exports and certain reexports to Iran are subject to a  comprehensive embargo administered by the Department of the Treasury's  Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). If you wish to export or  reexport to Iran, the Government of Iran or any entity owned or  controlled by that Government, you should review part 746 of the EAR and  consult with OFAC. Please note that authorization from OFAC constitutes  authorization under the EAR and no separate license or authorization  from BIS is required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Licensing policy. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act  of October 23, 1992, requires BIS to deny licenses for items controlled  to Iran for national security (section 5 of the 1979 EAA) or foreign  policy reasons (section 6 of the 1979 EAA), absent contract   sanctity or a Presidential waiver. License applications for which  contract sanctity is established may be considered under policies in  effect prior to the enactment of that Act. Otherwise, licenses for such  items to Iran are subject to a general policy of denial.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> License applications for items controlled under section 6(a) of  the EAA will also be reviewed to determine whether requirements of  section 6(j) apply. Whenever the Secretary of State determines that an  export or reexport could make a significant contribution to the military  potential of Iran, including its military logistics capability, or could  enhance Iran's ability to support acts of international terrorism, the  Secretaries of State and Commerce will notify the Congress 30 days prior  to the issuance of a license.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contract Sanctity. Section 6(f) of the Export Administration Act  requires that a report be delivered to Congress before foreign policy  based export controls are imposed, expanded or extended. Consistent with  section 6(p) of the Export Administration Act, certain exports or  reexports in fulfillment of contracts entered into before such delivery  of the report applicable to a particular license requirement or  licensing policy may be subject to the license requirements and  licensing policy that were in force before the report was delivered.  License applicants who wish to have their application considered under  such pre-existing requirements or policy must include evidence of the  pre-existing contract with their license applications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> U.S. controls. Although the United States seeks cooperation from  like-minded countries in maintaining anti-terrorism controls, at this  time these controls are maintained only by the United States.
