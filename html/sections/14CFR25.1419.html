                            <p class="depth0">If the applicant seeks certification for flight in icing conditions, the airplane must be able to safely operate in the continuous maximum and intermittent maximum icing conditions of appendix C. To establish this--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An analysis must be performed to establish that the ice protection for the various components of the airplane is adequate, taking into account the various airplane operational configurations; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To verify the ice protection analysis, to check for icing anomalies, and to demonstrate that the ice protection system and its components are effective, the airplane or its components must be flight tested in the various operational configurations, in measured natural atmospheric icing conditions and, as found necessary, by one or more of the following means:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Laboratory dry air or simulated icing tests, or a combination of both, of the components or models of the components.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Flight dry air tests of the ice protection system as a whole, or of its individual components.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Flight tests of the airplane or its components in measured simulated icing conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Caution information, such as an amber caution light or equivalent, must be provided to alert the flightcrew when the anti-ice or de-ice system is not functioning normally.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For turbine engine powered airplanes, the ice protection provisions of this section are considered to be applicable primarily to the airframe. For

the powerplant installation, certain additional provisions of subpart E of this part may be found applicable.
