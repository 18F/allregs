                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Membership. The OF board of directors shall consist of seventeen  part-time members as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The twelve Bank presidents, ex officio, provided that if the  presidency of any Bank becomes vacant, the person designated by the  Bank's board of directors to temporarily fulfill the duties of president  of that Bank shall serve on the OF board of directors until the  presidency is filled permanently; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Five Independent Directors who--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each shall be a citizen of the United States;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> As a group, shall have substantial experience in financial and  accounting matters; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Shall not have any material relationship with a Bank, or the  OF (directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an  organization), as determined under criteria set forth in a policy  adopted by the OF board of directors. At a minimum, such policy shall  provide that an Independent Director may not:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Be an officer, director, or employee of any Bank or member of a  Bank, or have been an officer director or employee of a Bank or member  of a Bank during the previous three years;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Be an officer or employee of the OF, or have been an officer or  employee of the OF during the previous three years; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em>, a holding  company of an entity that is part of a consolidated obligations seller  or dealer group shall be deemed to be part of the consolidated  obligations selling or dealer group if the assets of the holding  company's subsidiaries that are part of a consolidated obligation seller  or dealer group constitute 35% or more of the consolidated assets of the  holding company.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)</em> and (c)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of  this section, each Independent Director shall serve for five-year terms  (which shall be staggered so that no more than one Independent Director  seat would be scheduled to become vacant in any one year), and shall be  subject to removal or suspension in accordance with Sec. 1273.4(a) of  this part. An Independent Director may not serve more than two full,  consecutive terms, provided that any partial term served by an  Independent Director pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, or  time served by a private citizen member of the OF Board pursuant to an  appointment made prior to the effective date of this part, shall not  count as a term for purposes of this restriction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The OF board of directors shall fill any vacancy among the  Independent Directors occurring prior to   the scheduled end of a term by majority vote, subject to FHFA's review  of, and non-objection to, the new Independent Director. The OF board of  directors shall provide FHFA with the same biographic and background  information about the new Independent Director required under paragraph  (d) of this section, and FHFA shall have the same rights of non- objection to the Independent Director (and to appoint a different  Independent Director) as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. A  person shall be elected (or otherwise appointed by FHFA) under this  paragraph to serve only for the remainder of the term associated with  the vacant directorship.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Initial selection of Independent Directors.(1) As soon as  practicable after the effective date of this regulation, FHFA shall fill  the initial Independent Director positions by appointment. The  Independent Directors shall be appointed for such periods of time, not  to exceed five years, to assure the terms are staggered in accordance  with paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this section, or some combination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Election of Independent Directors after the initial terms. Once  the terms of the Independent Directors initially appointed by FHFA  expire or the positions otherwise become vacant, the Independent  Directors subsequently shall be elected by majority vote of the OF board  of directors, subject to FHFA's review of, and non-objection to, each  Independent Director. The OF board of directors shall provide FHFA with  relevant biographic and background information, including information  demonstrating that the new Independent Director meets the requirements  of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, at least 20 business days before  the person assumes any duties as a member of the OF board of directors.  If the OF board of directors, in FHFA's judgment, fails to elect a  suitably qualified person, FHFA may appoint some other person who meets  the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section. FHFA will provide  notice of its objection to a particular Independent Director prior to  the date that such Director is to assume duties as a member of the OF  board of directors. Such notice shall indicate whether, given FHFA's  objection, FHFA intends to fill the seat through appointment or a new  election should be held by the OF board of directors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Initial Selection of Chair and Vice-Chair. The first Chair and  Vice-Chair of the OF board of directors after the effective date of this  regulation shall be appointed by FHFA. The Chair shall be selected from  among the Independent Directors appointed under paragraph (c)(1) of this  section. The Vice-Chair shall be selected from among all OF board  directors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Subsequent Election of Chair and Vice-Chair. After the terms of  the persons selected under paragraph (e) of this section expire or the  positions otherwise become vacant:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Subsequent Chairs shall be elected by majority vote of the OF  board of directors from among the Independent Directors then serving on  the OF board of directors; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subsequent Vice-Chairs shall be elected by majority vote of the  OF board of directors from among all directors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The OF board of directors shall promptly inform FHFA of the  election of a Chair or Vice-Chair. If FHFA objects to any Chair or Vice- Chair elected by the OF board of directors, FHFA shall provide written  notice of its objection within 20 business days of the date that FHFA  first receives the notice of the election of the Chair and or Vice- Chair, and the OF board of directors must then promptly elect a new  Chair or Vice-Chair, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> By-laws and Committees. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The OF board of directors shall  adopt by-laws governing the manner in which   the board conducts its affairs, which shall be consistent with the  requirements of this part and other applicable laws and regulations as  administered by FHFA. The by-laws of the board of directors shall be  subject to review and approval by FHFA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In addition to the Audit Committee required under Sec. 1273.9  of this part, the OF board of directors may establish other committees,  including an Executive Committee. The duties and powers of such  committee, including any powers delegated by the OF board of directors,  shall be specified in the by-laws of the board of directors or the  charter of the committee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Compensation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Bank presidents shall not receive any  additional compensation or reimbursement as a result of their service as  a director of the OF board.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The OF shall pay reasonable compensation and expenses to the  Independent Directors in accordance with the requirements for payment of  compensation and expenses to Bank directors as set forth in part 1261 of  this title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Corporate Governance and Indemnification. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. The  corporate governance practices and procedures of the OF, and practices  and procedures related to indemnification (including advancement of  expenses) shall comply with applicable Federal law rules and  regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> within 90 calendar days from the date that it holds the  organizational meeting required under Sec. 1273.10(a) of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Indemnification. Subject to paragraphs (i)(1) and (i)(2) of this  section, to the extent applicable, the OF shall indemnify (and advance  the expenses of) its directors, officers and employees under such terms  and conditions as are determined by the OF board of directors. The OF  shall be authorized to maintain insurance for its directors, the CEO,  and any other officer or employee of the OF. Nothing in this paragraph  shall affect any rights to indemnification (including the advancement of  expenses) that a director, the CEO, or any other officer or employee of  the OF had with respect to any actions, omissions, transactions, or  facts occurring prior to the effective date of this paragraph (i).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Delegation. In addition to any delegation to a committee allowed  under paragraph (g) of this section, the OF board of directors may  delegate any of its authority or duties to any employee of the OF in  order to enable OF to carry out its functions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Outside staff and consultants. In carrying out its duties and  responsibilities, the OF board of directors, or any committee thereof,  shall have authority to retain staff and outside counsel, independent  accountants, or other outside consultants at the expense of the OF.</p>
