                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The grantee shall adhere to the Buy America clause set forth in  its grant contract with FTA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The grantee shall include in its bid or request for proposal  (RFP) specification for procurement within the scope of this part an  appropriate notice of the Buy America provision. Such specifications  shall require, as a condition of responsiveness, that the bidder or  offeror submit with the bid or offer a completed Buy America certificate  in accordance with Sec. Sec. 661.6 or 661.12 of this part, as  appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A bidder or offeror who has submitted an incomplete Buy America  certificate or an incorrect certificate of noncompliance through  inadvertent or clerical error (but not including failure to sign the  certificate, submission of certificates of both compliance and non- compliance, or failure to submit any certification), may submit to the  FTA Chief Counsel within ten (10) days of bid opening of submission or a  final offer, a written explanation of the circumstances surrounding the  submission of the incomplete or incorrect certification in accordance  with 28 U.S.C. 1746, sworn under penalty of perjury, stating that the  submission resulted from inadvertent or clerical error. The bidder or  offeror will also submit evidence of intent, such as information about  the origin of the product, invoices, or other working documents.   The bidder or offeror will simultaneously send a copy of this  information to the FTA grantee.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The FTA Chief Counsel may request additional information from  the bidder or offeror, if necessary. The grantee may not make a contract  award until the FTA Chief Counsel issues his/her determination, except  as provided in Sec. 661.15(m).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For negotiated procurements, compliance with the Buy America  requirements shall be determined on the basis of the certification  submitted with the final offer or final revised proposal. However, where  a grantee awards on the basis of initial proposals without discussion,  the certification submitted with the initial proposal shall control.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Certification based on ignorance of the proper application of  the Buy America requirements is not an inadvertent or clerical error.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Whether or not a bidder or offeror certifies that it will comply  with the applicable requirement, such bidder or offeror is bound by its  original certification (in the case of a sealed bidding procurement) or  its certification submitted with its final offer (in the case of a  negotiated procurement) and is not permitted to change its certification  after bid opening or submission of a final offer. Where a bidder or  offeror certifies that it will comply with the applicable Buy America  requirements, the bidder, offeror, or grantee is not eligible for a  waiver of those requirements.
