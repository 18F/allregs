                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Covered multifamily dwellings for first occupancy after March 13, 1991 shall be designed and constructed to have at least one building entrance on an accessible route unless it is impractical to do so because of the terrain or unusual characteristics of the site. For purposes of this section, a covered multifamily dwelling shall be deemed to be designed and constructed for first occupancy on or before March 13, 1991, if the dwelling is occupied by that date, or if the last building permit or renewal thereof for the dwelling is issued by a State, County or local government on or before June 15, 1990. The burden of establishing impracticality because of terrain or unusual site characteristics is on the person or persons who designed or constructed the housing facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The application of paragraph (a) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example (1): A real estate developer plans to construct six covered multifamily dwelling units on a site with a hilly terrain. Because of the terrain, it will be necessary to climb a long and steep stairway in order to enter the dwellings. Since there is no practical way to provide an accessible route to any of the dwellings, one need not be provided.</p><p class="depth2">Example (2): A real estate developer plans to construct a building consisting of 10 units of multifamily housing on a waterfront site that floods frequently. Because of this unusual characteristic of the site, the builder plans to construct the building on stilts. It is customary for housing in the geographic area where the site is located to be built on stilts. The housing may lawfully be constructed on the proposed site on stilts even though this means that there will be no practical way to provide an accessible route to the building entrance.</p><p class="depth2">Example (3): A real estate developer plans to construct a multifamily housing facility on a particular site. The developer would like the facility to be built on the site to contain as many units as possible. Because of the configuration and terrain of the site, it is possible to construct a building with 105 units on the site provided the site does not have an accessible route leading to the building entrance. It is also possible to construct a building on the site with an accessible route leading to the building entrance. However, such a building would have no more than 100 dwelling units. The building to be constructed on the site must have a building entrance on an accessible route because it is not impractical to provide such an entrance because of the terrain or unusual characteristics of the site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All covered multifamily dwellings for first occupancy after March 13, 1991 with a building entrance on an accessible route shall be designed and constructed in such a manner that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The public and common use areas are readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All the doors designed to allow passage into and within all premises are sufficiently wide to allow passage by handicapped persons in wheelchairs; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All premises within covered multifamily dwelling units contain the following features of adaptable design:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An accessible route into and through the covered dwelling unit;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats, and other environmental controls in accessible locations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Reinforcements in bathroom walls to allow later installation of grab bars around the toilet, tub, shower, stall and shower seat, where such facilities are provided; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Usable kitchens and bathrooms such that an individual in a wheelchair can maneuver about the space.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The application of paragraph (c) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example (1): A developer plans to construct a 100 unit condominium apartment building with one elevator. In accordance with paragraph (a), the building has at least one accessible route leading to an accessible entrance. All 100 units are covered multifamily dwelling units and they all must be designed and constructed so that they comply with the accessibility requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2">Example (2): A developer plans to construct 30 garden apartments in a three story building. The building will not have an elevator. The building will have one accessible entrance which will be on the first floor. Since the building does not have an elevator, only the ground floor units are covered multifamily units. The ground floor is the first floor because that is the floor that has an accessible entrance. All of the dwelling units on the first floor must meet the accessibility requirements of paragraph (c) of this section and must have access to at least one of each type of public or common use area available for residents in the building.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> Compliance with the appropriate requirements of ICC/ANSI A117.1-2003 (incorporated by reference at Sec. 100.201a), ICC/ANSI A117.1-1998 (incorporated by reference at Sec. 100.201a), CABO/ANSI A117.1-1992 (incorporated by reference at Sec. 100.201a), or ANSI A117.1-1986 (incorporated by reference at Sec. 100.201a) suffices to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compliance with the appropriate requirements of ICC/ANSI A117.1-2003 (incorporated by reference at Sec. 100.201a), ICC/ANSI A117.1-1998 (incorporated by reference at Sec. 100.201a), CABO/ANSI A117.1-1992 (incorporated by reference at Sec. 100.201a), or ANSI A117.1-1986 (incorporated by reference at Sec. 100.201a) suffices to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following also qualify as HUD-recognized safe harbors for compliance with the Fair Housing Act design and construction requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines, March 6, 1991, in conjunction with the Supplement to Notice of Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines: Questions and Answers About the Guidelines, June 28, 1994;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Fair Housing Act Design Manual, published by HUD in 1996, updated in 1998;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> 2000 ICC Code Requirements for Housing Accessibility (CRHA), published by the International Code Council (ICC), October 2000 (with corrections contained in ICC-issued errata sheet), if adopted without modification and without waiver of any of the provisions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> 2000 International Building Code (IBC), as amended by the 2001 Supplement to the International Building Code (2001 IBC Supplement), if adopted without modification and without waiver of any of the provisions intended to address the Fair Housing Act's design and construction requirements;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> 2003 International Building Code (IBC), if adopted without modification and without waiver of any of the provisions intended to address the Fair Housing Act's design and construction requirements, and conditioned upon the ICC publishing and distributing a statement to jurisdictions and past and future purchasers of the 2003 IBC stating, ``ICC interprets Section 1104.1, and specifically, the Exception to Section 1104.1, to be read together with Section 1107.4, and that the Code requires an accessible pedestrian route from site arrival points to accessible building entrances, unless site impracticality applies. Exception 1 to Section 1107.4 is not applicable to site arrival points for any Type B dwelling units because site impracticality is addressed under Section 1107.7.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> 2006 International Building Code; published by ICC, January 2006, with the January 31, 2007, erratum to correct the text missing from Section 1107.7.5, if adopted without modification and without waiver of any of the provisions intended to address the Fair Housing Act's design and construction requirements, and interpreted in accordance with the relevant 2006 IBC Commentary;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Compliance with any other safe harbor recognized by HUD in the future and announced in the Federal Register will also suffice to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Compliance with a duly enacted law of a State or unit of general local government that includes the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)(1)</em> It is the policy of HUD to encourage States and units of general local government to include, in their existing procedures for the review and approval of newly constructed covered multifamily dwellings, determinations as to whether the design and construction of such dwellings are consistent with paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is the policy of HUD to encourage States and units of general local government to include, in their existing procedures for the review and approval of newly constructed covered multifamily dwellings, determinations as to whether the design and construction of such dwellings are consistent with paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A State or unit of general local government may review and approve newly constructed multifamily dwellings for the purpose of making determinations as to whether the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Determinations of compliance or noncompliance by a State or a unit of general local government under paragraph (f) or (g) of this section are not conclusive in enforcement proceedings under the Fair Housing Amendments Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> This subpart does not invalidate or limit any law of a State or political subdivision of a State that requires dwellings to be designed and constructed in a manner that affords handicapped persons greater access than is required by this subpart.
