                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Notice of MLR information when the MLR standard is met or exceeded--(1) General requirement. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, for the 2011 MLR reporting year, an issuer whose MLR meets or exceeds the applicable MLR standard required by Sec. 158.210 or Sec. 158.211 must provide each policyholder and subscriber of a group health plan, and each subscriber in the individual market, a notice in accordance with the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Timing. An issuer must provide the notice required in this paragraph (a) with the first plan document that the issuer provides to enrollees on or after July 1, 2012.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Form and appearance. The notice must be prominently displayed in clear, conspicuous 14-point bold type on the front of the plan document or as a separate notice. The notice may be provided electronically, if the requirements for electronic disclosure under section 2715 of the Public Health Service Act are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Language. The following language must be used to satisfy the notice requirement of this paragraph (a):</p><p class="depth0">Medical Loss Ratio Information--The Affordable Care Act requires health insurers in the individual and small group markets to spend at least 80 percent of the premiums they receive on health care services and activities to improve health care quality (in the large group market, this amount is 85 percent). This is referred to as the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) rule or the 80/20 rule. If a health insurer does not spend at least 80 percent of the premiums it receives on health care services and activities to improve health care quality, the insurer must rebate the difference.</p><p class="depth0">A health insurer's Medical Loss Ratio is determined separately for each State's individual, small group and large group markets in which the health insurer offers health insurance. In some States, health insurers must meet a higher or lower Medical Loss Ratio. No later than August 1, 2012, health insurers must send any rebates due for 2011 and information to employers and individuals regarding any rebates due for 2011.</p><p class="depth0">You are receiving this notice because your health insurer had a Medical Loss Ratio for 2011 that met or exceeded the required Medical Loss Ratio. For more information on Medical Loss Ratio and your health insurer's Medical Loss Ratio, visit www.HealthCare.gov.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions. The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to an issuer that reports its experience separately under Sec. 158.120(d)(3) or (d)(4), or to an issuer whose experience is non-credible as defined in Sec. 158.230(c)(3) and determined in accordance with Sec. 158.231.
