                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Use the test procedures specified in the standard-setting part for showing that your engines/equipment meet emission standards. The test order will give further testing instructions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If no test cells are available at a given facility, you may make alternate testing arrangements with our approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Test at least two engines/equipment in each 24-hour period (including void tests). However, if your projected U.S. nonroad sales within the family are less than 7,500 for the year, you may test a minimum of one per 24-hour period. If you request and justify it, we may approve a lower testing rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For exhaust emissions, accumulate service on test engines/equipment at a minimum rate of 6 hours per engine or piece of equipment during each 24-hour period. The first 24-hour period for service accumulation begins when you finish preparing an engine or piece of equipment for testing. The minimum service accumulation rate does not apply on weekends or holidays. You may ask us to approve a lower service accumulation rate. We may require you to accumulate hours more rapidly than the minimum rate, as appropriate. Plan your service accumulation to allow testing at the rate specified in paragraph (c) of this section. Select operation for accumulating operating hours on your test engines/equipment to represent normal in-use operation for the family.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Test engines/equipment in the same order you select them.</p>
