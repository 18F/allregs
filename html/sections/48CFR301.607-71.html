General and specific core competencies, training, and required experience vary by certification level. (Note: Individuals certified under the FAC-P/PM program meet the general competency and experience standards for P/PM certification. However, IT Program and Project Managers should attain/demonstrate IT-specific P/PM requirements.

Experience requirements vary by certification level. For example, for certification at the Entry/Apprentice--Level I, at least 1 year of project management experience within the last 5 years is required. The Mid-level/Journeyman--Level II requires at least 2 years of program or project management experience within the last 5 years. The Senior/Expert--Level III requires at least 4 years of program and project management experience on Federal projects within the last 5 years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Additional OPDIV guidance. OPDIVs may issue supplemental guidance and requirements for selection and assignment of Program and Project Managers and require additional skills and competencies to meet organizational or mission needs. However, OPDIVs may not reduce the requirements specified in the P/PM Handbook.</p>
