That formula is as follows:  National charge data x updated geographic adjustment factors (GAFs) =  maximum VFC fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The State Medicaid Agency must submit a state plan amendment  that identifies the amount that the state will pay providers for the  administration of a qualified pediatric vaccine to a Medicaid-eligible  child under the VFC program. The amount identified by the state cannot  exceed the state's regional maximum administration fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Physicians participating in the VFC program can charge federally  vaccine-eligible children who are not enrolled in Medicaid the maximum  administration fee (if that fee reflects the provider's cost of  administration) regardless of whether the state has established a lower  administration fee under the Medicaid program. However, there would be  no federal Medicaid matching funds available for the administration  since these children are not eligible for Medicaid.</p>
