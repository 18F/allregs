                            <p class="depth0">As used in this subpart, the following terms have the following  meanings:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Agency has the meaning given in 5 U.S.C. 551(1) and 5 U.S.C.  552(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Appeal means a request for a review of the agency's  determination with regard to a fee waiver, category of requester,  expedited processing, or denial in whole or in part of a request for  access to a record or records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Business information means trade secrets or other commercial or  financial information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Business submitter means any entity which provides business  information to the Agency and which has a proprietary interest in the  information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Computer software means tools by which records are created,  stored, and retrieved. Normally, computer software, including source  code, object code, and listings of source and object codes, regardless  of medium, are not agency records. Proprietary (or copyrighted) software  is not an agency record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Confidential commercial information means records provided to  the government by a submitter that arguably contain material exempt from  release under Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C.  552(b)(4), because disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause  substantial competitive harm.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Duplication refers to the process of making a copy of a record  in order to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of  paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine-readable  documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Electronic records mean those records and information which are  created, stored, and retrievable by electronic means. This ordinarily  does not include computer software, which is a tool by which to create,  store, or retrieve electronic records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Request means any request for records made pursuant to 5 U.S.C.  552(a)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Requester means any person who makes a request for access to  records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Review, for fee purposes, refers to the process of examining  records located in response to a commercial use request to determine  whether any portion of any record located is permitted to be withheld.  It also includes processing any records for disclosure; e.g., doing all  that is necessary to excise them and otherwise prepare them for release.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Search includes all time spent looking for material that is  responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line  identification of material within records. Searches may be done manually  or by automated means.</p>
