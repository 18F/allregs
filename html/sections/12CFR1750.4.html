Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 1750--Minimum Capital Components</p><p class="depth2">for Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Rate Contracts</p><p class="depth2">1. The minimum capital components for interest rate and foreign  exchange rate contracts are computed on the basis of the credit  equivalent amounts of such contracts. Credit equivalent amounts are  computed for each of the following off-balance sheet interest rate and  foreign exchange rate contracts:</p><p class="depth2">a. Interest Rate Contracts</p><p class="depth2">i. Single currency interest rate swaps.</p><p class="depth2">ii. Basis swaps.</p><p class="depth2">iii. Forward rate agreements.</p><p class="depth2">iv. Interest rate options purchased (including caps, collars, and  floors purchased).</p><p class="depth2">v. Any other instrument that gives rise to similar credit risks  (including when-issued securities and forward deposits accepted).</p><p class="depth2">b. Foreign Exchange Rate Contracts</p><p class="depth2">i. Cross-currency interest rate swaps.</p><p class="depth2">ii. Forward foreign exchange rate contracts.</p><p class="depth2">iii. Currency options purchased.</p><p class="depth2">iv. Any other instrument that gives rise to similar credit risks.</p><p class="depth2">2. Foreign exchange rate contracts with an original maturity of 14  calendar days or less and foreign exchange rate contracts traded on  exchanges that require daily payment of variation margins are excluded  from the minimum capital requirement computation. Over-the-counter  options purchased, however, are included and treated in the same way as  the other interest rate and foreign exchange rate contracts.</p><p class="depth2">3. Calculation of Credit Equivalent Amounts</p><p class="depth2">a. The minimum capital components for interest rate and foreign  exchange rate contracts are computed on the basis of the credit  equivalent amounts of such contracts. The credit equivalent amount of an  off-balance sheet interest rate and foreign exchange rate contract that  is not subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract in accordance  with this appendix A is equal to the sum of the current exposure  (sometimes referred to as the replacement cost) of the contract and an  estimate of the potential future credit exposure over the remaining life  of the contract.</p><p class="depth2">b. The current exposure is determined by the mark-to-market value of  the contract. If the mark-to-market value is positive, then the current  exposure is the mark-to-market value. If the mark-to-market value is  zero or negative, then the current exposure is zero. Mark-to-market  values are measured in United States dollars, regardless of the currency  or currencies specified in the contract, and should reflect changes in  the relevant rates, as well as counterparty credit quality.</p><p class="depth2">c. The potential future credit exposure of a contract, including a  contract with a negative mark-to-market value, is estimated by  multiplying the notional principal amount of the contract by a credit  conversion factor. The effective rather than the apparent or stated  notional amount must be used in this calculation. The credit conversion  factors are:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Foreign</p><p class="depth2">Interest rate  exchange rate</p><p class="depth2">Remaining maturity                contracts      contracts</p><p class="depth2"><em>(percent)</em>      (percent) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1 year or less............................            0.0            1.0 Over 1 year...............................            0.5            5.0 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">d. Because foreign exchange rate contracts involve an exchange of  principal upon maturity, and foreign exchange rates are generally more  volatile than interest rates, higher conversion factors have been  established for foreign exchange rate contracts than for interest rate  contracts.</p><p class="depth2">e. No potential future credit exposure is calculated for single  currency interest rate swaps in which payments are made based upon two  floating rate indexes, so-called floating/floating or basis swaps. The  credit exposure on these contracts is evaluated solely on the basis of  their mark-to-market values.</p><p class="depth2">4. Avoidance of Double Counting</p><p class="depth2">In certain cases, credit exposures arising from the interest rate  and foreign exchange instruments covered by this appendix A may already  be reflected, in part, on the balance sheet. To avoid double counting  such exposures in the assessment of capital adequacy, counterparty  credit exposures arising from the types of instruments covered by this  appendix A may need to be excluded from balance sheet assets in  calculating the minimum capital requirement.</p><p class="depth2">5. Collateral</p><p class="depth2">a. The sufficiency of collateral for off-balance sheet items is  determined by the market value of the collateral in relation to the  credit equivalent amount. Collateral held against a netting contract is  not recognized for minimum capital standard purposes unless it is  legally available to support the single legal obligation created by the  netting contract. Excess collateral held against one contract or a group  of contracts for which a recognized netting agreement exists may not be  considered.</p><p class="depth2">b. The only forms of collateral that are formally recognized by the  minimum capital standard framework are cash on deposit; securities  issued or guaranteed by the central governments of the OECD-based group  of countries, United States Government agencies, or United States  Government-sponsored   agencies; and securities issued by multilateral lending institutions or  regional development banks.</p><p class="depth2">6. Netting</p><p class="depth2">a. For purposes of this appendix A, netting refers to the offsetting  of positive and negative mark-to-market values in the determination of a  current exposure to be used in the calculation of a credit equivalent  amount. Any legally enforceable form of bilateral netting (that is,  netting with a single counterparty) of interest rate and foreign  exchange rate contracts is recognized for purposes of calculating the  credit equivalent amount provided that the following criteria are met:</p><p class="depth2">i. Netting must be accomplished under a written netting contract  that creates a single legal obligation, covering all included individual  contracts, with the effect that the Enterprise would have a claim to  receive, or obligation to pay, only the net amount of the sum of the  positive and negative mark-to-market values on included individual  contracts in the event that a counterparty, or a counterparty to whom  the contract has been validly assigned, fails to perform due to default,  insolvency, liquidation, or similar circumstances.</p><p class="depth2">ii. The Enterprise must obtain a written and reasoned legal  opinion(s) representing that in the event of a legal challenge-- including one resulting from default, insolvency, liquidation, or  similar circumstances--the relevant court and administrative authorities  would find the Enterprise's exposure to be such a net amount under--</p><p class="depth2">A. The law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is  chartered or the equivalent location in the case of noncorporate  entities, and if a branch of the counterparty is involved, then also  under the law of the jurisdiction in which the branch is located;</p><p class="depth2">B. The law that governs the individual contracts covered by the  netting contract; and</p><p class="depth2">C. The law that governs the netting contract.</p><p class="depth2">iii. The Enterprise must establish and maintain procedures to ensure  that the legal characteristics of netting contracts are kept under  review in the event of possible changes in relevant law.</p><p class="depth2">iv. The Enterprise must maintain in its files documentation adequate  to support the netting of rate contracts, including a copy of the  bilateral netting contract and necessary legal opinions.</p><p class="depth2">b. A contract containing a walkaway clause is not eligible for  netting for purposes of calculating the credit equivalent amount. \1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\1\ A walkaway clause is a provision in a netting contract that  permits a non-defaulting counterparty to make lower payments than it  would make otherwise under the contract, or no payment at all, to a  defaulter or to the estate of a defaulter, even if the defaulter or the  estate of the defaulter is a net creditor under the contract. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">c. By netting individual contracts for the purpose of calculating  its credit equivalent amount, the Enterprise represents that it has met  the requirements of this appendix A and all the appropriate documents  are in the Enterprise's files and available for inspection by OFHEO.  OFHEO may determine that an Enterprise's files are inadequate or that a  netting contract, or any of its underlying individual contracts, may not  be legally enforceable under any one of the bodies of law described in  this appendix A. If such a determination is made, the netting contract  may be disqualified from recognition for minimum capital standard  purposes or underlying individual contracts may be treated as though  they are not subject to the netting contract.</p><p class="depth2">d. The credit equivalent amount of interest rate and foreign  exchange rate contracts that are subject to a qualifying bilateral  netting contract is calculated by adding the current exposure of the  netting contract and the sum of the estimates of the potential future  credit exposures on all individual contracts subject to the netting  contract, estimated in accordance with paragraph 3 of this appendix A.  Offsetting contracts in the same currency maturing on the same date will  have lower potential future exposure as well as lower current exposure.  Therefore, for purposes of calculating potential future credit exposure  to a netting counterparty for foreign exchange rate contracts and other  similar contracts in which notional principal is equivalent to cash  flows, total notional principal is defined as the net receipts falling  due on each value date in each currency.</p><p class="depth2">e. The current exposure of the netting contract is determined by  summing all positive and negative mark-to-market values of the  individual contracts included in the netting contract. If the net sum of  the mark-to-market values is positive, then the current exposure of the  netting contract is equal to that sum. If the net sum of the mark-to- market values is zero or negative, then the current exposure of the  netting contract is zero. OFHEO may determine that a netting contract  qualifies for minimum capital standard netting treatment even though  certain individual contracts may not qualify. In such instances, the  nonqualifying contracts should be treated as individual contracts that  are not subject to the netting contract.</p><p class="depth2">f. In the event a netting contract covers contracts that are  normally excluded from the minimum capital requirement computation--for  example, foreign exchange rate   contracts with an original maturity of 14 calendar days or less, or  instruments traded on exchanges that require daily payment of variation  margin--an Enterprise may elect consistently either to include or  exclude all mark-to-market values of such contracts when determining net  current exposure.</p>
