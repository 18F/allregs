another survey of the provider's or supplier's compliance with specified Medicare conditions or requirements before taking the enforcement actions provided for at Sec. 488.24.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If CMS determines that a provider or supplier is not in compliance with applicable Medicare conditions or requirements, the provider or supplier may be subject to termination of the provider or supplier agreement under Sec. 489.53 of this chapter or of the supplier agreement in accordance with the applicable supplier conditions and any other applicable intermediate sanctions and remedies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Re-instating deemed status.
