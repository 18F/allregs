                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Notwithstanding the public solicitation requirements of this part, the Director may award non-competitively an extension or extensions of an existing concession contract to the current concessioner for additional terms not to exceed three years in the aggregate, e.g., the Director may award one extension with a three year term, two consecutive extensions, one with a two year term and one with a one year term, or three consecutive extensions with a term of one year each. The Director may award such extensions only if the Director determines that the extension is necessary to avoid interruption of visitor services. Before determining to award such a contract extension, the Director must take all reasonable and appropriate steps to consider alternatives to avoid an interruption of visitor services. Further, the Director must publish notice in the Federal Register of the proposed extension at least 30 days in advance of the award of the extension (except in emergency situations).</p>
