Under these circumstances, limitations on</p><p class="depth0">occupancy may have to be governed by external dose limits. \b\ Air purifying respirators with APF <100 must be equipped with</p><p class="depth0">particulate filters that are at least 95 percent efficient.

Appendix B to Part 20--Annual Limits on Intake (ALIs) and Derived</p><p class="depth0">Air Concentrations (DACs) of Radionuclides for Occupational Exposure;</p><p class="depth0">Effluent Concentrations; Concentrations for Release to Sewerage</p><p class="depth0">Introduction</p><p class="depth0">For each radionuclide table 1 indicates the chemical form which is  to be used for selecting the appropriate ALI or DAC value. The ALIs and  DACs for inhalation are given for an aerosol with an activity median  aerodynamic diameter (AMAD) of 1 [micro]m and for three classes (D,W,Y)  of radioactive material, which refer to their retention (approximately  days, weeks or years) in the pulmonary region of the lung. This  classification applies to a range of clearance half-   times of less than 10 days for D, for W from 10 to 100 days, and for Y  greater than 100 days. The class (D, W, or Y) given in the column headed  ``Class'' applies only to the inhalation ALIs and DACs given in table 1,  columns 2 and 3. Table 2 provides concentration limits for airborne and  liquid effluents released to the general environment. Table 3 provides  concentration limits for discharges to sanitary sewer systems.</p><p class="depth0">Notation</p><p class="depth0">The values in tables 1, 2, and 3 are presented in the computer ``E''  notation. In this notation a value of 6E-02 represents a value of  6x10-2 or 0.06, 6E+2 represents 6x10\2\ or 600, and 6E+0  represents 6x10\0\ or 6.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1 ``Occupational''</p><p class="depth0">Note that the columns in table 1, of this appendix captioned ``Oral  Ingestion ALI,'' ``Inhalation ALI,'' and ``DAC,'' are applicable to  occupational exposure to radioactive material.</p><p class="depth0">The ALIs in this appendix are the annual intakes of a given  radionuclide by ``Reference Man'' which would result in either (1) a  committed effective dose equivalent of 5 rems (stochastic ALI) or (2) a  committed dose equivalent of 50 rems to an organ or tissue (non- stochastic ALI). The stochastic ALIs were derived to result in a risk,  due to irradiation of organs and tissues, comparable to the risk  associated with deep dose equivalent to the whole body of 5 rems. The  derivation includes multiplying the committed dose equivalent to an  organ or tissue by a weighting factor, wT. This weighting  factor is the proportion of the risk of stochastic effects resulting  from irradiation of the organ or tissue, T, to the total risk of  stochastic effects when the whole body is irradiated uniformly. The  values of wT are listed under the definition of weighting  factor in Sec. 20.1003. The non-stochastic ALIs were derived to avoid  non-stochastic effects, such as prompt damage to tissue or reduction in  organ function.</p><p class="depth0">A value of wT=0.06 is applicable to each of the five  organs or tissues in the ``remainder'' category receiving the highest  dose equivalents, and the dose equivalents of all other remaining  tissues may be disregarded. The following parts of the GI tract-- stomach, small intestine, upper large intestine, and lower large  intestine--are to be treated as four separate organs.</p><p class="depth0">Note that the dose equivalents for extremities (hands and forearms,  feet and lower legs), skin, and lens of the eye are not considered in  computing the committed effective dose equivalent, but are subject to  limits that must be met separately.</p><p class="depth0">When an ALI is defined by the stochastic dose limit, this value  alone, is given. When an ALI is determined by the non-stochastic dose  limit to an organ, the organ or tissue to which the limit applies is  shown, and the ALI for the stochastic limit is shown in parentheses.  (Abbreviated organ or tissue designations are used: LLI wall = lower  large intestine wall; St. wall = stomach wall; Blad wall = bladder wall;  and Bone surf = bone surface.)</p><p class="depth0">The use of the ALIs listed first, the more limiting of the  stochastic and non-stochastic ALIs, will ensure that non-stochastic  effects are avoided and that the risk of stochastic effects is limited  to an acceptably low value. If, in a particular situation involving a  radionuclide for which the non-stochastic ALI is limiting, use of that  non-stochastic ALI is considered unduly conservative, the licensee may  use the stochastic ALI to determine the committed effective dose  equivalent. However, the licensee shall also ensure that the 50-rem dose  equivalent limit for any organ or tissue is not exceeded by the sum of  the external deep dose equivalent plus the internal committed dose to  that organ (not the effective dose). For the case where there is no  external dose contribution, this would be demonstrated if the sum of the  fractions of the nonstochastic ALIs (ALIns) that contribute  to the committed dose equivalent to the organ receiving the highest dose  does not exceed unity (i.e., [Sigma] (intake (in [micro]Ci) of each  radionuclide/ALIns) <1.0). If there is an external deep dose  equivalent contribution of Hd then this sum must be less than  l-(Hd/50) instead of being <1.0.</p><p class="depth0">The derived air concentration (DAC) values are derived limits  intended to control chronic occupational exposures. The relationship  between the DAC and the ALI is given by: DAC=ALI(in [micro]Ci)/(2000  hours per working yearx60 minutes/hourx2x10\4\ ml per minute) = [ALI/ 2.4x10\9\] [micro]Ci/ml, where 2x10\4\ ml is the volume of air breathed  per minute at work by ``Reference Man'' under working conditions of  ``light work.''</p><p class="depth0">The DAC values relate to one of two modes of exposure: either  external submersion or the internal committed dose equivalents resulting  from inhalation of radioactive materials. Derived air concentrations  based upon submersion are for immersion in a semi-infinite cloud of  uniform concentration and apply to each radionuclide separately.</p><p class="depth0">The ALI and DAC values relate to exposure to the single radionuclide  named, but also include contributions from the in-growth of any daughter  radionuclide produced in the body by the decay of the parent. However,  intakes that include both the parent and daughter radionuclides should  be treated by the general method appropriate for mixtures.</p><p class="depth0">The value of ALI and DAC do not apply directly when the individual  both ingests and inhales a radionuclide, when the individual is exposed  to a mixture of radionuclides by either inhalation or ingestion or both,  or   when the individual is exposed to both internal and external radiation  (see Sec. 20.1202). When an individual is exposed to radioactive  materials which fall under several of the translocation classifications  (i.e., Class D, Class W, or Class Y) of the same radionuclide, the  exposure may be evaluated as if it were a mixture of different  radionuclides.</p><p class="depth0">It should be noted that the classification of a compound as Class D,  W, or Y is based on the chemical form of the compound and does not take  into account the radiological half-life of different radioisotopes. For  this reason, values are given for Class D, W, and Y compounds, even for  very short-lived radionuclides.</p><p class="depth0">Table 2</p><p class="depth0">The columns in table 2 of this appendix captioned ``Effluents,''  ``Air,'' and ``Water,'' are applicable to the assessment and control of  dose to the public, particularly in the implementation of the provisions  of Sec. 20.1302. The concentration values given in columns 1 and 2 of  table 2 are equivalent to the radionuclide concentrations which, if  inhaled or ingested continuously over the course of a year, would  produce a total effective dose equivalent of 0.05 rem (50 millirem or  0.5 millisieverts).</p><p class="depth0">Consideration of non-stochastic limits has not been included in  deriving the air and water effluent concentration limits because non- stochastic effects are presumed not to occur at the dose levels  established for individual members of the public. For radionuclides,  where the non-stochastic limit was governing in deriving the  occupational DAC, the stochastic ALI was used in deriving the  corresponding airborne effluent limit in table 2. For this reason, the  DAC and airborne effluent limits are not always proportional as was the  case in appendix B to Sec. Sec. 20.1-20.601.</p><p class="depth0">The air concentration values listed in table 2, column 1, were  derived by one of two methods. For those radionuclides for which the  stochastic limit is governing, the occupational stochastic inhalation  ALI was divided by 2.4x10 \9\ ml, relating the inhalation ALI to the  DAC, as explained above, and then divided by a factor of 300. The factor  of 300 includes the following components: a factor of 50 to relate the  5-rem annual occupational dose limit to the 0.1-rem limit for members of  the public, a factor of 3 to adjust for the difference in exposure time  and the inhalation rate for a worker and that for members of the public;  and a factor of 2 to adjust the occupational values (derived for adults)  so that they are applicable to other age groups.</p><p class="depth0">For those radionuclides for which submersion (external dose) is  limiting, the occupational DAC in table 1, column 3, was divided by 219.  The factor of 219 is composed of a factor of 50, as described above, and  a factor of 4.38 relating occupational exposure for 2,000 hours per year  to full-time exposure (8,760 hours per year). Note that an additional  factor of 2 for age considerations is not warranted in the submersion  case.</p><p class="depth0">The water concentrations were derived by taking the most restrictive  occupational stochastic oral ingestion ALI and dividing by 7.3x10\7\.  The factor of 7.3x10\7\ (ml) includes the following components: the  factors of 50 and 2 described above and a factor of 7.3x10\5\ (ml) which  is the annual water intake of ``Reference Man.''</p><p class="depth0">Note 2 of this appendix provides groupings of radionuclides which  are applicable to unknown mixtures of radionuclides. These groupings  (including occupational inhalation ALIs and DACs, air and water effluent  concentrations and sewerage) require demonstrating that the most  limiting radionuclides in successive classes are absent. The limit for  the unknown mixture is defined when the presence of one of the listed  radionuclides cannot be definitely excluded either from knowledge of the  radionuclide composition of the source or from actual measurements.</p><p class="depth0">Table 3 ``Sewer Disposal''</p><p class="depth0">The monthly average concentrations for release to sanitary sewers  are applicable to the provisions in Sec. 20.2003. The concentration  values were derived by taking the most restrictive occupational  stochastic oral ingestion ALI and dividing by 7.3x10\6\ (ml). The factor  of 7.3x10\6\ (ml) is composed of a factor of 7.3x10\5\ (ml), the annual  water intake by ``Reference Man,'' and a factor of 10, such that the  concentrations, if the sewage released by the licensee were the only  source of water ingested by a reference man during a year, would result  in a committed effective dose equivalent of 0.5 rem.</p><p class="depth0">List of Elements ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Atomic</p><p class="depth0">Name                   -------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Symbol            No. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Actinium................................
