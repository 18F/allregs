The consortium must set forth its priorities  for allocating housing (including CDBG and ESG, where applicable)  resources geographically within the consortium, describing how the  consolidated plan will address the needs identified (in accordance with  Sec. 91.405), describing the reasons for the consortium's allocation  priorities, and identifying any obstacles there are to addressing  underserved needs.
