For a new or reconstructed affected source, you must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All emission capture systems, add-on control devices, and CPMS must be installed and operating no later than the applicable compliance date specified in Sec. 63.4483. Except for solvent recovery systems for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to Sec. 63.4561(j), you must conduct a performance test of each capture system and add-on control device according to Sec. Sec. 63.4564, 63.4565, and 63.4566 and establish the operating limits required by Sec. 63.4492 no later than 180 days after the applicable compliance date specified in Sec. 63.4483.

The initial compliance period begins on the applicable compliance date specified in Sec. 63.4483 and ends on the last day of the 12th month following the compliance date. If the compliance date occurs on any day other than the first day of a month, then the initial compliance period extends through the end of that month plus the next 12 months. You must determine the mass of organic HAP emissions and mass of coatings solids used each month and then calculate an organic HAP emission rate at the end of the initial compliance period. The initial compliance demonstration includes the results of emission capture system and add-on control device performance tests conducted according to Sec. Sec. 63.4564, 63.4565, and 63.4566; results of liquid-liquid material balances conducted according to Sec. 63.4561(j); calculations according to Sec. 63.4561 and supporting documentation showing that during the initial compliance period the organic HAP emission rate was equal to or less than the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.4490; the operating limits established during the performance tests and the results of the continuous parameter monitoring required by Sec. 63.4568; and documentation of whether you developed and implemented the work practice plan required by Sec. 63.4493.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You do not need to comply with the operating limits for the emission capture system and add-on control device required by Sec. 63.4492 until after you have completed the performance tests specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Instead, you must maintain a log detailing the operation and maintenance of the emission capture system, add-on control device, and continuous parameter monitors during the period between the compliance date and the performance test. You must begin complying with the operating limits for your affected source on the date you complete the performance tests specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
