                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Investigation and referral. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Offices responsible for the  award and administration of contracts are responsible for reporting to  the appropriate Senior Procurement Executive and the DOE Inspector  General information about possible fraud, waste, abuse, or other  wrongdoing which may constitute or contribute to a cause(s) for  debarment under this subpart. Circumstances that involve possible  criminal or fraudulent activities must   be reported to the Office of the Inspector General in accordance with 10  CFR part 1010, Conduct of Employees, Sec. 1010.103, Reporting  Wrongdoing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At a minimum, referrals for consideration of debarment action  should be in writing and should include the following information--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The recommendation and rationale for the referral;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A statement of facts;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Copies of documentary evidence and a list of all witnesses,  including addresses and telephone numbers, together with a statement  concerning their availability to appear at a fact-finding proceeding and  the subject matter of their testimony;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A list of parties including the contractor, principals, and  affiliates (including last known home and business addresses, zip codes  and DUNS Number or other identifying number for an individual);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> DOE's and NNSA's acquisition history with the contractor,  including recent experience under contracts and copies of pertinent  contracts;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> A list of any known active or potential criminal  investigations, criminal or civil proceedings, or administrative claims  before the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals or other fact-finding  body; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> A statement regarding the impact of the debarment action on  DOE and NNSA programs. This statement is not required for referrals by  the Inspector General.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Referrals may be returned to the originator for further  information or development.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Decisionmaking process. Contractors proposed for debarment shall  be afforded an opportunity to submit information and argument in  opposition to the proposed debarment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In actions based upon a conviction or civil judgment, or in  which there is no genuine dispute over material facts, the Debarring  Official shall make a decision on the basis of all the information in  the administrative record, including any submissions made by the  contractor. If the respondent fails to submit a timely written response  to a notice of proposed debarment, the Debarring Official shall notify  the respondent in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(e) that the contractor is  debarred.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In actions not based upon a conviction or civil judgment, the  contractor may request a fact-finding hearing to resolve a genuine  dispute of material fact. In its request, the contractor must identify  the material facts in dispute and the basis for disputing the facts. If  the Debarring Official determines that there is a genuine dispute of  material fact, the Debarring Official shall appoint, and refer the  matter to, a Fact-Finding Official for a fact-finding conference.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Meeting. Upon receipt of a timely request from a contractor  proposed for debarment, the Debarring Official shall schedule a meeting  between the Debarring Official and the respondent, to be held no later  than 30 days from the date the request is received. The Debarring  Official may postpone the date of the meeting if the respondent requests  a postponement in writing. At the meeting, the respondent, appearing  personally or through an attorney or other authorized representative,  may present and explain evidence that causes for debarment do not exist,  evidence of any mitigating factors, and arguments concerning the  imposition, scope, or duration of a proposed debarment or debarment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Fact-finding conference. The purpose of a fact-finding  conference under this section is to provide the respondent an  opportunity to dispute material facts through the submission of oral and  written evidence; resolve facts in dispute; and provide the Debarring  Official with findings of fact based, as applicable, on adequate  evidence or on a preponderance of the evidence. The fact-finding  conference shall be conducted in accordance with rules consistent with  48 CFR 9.406-3(b). The Fact-Finding Official will notify the affected  parties of the schedule for the hearing. The Fact-Finding Official shall  deliver written findings of fact to the Debarring Official (together  with a transcription of the proceeding, if made) within a certain time  period after the hearing record closes as specified by the Fact-Finding  Official. The findings shall resolve any disputes over   material facts based upon a preponderance of the evidence, if the case  involves a proposal to debar, or on adequate evidence, if the case  involves a suspension. Since convictions or civil judgments generally  establish the cause for debarment by a preponderance of the evidence,  there usually is no genuine dispute over a material fact that would  warrant a fact-finding conference for those proposed debarments based on  convictions or civil judgments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Debarring Official's decision. (4) The Debarring Official's  final decision shall be based on the administrative record. In those  actions where additional proceedings are necessary as to disputed  material facts, written findings of fact shall be prepared and included  in the final decision. In those cases where the contractor has requested  and received a fact-finding conference, the written findings of fact  shall be those findings prepared by the Fact-Finding Official. Findings  of fact shall be final and conclusive unless, within 15 days of receipt  of the findings, the Department or the respondent requests  reconsideration, or unless set aside by a court of competent  jurisdiction. The Fact-Finding Official shall be provided a copy of the  Debarring Official's final decision.  [61 FR 39857, July 31, 1996, as amended at 76 FR 7691, Feb. 11, 2011]</p>
