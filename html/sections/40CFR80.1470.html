not be under the sole operational control of the third-party auditor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An originally signed duplicate of the agreement or contract establishing the RIN replacement mechanism must be submitted to the EPA by the independent third party auditor in accordance with Sec. 80.1450(g)(7).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any substantive change to the agreement establishing the RIN replacement mechanism must be submitted to the EPA within 30 days of the change.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cap on RIN replacement for independent third party auditors of A-RINs. (1) If required to replace invalid A-RINs pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the independent third party auditor shall be required to replace no more than the percentage specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section of each D code of A-RINs verified by the auditor in the current calendar year and four previous calendar years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If required to replace invalid A-RINs pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the independent third party auditor shall be required to replace no more than the percentage specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section of each D code of A-RINs verified by the auditor in the current calendar year and four previous calendar years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The cap on RIN replacement for auditors of A-RINs shall be two percent for A-RINs generated in the interim period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The auditor's potential replacement responsibility for a given RIN will expire at the end of the fourth calendar year after the calendar year in which the RIN was verified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Applicability of the RIN replacement cap.
