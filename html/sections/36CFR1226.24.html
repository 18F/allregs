                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Sale or salvage of unrestricted records--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Paper records.  Paper records to be destroyed normally must be sold as wastepaper, or  otherwise salvaged. All sales must follow the established procedures for  the sale of surplus personal property. (See 41 CFR part 101--45, Sale,  Abandonment, or Destruction of Personal Property.) The contract for sale  must prohibit the resale of all records for use as records or documents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Records on electronic and other media. Records other than paper  records (audio, visual, and electronic records on physical media data  tapes, disks, and diskettes) may be salvaged and sold in the same manner  and under the same conditions as paper records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Destruction of unrestricted records. Unrestricted records that  agencies cannot sell or otherwise salvage must be destroyed by burning,  pulping, shredding, macerating, or other suitable means authorized by  implementing regulations issued under E.O. 12958, as amended or its  successor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Destruction of classified or otherwise restricted records. If  the records are restricted because they are national security classified  or exempted from disclosure by statute, including the Privacy Act, or  regulation:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Paper records. For paper records, the agency or its wastepaper  contractor must definitively destroy the information contained in the  records by one of the means specified in paragraph (b) of this section  and their destruction must be witnessed either by a Federal employee or,  if authorized by the agency, by a contractor employee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Electronic records. Electronic records scheduled for destruction  must be disposed of in a manner that ensures protection of any  sensitive, proprietary, or national security information. Magnetic  recording media previously used for electronic records containing  sensitive, proprietary, or national security information must not be  reused if the previously recorded information can be compromised in any  way by reuse of the media.</p>
