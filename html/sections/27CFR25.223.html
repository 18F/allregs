                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Destruction without supervision. A brewer may destroy beer  without supervision if the appropriate TTB officer does not advise the  brewer before the date specified in the notice that destruction of the  beer is to be supervised.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Destruction with supervision. The appropriate TTB officer may  require that an appropriate TTB officer verify the information in the  notice of destruction or witness the destruction of the beer. The  appropriate TTB officer may also require a delay in the destruction of  the beer or, if the place of destruction is not readily accessible to an  appropriate TTB officer, may require that the beer be moved to a more  convenient location. In this case, the brewer may not destroy the beer  except under the conditions imposed by the appropriate TTB officer.  (Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1335, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5056))  [T.D.
