                            <p class="depth0">All terms used in this part shall have the meaning given them in the Act and in this section. If a term is defined both in this section and in other parts that reference the use of this part, the term shall have the meaning given in this section for purposes of this part. If a term is not defined in the Act or in this section, the term shall have the meaning given in the referencing subpart for purposes of this part. The terms follow:</p><p class="depth0">Act means the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.).</p><p class="depth0">Administrator means the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or his or her authorized representative (for

example, a State that has been delegated the authority to implement the provisions of this part).</p><p class="depth0">Approved permit program means a State permit program approved by the Administrator as meeting the requirements of part 70 of this chapter or a Federal permit program established in this chapter pursuant to title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661).</p><p class="depth0">Automated continuous parameter monitoring system means a continuous parameter monitoring system that automatically both records the measured data and calculates hourly averages.</p><p class="depth0">Automated monitoring and recording system means any means of measuring values of monitored parameters and creating a hard copy or computer record of the measured values that does not require manual reading of monitoring instruments and manual transcription of data values. Automated monitoring and recording systems include, but are not limited to, computerized systems, strip charts, and circular charts.</p><p class="depth0">Batch process means a process in which the equipment is fed intermittently or discontinuously. Processing then occurs in this equipment after which the equipment is generally emptied. Examples of industries that use batch processes include pharmaceutical production and pesticide production.</p><p class="depth0">Batch product-process equipment train means the collection of equipment (for example, connectors, reactors, valves, pumps) configured to produce a specific product or intermediate by a batch process.</p><p class="depth0">Boiler means any enclosed combustion device that extracts useful energy in the form of steam and is not an incinerator or a process heater. Boiler also means any industrial furnace as defined in 40 CFR 260.10.</p><p class="depth0">Bottoms receiver means a tank that collects distillation bottoms before the stream is sent for storage or for further downstream processing.</p><p class="depth0">By compound means by individual stream components, not carbon equivalents.</p><p class="depth0">Car-seal means a seal that is placed on a device that is used to change the position of a valve (for example, from opened to closed) in such a way that the position of the valve cannot be changed without breaking the seal.</p><p class="depth0">Closed vent system means a system that is not open to the atmosphere and is composed of piping, ductwork, connections, and, if necessary, flow inducing devices that transport gas or vapor from an emission point to a control device. A closed vent system does not include the vapor collection system that is part of any tank truck or railcar or the loading arm or hose that is used for vapor return. For transfer racks, the closed vent system begins at, and includes, the first block valve on the downstream side of the loading arm or hose used to convey displaced vapors.</p><p class="depth0">Closed vent system shutdown means a work practice or operational procedure that stops production from a process unit or part of a process unit during which it is technically feasible to clear process material from a closed vent system or part of a closed vent system consistent with safety constraints and during which repairs can be effected. An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure that stops production from a process unit or part of a process unit for less than 24 hours is not a closed vent system shutdown. An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure that would stop production from a process unit or part of a process unit for a shorter period of time than would be required to clear the closed vent system or part of the closed vent system of materials and start up the unit, and would result in greater emissions than delay of repair of leaking components until the next scheduled closed vent system shutdown, is not a closed vent system shutdown. The use of spare equipment and technically feasible bypassing of equipment without stopping production are not closed vent system shutdowns.</p><p class="depth0">Closed-loop system means an enclosed system that returns process fluid to a process.</p><p class="depth0">Closed-purge system means a system or combination of systems and portable containers to capture purged liquids. Containers must be covered or closed when not being filled or emptied.</p><p class="depth0">Combustion device means an individual unit of equipment, such as a flare, incinerator, process heater, or

boiler, used for the combustion of organic emissions.</p><p class="depth0">Compliance date means the date by which a regulated source is required to be in compliance with a relevant standard, limitation, prohibition, or any federally enforceable requirement established by the Administrator (or a State with an approved permit program) pursuant to the Act.</p><p class="depth0">Connector means flanged, screwed, or other joined fittings used to connect two pipelines or a pipeline and a piece of equipment.

A continuous seal may be a vapor-mounted, liquid-mounted, or metallic shoe seal. A continuous seal may be constructed of fastened segments so as to form a continuous seal.</p><p class="depth0">Control device means any combustion device, recovery device, or any combination of these devices used to comply with this part. Such equipment or devices include, but are not limited to, absorbers, carbon adsorbers, condensers, incinerators, flares, boilers, and process heaters. For process vents (as defined in this section), recovery devices are not considered control devices except for the recovery devices specified in Sec. 65.63(a)(2)(ii). A fuel gas system is not a control device. For a steam stripper, a primary condenser is not considered a control device.</p><p class="depth0">Control system means the combination of the closed vent system and the control devices used to collect and control vapors or gases from a regulated source.</p><p class="depth0">Day means a calendar day.</p><p class="depth0">Distance piece means an open or enclosed casing through which the piston rod travels, separating the compressor cylinder from the crankcase.</p><p class="depth0">Double block and bleed system means two block valves connected in series with a bleed valve or line that can vent the line between the two block valves.</p><p class="depth0">Ductwork means a conveyance system such as those commonly used for heating and ventilation systems. It is often made of sheet metal and often has sections connected by screws or crimping. Hard-piping is not ductwork.</p><p class="depth0">Emission point means an individual process vent, storage vessel, transfer rack, wastewater stream, or equipment leak.</p><p class="depth0">Empty or emptying means the removal of the stored liquid from a storage vessel. Storage vessels where stored liquid is left on the walls, as bottom clingage, or in pools due to bottom irregularities are considered empty. Lowering of the stored liquid level, so that the floating roof is resting on its legs, as necessitated by normal vessel operation (for example, when changing stored material or when transferring material out of the vessel for shipment) is not considered emptying.</p><p class="depth0">Equipment means each of the following that is subject to control under the referencing subpart: pump, compressor, agitator, pressure relief device, sampling connection system, open-ended valve or line, valve, connector, and instrumentation system; and any control devices or systems used to comply with subpart F of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Equivalent method means any method of sampling and analyzing for an air pollutant that has been demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction to have a consistent and quantitatively known relationship to the reference method under specified conditions.</p><p class="depth0">External floating roof or EFR means a pontoon-type (noncontact) or double-
