[Comment: Procedures for demonstrating compliance with this standard in  part B of the permit application are specified in Sec. 270.14(b)(11).  Facilities which are located in political jurisdictions other than those  listed in appendix VI of this part, are assumed to be in compliance with  this requirement.]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Floodplains. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A facility located in a 100-year floodplain  must be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained to prevent  washout or any   hazardous waste by a 100-year flood, unless the owner or operator can  demonstrate to the Regional Administrator's satisfaction that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Procedures are in effect which will cause the waste to be  removed safely, before flood waters can reach the facility, to a  location where the wastes will not be vulnerable to flood waters; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For existing surface impoundments, waste piles, land treatment  units, landfills, and miscellaneous units, no adverse effects on human  health or the environment will result if washout occurs, considering:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The volume and physical and chemical characteristics of the  waste in the facility;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The concentration of hazardous constituents that would  potentially affect surface waters as a result of washout;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The impact of such concentrations on the current or potential  uses of and water quality standards established for the affected surface  waters; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The impact of hazardous constituents on the sediments of  affected surface waters or the soils of the 100- year floodplain that  could result from washout.  [Comment: The location where wastes are moved must be a facility which  is either permitted by EPA under part 270 of this chapter, authorized to  manage hazardous waste by a State with a hazardous waste management  program authorized under part 271 of this chapter, or in interim status  under parts 270 and 265 of this chapter.]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As used in paragraph (b)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> ``100-year floodplain'' means any land area which is subject to  a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year from any  source.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> ``Washout'' means the movement of hazardous waste from the  active portion of the facility as a result of flooding.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> ``100-year flood'' means a flood that has a one percent chance  of being equalled or exceeded in any given year.

For details relative to these laws, see EPA's manual for  SEA (special environmental area) requirements for hazardous waste  facility permits. Though EPA is responsible for complying with these  requirements, applicants are advised to consider them in planning the  location of a facility to help prevent subsequent project delays.]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Salt dome formations, salt bed formations, underground mines and  caves.
