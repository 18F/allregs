                            <p class="depth0">As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein shall have the meaning given them in the CAA and in subpart A of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Certified emissions life means the period during which the engine is designed to properly function in terms of reliability and fuel consumption, without being remanufactured, specified as a number of hours of operation or calendar years, whichever comes first. The values for certified emissions life for stationary CI ICE with a displacement of less than 10 liters per cylinder are given in 40 CFR 1039.101(g). The values for certified emissions life for stationary CI ICE with a displacement of greater than or equal to 10 liters per cylinder and less than 30 liters per cylinder are given in 40 CFR 94.9(a).</p><p class="depth0">Combustion turbine means all equipment, including but not limited to the turbine, the fuel, air, lubrication and exhaust gas systems, control systems (except emissions control equipment), and any ancillary components and sub-components comprising any simple cycle combustion turbine, any regenerative/recuperative cycle combustion turbine, the combustion turbine portion of any cogeneration cycle combustion system, or the combustion turbine portion of any combined cycle steam/electric generating system.</p><p class="depth0">Compression ignition means relating to a type of stationary internal combustion engine that is not a spark ignition engine.</p><p class="depth0">Date of manufacture means one of the following things:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For freshly manufactured engines and modified engines, date of manufacture means the date the engine is originally produced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For reconstructed engines, date of manufacture means the date the engine was originally produced, except as specified in paragraph (3) of this definition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reconstructed engines are assigned a new date of manufacture if the fixed capital cost of the new and refurbished components exceeds 75 percent of the fixed capital cost of a comparable entirely new facility. An engine that is produced from a previously used engine block does not retain the date of manufacture of the engine in which the engine block was previously used if the engine is produced using all new components except for the engine

block. In these cases, the date of manufacture is the date of reconstruction or the date the new engine is produced.</p><p class="depth0">Diesel fuel means any liquid obtained from the distillation of petroleum with a boiling point of approximately 150 to 360 degrees Celsius. One commonly used form is number 2 distillate oil.</p><p class="depth0">Diesel particulate filter means an emission control technology that reduces PM emissions by trapping the particles in a flow filter substrate and periodically removes the collected particles by either physical action or by oxidizing (burning off) the particles in a process called regeneration.</p><p class="depth0">Emergency stationary internal combustion engine means any stationary reciprocating internal combustion engine that meets all of the criteria in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this definition. All emergency stationary ICE must comply with the requirements specified in Sec. 60.4211(f) in order to be considered emergency stationary ICE. If the engine does not comply with the requirements specified in Sec. 60.4211(f), then it is not considered to be an emergency stationary ICE under this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The stationary ICE is operated to provide electrical power or mechanical work during an emergency situation. Examples include stationary ICE used to produce power for critical networks or equipment (including power supplied to portions of a facility) when electric power from the local utility (or the normal power source, if the facility runs on its own power production) is interrupted, or stationary ICE used to pump water in the case of fire or flood, etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The stationary ICE is operated under limited circumstances for situations not included in paragraph (1) of this definition, as specified in Sec. 60.4211(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The stationary ICE operates as part of a financial arrangement with another entity in situations not included in paragraph (1) of this definition only as allowed in Sec. 60.4211(f)(2)(ii) or (iii) and Sec. 60.4211(f)(3)(i).</p><p class="depth0">Engine manufacturer means the manufacturer of the engine. See the definition of ``manufacturer'' in this section.</p><p class="depth0">Fire pump engine means an emergency stationary internal combustion engine certified to NFPA requirements that is used to provide power to pump water for fire suppression or protection.</p><p class="depth0">Freshly manufactured engine means an engine that has not been placed into service. An engine becomes freshly manufactured when it is originally produced.</p><p class="depth0">Installed means the engine is placed and secured at the location where it is intended to be operated.</p><p class="depth0">Manufacturer has the meaning given in section 216(1) of the Act. In general, this term includes any person who manufactures a stationary engine for sale in the United States or otherwise introduces a new stationary engine into commerce in the United States. This includes importers who import stationary engines for sale or resale.</p><p class="depth0">Maximum engine power means maximum engine power as defined in 40 CFR 1039.801.</p><p class="depth0">Model year means the calendar year in which an engine is manufactured (see ``date of manufacture''), except as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Model year means the annual new model production period of the engine manufacturer in which an engine is manufactured (see ``date of manufacture''), if the annual new model production period is different than the calendar year and includes January 1 of the calendar year for which the model year is named. It may not begin before January 2 of the previous calendar year and it must end by December 31 of the named calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For an engine that is converted to a stationary engine after being placed into service as a nonroad or other non-stationary engine, model year means the calendar year or new model production period in which the engine was manufactured (see ``date of manufacture'').</p><p class="depth0">Other internal combustion engine means any internal combustion engine, except combustion turbines, which is not a reciprocating internal combustion engine or rotary internal combustion engine.</p><p class="depth0">Reciprocating internal combustion engine means any internal combustion engine which uses reciprocating motion to convert heat energy into mechanical work.</p><p class="depth0">Rotary internal combustion engine means any internal combustion engine

which uses rotary motion to convert heat energy into mechanical work.</p><p class="depth0">Spark ignition means relating to a gasoline, natural gas, or liquefied petroleum gas fueled engine or any other type of engine with a spark plug (or other sparking device) and with operating characteristics significantly similar to the theoretical Otto combustion cycle. Spark ignition engines usually use a throttle to regulate intake air flow to control power during normal operation. Dual-fuel engines in which a liquid fuel (typically diesel fuel) is used for CI and gaseous fuel (typically natural gas) is used as the primary fuel at an annual average ratio of less than 2 parts diesel fuel to 100 parts total fuel on an energy equivalent basis are spark ignition engines.</p><p class="depth0">Stationary internal combustion engine means any internal combustion engine, except combustion turbines, that converts heat energy into mechanical work and is not mobile. Stationary ICE differ from mobile ICE in that a stationary internal combustion engine is not a nonroad engine as defined at 40 CFR 1068.30 (excluding paragraph (2)(ii) of that definition), and is not used to propel a motor vehicle, aircraft, or a vehicle used solely for competition. Stationary ICE include reciprocating ICE, rotary ICE, and other ICE, except combustion turbines.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart means 40 CFR part 60, subpart IIII.
