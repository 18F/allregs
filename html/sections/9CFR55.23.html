                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Approval of State programs and responsibilities of States. In  reviewing a State program's eligibility to be designated an Approved  State CWD Herd Certification Program, the Administrator will evaluate a  written statement from the State that describes the State's CWD control  and deer, elk, and moose herd certification activities and that cites  relevant State statutes, regulations, and directives pertaining to  animal health activities and reports and publications of the State. In  determining whether the State program qualifies, the Administrator will  determine whether the State:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Has the authority, based on State law or regulation, to restrict  the intrastate movement of all CWD-positive, CWD-suspect, and CWD- exposed animals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Has the authority, based on State law or regulation, to require  the prompt reporting of any animal suspected of having CWD and test  results for any animals tested for CWD to State or Federal animal health  authorities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Has, in cooperation with APHIS personnel, drafted and signed a  memorandum of understanding with APHIS that delineates the respective  roles of the State and APHIS in CWD Herd Certification Program  implementation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Has placed all known CWD-positive, CWD-exposed, and CWD-suspect  animals and herds under movement restrictions, with movement of animals  from them only for destruction or under permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Has effectively implemented policies to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Promptly investigate all animals reported as CWD-suspect  animals;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Designate herds as CWD-positive, CWD-exposed, or CWD-suspect  and promptly restrict movement of animals from the herd after an APHIS  employee or State representative determines that the herd contains or  has contained a CWD-positive animal;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Remove herd movement restrictions only after completion of a  herd plan agreed upon by the State representative, APHIS, and the owner;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Conduct an epidemiologic investigation of CWD-positive, CWD- exposed, and CWD-suspect herds that includes the designation of suspect  and exposed animals and that identifies animals to be traced;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Conduct tracebacks of CWD-positive animals and traceouts of CWD- exposed animals and report any out-of-State traces to the appropriate  State promptly after receipt of notification of a CWD-positive animal;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Conduct tracebacks based on slaughter or other sampling  promptly after receipt of notification of a CWD-positive animal at  slaughter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Effectively monitors and enforces State quarantines and State  reporting laws and regulations for CWD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Has designated at least one State animal health official, or has  worked with APHIS to designate an APHIS official, to coordinate CWD Herd  Certification Program activities in the State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Has programs to educate those engaged in the interstate movement  of deer, elk, and moose regarding the identification and recordkeeping  requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Requires, based on State law or regulation, and effectively  enforces identification of all animals in herds   participating in the CWD Herd Certification Program;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Maintains in the CWD National Database administered by APHIS,  or in a State database approved by the Administrator as compatible with  the CWD National Database, the State's:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Premises information and assigned premises numbers;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Individual animal information on all deer, elk, and moose in  herds participating in the CWD Herd Certification Program in the State;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Individual animal information on all out-of-State deer, elk,  and moose to be traced; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Accurate herd status data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Requires that tissues from all CWD-exposed or CWD-suspect  animals that die or are depopulated or otherwise killed be submitted to  a laboratory authorized by the Administrator to conduct official CWD  tests and requires appropriate disposal of the carcasses of CWD- positive, CWD-exposed, and CWD-suspect animals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Responsibilities of enrolled herd owners. Herd owners who enroll  in the CWD Herd Certification Program agree to maintain their herds in  accordance with the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each animal in the herd must be identified using means of animal  identification specified in Sec. 55.25. All animals in an enrolled herd  must be identified before reaching 12 months of age. In addition, all  animals of any age in an enrolled herd must be identified before being  moved from the herd premises. In addition, all animals in an enrolled  herd must be identified before the inventory required under paragraph  (b)(4) of this section, and animals found to be in violation of this  requirement during the inventory must be identified during or after the  inventory on a schedule specified by the APHIS employee or State  representative conducting the inventory;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The herd premises must have perimeter fencing adequate to  prevent ingress or egress of cervids. This fencing must also comply with  any applicable State regulations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The owner must immediately report to an APHIS employee or State  representative all animals that escape or disappear, and all deaths  (including animals killed on premises maintained for hunting and animals  sent to slaughter) of deer, elk, and moose in the herd aged 12 months or  older; Except that, APHIS employees or State representatives may approve  reporting schedules other than immediate notification when herd  conditions warrant it in the opinion of both APHIS and the State. The  report must include the identification numbers of the animals involved  and the estimated time and date of the death, escape, or disappearance.  For animals that die (including animals killed on premises maintained  for hunting and animals sent to slaughter), the owner must inform an  APHIS or State representative and must make the carcasses of the animals  available for tissue sampling and testing in accordance with  instructions from the APHIS or State representative. In cases where  animals escape or disappear and thus are not available for tissue  sampling and testing, or when the owner provides samples that are of  such poor quality that they cannot be tested for CWD, an APHIS  representative will investigate whether the unavailability of animals or  usable samples for testing constitutes a failure to comply with program  requirements and will affect the herd's status in the CWD Herd  Certification Program;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The owner must maintain herd records that include a complete  inventory of animals that states the species, age, and sex of each  animal, the date of acquisition and source of each animal that was not  born into the herd, the date of disposal and destination of any animal  removed from the herd, and all individual identification numbers (from  tags, tattoos, electronic implants, etc.) associated with each animal.  Upon request by an APHIS employee or State representative, the owner  must allow either of these officials or a designated accredited  veterinarian access to the premises and herd to conduct an inventory.  The owner will be responsible for assembling, handling, and restraining  the animals and for all costs incurred to present the animals for  inspection. The APHIS employee or State representative may order either  an inventory that consists of review of herd records with visual  examination of an enclosed group of animals, or a complete physical herd   inventory with verification to reconcile all animals and identifications  with the records maintained by the owner. In the latter case, the owner  must present the entire herd for inspection under conditions where the  APHIS employee, State representative, or accredited veterinarian can  safely read all identification on the animals. During inventories, the  owner must cooperate with the inspector to resolve any discrepancies to  the satisfaction of the person performing the inventory. Inventory of a  herd will be conducted no more frequently than once per year, unless an  APHIS employee, State representative, or accredited veterinarian  determines that more frequent inventories are needed based on  indications that the herd may not be in compliance with CWD Herd  Certification Program requirements. A complete physical herd inventory  must be performed on a herd in accordance with this paragraph at the  time a herd is enrolled in the CWD Herd Certification Program; Except  that, APHIS may accept a complete physical herd inventory performed by  an APHIS employee, State representative, or accredited veterinarian not  more than 1 year before the herd's date of enrollment in the CWD Herd  Certification Program as fulfilling the requirement for an initial  inventory. In addition, a complete physical herd inventory must be  performed for all herds enrolled in the CWD Herd Certification Program  no more than 3 years after the last complete physical herd inventory for  the herd;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If an owner wishes to maintain separate herds, he or she must  maintain separate herd inventories, records, working facilities, water  sources, equipment, and land use. There must be a buffer zone of at  least 30 feet between the perimeter fencing around separate herds, and  no commingling of animals may occur. Movement of animals between herds  must be recorded as if they were separately owned herds;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> New animals may be introduced into the herd only from other  herds enrolled in the CWD Herd Certification Program. If animals are  received from an enrolled herd with a lower program status, the  receiving herd will revert to that lower program status. If animals are  obtained from a herd not participating in the program, then the  receiving herd will be required to start over in the program.
