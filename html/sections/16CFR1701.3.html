                            <p class="depth0">The special packaging requirements of the PPPA apply to ``household substances'' for which the Commission has determined there is a need for special packaging, as provided in section 3 of the act (15 U.S.C. 1472). At section 2(2) of the act (15 U.S.C. 1471) (restated at 16

CFR 1700.1(b)(2)), the term household substance is defined as ``any substance which is customarily produced or distributed for sale for consumption or use, or customarily stored, by individuals in or about the household * * *.'' The Commission has issued requirements for special packaging for certain hazardous substances at 16 CFR 1700.14(a). Unless otherwise indicated in the requirements for specific hazardous substances, the Commission interprets the term ``household substance'' as only applying to these hazardous substances when packaged in containers with a capacity of less than 5 gallons. As a result, unless otherwise specified, the hazardous substances at 16 CFR 1700.14(a) are not required to be in special packaging when packaged in containers of 5 gallons or more.
