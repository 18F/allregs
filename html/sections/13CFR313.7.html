EDA may provide assistance in the form of a grant under  this section to an Impacted Community to help the Community carry out a  project or program that is included in a Strategic Plan developed in  accordance with Sec. 313.6. Such assistance may include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Infrastructure improvements, such as site acquisition, site  preparation, construction, rehabilitation and equipping of facilities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Market or industry research and analysis;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Technical assistance, including organizational development such  as business networking, restructuring or improving the delivery of  business services, or feasibility studies;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Public services;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Training; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Other activities justified by the Strategic Plan that satisfy  applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application evaluation criteria. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An Impacted Community that  seeks to receive an implementation grant under this section shall submit  a completed `Application for Federal Assistance' (Form ED-900 or any  successor form) to the applicable regional office (or regional offices  in the event the Community crosses multiple geographic boundaries)  serving the geographic   area in which the Community is located. A complete application also  shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The EDA-approved Strategic Plan that meets the requirements of  Sec. 313.6; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A description of the project or program included in the  Strategic Plan with respect to which the Impacted Community seeks  assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> EDA will evaluate all applications for the feasibility of the  budget presented and conformance with statutory and regulatory  requirements. EDA also will consider the degree to which an  implementation grant in the Impacted Community will satisfy the  evaluation criteria set forth in the applicable FFO announcement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Coordination among grant programs. If an entity in an Impacted  Community seeks or plans to seek a Community College and Career Training  Grant under section 278 of the Trade Act or a Sector Partnership Grant  under section 279A of the Trade Act while the Impacted Community seeks  assistance under this section, the Impacted Community shall include in  the application for assistance a description of how the Impacted  Community will integrate any projects or programs carried out using  assistance provided under this section with any projects or programs  that may be implemented with other Federal assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Cost sharing requirement. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an Impacted Community is  awarded an implementation grant under this section, the following  requirements shall apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Federal share. The Federal share of a project or program for  which a grant is awarded may not exceed 95 percent of the cost of  implementing the project or program; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Community's share. The Impacted Community must contribute at  least five percent of the amount of the implementation grant towards the  cost of implementing the project or program for which the grant is  awarded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In order to provide funding to as many merit-worthy Impacted  Communities as feasible, EDA may base the amount of the Community's  required share on the relative distress caused by the actual or  threatened decline in the most recent Civilian Labor Force statistics  effective on the date EDA receives an application for an implementation  grant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Limitation. An Impacted Community may not be awarded more than  $5,000,000 in implementation grant assistance under this section.</p>
