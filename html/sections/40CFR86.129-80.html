where:
Hp = the dynamometer power absorber setting at 50 mph (horsepower).A = the vehicle reference frontal area (ft\2\).

A protuberance is defined as any fixture attached to the vehicle protruding more than 1 inch from the vehicle surface and having a projected area greater than 0.01 ft\2\ with the area calculated by a method approved in advance by the Administrator. Included in the total protuberance frontal area shall be all fixtures which occur as standard equipment. The area of any optional equipment shall also be included if it is expected that more than 33 percent of the car line sold will be equipped with this option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The dynamometer power absorber setting for light-duty vehicles shall be rounded to the nearest 0.1 horsepower.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For light-duty vehicles to be tested on a single, large roll dynamometer.
