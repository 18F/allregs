                                Sec. 1.6016-4  Short taxable year.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirement of declaration. No declaration may be made for a  period of more than 12 months. For purposes of this section a taxable  year of 52 or 53 weeks, in the case of a corporation which computes its  taxable income in accordance with the election permitted by section  441(f), shall be deemed a period of 12 months. For special rules  affecting the time for filing declarations and paying estimated tax by  such corporation, see paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.441-2. A separate  declaration is required where a corporation is required to submit an  income tax return for a period of less than 12 months, but only if such  short period ends on or after December 31, 1955. However, no declaration  is required if the short taxable year:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Begins on or before December 31, 1963, and is:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A period of less than 9 months, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A period of 9 or more months but less than 12 months and the  requirements of section 6016(a) are not met before the 1st day of the  last month in the short taxable year, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Begins after December 31, 1963, and is:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A period of less than 4 months, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A period of 4 or more months but less than 12 months and the  requirements of section 6016(a) are not met before the 1st day of the  last month in the short taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em>. If a tax computed on such  annualized income exceeds the sum of $100,000 and any credits under part  IV, of subchapter A, chapter 1 of the Code, the estimated tax shall be  the same part of the excess so computed as the number of months in the  short period is of 12 months. Thus, for example, a corporation which  changes from a calendar year basis to a fiscal year basis beginning  October 1, 1956, will have a short taxable year beginning January 1,  1956, and ending September 30, 1956. If on or before August 31, 1956,  the taxpayer anticipates that it will have income of $264,000 for the 9- month taxable year the estimated tax is computed as follows:  (1) Anticipated taxable income for 9 months.................    $264,000 (2) Annualized income ($264,000x12/9).......................     352,000 (3) Tax liability on item (2)...............................     177,540 (4) Item (3) reduced by $100,000 (there are no credits under      77,540</p><p class="depth2">part IV, subchapter A, chapter 1 of the Code).............. (5) Estimated tax for 9-month period ($77,540x9/12).........      58,155</p><p class="depth2">Since the tax liability on the annualized income is in excess of  $100,000, a declaration is required to be filed, reporting an estimated  tax of $58,155 for the 9-month taxable period. This paragraph has no  application where the short taxable year does not result from a change  in the taxpayer's annual accounting period.
