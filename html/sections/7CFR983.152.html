Reworking shall consist of mechanical, electronic, or manual procedures normally used in the handling of pistachios.

If, after the lot has been reworked and tested, it fails the aflatoxin test for a second time, the lot may be shelled and the kernels reworked, sampled, and tested in the manner specified for an original lot of kernels, or the failed lot may be used for non-human consumption or otherwise disposed of.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Kernel rework procedure for aflatoxin.
