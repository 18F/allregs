                            <p class="depth0">The table in paragraph (f) of this section provides a reference to the paragraphs in this section that contain observer coverage requirements for vessels, shoreside processors, and stationary floating processors participating in certain fishery programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Observer requirements for vessels--(1) Groundfish and halibut fishery partial observer coverage category--(i) Vessel classes in partial coverage category. Unless otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the following catcher vessels are in the partial observer coverage category when fishing for halibut with hook-and-line gear or when directed fishing for groundfish in a federally managed or parallel groundfish fishery, as defined at Sec. 679.2:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Groundfish and halibut fishery partial observer coverage category--(i) Vessel classes in partial coverage category.

Unless otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the following catcher vessels are in the partial observer coverage category when fishing for halibut with hook-and-line gear or when directed fishing for groundfish in a federally managed or parallel groundfish fishery, as defined at Sec. 679.2:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A catcher vessel designated on an FFP under Sec. 679.4(b)(1); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A catcher vessel when fishing for halibut with hook-and-line gear and while carrying a person named on a permit issued under Sec. 679.4(d)(1)(i), Sec. 679.4(d)(2)(i), or Sec. 679.4(e)(2), or for sablefish IFQ with hook-and-line or pot gear and while carrying a person named on a permit issued under Sec. 679.4(d)(1)(i) or Sec. 679.4(d)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Registration and notification of observer deployment. The Observer Declare and Deploy System (ODDS) is the communication platform for the partial observer coverage category by which NMFS receives information about fishing plans subject to randomized observer deployment. Vessel operators provide fishing plan and contact information to NMFS and receive instructions through ODDS for coordinating with an observer provider for any required observer coverage. Access to ODDS is available through the NMFS Alaska Region Web site at http://alaskafisheries.noaa.gov.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Registration. NMFS will enter information into ODDS about all partial coverage category vessels that are designated on an FFP and all catcher vessels that are not designated on an FFP but that landed sablefish IFQ or halibut IFQ or CDQ in the previous or current year. Owners or operators are not responsible for initial registration of their vessel in ODDS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Notification. Upon entry into ODDS, NMFS will notify the owner or operator as to whether his or her vessel is entered in either a ``vessel'' or ``trip'' selection pool. Owners and operators must comply with all further instructions set forth by ODDS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Trip selection pool. (1) A minimum of 72 hours prior to embarking on each fishing trip, the operator of a vessel in the trip selection pool must register the anticipated trip with ODDS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When a fishing trip is registered with ODDS per paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(C)(1) of this section, the vessel operator will be notified by ODDS whether the trip is selected for observer coverage and a receipt number corresponding to this notification will be provided by ODDS. Trip registration is complete when the vessel operator receives a receipt number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An operator may embark on a fishing trip registered with ODDS:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Not selected trip. At any time if ODDS indicates that the fishing trip is not selected for observer coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Selected trip. When an observer is aboard the vessel if ODDS indicates that the fishing trip is selected for observer coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Delayed trip. A selected fishing trip not embarked upon within 48 hours of the time specified in the registration with ODDS is invalidated. The operator must register any new trip in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(C)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Observer coverage duration. If selected, a vessel is required to carry an observer for the entire fishing trip.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A fishing trip selected for observer coverage may not begin until all previously harvested fish has been offloaded and an observer is aboard the vessel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An observer may not be transferred off a catcher vessel until the observer confirms that all fish from the observed fishing trip are offloaded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A vessel must make a minimum of one delivery to a tender vessel to be subject to paragraph (3)(ii) of the fishing trip definition at Sec. 679.2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Vessel selection pool.
