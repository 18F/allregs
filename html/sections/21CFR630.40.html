You, an establishment that collects blood or blood components, must make reasonable attempts to notify any donor, including an autologous donor, who has been deferred based on the results of tests for evidence of infection with a relevant transfusion-transmitted infection(s) as required by Sec. 610.41(a) of this chapter; any donor who has been deferred as required under Sec. 630.30(b)(3) because their donated platelets have been determined under Sec. 606.145(d) of this chapter to be contaminated with an organism that is identified as likely to be associated with a bacterial infection that is endogenous to the bloodstream of the donor; and any donor who has been determined not to be eligible as a donor based on eligibility criteria under Sec. Sec. 630.10 and 630.15. * * *</p><p class="depth2">* * * * *</p>
