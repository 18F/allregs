                                Sec. 1235.46  What electronic media may be used for transferring records
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. This section specifies the media or method used to  transfer permanent records to the National Archives of the United  States. (See 36 CFR 1236.28 for the requirements governing the selection  of electronic records storage media for current agency use.) The agency  must use only media that is are sound and free from defects for  transfers to the National Archives of the United States. When permanent  electronic records may be disseminated through multiple electronic media  (e.g., magnetic tape, CD-ROM) or mechanisms (e.g., FTP), the agency and  NARA must agree on the most appropriate medium or method for transfer of  the records into the National Archives of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Magnetic tape. Agencies may transfer electronic records to the  National Archives of the United States on magnetic tape as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Open-reel magnetic tape must be on \1/2\-inch 9-track tape reels  recorded at 1600 or 6250 bpi that meet ANSI X3.39 or ANSI X3.54 (both  incorporated by reference, see Sec. 1235.4), respectively.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 18-track 3480-class cartridges must be recorded at 37,871 bpi  that meet ANSI X3.180 (incorporated by reference see, Sec. 1235.4). The  data must be blocked at no more than 32,760 bytes per block.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For DLT tape IV cartridges, the data must be blocked at no more  than 32,760 bytes per block and must conform to the standards cited in  the table as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ If you are copying the records on . . .   . . . then, the standard below</p><p class="depth3">applies. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ DLTtape IV with a DLT 4000 drive . . ..  ISO/IEC 15307 (incorporated by</p><p class="depth3">reference see, Sec. 1235.4). DLTtape IV with a DLT 7000 drive . . ..  ISO/IEC 15896 (incorporated by</p><p class="depth3">reference see, Sec. 1235.4). DLTtape IV with a DLT 8000 drive . . ..  ISO/IEC 16382 (incorporated by</p><p class="depth3">reference see, Sec. 1235.4). ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Compact-Disk, Read Only Memory (CD-ROM) and Digital Video Disks  (DVDs). Agencies may use CD-ROMs and DVDs to transfer permanent  electronic records to the National Archives of the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> CD-ROMs used for this purpose must conform to ANSI/NISO/ISO 9660  (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 1235.4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Permanent electronic records must be stored in discrete files.  Transferred CD-ROMs and DVDs may contain other files, such as software  or temporary records, but all permanent records must be in files that  contain only permanent records. Agencies must indicate at the time of  transfer if a CD-ROM or DVD contains temporary records and where those  records are located on the CD-ROM or DVD. The agency must also specify  whether NARA should return the CD-ROM or DVD to the agency or dispose of  it after copying the permanent records to an archival medium.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If permanent electronic records are stored on both CD-ROM (or  DVD) and other media, such as magnetic tape, the agency and NARA must  agree on the medium that will be used to transfer the records into the  National Archives of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> File Transfer Protocol. Agencies may use File Transfer Protocol  (FTP) to transfer permanent electronic records to the National Archives  of the United States only with NARA's approval. Several important  factors may   limit the use of FTP as a transfer method, including the number of  records, record file size, and available bandwidth. Agencies must  contact the National Archives and Records Administration, Special Media  Archives Services Division (NWCS), 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD  20740, phone number (301) 837-2903, or the National Archives and Records  Administration, Electronic/Special Media Records Services Division  (NWME), 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740, phone number (301)  837-1578, to initiate the transfer discussions. Each transfer of  electronic records via FTP must be preceded with a signed SF 258 sent to  NWME.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> FTP file structure may use the 64-character Joliet extension  naming convention only when letters, numbers, dashes (-), and  underscores (------) are used in the file and/or directory names, with a  slash (/) used to indicate directory structures. Otherwise, FTP file  structure must conform to an 8.3 file naming convention and file  directory structure as cited in ANSI/NISO/ISO 9660 (incorporated by  reference, see Sec. 1235.4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Permanent electronic records must be transferred in discrete  files, separate from temporary files. All permanent records must be  transferred in files that contain only permanent records.</p>
