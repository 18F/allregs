                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The authorized officer shall promptly aknowledge the receipt of  a plan of operations and within 30 days of receipt of the plan act on  the plan of operations to determine its acceptability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The authorized officer shall review the plan of operations to  determine if the operations are impairing the suitability of the area  for preservation as wilderness. Pending approval of the plan of  operations, mining operations may continue in a manner that minimizes  environmental impacts as prescribed in Sec. 3802.3 of this title. After  completing the review of the plan of operations, the authorized officer  shall give the operator written notice that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The plan is approved subject to measures that will prevent the  impairment of the suitability of the area for preservation as wilderness  as determined by the authorized officer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Plans covering operations on a claim with a valid existing right  are approved subject to measures that will prevent undue and unnecessary  degradation of the area; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The anticipated impacts of the mining operations are such that  all or part of further operations will impair the suitability of the  area for preservation as wilderness, the plan is disapproved and  continuance of such operations is not allowed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon receipt of a plan of operations for mining activities  commencing after the effective date of these regulations, the authorized  officer may notify the operator, in writing, that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In an area of lands under wilderness review where an inventory  has not been completed, an operator may agree to operate under a plan of  operations that includes terms and conditions that would be applicable  in a wilderness study area. Without an agreement to this effect, no  action may be taken on the plan until a wilderness inventory is  completed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The area has been inventoried and a final decision has been  issued and become effective that the area does not contain wilderness  characteristics, and that the mining operations are no longer subject to  these regulations; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The anticipated impacts are such that all or part of the  proposed mining operations will impair the suitability of the area for  preservation as wilderness, and therefore, the proposed mining operation  cannot be allowed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In addition to paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, the  following general plan approval procedures may also apply. The  authorized officer may notify the operator, in writing, that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The plan of operations is unacceptable and the reasons  therefore;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Modification of the plan of operations is necessary to meet the  requirements of these regulations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The plan of operations is being reviewed, but that more time,  not to exceed an additional 60 days, is necessary to complete such  review, setting forth the reasons why additional time is needed except  in those instances where it is determined that an Environmental Impact  Statement, compliance with section 106 of the National Historic  Preservation Act (NHPA) or section 7 of the Endangered Species Act is  needed. Periods during which the area of operations is inaccessible for  inspection due to climatic conditions, fire hazards or other physical  conditions or legal impediments, shall not be included when counting the  60 calendar day period; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The proposed operations do not require a plan of operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the authorized officer does not notify the operator of any  action on the plan of operations within the 30-day period, or the 60-day  extension, or notify the operator of the need for an Environmental  Impact Statement or compliance with section 106 of NHPA or section 7 of  the Endangered Species Act, operations under the plan may begin. The  option to begin operations under this section does not constitute  approval of a plan of operations. However, if the authorized officer at  a later date finds that operations under the   plan are impairing wilderness suitability, the authorized officer shall  notify the operator that the operations are not in compliance with these  regulations and what changes are needed, and shall require the operator  to submit a modified plan of operations, within a time specified in the  notice. If the operator is notified of the need for an Environmental  Impact Statement, the plan of operations shall not be approved before 30  days after a final statement is prepared and filed with the  Environmental Protection Agency. If the is operator notified of the need  for compliance with section 106 of the NHPA or section 7 of the  Endangered Species Act, the plan of operations shall not be approved  until the compliance responsibilities of the Bureau of Land Management  are satisfied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> of this  title, included in an approved plan of operation shall be the  operator's.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Pending final approval of the plan of operations, the authorized  officer may approve any operations that may be necessary for timely  compliance with requirements of Federal and State laws. Such operations  shall be conducted so as to prevent impairment of wilderness suitability  and to minimize environmental impacts as prescribed by the authorized  officer in accordance with the standards contained in Sec. 3802.3 of  this title.</p>
