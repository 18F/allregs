                            <p class="depth0">In the usual course of disposition of complaints filed under this  subpart, no oral hearing will be held, but, the administrative law  judge, in his or her discretion, may order such hearing. A request for  oral hearing may be incorporated in the answer or in complainant's reply  to the answer. Requests for oral hearing will not be entertained unless  they set forth in detail the reasons why the filing of affidavits or  other documents will not permit the fair and expeditious disposition of  the claim, and the precise nature of the facts sought to be proved at  such oral hearing. The administrative law judge shall rule upon a  request for oral hearing within ten (10) days of its receipt. In the  event an oral hearing is ordered, it will be held in accordance with the  rules applicable to other formal proceedings, as set forth in subparts A  through Q of this part. [Rule 315.]  [49 FR 44369, Nov. 6, 1984; 49 FR 47394, Dec. 4, 1984]</p>
