Examples of civil  actions alleging individual liability include the following: a medical  malpractice lawsuit against health care providers; suits resulting   from motor vehicle accidents; constitutional torts; or, common law torts  such as assault, libel, or intentional infliction of emotional distress.  Likewise, state or Federal criminal charges can arise from the  performance of official duties, including environmental crimes or motor  vehicle accidents.</p>
