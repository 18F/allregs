                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">A loan agreement or a supplement to a previous loan agreement must be executed by the intermediary and the Agency at loan closing for each loan. The loan agreement will be prepared by the Agency and reviewed by the intermediary prior to loan closing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The loan agreement will, as a minimum, set out:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The amount of the loan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The interest rate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The term and repayment schedule;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The provisions for late charges. The intermediary shall pay a late charge of 4 percent of the payment due if payment is not received within 15 calendar days following the due date. The late charge shall be considered unpaid if not received within 30 calendar days of the missed due date for which it was imposed. Any unpaid late charge shall be added to principal and be due as an extra payment at the end of the term. Acceptance of a late charge by the Agency does not constitute a waiver of default;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The disbursement procedure. Disbursement of loan funds by the Agency to the intermediary shall take place after the loan agreement and promissory note are executed, and any other conditions precedent to disbursement of funds are fully satisfied. For purposes of computing interest, the date of each draw down shall constitute the date the funds are advanced under the loan agreement;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The intermediary may initially draw up to 25 percent of the loan funds or, the intermediary must have at least one ultimate recipient loan application ready to close. Upon requesting a disbursement, the intermediary must provide documentation showing that its equity contribution has been deposited into the IRP revolving loan fund account. The initial draw must be deposited in an interest bearing account in accordance with Sec. 4274.332(b)(5) until needed and must be used for loans to ultimate recipients before any additional Agency IRP loan funds may be drawn by the intermediary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After the initial draw of funds, an intermediary may draw down only such funds as are necessary to cover a 30-day period in implementing its approved work plan. Advances must be requested by the intermediary in writing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The provisions regarding default. On the occurrence of any event of default, the Agency may declare all or any portion of the debt and interest to be immediately due and payable and may proceed to enforce its rights under the loan agreement or any other instruments securing or relating to the loan and in accordance with the applicable law and regulations. Any of the following may be regarded as an ``event of default'' in the sole discretion of the Agency:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Failure of the intermediary to carry out the specific activities in its loan application as approved by the Agency or comply with the loan terms and conditions of the loan agreement, any applicable Federal or State laws, or with such USDA or Agency regulations as may become applicable;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Failure of the intermediary to pay within 15 calendar days of its due date any installment of principal or interest on its promissory note to the Agency;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The occurrence of;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The intermediary becoming insolvent, or ceasing, being unable, or admitting in writing its inability to pay its debts as they mature, or making a general assignment for the benefit of, or entering into any composition or arrangement with creditors, or;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Proceedings for the appointment of a receiver, trustee, or liquidator of the intermediary, or of a substantial part of its assets, being authorized or instituted by or against it;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Submission or making of any report, statement, warranty, or representation by the intermediary or agent on its behalf to USDA or the Agency in connection with the financial assistance awarded hereunder which is false, incomplete, or incorrect in any material respect; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Failure of the intermediary to remedy any material adverse change in its financial or other condition (such as the representational character of its board of directors or policymaking body) arising since the date of the Agency's award of assistance hereunder, which condition was an inducement to Agency's original award.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The insurance requirements. (i) Hazard insurance with a standard mortgage clause naming the intermediary as beneficiary will be required by the intermediary on every ultimate recipient's project funded from the IRP revolving fund in an amount that is at least the lesser of the depreciated replacement value of the property being insured or the amount of the loan. Hazard insurance includes fire, windstorm, lightning, hail, business interruption, explosion, riot, civil commotion, aircraft, vehicle, marine, smoke, builder's risk, public liability, property damage, flood or mudslide, or any other hazard insurance that may be required to protect the security. The intermediary's interest in the insurance will be assigned to the Agency, upon the Agency's request, in the event of default by the intermediary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Hazard insurance with a standard mortgage clause naming the intermediary as beneficiary will be required by the intermediary on every ultimate recipient's project funded from the IRP revolving fund in an amount that is at least the lesser of the depreciated replacement value of the property being insured or the amount of the loan. Hazard insurance includes fire, windstorm, lightning, hail, business interruption, explosion, riot, civil commotion, aircraft, vehicle, marine, smoke, builder's risk, public liability, property damage, flood or mudslide, or any other hazard insurance that may be required to protect the security. The intermediary's interest in the insurance will be assigned to the Agency, upon the Agency's request, in the event of default by the intermediary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Ordinarily, life insurance, which may be decreasing term insurance, is required for the principals and key employees of the ultimate recipient funded from the IRP revolving fund and will be assigned or pledged to the intermediary and subsequently, in the event of request by the Agency following default by the intermediary, to the Agency. A schedule of life insurance available for the benefit of the loan will be included as part of the application.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Workmen's compensation insurance on ultimate recipients is required in accordance with the State law.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Flood insurance. The intermediary is responsible for determining if an ultimate recipient funded from the IRP revolving fund is located in a special flood or mudslide hazard area. If the ultimate recipient is in a flood or mudslide area, then flood or mudslide insurance must be provided in accordance with subpart B of part 1806 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Intermediaries will provide fidelity bond coverage for all persons who have access to intermediary funds. Coverage may be provided either for all individual positions or persons, or through ``blanket'' coverage providing protection for all appropriate employees and officials. The Agency may also require the intermediary to carry other appropriate insurance, such as public liability, workers compensation, and property damage.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The amount of fidelity bond coverage required by the Agency will normally approximate the total annual debt service requirements for the Agency loans;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Other types of coverage may be considered acceptable if it is determined by the Agency that they fulfill essentially the same purpose as a fidelity bond;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Intermediaries must provide evidence of adequate fidelity bond and other appropriate insurance coverage by loan closing. Adequate coverage in accordance with this section must then be maintained for the life of the loan. It is the responsibility of the intermediary to assure and provide evidence that adequate coverage is maintained. This may consist of a listing of policies and coverage amounts in reports required by paragraph (b)(4) of this section or other documentation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The intermediary will agree in the loan agreement:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Not to make any changes in the intermediary's articles of incorporation, charter, or by-laws without the concurrence of the Agency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Not to make a loan commitment to an ultimate recipient to be funded from Agency IRP loan funds without first receiving the Agency's written concurrence;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To maintain a separate ledger and segregated account for the IRP revolving fund;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> To Agency reporting requirements by providing:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An annual audit;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Dates of audit report period need not necessarily coincide with other reports on the IRP. Audit reports shall be due 90 days following the audit period. Audits must cover all of the intermediary's activities. Audits will be performed by an independent certified public accountant. An acceptable audit will be performed in accordance with Generally Accepted Government

Auditing Standards and include such tests of the accounting records as the auditor considers necessary in order to express an opinion on the financial condition of the intermediary. The Agency does not require an unqualified audit opinion as a result of the audit. Compilations or reviews do not satisfy the audit requirement;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> It is not intended that audits required by this subpart be separate and apart from audits performed in accordance with State and local laws or for other purposes. To the extent feasible, the audit work should be done in connection with these audits. Intermediaries covered by 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, as codified in 2 CFR 400.1, should submit audits made in accordance with that regulation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Quarterly or semiannual reports (due 30 days after the end of the period);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Reports will be required quarterly during the first year after loan closing and, if all loan funds are not utilized during the first year, quarterly reports will be continued until at least 90 percent of the Agency IRP loan funds have been advanced to ultimate recipients. Thereafter, reports will be required semiannually. Also, the Agency may require quarterly reports if the intermediary becomes delinquent in repayment of its loan or otherwise fails to fully comply with the provisions of its work plan or Loan Agreement, or the Agency determines that the intermediary's IRP revolving fund is not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the ultimate recipients.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> These reports shall contain information only on the IRP revolving loan fund, or if other funds are included, the IRP loan program portion shall be segregated from the others; and in the case where the intermediary has more than one IRP revolving fund from the Agency a separate report shall be made for each of the IRP revolving funds.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The reports will be submitted through the Agency approved electronic system and includes information on the intermediary's lending activity, income and expenses, financial condition and a summary of applicable information of the ultimate recipients the intermediary has financed.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> An annual report on the extent to which increased employment, income and ownership opportunities are provided to low-income persons, farm families, and displaced farm families for each loan made by such intermediary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Annual proposed budget for the following year; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Other reports as the Agency may require from time to time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Before the first relending of Agency funds to an ultimate recipient, to obtain written Agency approval of;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All forms to be used for relending purposes, including application forms, loan agreements, promissory notes, and security instruments;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Intermediary's policy with regard to the amount and form of security to be required;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> To obtain written approval of the Agency before making any significant changes in forms, security policy, or the work plan. The servicing officer may approve changes in forms, security policy, or work plans at any time upon a written request from the intermediary and determination by the Agency that the change will not jeopardize repayment of the loan or violate any requirement of this subpart or other Agency regulations. The intermediary must comply with the work plan approved by the Agency so long as any portion of the intermediary's IRP loan is outstanding;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> To secure the indebtedness by pledging the IRP revolving fund, including its portfolio of investments derived from the proceeds of the loan award, and pledging its real and personal property and other rights and interests as the Agency may require;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> In the event the intermediary's financial condition deteriorates or the intermediary takes action detrimental to prudent fund operation or fails to take action required of a prudent lender, to provide additional security, execute any additional documents, and undertake any reasonable acts the Agency may request, to protect the agency's interest or to perfect a security interest in any assets, including physical delivery of assets and specific assignments; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> If any part of the loan has not been used in accordance with the intermediary's work plan by a date 3

years from the date of the loan agreement, the Agency may cancel the approval of any funds not yet delivered to the intermediary and the intermediary will return, as an extra payment on the loan, any funds delivered to the intermediary that have not been used by the intermediary in accordance with the work plan. The Agency, at its sole discretion, may allow the intermediary additional time to use the loan funds. Regular loan payments will be based on the amount of funds actually drawn by the intermediary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> For IRP intermediaries, IRP funds in excess of $250,000 that have not been used to make loans to ultimate recipients for 6 months or more will be returned to Rural Development unless Rural Development provides an exception to the intermediary. Any exception would be based on evidence satisfactory to Rural Development that every effort is being made by the intermediary to utilize the IRP funding in conformance with program objectives.
