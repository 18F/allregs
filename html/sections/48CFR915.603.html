                            <p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Unsolicited proposals for the performance of support services  are, except as discussed in this paragraph, unacceptable as the  performance of such services is unlikely to necessitate innovative and  unique concepts. There may be rare instances in which an unsolicited  proposal offers an innovative and unique approach to the accomplishment  of a support service. If such a proposal offers a previously unknown or  an alternative approach to generally recognized techniques for the  accomplishment of a specific service(s) and such approach will provide  significantly greater economy or enhanced quality, it may be considered  for acceptance. Such acceptance shall, however, require approval of the  acquisition of support services in accordance with applicable DOE  Directives and be processed as a deviation to the prohibition in this  paragraph.
