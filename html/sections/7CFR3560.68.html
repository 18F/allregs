Borrowers operating on a limited profit basis will be permitted a return not to exceed 8 percent of their required initial investment determined at the time of loan approval in accordance with Sec. 3560.63(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Calculation of permitted return.

A return may not be allowed on the amount above the equity contribution required by Sec. 3560.63(c) if the market value as determined by the Agency, when added to the loan and grant amounts from all sources, exceeds the security value of the MFH project as specified in Sec. 3560.63(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Return on additional investment. The initial investment may exceed the equity contribution required by Sec. 3560.63(c) and a return allowed on the investment if the additional return does not increase basic rents and rental assistance costs above what basic rents and rental assistance costs would have been with the Agency financing 95 or 97 percent of the total development cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Compensation to nonprofit organizations. Although nonprofit organizations are not eligible to take a return on investment, with prior Agency approval, cooperatives and nonprofit organizations may use housing project funds to

pay asset management expenses directly attributable to ownership responsibilities, as described in Sec. 3560.303(b)(1)(ii).</p>
