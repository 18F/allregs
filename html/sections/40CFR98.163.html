Calculate and report under this subpart the CO2 emissions by operating and maintaining CEMS according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology specified in Sec. 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Fuel and feedstock material balance approach. Calculate and report CO2 emissions as the sum of the annual emissions associated with each fuel and feedstock used for hydrogen production by following paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section. The carbon content and molecular weight shall be obtained from the analyses conducted in accordance with Sec. 98.164(b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4), as applicable, or from the missing data procedures in Sec. 98.165. If the analyses are performed annually, then the annual value shall be used as the monthly average. If the analyses are performed more frequently than monthly, use the arithmetic average of values obtained during the month as the monthly average.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Gaseous fuel and feedstock.

The owner or operator shall report under this subpart the combined stack emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in Sec. 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources).
