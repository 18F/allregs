                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section 152(c) provides that a taxpayer shall be treated as  having contributed over half of the support of an individual for the  calendar year (in cases where two or more taxpayers contributed to the  support of such individual) if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No one person contributed over half of the individual's support,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each member of the group which collectively contributed more  than half of the support of the individual would have been entitled to  claim the individual as a dependent but for the fact that he did not  contribute more than one-half of such support.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The member of the group claiming the individual as a dependent  contributed more than 10 percent of the individual's support, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each other person in the group who contributed more than 10  percent   of such support furnishes to the taxpayer claiming the dependent a  written declaration that such other person will not claim the individual  as a dependent for any taxable year beginning in such calendar year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Examples. Application of the rule contained in paragraph (a) of  this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. During the taxable year, brothers A, B, C, and D  contributed the entire support of their mother in the following  percentages: A, 30 percent; B, 20 percent; C, 29 percent; and D, 21  percent. Any one of the brothers, except for the fact that he did not  contribute more than half of her support, would have been entitled to  claim his mother as a dependent. Consequently, any one of the brothers  could claim a deduction for the exemption of the mother if he obtained a  written declaration (as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section)  from each of the other brothers. Even though A and D together  contributed more than one-half the support of the mother, A, if he  wished to claim his mother as a dependent, would be required to obtain  written declarations from B, C, and D, since each of those three  contributed more than 10 percent of the support and, but for the failure  to contribute more than half of the mother's support, would have been  entitled to claim his mother as a dependent.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. During the taxable year, E, an individual who resides  with his son, S, received his entire support for that year as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Percentage</p><p class="depth2">Source                              of total ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Social Security............................................           25 N, an unrelated neighbor...................................           11 B, a brother...............................................           14 D, a daughter..............................................           10 S, a son...................................................           40</p><p class="depth2">Total received by E....................................          100 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">B, D, and S are persons each of whom, but for the fact that none  contributed more than half of E's support, could claim E as a dependent  for the taxable year. The three together contributed 64 percent of E's  support, and, thus, each is a member of the group to be considered for  the purpose of section 152(c). B and S are the only members of such  group who can meet all the requirements of section 152(c), and either  one could claim E as a dependent for his taxable year if he obtained a  written declaration (as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section)  signed by the other, and furnished the other information required by the  return with respect to all the contributions to E. Inasmuch as D did not  contribute more than 10 percent of E's support, she is not entitled to  claim E as a dependent for the taxable year nor is she required to  furnish a written declaration with respect to her contributions to E. N  contributed over 10 percent of the support of E, but, since he is an  unrelated neighbor, he does not qualify as a member of the group for the  purpose of the multiple support agreement under section 152(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The member of a group of contributors who claims an  individual as a dependent for a taxable year beginning before January 1,  2002, under the multiple support agreement provisions of section 152(c)  must attach to the member's income tax return for the year of the  deduction a written declaration from each of the other persons who  contributed more than 10 percent of the support of such individual and  who, but for the failure to contribute more than half of the support of  the individual, would have been entitled to claim the individual as a  dependent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The taxpayer claiming an individual as a dependent for a taxable  year beginning after December 31, 2001, under the multiple support  agreement provisions of section 152(c) must provide with the income tax  return for the year of the deduction--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A statement identifying each of the other persons who  contributed more than 10 percent of the support of the individual and  who, but for the failure to contribute more than half of the support of  the individual, would have been entitled to claim the individual as a  dependent; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A statement indicating that the taxpayer obtained a written  declaration from each of the persons described in section 152(c)(2)  waiving the right to claim the individual as a dependent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The taxpayer claiming the individual as a dependent for a  taxable year beginning after December 31, 2001, must retain the waiver  declarations and should be prepared to furnish the waiver declarations  and any other information necessary to substantiate the claim, which may  include a statement showing the names of all contributors (whether or  not members of the group described in section 152(c)(2)) and   the amount contributed by each to the support of the claimed dependent.
