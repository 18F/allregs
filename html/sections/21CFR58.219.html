                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">A testing facility that has been disqualified may be reinstated as  an acceptable source of nonclinical laboratory studies to be submitted  to the Food and Drug Administration if the Commissioner determines, upon  an evaluation of the submission of the testing facility, that the  facility can adequately assure that it will conduct future nonclinical  laboratory studies in compliance with the good laboratory practice  regulations set forth in this part and, if any studies are currently  being conducted, that the quality and integrity of such studies have not  been seriously compromised. A disqualified testing facility that wishes  to be so reinstated shall present in writing to the Commissioner reasons  why it believes it should be reinstated and a detailed description of  the corrective actions it has taken or intends to take to assure that  the acts or omissions which led to its disqualification will not recur.  The Commissioner may condition reinstatement upon the testing facility  being found in compliance with the good laboratory practice regulations  upon an inspection. If a testing facility is reinstated, the  Commissioner shall so notify the testing facility and all organizations  and persons who were notified, under Sec. 58.213 of the  disqualification of the testing facility. A determination that a testing  facility has been reinstated is disclosable to the public under part 20  of this chapter.</p>
