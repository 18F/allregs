However, recipients shall be advised where levels of  radioactive contamination require specific controls for shipment as  provided in Department of Transportation Regulations (49 CFR parts 171- 179) for shipment of radioactive personal property. In addition, when  any contaminated personal property is screened within DOE, reported to  GSA, or otherwise disposed of, the kind and degree of contamination must  be plainly indicated on all pertinent documents.</p>
