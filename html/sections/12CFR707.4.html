Except as  provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, if a member or  potential member is not present at the credit union when the account is  opened or the service is provided and has not already received the  disclosures, the credit union must mail or deliver the disclosures no  later than 10 business days after the account is opened or the service  is provided, whichever is earlier.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Timing of electronic disclosures. If a member or potential  member who is not present at the credit union uses electronic means, for  example, an internet Web site, to open an account or request a service,  the disclosures required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be  provided before the account is opened or the service is provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Requests. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A credit union must provide account disclosures to  a member or potential member upon request.

Such prospective dividend rate and  prospective annual percentage yield may be disclosed either in lieu of,  or in addition to, the dividend rate and   annual percentage yield as of the last dividend declaration date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For interest bearing accounts and for dividend-bearing term  share accounts, specify an interest rate and annual percentage yield  that were offered within the most recent seven calendar days; state that  the rate and yield are accurate as of an identified date; and provide a  telephone number members may call to obtain current rate information;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> State the maturity of a term share account as either a term or a  date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Content of account disclosures.
