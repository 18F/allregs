The classified nature of the challenge, as  well as the appended documents, require that the holder transmit same in  full accordance with established security procedures. In general,  registered U.S. mail is approved for SECRET, non-compartmented material;  higher classifications require use of approved Top Secret facsimile  machines or CIA-approved couriers. Further information is available from  the CIA as well as corporate or other federal agency security  departments.</p><p class="depth0">Action on Challenges</p>
