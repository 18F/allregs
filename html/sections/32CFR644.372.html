                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Upon receipt of initial information that real property  is excess, the DE should promptly initiate planning for interim  productive use. Interim use should be planned to save care and custody  expense but must not interfere with, delay, or retard transfer of the  property to another Federal agency or its disposal otherwise. Any permit  or lease must have the prior approval of GSA, and shall be for a period  not exceeding one year and shall be revocable on 30 days' notice (FPMR  Sections 101-47.203-9 and 101-47.312).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Permits to other Federal agencies. Interested Federal agencies  will be afforded a priority in the interim use of excess and surplus  real property. The permit will require the Federal agency to perform  care and custody and perform routine maintenance. 41 CFR 101-47.203-8,  provides for temporary assignment, conditional transfers, and rental or  user charges for use of excess property by Federal agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Leases for non-Federal use. Leases of excess and surplus  property are made under authority of the Federal Property and  Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended and AR 405-80. Such  leases are subject to the Economy Act (40 U.S.C. 303b), and must be for  a money consideration only. The lessee can and should, however, be made  responsible for ordinary maintenance and restoration as required by  standard Corps of Engineers lease forms. Where a portion of an excess or  surplus installation is leased, it may be advantageous to enter into an  agreement with the lessee for care and custody of the remainder. The  agreement cannot provide for a reduction of rental for the portion  leased. The Economy Act may not apply in some cases where industrial  plants are determined excess subject to the National Security Clause or  similar recapture conditions. Such cases should be coordinated with  DAEN-REM on an individual basis.    Sec. Sec. 644.373-644.375  [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2">Return of Public Domain Lands and Lands Obtained on a Temporary Basis</p><p class="depth2">From Another Federal Agency</p>
