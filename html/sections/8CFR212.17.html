USCIS may not waive a ground of inadmissibility based  upon section 212(a)(3)(E) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(E). USCIS, in  its discretion, may grant the waiver based on section 212(d)(3) of the  Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(3), except where the ground of inadmissibility  arises under sections 212(a)(3)(A)(i)(I), (3)(A)(ii), (3)(A)(iii),  (3)(C), or (3)(E) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(A)(i)(I), (3)(A)(ii),  (3)(A)(iii), (3)(C), or (3)(E).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of applicants inadmissible on criminal or related  grounds, in exercising its discretion USCIS will consider the number and  severity of the offenses of which the applicant has been convicted. In  cases involving violent or dangerous crimes or inadmissibility based on  the security and related grounds in section 212(a)(3) of the Act, USCIS  will only exercise favorable discretion in extraordinary circumstances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> There is no appeal of a decision to deny a waiver. However,  nothing in this paragraph is intended to prevent an applicant from re- filing a request for a waiver of ground of inadmissibility in  appropriate cases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Revocation. The Secretary of Homeland Security, at any time, may  revoke a waiver previously authorized under section 212(d) of the Act, 8  U.S.C. 118(d). Under no circumstances will the alien or any party acting  on his or her   behalf have a right to appeal from a decision to revoke a waiver.
