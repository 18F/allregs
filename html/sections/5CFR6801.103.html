                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prohibited interests. Except as permitted by this section, an  employee, or an employee's spouse or minor child, shall not own or  control, directly or indirectly, any debt or equity interest in:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A depository institution or any of its affiliates; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A primary government securities dealer or any of its affiliates,  if such employee has regular, ongoing access to Class I Federal Open  Market Committee information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions. The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section  does not apply to the ownership or control of a debt or equity interest  in the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Nonbanking holding companies. A publicly traded holding company  that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Owns a bank and either the holding company or the bank is exempt  under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, 12 U.S.C. 1841 et seq., (for  example, a credit card bank, a nonbank bank or a grandfathered bank  holding company), and the holding company's predominant activity is not  the ownership or operation of banks and thrifts;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Owns a thrift and its predominant activity is not the ownership  or operation of banks and thrifts; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Owns a primary government securities dealer and its  predominant activity is not the ownership or operation of banks, thrifts  or securities firms.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Mutual funds. A publicly traded or publicly available mutual  fund or other collective investment fund if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The fund does not have a stated policy of concentration in the  financial services industry; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Neither the employee nor the employee's spouse exercises or has  the ability to exercise control over the financial interests held by the  fund or their selection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Pension plans. A widely held, diversified pension or other  retirement fund that is administered by an independent trustee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Waivers. The Board's Designated Agency Ethics Official, in  consultation with Division management, may grant a written waiver  permitting the employee to own or control a debt or equity interest  prohibited by paragraph (a) of this section if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Extenuating circumstances exist, such as that ownership or  control was acquired:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Prior to Federal Reserve employment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Through inheritance, gift, merger, acquisition, or other change  in corporate structure, or otherwise without specific intent on the part  of the employee, spouse, or minor child to acquire the debt or equity  interest; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> By an employee's spouse as part of a compensation package in  connection with the spouse's employment or prior to marriage to the  employee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employee makes a prompt and complete written disclosure of  the interest;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The employee's disqualification from participating in any  particular matter having a direct and predictable effect on the  institution or any of its affiliates does not unduly interfere with the  full performance of the employee's duties; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Granting the waiver would be consistent with Division policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Disqualification. If an employee or an employee's spouse or  minor child holds an interest in an entity under paragraph (b)(1) or (c)  of this section, the employee must consult the Designated Agency Ethics  Official in order to determine whether the employee must be disqualified  from participating in any particular matter involving that entity or  affiliate under the conflicts of interest rules of the Office of  Government Ethics.
