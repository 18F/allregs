In the event of a kick,  you must use one of the following alternatives to dispose of the well- influx fluids giving consideration to personnel safety, possible  environmental damage, and possible facility well-equipment damage:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contain the well-fluid influx by shutting in the well and  pumping the fluids back into the formation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Control the kick by using appropriate well-control techniques to  prevent formation fracturing in an open hole within the pressure limits  of the well equipment (drill pipe, work string, casing, wellhead, BOP  system, and related equipment). The disposal of H2S and other  gases must be through pressurized or atmospheric mud-separator equipment  depending on volume, pressure and concentration of H2S. The  equipment must be designed to recover well-control fluids and burn the  gases separated from the well-control fluid. The well-control fluid must  be treated to neutralize H2S and restore and maintain the  proper quality.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Well testing in a zone known to contain H2S. When testing a well  in a zone with H2S present, you must do all of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Before starting a well test, conduct safety meetings for all  personnel who will be on the facility during the test. At the meetings,  emphasize the use of protective-breathing equipment, first-aid  procedures, and the Contingency Plan. Only competent personnel who are  trained and are knowledgeable of the hazardous effects of H2S  must be engaged in these tests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Perform well testing with the minimum number of personnel in the  immediate vicinity of the rig floor and with the appropriate test  equipment to safely and adequately perform the test. During the test,  you must continuously monitor H2S levels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Not burn produced gases except through a flare which meets the  requirements of paragraph (q)(6) of this section. Before flaring gas  containing H2S, you must activate SO2 monitoring  equipment in accordance with paragraph (j)(11) of this section. If you  detect SO2 in excess of 2 ppm, you must implement the  personnel protective measures in your H2S Contingency Plan,  required by paragraph (f) of this section. You must also follow the  requirements of Sec.  250.1164. You must pipe gases from stored test  fluids into the flare outlet and burn them.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Use downhole test tools and wellhead equipment suitable for  H2S service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Use tubulars suitable for H2S service. You must not  use drill pipe for well testing without the prior approval of the  District Manager. Water cushions must be thoroughly inhibited in order  to prevent H2S attack on metals. You must flush the test  string fluid treated for this purpose after completion of the test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Use surface test units and related equipment that is designed  for H2S service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(p)</em> Metallurgical properties of equipment. When operating in a zone  with H2S present, you must use equipment that is constructed  of materials with metallurgical properties that resist or prevent  sulfide stress cracking (also known as hydrogen embrittlement, stress  corrosion cracking, or H2S embrittlement), chloride-stress  cracking, hydrogen-induced cracking, and other failure modes. You must  do all of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Use tubulars and other equipment, casing, tubing, drill pipe,  couplings, flanges, and related equipment that is designed for  H2S service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Use BOP system components, wellhead, pressure-control equipment,  and related equipment exposed to H2S-bearing fluids in  conformance with NACE Standard MR0175-03 (as specified in Sec.   250.198).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Use temporary downhole well-security devices such as retrievable  packers and bridge plugs that are designed for H2S service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> When producing in zones bearing H2S, use equipment  constructed of materials capable of resisting or preventing sulfide  stress cracking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Keep the use of welding to a minimum during the installation or  modification of a production facility. Welding must be done in a manner  that ensures resistance to sulfide stress cracking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(q)</em> General requirements when operating in an H2S zone: (1) Coring  operations. When you conduct coring operations in H2S-bearing  zones, all personnel in the working area must wear protective-breathing  equipment at least 10 stands in advance of retrieving the core barrel.  Cores to be transported must be sealed and marked for the presence of  H2S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Logging operations. You must treat and condition well-control  fluid in use for logging operations to minimize the effects of  H2S on the logging equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Stripping operations. Personnel must monitor displaced well- control fluid returns and wear protective-breathing equipment in the  working area when the atmospheric concentration of H2S  reaches 20 ppm or if the well is under pressure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Gas-cut well-control fluid or well kick from H2S-bearing zone.  If you decide to circulate out a kick, personnel in the working area  during bottoms-up and extended-kill operations must wear protective- breathing equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Drill- and workover-string design and precautions. Drill- and  workover-strings must be designed consistent with the anticipated depth,  conditions of the hole, and reservoir environment to be encountered. You  must minimize exposure of the drill- or workover-string to high stresses  as much as practical and consistent with well conditions. Proper  handling techniques must be taken to minimize notching and stress  concentrations. Precautions must be taken to minimize stresses caused by  doglegs, improper stiffness ratios, improper torque, whip, abrasive wear  on tool joints, and joint imbalance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Flare system. The flare outlet must be of a diameter that allows  easy nonrestricted flow of gas. You must locate flare line outlets on  the downside of the facility and as far from the facility as is  feasible, taking into account the prevailing wind directions, the wake  effects caused by the facility and adjacent structure(s), and the height  of all such facilities and structures. You must equip the flare outlet  with an automatic ignition system including a pilot-light gas source or  an equivalent system. You must have alternate methods for igniting the  flare. You must pipe to the flare system used for H2S all  vents from production process equipment, tanks, relief valves, burst  plates, and similar devices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Corrosion mitigation. You must use effective means of monitoring  and controlling corrosion caused by acid gases (H2S and  CO2) in both the downhole and surface portions of a  production system. You must take specific corrosion monitoring and  mitigating measures in areas of unusually severe corrosion where  accumulation of water and/or higher concentration of H2S  exists.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Wireline lubricators. Lubricators which may be exposed to fluids  containing H2S must be of H2S-resistant materials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Fuel and/or instrument gas. You must not use gas containing  H2S for instrument gas. You must not use gas containing  H2S for fuel gas without the prior approval of the District  Manager.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Sensing lines and devices. Metals used for sensing line and  safety-control devices which are necessarily exposed to H2S- bearing fluids must be constructed of H2S-corrosion resistant  materials or coated so as to resist H2S corrosion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Elastomer seals. You must use H2S-resistant  materials for all seals which may be exposed to fluids containing  H2S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Water disposal. If you dispose of produced water by means other  than subsurface injection, you must submit to the District Manager an  analysis of the anticipated H2S content of the water at the  final treatment vessel and at the discharge point. The District Manager  may require that the water be treated for removal of H2S. The  District Manager may require the submittal of an updated analysis if the  water disposal rate or the potential H2S content increases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Deck drains. You must equip open deck drains with traps or  similar devices to prevent the escape of H2S gas into the  atmosphere.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Sealed voids. You must take precautions to eliminate sealed  spaces in piping designs (e.g., slip-on flanges, reinforcing pads) which  can be invaded by atomic hydrogen when H2S is present.</p>
