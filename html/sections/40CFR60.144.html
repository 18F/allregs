Sampling shall be conducted only during the steel production cycle and for a sufficient number of steel production cycles to obtain a total sample volume of at least 5.67 dscm (200 dscf) for each run.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Method 9 and the procedures of Sec. 60.11 shall be used to determine opacity, except sections 2.4 and 2.5 of Method 9 shall be replaced with the following instructions for recording observations and reducing data:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Section 2.4. Opacity observations shall be recorded to the nearest 5 percent at 15-second intervals. During the initial performance test conducted pursuant to Sec. 60.8, observations shall be made and recorded in this manner for a minimum of three steel production cycles. During any subsequent compliance test, observations may be made for any number of steel production cycles, although, where conditions permit, observations will generally be made for a minimum of three steel production cycles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 2.5. Opacity shall be determined as an average of 12 consecutive observations recorded at 15-second intervals. For each steel production cycle, divide the observations recorded into sets of 12 consecutive observations. Sets need not be consecutive in time, and in no case shall two sets overlap. For each set of 12 observations, calculate the average by summing the opacity of 12 consecutive observations and dividing this sum by 12.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In complying with the requirements of Sec. 60.143a(c), the owner or operator shall conduct an initial test as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For devices that monitor and record the exhaust ventilation rate, compare velocity readings recorded by the monitoring device against the velocity readings obtained by Method 2. Take Method 2 readings at a point or points that would properly characterize the monitoring device's performance and that would adequately reflect the various rates of exhaust ventilation. Obtain readings at sufficient intervals to obtain 12 pairs of readings for each duct of the secondary emission capture system. Compare the averages of the two sets to determine whether the monitoring device velocity is within 10 percent of the Method 2 average.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For devices that monitor the level of exhaust ventilation and record only step changes when a set point rate is reached, compare step changes recorded by the monitoring device against the velocity readings obtained by Method 2. Take Method 2 readings

at a point or points that would properly characterize the performance of the monitoring device and that would adequately reflect the various rates of exhaust ventilation. Obtain readings at sufficient intervals to obtain 12 pairs of readings for each duct of the secondary emission capture system. Compare the averages of the two sets to determine whether the monitoring device step change is within 10 percent of the setpoint rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> To comply with Sec. 60.143a(d) or (e), the owner or operator shall use the monitoring device of Sec. 60.143a(a) to determine the exhaust ventilation rates or levels during the particulate matter runs. Each owner or operator shall then use these rates or levels to determine the 3-hour averages required by Sec. 60.143a(d) and (e).

Sec. 60.145a  Compliance provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> When determining compliance with mass and visible emission limits specified in Sec. 60.142a(a) (2) and (3), the owner or operator of a BOPF shop that normally operates two furnaces with overlapping cycles may elect to operate only one furnace. If an owner or operator chooses to shut down one furnace, he shall be allowed a reasonable time period to adjust his production schedule before the compliance tests are conducted. The owner or operator of an affected facility may also elect to suspend shop operations not subject to this subpart during compliance testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> During compliance testing for mass and visible emission standards, if an owner or operator elects to shut down one furnace in a shop that normally operates two furnaces with overlapping cycles, the owner or operator shall operate the secondary emission control system for the furnace being tested at exhaust ventilation rates or levels for each duct of the secondary emission control system that are appropriate for single-furnace operation. Following the compliance test, the owner or operator shall operate the secondary emission control system at exhaust ventilation rates or levels for each duct of the system that are no lower than 90 percent of the exhaust ventilation values established during the most recent compliance test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> For the purpose of determining compliance with visible and mass emission standards, a steel production cycle begins when the scrap or hot metal is charged to the vessel (whichever operation occurs first) and terminates 3 minutes after slag is emptied from the vessel into the slag pot. Consecutive steel production cycles are not required for the purpose of determining compliance. Where a hot metal transfer or skimming station is an affected facility, the steel production cycle also includes the hot metal transfer or skimming operation for the next steel production cycle for the affected vessel. Visible emission observations for both hot metal transfer and skimming operations begin with the start of the operation and terminate 3 minutes after completion of the operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> For the purpose of determining compliance with visible emission standards specified in Sec. 60.142a(a) (1) and (3), the starting and stopping times of regulated process operations shall be determined and the starting and stopping times of visible emissions data sets shall be determined accordingly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> To determine compliance with Sec. 60.142a(a)(1), select the data sets yielding the highest and second highest 3-minute average opacities for each steel production cycle. Compliance is achieved if the highest 3-minute average for each cycle observed is less than 20 percent and the second highest 3-minute average is 10 percent or less.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> To determine compliance with Sec. 60.142(a)(2), determine the concentration of particulate matter in exhaust gases exiting the secondary emission collection device with Method 5. Compliance is achieved if the concentration of particulate matter does not exceed 23 mg/dscm (0.010 gr/dscf).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> To determine compliance with Sec. 60.142a(a)(3), construct consecutive 3-minute averages for each steel production cycle. Compliance is achieved if no 3-minute average is more than 5 percent.
