                            <p class="depth0">All terms used in this subpart shall have the meaning given to them in the Act and in this section. If a term is defined in both this section and in another subpart that references the use of

this subpart, then the definition in this subpart shall take precedence when implementing this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Container means a portable unit in which a material can be stored, transported, treated, disposed of, or otherwise handled. Examples of containers include but are not limited to drums, dumpsters, roll-off boxes, bulk cargo containers commonly known as ``portable tanks'' or ``totes,'' cargo tank trucks, and tank railcars.</p><p class="depth0">Closure device means a cover, cap, hatch, lid, plug, seal, valve, or other type of fitting that prevents or reduces air emissions to the atmosphere by blocking an opening in a container or its cover when the device is secured in the closed position. Closure devices include devices that are detachable from the container (e.g., a drum head, a threaded plug), manually operated (e.g., a hinged dumpster lid, a truck tank hatch), or automatically operated (e.g., a spring loaded pressure relief valve).</p><p class="depth0">Empty container means a container for which either of the following conditions exists: the container meets the conditions for an empty container specified in 40 CFR 261.7(b); or all regulated-material has been removed from the container except for any regulated-material that remains on the interior surfaces of the container as clingage or in pools on the container bottom due to irregularities in the container.</p><p class="depth0">No detectable organic emissions means no escape of organics to the atmosphere as determined using the procedure specified in Sec.  63.925(a) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Regulated-material means the material (e.g. waste, wastewater, off-site material) required to be managed in containers using air emission controls in accordance with the standards specified in this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Safety device means a closure device such as a pressure relief valve, frangible disc, fusible plug, or any other type of device which functions to prevent physical damage or permanent deformation to equipment by venting gases or vapors during unsafe conditions resulting from an unplanned, accidental, or emergency event. For the purpose of this subpart, a safety device is not used for routine venting of gases or vapors from the vapor headspace underneath a cover such as during filling of the unit or to adjust the pressure in this vapor headspace in response to normal daily diurnal ambient temperature fluctuations. A safety device is designed to remain in a closed position during normal operations and open only when the internal pressure, or another relevant parameter, exceeds the device threshold setting applicable to the equipment as determined by the owner or operator based on manufacturer recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of flammable, combustible, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials.
