                            <p class="depth0">As used in this subpart--</p><p class="depth0">Acquisition savings means savings resulting from the application of  a value engineering change proposal (VECP) to contracts awarded by the  same contracting office of its successor for essentially the same unit.  Acquisition savings include--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Instant contract savings, that are the net cost reductions on  the contract under which the VECP is submitted and accepted, and that  are equal to the instant unit cost reduction multiplied by the number of  instant contract units affected by the VECP, less the contractor's  allowable development and implementation costs;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Concurrent contract savings, that are net reductions in the  prices of other contracts that are definitized and   ongoing at the time the VECP is accepted; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Future contract savings, that are the product of the future unit  cost reduction multiplied by the number of future contract units in the  sharing base. On an instant contract, future contract savings include  savings on increases in quantities after VECP acceptance that are due to  contract modifications, exercise of options, additional orders, and  funding of subsequent year requirements on a multiyear contract.</p><p class="depth2">Collateral costs means agency costs of operation, maintenance  logistic support, or Government-furnished property.</p><p class="depth2">Collateral savings means those measurable net reductions resulting  from a VECP in the agency's overall projected collateral costs,  exclusive of acquisition savings, whether or not the acquisition cost  changes.</p><p class="depth2">Contracting office includes any contracting office that the  acquisition is transferred to, such as another branch of the agency or  another agency's office that is performing a joint acquisition action.</p><p class="depth2">Contractor's development and implementation costs means those costs  the contractor incurs on a VECP specifically in developing, testing,  preparing, and submitting the VECP, as well as those costs the  contractor incurs to make the contractual changes required by Government  acceptance of a VECP.</p><p class="depth2">Future unit cost reduction means the instant unit cost reduction  adjusted as the contracting officer considers necessary for projected  learning or changes in quantity during the sharing period. It is  calculated at the time the VECP is accepted and applies either (1)  throughout the sharing period, unless the contracting officer decides  that recalculation is necessary because conditions are significantly  different from those previously anticipated or (2) to the calculation of  a lump-sum payment, that cannot later be revised.</p><p class="depth2">Government costs means those agency costs that result directly from  developing and implementing the VECP, such as any net increases in the  cost of testing, operations, maintenance, and logistics support. The  term does not include the normal administrative costs of processing the  VECP or any increase in instant contract cost or price resulting from  negative instant contract savings, except that for use in 52.248-3, see  the definition at 52.248-3(b).</p><p class="depth2">Instant contract means the contract under which the VECP is  submitted. It does not include increases in quantities after acceptance  of the VECP that are due to contract modifications, exercise of options,  or additional orders. If the contract is a multiyear contract, the term  does not include quantities funded after VECP acceptance. In a fixed- price contract with prospective price redetermination, the term refers  to the period for which firm prices have been established.</p><p class="depth2">Instant unit cost reduction means the amount of the decrease in unit  cost of performance (without deducting any contractor's development or  implementation costs) resulting from using the VECP on the instant  contract. In service contracts, the instant unit cost reduction is  normally equal to the number of hours per line-item task saved by using  the VECP on the instant contract, multiplied by the appropriate contract  labor rate.</p><p class="depth2">Negative instant contract savings means the increase in the instant  contract cost or price when the acceptance of a VECP results in an  excess of the contractor's allowable development and implementation  costs over the product of the instant unit cost reduction multiplied by  the number of instant contract units affected.</p><p class="depth2">Net acquisition savings means total acquisition savings, including  instant, concurrent, and future contract savings, less Government costs.</p><p class="depth2">Sharing base means the number of affected end items on contracts of  the contracting office accepting the VECP.</p><p class="depth2">Sharing period means the period beginning with acceptance of the  first unit incorporating the VECP and ending at a calendar date or event  determined by the contracting officer for each VECP.</p><p class="depth2">Unit means the item or task to which the contracting officer and the  contractor agree the VECP applies.</p><p class="depth2">Value engineering proposal means, in connection with an A-E  contract, a   change proposal developed by employees of the Federal Government or  contractor value engineering personnel under contract to an agency to  provide value engineering services for the contract or program.
