                                Sec. 204.22  Submitting a request for a fire management assistance
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The Governor of a State, or the Governor's Authorized Representative  (GAR), may submit a request for a fire management assistance  declaration. The request must be submitted while the fire is burning  uncontrolled and threatens such destruction as would constitute a major  disaster. The request must be submitted to the Regional Administrator  and should address the relevant criteria listed in Sec. 204.21, with  supporting documentation that contains factual data and professional  estimates on the fire or fire complex. To ensure that FEMA can process a  State's request for a fire management assistance declaration as  expeditiously as possible, the State   should transmit the request by telephone, promptly followed by written  documentation.
