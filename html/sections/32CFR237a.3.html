Such understanding can be achieved by (1) wide dissemination of information to the business community, consistent with national security, and (2) cooperation with industry in public relations activities which are not contrary to the national or DoD interests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As outlined in part 237 of this subchapter, DoD components shall cooperate with industry at local and regional levels. However, they will notify the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Public Affairs) (ASD(PA)) promptly of any local or regional activity which has the potential of being escalated, or which has been escalated by unforeseen circumstances, to national or international interest.</p>
