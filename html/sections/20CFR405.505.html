                            <p class="depth0">If you have received our final decision, you may request that we  extend the time for seeking judicial review in a Federal district court.  Your request must be in writing and explain why the action was not  filed, or cannot be filed, on time. You must file your request with the  Appeals Council. If you show that you have good cause for missing the  deadline, we will extend the time period. We will use the standards in  Sec. 405.20 of this part to determine if you have good cause for an  extension of time.  [71 FR 16446, Mar. 31, 2006, as amended at 76 FR 24810, May 3, 2011]</p>
