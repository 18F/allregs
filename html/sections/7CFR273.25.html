                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Simplified Food Stamp Program (SFSP) means a program authorized  under 7 U.S.C. 2035.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) means a State  program of family assistance operated by an eligible State under its  TANF plan as defined at 45 CFR 260.30.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Pure-TANF household means a household in which all members  receive assistance under a State program funded under part A of title IV  of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Mixed-TANF household means a household in which 1 or more  members, but not all members, receive assistance under a State program  funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.  601 et seq.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Assistance under a State program funded under part A of title IV  of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) means ``assistance''  as defined in regulations at 45 CFR 260.31.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Limit on benefit reduction for mixed-TANF households under the  SFSP. If a State agency chooses to operate an SFSP and includes mixed- TANF households in its program, the following requirements apply in  addition to the statutory requirements governing the SFSP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a State's SFSP reduces benefits for mixed-TANF households,  then no more than 5 percent of these participating households can have  benefits reduced by 10 percent of the amount they are eligible to  receive under the regular FSP and no mixed-TANF household can have  benefits reduced by 25 percent or more of the amount it is eligible to  receive under the regular FSP. Reductions of $10 or less will be  disregarded when applying this requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The State must include in its State SFSP plan an analysis  showing the impact its program has on benefit levels for mixed-TANF  households by comparing the allotment amount such households would  receive using the rules and procedures of the State's SFSP with the  allotment amount these households would receive if certified under  regular Food Stamp Program rules and showing the number of households  whose allotment amount would be reduced by 9.99 percent or less, by 10  to 24.99 percent, and by 25 percent or more, excluding those households  with reductions of $10 or less. In order for FNS to accurately evaluate  the program's impact, States must describe in detail the methodology  used as the basis for this analysis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To ensure compliance with the benefit reduction requirement once  an SFSP is operational, States must describe in their plan and have  approved by FNS a methodology for measuring benefit reductions for  mixed-TANF households on an on-going basis throughout the duration of  the SFSP. In addition, States must report to FNS on a periodic basis the  amount of benefit loss experienced by mixed-TANF households  participating in the State's SFSP. The frequency of such reports will be  determined by FNS taking into consideration such factors as the number  of mixed-TANF households participating in the SFSP and the amount of  benefit loss attributed to these households through initial or on-going  analyses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Application processing standards. Under statutory requirements,  a household is not eligible to participate in an SFSP unless it is  receiving TANF assistance. If a household is not receiving TANF  assistance (payments have not been authorized) at the time of its  application for the SFSP, the State agency must process the application  using   the regular Food Stamp Program requirements of Sec. 273.2, including  processing within the 30-day regular or 7-day expedited time frame, and  screening for and provision of expedited service if eligible. The State  agency must determine under regular food stamp rules the eligibility and  benefits of any household that it has found ineligible for TANF  assistance because of time limits, more restrictive resource standards,  or other rules that do not apply to food stamps.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Standards for shelter costs. Legislation governing the SFSP  requires that State plans must address the needs of households with high  shelter costs relative to their income. If a State chooses to  standardize shelter costs under the SFSP, it must, therefore, use  multiple standards that take into consideration households with high  shelter costs versus those with low shelter costs. A State is prohibited  from using a single standard based on average shelter costs for all  households participating in an SFSP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Opportunity for public comment. States must provide an  opportunity for public input on proposed SFSP plans (with special  attention to changes in benefit amounts that are necessary in order to  ensure that the overall proposal not increase Federal costs) through a  public comment period, public hearings, or meetings with groups  representing participants' interests. Final approval will be given after  the State informs the Department about the comments received from the  public. After the public comment period, the State agency must inform  the Department about the comments received from the public and submit  its final SFSP plan for Departmental approval.
