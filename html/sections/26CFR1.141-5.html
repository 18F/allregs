                                Sec. 1.141-5  Private loan financing test.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Bonds of an issue are private activity bonds if more  than the lesser of 5 percent or $5 million of the proceeds of the issue  is to be used (directly or indirectly) to make or finance loans to  persons other than governmental persons. Section 1.141-2(d) applies in  determining whether the private loan financing test is met. In  determining whether the proceeds of an issue are used to make or finance  loans, indirect, as well as direct, use of the proceeds is taken into  account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Measurement of test. In determining whether the private loan  financing test is met, the amount actually loaned to a nongovernmental  person is not discounted to reflect the present value of the loan  repayments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definition of private loan--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Any transaction that  is generally characterized as a loan for federal income tax purposes is  a loan for purposes of this section. In addition, a loan may arise from  the direct lending of bond proceeds or may arise from transactions in  which indirect benefits that are the economic equivalent of a loan are  conveyed. Thus, the determination of whether a loan is made depends on  the substance of a transaction rather than its form. For example, a  lease or other contractual arrangement (for example, a management  contract or an output contract) may in substance constitute a loan if  the arrangement transfers tax ownership of the facility to a  nongovernmental person. Similarly, an output contract or a management  contract with respect to a financed facility generally is not treated as  a loan of proceeds unless the agreement in substance shifts significant  burdens and benefits of ownership to the nongovernmental purchaser or  manager of the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Application only to purpose investments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A loan  may be either a purpose investment or a nonpurpose investment. A loan  that is a nonpurpose investment does not cause the private loan  financing test to be met. For example, proceeds invested in loans, such  as obligations of the United States, during a temporary period, as part  of a reasonably required reserve or replacement fund, as part of a  refunding escrow, or as part of a minor portion (as each of those terms  are defined in Sec. 1.148-1 or Sec. 1.148-2) are generally not treated  as loans under the private loan financing test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certain prepayments treated as loans. Except as otherwise  provided, a prepayment for property or services, including a prepayment  for property or services that is made after the date that the contract  to buy the property or services is entered into, is treated as a loan  for purposes of the private loan financing test if a principal purpose  for prepaying is to provide a benefit of tax-exempt financing to the  seller. A prepayment is not treated as a loan for purposes of the  private loan financing test if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Prepayments on substantially the same terms are made by a  substantial percentage of persons who are similarly situated to the  issuer but who are not beneficiaries of tax-exempt financing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The prepayment is made within 90 days of the reasonably expected  date of delivery to the issuer of all of the   property or services for which the prepayment is made; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The prepayment meets the requirements of Sec. 1.148- 1(e)(2)(iii)(A) or (B) (relating to certain prepayments to acquire a  supply of natural gas or electricity).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Customary prepayments. The determination of whether a  prepayment satisfies paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section is  generally made based on all the facts and circumstances. In addition, a  prepayment is deemed to satisfy paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section  if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The prepayment is made for--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Maintenance, repair, or an extended warranty with respect to  personal property (for example, automobiles or electronic equipment); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Updates or maintenance or support services with respect to  computer software; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The same maintenance, repair, extended warranty, updates or  maintenance or support services, as applicable, are regularly provided  to nongovernmental persons on the same terms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Additional prepayments as permitted by the Commissioner. The  Commissioner may, by published guidance, set forth additional  circumstances in which a prepayment is not treated as a loan for  purposes of the private loan financing test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Grants--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A grant of proceeds is not a loan.  Whether a transaction may be treated as a grant or a loan depends on all  of the facts and circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Tax increment financing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Generally, a grant  using proceeds of an issue that is secured by generally applicable taxes  attributable to the improvements to be made with the grant is not  treated as a loan, unless the grantee makes any impermissible agreements  relating to the payment that results in the taxes imposed on that  taxpayer not to be treated as generally applicable taxes under Sec.  1.141-4(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Amount of loan. If a grant is treated as a loan under this  paragraph (c)(3), the entire grant is treated as a loan unless the  impermissible agreement is limited to a specific portion of the tax. For  this purpose, an arrangement with each unrelated grantee is treated as a  separate grant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> applies only if those payments do not  secure the payment of principal of, or interest on, the bonds (directly  or indirectly), under the terms of the bonds and those payments are not  taken into account under the private payment test pursuant to Sec.  1.141-4(f)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Tax assessment loan exception--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. For purposes of  this section, a tax assessment loan that satisfies the requirements of  this paragraph (d) is not a loan for purposes of the private loan  financing test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Tax assessment loan defined. A tax assessment loan is a loan  that arises when a governmental person permits or requires property  owners to finance any governmental tax or assessment of general  application for an essential governmental function that satisfies each  of the requirements of paragraphs (d) (3) through (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Mandatory tax or other assessment. The tax or assessment must be  an enforced contribution that is imposed and collected for the purpose  of raising revenue to be used for a specific purpose (that is, to defray  the capital cost of an improvement). Taxes and assessments do not  include fees for services. The tax or assessment must be imposed  pursuant to a state law of general application that can be applied  equally to natural persons not acting in a trade or business and persons  acting in a trade or business. For this purpose, taxes and assessments  that are imposed subject to protest procedures are treated as enforced  contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Specific essential governmental function--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A  mandatory tax or assessment that gives rise to a tax assessment loan  must be imposed for one or more specific, essential governmental  functions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, commercial or industrial facilities and improvements to  property owned by a nongovernmental person do not serve an essential  governmental  function. Permitting installment payments of property taxes or other  taxes is not an essential governmental function.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Equal basis requirement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Owners of both business  and nonbusiness property benefiting from the financed improvements must  be eligible, or required, to make deferred payments of the tax or  assessment giving rise to a tax assessment loan on an equal basis (the  equal basis requirement). A tax or assessment does not satisfy the equal  basis requirement if the terms for payment of the tax or assessment are  not the same for all taxed or assessed persons. For example, the equal  basis requirement is not met if certain property owners are permitted to  pay the tax or assessment over a period of years while others must pay  the entire tax or assessment immediately or if only certain property  owners are required to prepay the tax or assessment when the property is  sold.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> General rule for guarantees. A guarantee of debt service on  bonds, or of taxes or assessments, by a person that is treated as a  borrower of bond proceeds violates the equal basis requirement if it is  reasonable to expect on the date the guarantee is entered into that  payments will be made under the guarantee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Coordination with private business tests. See Sec. Sec. 1.141-3  and 1.141-4 for rules for determining whether tax assessment loans cause  the bonds financing those loans to be private activity bonds under the  private business use and the private security or payment tests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Turnkey contract not treated as a loan. State agency Z  and federal agency H will each contribute to rehabilitate a project  owned by Z. H can only provide its funds through a contribution to Z to  be used to acquire the rehabilitated project on a turnkey basis from an  approved developer. Under H's turnkey program, the developer must own  the project while it is rehabilitated. Z issues its notes to provide  funds for construction. A portion of the notes will be retired using the  H contribution, and the balance of the notes will be retired through the  issuance by Z of long-term bonds. Z lends the proceeds of its notes to  Developer B as construction financing and transfers title to B for a  nominal amount. The conveyance is made on condition that B rehabilitate  the property and reconvey it upon completion, with Z retaining the right  to force reconveyance if these conditions are not satisfied. B must name  Z as an additional insured on all insurance. Upon completion, B must  transfer title to the project back to Z at a set price, which price  reflects B's costs and profit, not fair market value. Further, this  price is adjusted downward to reflect any cost-underruns. For purposes  of section 141(c), this transaction does not involve a private loan.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Essential government function requirement not met. City D  creates a special taxing district consisting of property owned by  nongovernmental persons that requires environmental clean-up. D imposes  a special tax on each parcel within the district in an amount that is  related to the expected environmental clean-up costs of that parcel. The  payment of the tax over a 20-year period is treated as a loan by the  property owners for purposes of the private loan financing test. The  special district issues bonds, acting on behalf of D, that are payable  from the special tax levied within the district, and uses the proceeds  to pay for the costs of environmental clean-up on the property within  the district. The bonds meet the private loan financing test because  more than 5 percent of the proceeds of the issue are loaned to  nongovernmental persons. The issue does not meet the tax assessment loan  exception because the improvements to property owned by a  nongovernmental person are not an essential governmental function under  section   141(c)(2). The issue also meets the private business tests of section  141(b).  [T.D. 8712, 62 FR 2296, Jan. 16, 1997, as amended by T.D. 9085, 68 FR  45775, Aug. 4, 2003]</p>
