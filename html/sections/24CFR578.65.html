                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The collaborative applicant for a Continuum may apply to HUD to have the Continuum be designated a high-performing community (HPC). The designation shall be for grants awarded in the same competition in which the designation is applied for and made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applying for HPC designation. The application must be submitted at such time and in such manner as HUD may require, must use HMIS data where required to show the standards for qualifying are met, and must contain such information as HUD requires, including at a minimum:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A report showing how the Continuum of Care program funds received in the preceding year were expended;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A specific plan for how grant funds will be expended; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Information establishing that the Continuum of Care meets the standards for HPCs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Standards for qualifying as an HPC. To qualify as an HPC, a Continuum must demonstrate through:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reliable data generated by the Continuum of Care's HMIS that it meets all of the following standards:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Mean length of homelessness. Either the mean length of episode of homelessness within the Continuum's geographic area is fewer than 20 days, or the mean length of episodes of homelessness for individuals or families in similar circumstances was reduced by at least 10 percent from the preceding federal fiscal year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Reduced recidivism. Of individuals and families who leave homelessness, less than 5 percent become homeless again at any time within the next 2 years; or the percentage of individuals and families in similar circumstances who become homeless again within 2 years after leaving homelessness was decreased by at least 20 percent from the preceding federal fiscal year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> HMIS coverage. The Continuum's HMIS must have a bed coverage rate of 80 percent and a service volume coverage rate of 80 percent as calculated in accordance with HUD's HMIS requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Serving families and youth. With respect to Continuums that served homeless families and youth defined as homeless under other federal statutes in paragraph (3) of the definition of homeless in Sec.  576.2:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> 95 percent of those families and youth did not become homeless again within a 2-year period following termination of assistance; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> 85 percent of those families achieved independent living in permanent housing for at least 2 years following termination of assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reliable data generated from sources other than the Continuum's HMIS that is provided in a narrative or other form prescribed by HUD that it meets both of the following standards:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Community action. All the metropolitan cities and counties within the Continuum's geographic area have a comprehensive outreach plan, including specific steps for identifying homeless persons and referring them to appropriate housing and services in that geographic area.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Renewing HPC status. If the Continuum was designated an HPC in the previous federal fiscal year and used Continuum of Care grant funds for activities described under Sec.  578.71, that such activities were effective at reducing the number of individuals and families who became homeless in that community.</p>
