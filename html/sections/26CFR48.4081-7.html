                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Overview. This section provides reporting requirements and other  conditions that a person paying tax to the government under section 4081  must satisfy to receive a refund (but not a credit) under section  4081(e) with respect to taxable fuel on which a prior tax was paid to  the government under section 4081. No credit against any tax imposed  under the Internal Revenue Code is allowed under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Conditions to allowance of refund. A claim for refund of tax  imposed by section 4081 with respect to taxable fuel is allowed under  section 4081(e) and this section only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A tax imposed by section 4081 with respect to the taxable fuel  was paid to the government and not credited or refunded (the ``first  tax'');</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> After imposition of the first tax, another tax was imposed by  section 4081 with respect to the same taxable fuel and was also paid to  the government (the ``second tax'');</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The person that paid the second tax to the government has filed  a timely claim for refund that contains the information required under  paragraph (d) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The person that paid the first tax to the government has met the  reporting requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reporting requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Reporting by persons paying the  first tax. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the  person that paid the first tax under Sec. 48.4081-3 (the first  taxpayer) must file a report that is in substantially the same form as  the model report provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section (or such  other model report as the Commissioner may prescribe) and contains all  information necessary to complete such model report (the first  taxpayer's report). A first taxpayer's report must be filed with the  return to which the report relates (or at such other time, or in such  other manner, as prescribed by the Commissioner).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Model first taxpayer's report.</p><p class="depth0">First Taxpayer's Report  1.______________________________________________________________________   ________________________________________________________________________  First Taxpayer's name, address, and employer identification number  2.______________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________  Name, address, and employer identification number of the buyer of the  taxable fuel subject to tax  3.______________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Date and location of removal, entry, or sale  4.______________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Volume and type of taxable fuel removed, entered, or sold  5.

Paragraph (c)(1)  of this section does not apply with respect to a tax imposed under Sec.  48.4081-2 (removal at a terminal rack), Sec. 48.4081-3(c)(1)(ii)  (nonbulk entries into the United States), or Sec. 48.4081-3(g)  (removals or sales by blenders). However, if the person liable for the  tax expects that another tax will be imposed under section 4081 with  respect to the taxable fuel, that person should (but is not required to)  file a first taxpayer's report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Information provided to subsequent owners, etc.--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> By person  required to file first taxpayer's report. A first taxpayer required to  file a first taxpayer's report under paragraph (c)(1) of this section  must give a copy of the report to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The person to whom the first taxpayer sells (within the meaning  of Sec. 48.4081-1)) the taxable fuel within the bulk transfer/terminal  system; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The owner of the taxable fuel immediately before the imposition  of the first tax, if the first taxpayer is not the owner at that time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> By person filing optional first taxpayer's report. A first  taxpayer filing a first taxpayer's report under paragraph (c)(3) of this  section should (but is not required to) give a copy of the report to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The person to whom the first taxpayer sells the taxable fuel; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The owner of the taxable fuel immediately before the imposition  of the first tax, if the first taxpayer is not the owner at that time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> By person receiving first taxpayer's report. A person that  receives a copy of the first taxpayer's report and subsequently sells  (within the meaning of Sec. 48.4081-1)) the taxable fuel within the  bulk transfer/terminal system must give the copy and a statement that  satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section to  the buyer. A person that receives a copy of the first taxpayer's report  and subsequently sells the taxable fuel outside the bulk transfer/ terminal system should (but is not required to) give the copy and a  statement that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of  this section to the buyer, if that person expects that another tax will  be imposed under section 4081 with respect to the taxable fuel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Form of statement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. A statement satisfies the  requirements of this paragraph (c)(4)(iv) if it is provided at the  bottom or on the back of the copy of the first taxpayer's report (or in  an attached document). This statement must contain all information  necessary to complete the model statement provided in paragraph  (c)(4)(iv)(B) of this section (or such other model statement as the  Commissioner may prescribe) but need not be in the same format.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Model statement describing subsequent sale.</p><p class="depth0">Statement of Subsequent Seller  1.______________________________________________________________________  ________________________________________________________________________  Name, address, and employer identification number of seller in  subsequent sale  2.______________________________________________________________________  ________________________________________________________________________  Name, address, and employer identification number of buyer in subsequent  sale  3.______________________________________________________________________  Date and location of subsequent sale  4.______________________________________________________________________  Volume and type of taxable fuel sold</p><p class="depth0">The undersigned seller (the ``Seller'') has received the copy of the  first taxpayer's report provided with this statement in connection with  Seller's purchase of the taxable fuel described in this statement.</p><p class="depth0">Under penalties of perjury, Seller declares that Seller has examined  this statement, including any accompanying schedules and statements,  and, to the best of Seller's knowledge and belief, they are true,  correct and complete.  ________________________________________________________________________  Signature and date signed  ________________________________________________________________________  Printed or typed name of person signing this statement  ________________________________________________________________________  Title</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Sale to multiple buyers. If the first taxpayer's report relates  to taxable fuel divided among more than one buyer, multiple copies of  the first taxpayer's report must be made at the stage that the taxable  fuel is divided and each buyer must be given a copy of the report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Form and content of claim--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The following rules  apply to claims for refund under section 4081(e):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The claim must be made by the person that paid the second tax to  the government and must include all the information described in  paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The claim must be made on Form 8849 (or such other form as the  Commissioner may designate) in accordance with the instructions on the  form. The form should be marked Section 4081(e) Claim at the top.  Section 4081(e) claims must not be included with a claim for a refund  under any other provision of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Information to be included in the claim. Each claim for a refund  under section 4081(e) must contain the following information with  respect to the taxable fuel covered by the claim:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Volume and type of taxable fuel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Date on which the claimant incurred the tax liability to which  this claim relates (the second tax).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Amount of second tax that claimant paid to the government and  a statement that claimant has not included the amount of this tax in the  sales price of the taxable fuel to which this claim relates and has not  collected that amount from the person that bought the taxable fuel from  claimant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Name, address, and employer identification number of the person  that paid the first tax to the government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A copy of the first taxpayer's report that relates to the  taxable fuel covered by the claim.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> If the taxable fuel covered by the claim was bought other than  from the first taxpayer, a copy of the statement of subsequent seller  that the claimant received with respect to that taxable fuel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em>  may be filed any time after the claimant has filed the return of the  second tax and before the end of the period prescribed by section 6511  for the filing of a claim for a refund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A is a taxable fuel registrant that owns 10,000  gallons of gasoline, and on April 5, 1996, is transporting the gasoline  by barge on a waterway in the United States. That day, A sells the  gasoline to B, a person that is not a taxable fuel registrant. A is  liable for tax on the sale under Sec. 48.4081-3(f). A pays this tax to  the government and attaches to its return of the gasoline tax for the  2nd quarter of 1996 the first taxpayer's report described in paragraph  (c) of this section. A also gives a copy of this report to B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On April 9, 1996, B sells the gasoline to C, a taxable fuel  registrant. B also gives C a copy of the first taxpayer's report and the  statement of subsequent seller (required under paragraph (c)(4) of this  section). On April 14, 1996, the gasoline is removed from a terminal at  the rack. C is the position holder of the gasoline at the time of the  removal and thus is liable for tax on the removal   under Sec. 48.4081-2(c)(1). C pays this tax to the government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> After C has filed a return of the second tax and before the  end of the period prescribed by section 6511 for filing a claim for a  refund, C files a claim for a refund of the second tax. The claim is in  the form prescribed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. C includes with  its claim a copy of the first taxpayer's report and statement of  subsequent seller. Because the conditions to allowance of a refund under  paragraph (b) of this section have been met, C is allowed a refund of  the second tax.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that A does  not pay the tax to the government. Because the first tax was not paid to  the government as required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the  conditions to allowance of a refund under paragraph (b) of this section  have not been met. Therefore, C is not allowed a refund of the second  tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Effective date. This section is effective in the case of taxable  fuel with respect to which the first tax is imposed after September 30,  1995.  [T.D. 8421, 57 FR 32424, July 22, 1992, as amended by T.D. 8609, 60 FR  40086, Aug. 7, 1995; T.D. 8659, 61 FR 10457, Mar. 14, 1996; T.D. 8879,  65 FR 17157, Mar. 31, 2000]</p>
