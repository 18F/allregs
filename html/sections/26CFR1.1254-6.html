                            <p class="depth0">Sections 1.1254-1 through 1.1254-3 and Sec. 1.1254-5 are effective  with respect to any disposition of natural resource recapture property  occurring after March 13, 1995. The rule in Sec. 1.1254- 1(b)(2)(iv)(A)(2), relating to a nonoperating mineral interest carved  out of an operating mineral interest with respect to which an  expenditure has been deducted, is effective with respect to any  disposition occurring after March 13, 1995 of property (within the  meaning of section 614) that is placed in service by the taxpayer after  December 31, 1986. Section 1.1254-4 applies to dispositions of natural  resource recapture property by an S corporation (and a corporation that  was formerly an S corporation) and dispositions of S corporation stock  occurring on or after October 10, 1996. Sections 1.1254-2(d)(1)(ii) and  1.1254-3 (b)(1) (i) and (ii) and (d)(1) (i) and (ii) are effective for  dispositions of property occurring on or after October 10, 1996.  [T.D. 8586, 60 FR 2508, Jan. 10, 1995, as amended by T.D. 8684, 61 FR  53066, Oct. 10, 1996]    Sec. 1.1256(e)-1  Identification of hedging transactions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification and recordkeeping requirements. Under section  1256(e)(2), a taxpayer that enters into a hedging transaction must  identify the transaction as a hedging transaction before the close of  the day on which the taxpayer enters into the transaction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requirements for identification. The identification of a hedging  transaction for purposes of section 1256(e)(2) must satisfy the  requirements of Sec. 1.1221-2(f)(1). Solely for purposes of section  1256(f)(1), however, an identification that does not satisfy all of the  requirements of Sec. 1.1221-2(f)(1) is nevertheless treated as an  identification under section 1256(e)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Consistency with Sec. 1.1221-2. Any identification for purposes  of Sec. 1.1221-2(f)(1) is also an identification for purposes of this  section. If a taxpayer satisfies the requirements of Sec. 1.1221- 2(g)(1)(ii), the transaction is treated as if it were not identified as  a hedging transaction for purposes of section 1256(e)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective date. The rules of this section apply to transactions  entered into on or after March 20, 2002.  [T.D. 8985, 67 FR 12870, Mar. 20, 2002; 67 FR 31955, May 13, 2002]</p>
