                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Analyzers. Analyze measured gases with the following  instruments:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Carbon monoxide (CO) analysis. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The carbon monoxide analyzer  must be of the non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) absorption type.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The use of linearizing circuits is permitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Carbon dioxide (CO2) analysis. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The carbon dioxide  analyzer must be of the non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) absorption type.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The use of linearizing circuits is permitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Oxygen (O2) analysis. Oxygen (O2)  analyzers may be of the paramagnetic (PMD), zirconia (ZRDO) or  electrochemical type (ECS).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Hydrocarbon (HC) analysis. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For Raw Gas Sampling, the  hydrocarbon analyzer must be of the heated flame ionization (HFID) type.  For constant volume sampling, the hydrocarbon analyzer may be of the  flame ionization (FID) type or of the heated flame ionization (HFID)  type.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For the HFID system, if the temperature of the exhaust gas at  the sample probe is below 190 C, the temperature of the valves, pipe  work, and so forth, must be controlled so as to maintain a wall  temperature of 190 [11 C. If the temperature of the exhaust gas at the  sample probe is above 190 C, the temperature of the valves, pipe work,  and so forth, must be controlled so as to maintain a wall temperature  greater than 180 C.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For the HFID analyzer, the detector, oven, and sample-handling  components within the oven must be suitable for continuous operation at  temperatures to 200 C. It must by capable of maintaining temperature  within [5.5 C of the set point.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Fuel and burner air must conform to the specifications in  Sec. 91.312.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The percent of oxygen interference must be less than three  percent, as specified in Sec. 91.316(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Oxides of nitrogen (NOX) analysis. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> This analysis  device consists of the following items:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A NO2 to NO converter. The NO2 to NO  converter efficiency must be at least 90 percent.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> An ice bath located after the NOX converter  (optional).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A chemiluminescent detector (CLD) or heated chemiluminescent  detector (HCLD).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The quench interference must be less than three percent as  measured in Sec. 91.325.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Other gas analyzers yielding equivalent results may be used with  advance approval of the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The following requirements must be incorporated as indicated in  systems used for testing under this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide measurements must be made on  a dry basis (for raw exhaust measurement only). Specific requirements  for the means of drying the sample can be found in Sec. 91.313(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Calibration or span gases for the NOX measurement  system must pass through the NO2 to NO converter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of the equipment must be  on a level as to minimize additional errors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Gas drying. Chemical dryers are not an acceptable method of  removing water from the sample. Water removal by condensation is  acceptable. If water is removed by condensation, the sample gas  temperature or sample dew point must be monitored either within the  water trap or downstream and its temperature must not exceed 7 C. A  water trap performing this function is an acceptable method. Means other  than condensation may be used only with prior approval from the  Administrator.</p>
