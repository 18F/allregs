                            <p class="depth0">For each month the market administrator shall compute a producer price differential per hundredweight. The report of any handler who has not made payments required pursuant to Sec. 1033.71 for the preceding month shall not be included in the computation of the producer price differential, and such handler's report shall not be included in the computation for succeeding months until the handler has made full payment of outstanding monthly obligations. Subject to the conditions of this paragraph, the market administrator shall compute the producer price differential in the following manner:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to Sec. 1033.60 for all handlers required to file reports prescribed in Sec. 1033.30;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Subtract the total values obtained by multiplying each handler's total pounds of protein, other solids, and butterfat contained in the milk for which an obligation was computed pursuant to Sec. 1033.60 by the protein price, the other solids price, and the butterfat price, respectively, and the total value of the somatic cell adjustment pursuant to Sec. 1033.30(a)(1) and (c)(1);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Add an amount equal to the minus location adjustments and subtract an amount equal to the plus location adjustments computed pursuant to Sec. 1033.75;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Add an amount equal to not less than one-half of the unobligated balance in the producer-settlement fund;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Divide the resulting amount by the sum of the following for all handlers included in these computations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The total hundredweight of producer milk; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The total hundredweight for which a value is computed pursuant to Sec. 1033.60(i); and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Subtract not less than 4 cents nor more than 5 cents from the price computed pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.
