While conducting VFR operations, the pilot in command  must ensure that all terrain and obstacles along the route of flight are  cleared vertically by no less than the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 300 feet for day operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 500 feet for night operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Rerouting the planned flight path. A pilot in command may  deviate from the planned flight path for reasons such as weather  conditions or operational considerations. Such deviations do not relieve  the pilot in command of the weather requirements or the requirements for  terrain and obstacle clearance contained in this part and in part 91 of  this chapter. Rerouting, change in destination, or other changes to the  planned flight that occur while the helicopter is on the ground at an  intermediate stop require evaluation of the new route in accordance with  paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Operations manual.
