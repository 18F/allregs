                                Sec. 250.404  Serving as director of member bank and corporation
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Board recently considered the question whether section 32 of the Banking Act of 1933 (12 U.S.C. 78) would be applicable to the service of a director of a corporation which planned to acquire or organize, as proceeds from the sale of stock became available, subsidiaries to operate in a wide variety of fields, including manufacturing, foreign trade, leasing of heavy equipment, and real estate development. The corporation had a paid-in capital of about $60,000 and planned to sell additional shares at a price totaling $10 million, with the proviso that if less than $3 million worth were sold by March 1962, the funds subscribed would be refunded. It thus appeared to be contemplated that the sale of stock would take at least a year, and there appeared to be no reason for believing that, if the venture proved successful, additional shares would not be offered so that the corporation could continue to expand.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Board concluded that section 32 would be applicable, stating that although Sec. 218.102, as clarified by Sec. 218.104, related to closed-end investment companies, the rationale of that interpretation is applicable to corporations generally.
