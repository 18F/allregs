                                Sec. 393.13  Retroreflective sheeting and reflex reflectors, requirements
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. All trailers and semitrailers manufactured prior  to December 1, 1993, which have an overall width of 2,032 mm (80 inches)  or more and a gross vehicle weight rating of 4,536 kg (10,001 pounds) or  more, except trailers that are manufactured exclusively for use as  offices or dwellings, pole trailers (as defined in Sec. 390.5 of this  subchapter), and trailers transported in a driveaway-towaway operation,  must be equipped with retroreflective sheeting or an array of reflex  reflectors that meet the requirements of this section. Motor carriers  operating trailers, other than container chassis (as defined in Sec.  393.5), have until June 1, 2001, to comply with the requirements of this  section. Motor carriers operating container chassis have until December  1, 2001, to comply with the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Retroreflective sheeting and reflex reflectors. Motor carriers  are encouraged to retrofit their trailers with a conspicuity system that  meets all of the requirements applicable to trailers manufactured on or  after December 1, 1993, including the use of retroreflective sheeting or  reflex reflectors in a red and white pattern (see Federal Motor Vehicle  Safety Standard No. 108 (49 CFR 571.108), S5.7, Conspicuity systems).  Motor carriers which do not retrofit their trailers to meet the  requirements of FMVSS No. 108, for example by using an alternative color  pattern, must comply with the remainder of this paragraph and with  paragraph (c) or (d) of this section. Retroreflective sheeting or reflex  reflectors in colors or color combinations other than red and white may  be used on the sides or lower rear area of the semitrailer or trailer  until June 1, 2009. The alternate color or color combination must be  uniform along the sides and lower rear area of the trailer. The  retroreflective sheeting or reflex reflectors on the upper rear area of  the trailer must be white and conform to the requirements of FMVSS No.  108 (S5.7). Red retroreflective sheeting or reflex reflectors shall not  be used along the sides of the trailer unless it is used as part of a  red and white pattern. Retroreflective sheeting shall have a width of at  least 50 mm (2 inches).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Locations for retroreflective sheeting--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sides.  Retroreflective sheeting shall be applied to each side of the trailer or  semitrailer. Each strip of retroreflective sheeting shall be positioned  as horizontally as practicable, beginning and ending as close to the  front and rear as practicable. The strip need not be continuous but the  sum of the length of all of the segments shall be at least half of the  length of the trailer and the spaces between the segments of the strip  shall be distributed as evenly as practicable. The centerline for each  strip of retroreflective sheeting shall be between 375 mm (15 inches)  and 1,525 mm (60 inches) above the road surface when measured with the  trailer empty or unladen, or as close as practicable to this area. If  necessary to clear rivet heads or other similar obstructions, 50 mm (2  inches) wide retroreflective sheeting may be separated into two 25 mm (1  inch) wide strips of the same length and color, separated by a space of  not more than 25 mm (1 inch).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Lower rear area. The rear of each trailer and semitrailer must  be equipped with retroreflective sheeting. Each strip of retroreflective  sheeting shall be positioned as horizontally as practicable, extending  across the full width of the trailer, beginning and ending as close to  the extreme edges as practicable. The centerline for each of the strips  of retroreflective sheeting shall be between 375 mm (15 inches) and  1,525 mm (60 inches) above the road surface when measured with the  trailer empty or unladen, or as close as practicable to this area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upper rear area. Two pairs of white strips of retroreflective  sheeting, each pair consisting of strips 300 mm (12 inches) long, must  be positioned horizontally and vertically on the right and left upper  corners of the rear of the body of each trailer and semitrailer, as  close as practicable to the top of the trailer and as far apart as  practicable. If the perimeter of the body, as viewed from the rear, is  not square or rectangular, the strips may be applied along the  perimeter, as close as practicable to the uppermost and outermost areas   of the rear of the body on the left and right sides.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Locations for reflex reflectors--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sides. Reflex reflectors  shall be applied to each side of the trailer or semitrailer. Each array  of reflex reflectors shall be positioned as horizontally as practicable,  beginning and ending as close to the front and rear as practicable. The  array need not be continuous but the sum of the length of all of the  array segments shall be at least half of the length of the trailer and  the spaces between the segments of the strip shall be distributed as  evenly as practicable. The centerline for each array of reflex  reflectors shall be between 375 mm (15 inches) and 1,525 mm (60 inches)  above the road surface when measured with the trailer empty or unladen,  or as close as practicable to this area. The center of each reflector  shall not be more than 100 mm (4 inches) from the center of each  adjacent reflector in the segment of the array. If reflex reflectors are  arranged in an alternating color pattern, the length of reflectors of  the first color shall be as close as practicable to the length of the  reflectors of the second color.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Lower rear area. The rear of each trailer and semitrailer must  be equipped with reflex reflectors. Each array of reflex reflectors  shall be positioned as horizontally as practicable, extending across the  full width of the trailer, beginning and ending as close to the extreme  edges as practicable. The centerline for each array of reflex reflectors  shall be between 375 mm (15 inches) and 1,525 mm (60 inches) above the  road surface when measured with the trailer empty or unladen, or as  close as practicable to this area. The center of each reflector shall  not be more than 100 mm (4 inches) from the center of each adjacent  reflector in the segment of the array.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upper rear area. Two pairs of white reflex reflector arrays,  each pair at least 300 mm (12 inches) long, must be positioned  horizontally and vertically on the right and left upper corners of the  rear of the body of each trailer and semitrailer, as close as  practicable to the top of the trailer and as far apart as practicable.  If the perimeter of the body, as viewed from the rear, is not square or  rectangular, the arrays may be applied along the perimeter, as close as  practicable to the uppermost and outermost areas of the rear of the body  on the left and right sides. The center of each reflector shall not be  more than 100 mm (4 inches) from the center of each adjacent reflector  in the segment of the array.
