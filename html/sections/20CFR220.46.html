                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Acceptable sources. The Board needs reports about the claimant's  impairment(s) from acceptable medical sources. Acceptable medical  sources are--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Licensed physicians;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Licensed osteopaths;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Licensed or certified psychologists;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Licensed optometrists for the measurement of visual acuity and  visual fields (a report from a physician may be needed to determine  other aspects of eye diseases); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Persons authorized to furnish a copy or summary of the records  of a medical facility. Generally, the copy or   summary should be certified as accurate by the custodian or by any  authorized employee of the Railroad Retirement Board, Social Security  Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, or State agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Medical reports. Medical reports should include--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Medical history;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Clinical findings (such as the results of physical or mental  status examinations);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Laboratory findings (such as blood pressure, x-rays);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Diagnosis (statement of disease or injury based on its signs and  symptoms);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Treatment prescribed, with response to treatment and prognosis;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Statements about what the claimant can still do despite his  or her impairment(s) based on the medical source's findings on the  factors under paragraph (b)(1) through (5) of this section (except in  disability claims for remarried widow's and surviving divorced spouses).  (See Sec. 220.112).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Statements about what the claimant can still do (based on the  medical source's findings on the factors under paragraph (b)(1) through  (5) of this section) should describe--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The medical source's opinion about the claimant's ability,  despite his or her impairment(s), to do work-related activities such as  sitting, standing, moving about, lifting, carrying, handling objects,  hearing, speaking, and traveling; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In cases of mental impairment(s), the medical source's opinion  about the claimant's ability to reason or make occupational, personal,  or social adjustments. (See Sec. 220.112).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Completeness. The medical evidence, including the clinical and  laboratory findings, must be complete and detailed enough to allow the  Board to make a determination about whether or not the claimant is  disabled. It must allow the Board to determine--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The nature and limiting effects of the claimant's impairment(s)  for any period in question;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The probable duration of the claimant's impairment(s); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The claimant's residual functional capacity to do work-related  physical and mental activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Evidence from physicians. A statement by or the opinion of the  claimant's treating physician will not determine whether the claimant is  disabled. However, the medical evidence provided by a treating physician  will be considered by the Board in making a disability decision. A  treating physician is a doctor to whom the claimant has been going for  treatment on a continuing basis. The claimant may have more than one  treating physician. The Board may use consulting physicians or other  medical consultants for specialized examinations or tests, to obtain  more complete evidence, and to resolve any conflicts. A consulting  physician is a doctor (often a specialist) to whom the claimant is  referred for an examination once or on a limited basis. (See Sec.  220.50 for an explanation of when the Board may request a consultative  examination.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Information from other sources. Information from other sources  may also help the Board understand how an impairment affects the  claimant's ability to work. Other sources include--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Public and private social welfare agencies;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Observations by nonmedical sources;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other practitioners (for example, naturopaths, chiropractors,  audiologists, etc.); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Railroad and nonrailroad employers.
