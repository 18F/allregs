This requirement  shall apply to a service provider's existing numbering resources as well  as any new numbering resources it obtains in the future.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A service provider that opens an uncontaminated thousands-block  prior to assigning all available telephone numbers within an opened  thousands-block should be prepared to demonstrate to the state  commission:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A genuine request from a customer detailing the specific need  for telephone numbers; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The service provider's inability to meet the specific customer  request for telephone numbers from the available numbers within the  service provider's opened thousands-blocks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon a finding by a state commission that a service provider  inappropriately assigned telephone numbers from an uncontaminated  thousands-block, the NANPA or the Pooling Administrator shall suspend  assignment or allocation of any additional numbering resources to that  service provider in the applicable NPA until the service provider  demonstrates that it does not have sufficient numbering resources to  meet a specific customer request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Numbering audits. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All telecommunications service providers  shall be subject to ``for cause'' and random audits to verify carrier  compliance with Commission regulations and applicable industry  guidelines relating to numbering administration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Enforcement Bureau will oversee the conduct and scope of all  numbering audits conducted under the Commission's jurisdiction, and  determine the audit procedures necessary to perform the audit.
