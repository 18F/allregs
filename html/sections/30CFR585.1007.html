BOEM will specify a time period  for members of the public to express competitive interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If we receive indications of competitive interest within the  published timeframe, we will proceed with a competitive offering. As  part of such competitive offering, each competing applicant must submit  a description of the types of activities proposed for the existing  facility, as well as satisfactory evidence that the competing applicant  qualifies to hold a lease or grant on the OCS, as required in Sec. Sec.   585.106 and 585.107, by a date we specify. We may request additional  information from competing applicants, as necessary, to adequately  evaluate the competing proposals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> We will evaluate all competing proposals to determine whether:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The proposed activities are compatible with existing activities  at the facility; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> We have the expertise and resources available to regulate the  activities effectively.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> We will evaluate all proposals under the requirements of NEPA,  CZMA, and other applicable laws.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Following our evaluation, we will select one or more acceptable  proposals for activities involving the alternate use of an existing OCS  facility, notify the competing applicants, and submit each acceptable  proposal to the lessee and owner of the existing OCS facility. If the  lessee and owner of the facility agree to accept a proposal, we will  proceed to issue an Alternate Use RUE. If the lessee and owner of the  facility are unwilling to accept any of the proposals that we deem  acceptable, we will not issue an Alternate Use RUE.    Sec.
