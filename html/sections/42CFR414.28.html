For calendar years 1993 through 1995, the CF for  each year is equal to the CF for the previous year, adjusted in  accordance with Sec. 414.30. Beginning January 1, 1996, the CF for each  calendar year may be further adjusted so that adjustments to the fee  schedule in accordance with section 1848(c)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act do not  cause total expenditures under the fee schedule to differ by more than  $20 million from the amount that would have been spent if these  adjustments had not been made.
