The detailed statement must indicate:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Income from all sources;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Assets;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Liabilities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Number of dependents;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Expenses for food, housing, clothing, and transportation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Medical expenses; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Exceptional expenses, if any.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Evaluation of request. FHFA shall evaluate the statement and supporting documents and determine whether the original offset or repayment schedule

imposes extreme financial hardship on the employee, for example, by preventing the employee from meeting essential subsistence expenses such as food, housing, clothing, transportation, and medical care. FHFA shall notify the employee in writing within 30 calendar days of such determination, including, if appropriate, a revised offset or payment schedule. If the special review results in a revised offset or repayment schedule, FHFA shall provide a new certification to the paying agency.</p>
