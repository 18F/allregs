Such payments are wages, however, if they are for  coverage for an employee who was separated from employment prior to  January 1, 1989, if the payments are for any period for which the  employee is reemployed by the employer (or successor of that employer)  after the date of separation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Payments to you or your dependents under your employer's plan at  or after the termination of your employment relationship because of your  death or retirement for disability are excluded from wages.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Payments made after 1983 to you or your dependents under your  employer's plan at or after the termination of your employment  relationship because of retirement after reaching an age specified in  the plan or in a pension plan of the employer are not excluded from  wages unless--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The payments are to or from a trust or annuity plan of your  employer as described in Sec. 404.1052; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An agreement to retire was in effect on March 24, 1983, between  you and your employer and the payments made after 1983 under a  nonqualified deferred compensation plan (see Sec. 404.1042(f)) are based  on services performed for your employer before 1984.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The plan or system established by the employer must provide for  the employees generally or for a class or classes of employees.
