                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, whenever  livestock or live poultry is bought, sold, acquired, paid, or settled on  a weight basis, or whenever the weight of feed is a factor in  determining payment or settlement to a livestock grower or poultry  grower by a stockyard owner, market agency, dealer, packer, or live  poultry dealer when livestock or poultry is produced under a growing  arrangement, payment or settlement shall be on the basis of the actual  weight of the livestock, live poultry, and/or feed shown on the scale  ticket. If the actual weight used is not obtained on the date and at the  place of transfer of possession, this information shall be disclosed  with the date and location of the weighing on the accountings, bills, or  statements issued. Any adjustment to the actual weight shall be fully  and accurately explained on the accountings, bills, or statements  issued, and records shall be maintained to support such adjustment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Whenever the weight of feed is a factor in determining payment  or settlement to such livestock grower or poultry grower when the  livestock or poultry is produced under a livestock   or poultry growing arrangement, any feed that is picked up from or  returned by a livestock grower or poultry grower must be weighed or its  weight must be reasonably determined. When feed is picked up or returned  and not weighed, the stockyard owner, market agency, dealer, packer, or  live poultry dealer must document that the method used reasonably  determines weight and is mutually acceptable to it and the livestock  grower or poultry grower. The stockyard owner, market agency, dealer,  packer, or live poultry dealer must document and account for the picked  up or returned feed weight.
