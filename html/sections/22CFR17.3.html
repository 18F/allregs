                            <p class="depth0">A recipient of an overpayment is without fault if he or she  performed no act of commission or omission that resulted in the  overpayment. The fact that the Department of State or other   agency may have been at fault in initiating an overpayment will not  necessarily relieve the individual from liability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Considerations. Pertinent considerations in finding fault are--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether payment resulted from the individual's incorrect but not  necessarily fraudulent statement, which he/she should have known to be  incorrect;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether payment resulted from the individual's failure to  disclose material facts in his/her possession which he/she should have  known to be material; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether he/she accepted a payment which he/she knew or should  have known to be erroneous.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Mitigation factors. The individual's age, physical and mental  condition or the nature of the information supplied to him or her by the  Department of State or a Federal agency may mitigate against finding  fault if one or more contributed to his or her submission of an  incorrect statement, a statement which did not disclose material facts  in his or her possession, or his or her acceptance of an erroneous  overpayment.</p>
