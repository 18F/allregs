                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The standard that must be used to determine whether the  individual employee is exempt is that his primary duty must be the range  production of livestock and that this duty necessitates his constant  attendance on the range, on a standby basis, for such periods of time so  as to make the computation of hours worked extremely difficult. The fact  that an employee generally returns to his place of residence at the end  of each day would not affect the application of the exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Thus, exempt work must be performed away from the  ``headquarters.'' The headquarters is not, however, to be confused with  the ``headquarters ranch.'' The term headquarters has reference to the  place for the transaction of the business of the ranch (administrative  center), as distinguished from buildings or lots used for convenience  elsewhere. It is a particular location for the discharge of the  management duties. Accordingly, the term ``headquarters'' would not  embrace large acreage, but only the ranchhouse, barns, sheds, pen,  bunkhouse, cookhouse, and other buildings in the vicinity. The balance  of the ``headquarters ranch'' would be the ``range.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Furthermore, the legislative history indicates that this  exemption was not intended to apply to feed lots or to any area where  the stock involved would be near headquarters. Its sponsors stated that  the exemption would apply only to those employees principally engaged in  activities which require constant attendance on a standby basis, away  from headquarters, such as herding, where the computation of hours  worked would be extremely difficult. Such constant surveillance of  livestock that graze and reproduce on range lands is necessary to see  that the animals receive adequate care, water, salt, minerals, feed  supplements, and protection from insects, parasites, disease, predators,  adverse weather, etc.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The man-days of labor of employees principally engaged in the  range production of livestock, even though the employees are exempt from  the wage and hour requirements of the Act, are included in the  employer's man-day count for purposes of application of section  13(a)(6)(A). Thus, if a cattle rancher in a particular calendar quarter  uses 200 man-days of such range production labor and 400 man-days of  agricultural labor performed by individuals not so engaged, he is  required to pay the minimum wage to the latter employees in the  following year.</p>
