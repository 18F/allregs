                                Sec. 412.101  Special treatment: Inpatient hospital payment
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. Beginning in FY 2011, the terms used in this  section are defined as follows:</p><p class="depth2">Medicare discharges means discharge of inpatients entitled to  Medicare Part A, including discharges associated with individuals whose  inpatient benefits are exhausted or whose stay was not covered by  Medicare and also discharges of individuals enrolled in a MA  organization under Medicare Part C.</p><p class="depth2">Road miles means ``miles'' as defined in Sec. 412.92(c)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General considerations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> CMS provides an additional payment  to a qualifying hospital for the higher incremental costs associated  with a low volume of discharges. The amount of any additional payment  for a qualifying hospital is calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In order to qualify for this adjustment, a hospital must meet  the following criteria:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For FY 2005 through FY 2010 and FY 2018 and subsequent fiscal  years, a hospital must have fewer than 200 total discharges, which  includes Medicare and non-Medicare discharges, during the fiscal year,  based on the hospital's most recently submitted cost report, and be  located more than 25 road miles (as defined in paragraph (a) of this  section) from the nearest ``subsection (d)'' (section 1886(d) of the  Act) hospital.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For FY 2011 through FY 2017, a hospital must have fewer than  1,600 Medicare discharges, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section,  during the fiscal year, based on the hospital's Medicare discharges from  the most recently available MedPAR data as determined by CMS, and be  located more than 15 road miles, as defined in paragraph (a) of this  section, from the nearest ``subsection (d)'' (section 1886(d) of the  Act) hospital.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In order to qualify for the adjustment, a hospital must provide  its fiscal intermediary or Medicare administrative contractor with  sufficient evidence that it meets the distance requirement specified  under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The fiscal intermediary or  Medicare administrative contractor will base its determination of  whether the distance requirement is satisfied upon the evidence  presented by the hospital and other relevant evidence, such as maps,  mapping software, and inquiries to State and local police,  transportation officials, or other government officials.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determination of the adjustment amount. The low-volume  adjustment for hospitals that qualify under paragraph (b) of this  section is as follows for the applicable fiscal year:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For FY 2005 through FY 2010 and FY 2018 and subsequent fiscal  years, the adjustment is an additional 25 percent for each Medicare  discharge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For FY 2011 through FY 2017, the adjustment is as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For low-volume hospitals with 200 or fewer Medicare discharges  (as defined in paragraph (a) of this section), the adjustment is an  additional 25 percent for each Medicare discharge.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Eligibility of new hospitals for the adjustment. For FYs 2005  through 2010 and FY 2018 and subsequent fiscal years, a new hospital  will be eligible for a low-volume adjustment under this section once it  has submitted a cost report for a cost reporting period that indicates  that it meets discharge requirements during the applicable fiscal year  and has provided its Medicare administrative contractor with sufficient  evidence that it meets the distance requirement, as specified under  paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
