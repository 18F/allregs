                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Reporting. The facts concerning any final conviction for any violation of 18 U.S.C. 201-224 involving or relating to agency contracts shall be reported promptly to the agency head or designee for that official's consideration. The agency head or designee shall promptly notify the Civil Division, Department of Justice, that an action is being considered under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Decision. Following an assessment of the facts, the agency head or designee may declare void and rescind contracts with respect to which a final conviction has been entered, and recover the amounts expended and the property transferred by the agency under the terms of the contracts involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Decision-making process. Agency procedures governing the voiding and rescinding decision-making process shall be as informal as is practicable, consistent with the principles of fundamental fairness. As a minimum, however, agencies shall provide the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A notice of the proposed action to declare void and rescind the contract shall be made in writing and sent by certified mail, return receipt requested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A thirty calendar day period after receipt of the notice, for the contractor to submit pertinent information before any final decision is made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon request made within the period for submission of pertinent information, an opportunity shall be afforded for a hearing at which witnesses may be presented, and any witness the agency presents may be confronted.

However, no inquiry shall be made regarding the validity of a conviction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the agency head or designee decides to declare void and rescind the contracts involved, that official shall issue a written decision which--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> States that determination;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Reflects consideration of the fair value of any tangible benefits received and retained by the agency; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> States the amount due, and the property to be returned, to the agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notice of proposed action. The notice of the proposed action, as a minimum shall--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Advise that consideration is being given to declaring void and rescinding contracts awarded by the agency, and recovering the amounts expended and property transferred therefor, under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 218;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specifically identify the contracts affected by the action;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specifically identify the offense or final conviction on which the action is based;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> State the amounts expended and property transferred under each of the contracts involved, and the money and the property demanded to be returned;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Identify any tangible benefits received and retained by the agency under the contract, and the value of those benefits, as calculated by the agency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Advise that pertinent information may be submitted within 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice, and that, if requested within that time, a hearing shall be held at which witnesses may be presented and any witness the agency presents may be confronted; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Advise that action shall be taken only after the agency head or designee issues a final written decision on the proposed action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Final agency decision. The final agency decision shall be based on the information available to the agency head or designee, including any pertinent information submitted or, if a hearing was held, presented at the hearing. If the agency decision declares void and rescinds the contract, the final decision shall specify the amounts due and property to be returned to the agency, and reflect consideration of the fair value of any tangible benefits received and retained by the agency. Notice of the decision shall be sent promptly by certified mail, return receipt requested. Rescission of contracts under the authority of the Act and demand for recovery of the amounts expended and property transferred therefor, is not a claim within the meaning of 41 U.S.C. chapter 71, Contract Disputes, or part 33. Therefore, the procedures required by the statute and the FAR for the issuance of a final contracting officer decision are not applicable to final agency decisions under this subpart, and shall not be followed.
