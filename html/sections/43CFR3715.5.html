In all uses  and occupancies, you must prevent or avoid ``unnecessary or undue  degradation'' of the public lands and resources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Your uses must conform to all applicable federal and state  environmental standards and you must have obtained all required permits  before beginning, as required under 43 CFR part 3800. This means getting  permits and authorizations and meeting standards required by state and  federal law, including, but not limited to, the Clean Water Act (33  U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), and the  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.), as  required under 43 CFR part 3800.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Your occupancies must conform to all applicable federal and  state environmental standards and you must have obtained all required  permits before beginning, as required under this subpart and 43 CFR part  3800. This means getting permits and authorizations and meeting  standards required by state and federal law, including, but not limited  to, the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), Clean Air Act (42  U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (42  U.S.C. 6901 et seq.), as required under this subpart and 43 CFR part  3800.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If your prospecting or exploration activities involve only  surface activities, you must not place permanent structures on the  public lands. Any temporary structures you place on the public lands  during prospecting or exploration will be allowed only for the duration  of the activities, unless BLM expressly and in writing allows them to  remain longer. If your prospecting or exploration activities involve  subsurface activities, you may place permanent structures on the public  lands, if BLM concurs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> All permanent and temporary structures you place on the public  lands must conform with the applicable state or local building, fire,  and electrical codes, and occupational safety and health and mine safety  standards. If state or local codes require, you must obtain a  certificate of occupancy or its equivalent before you begin use or  occupancy involving permanent structures. If state or local law  requires, you must also acquire appropriate sewerage and sanitation  permits before the occupancy or use of a permanent structure placed on  the public lands.</p>
