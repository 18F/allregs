This procedure can be used to determine  capture efficiency for partially controlled spray booths (e.g.,  automated spray zones controlled and manual spray zones not controlled)  and for fully controlled spray booths.</p><p class="depth0">1.2 Principle.</p><p class="depth0">1.2.1 The volatile organic compounds (VOC) associated with the  coating solids deposited on a part (or panel) in a controlled spray  booth zone (or group of contiguous controlled spray booth zones)  partition themselves between the VOC that volatilize in the controlled  spray booth zone (principally between the spray gun and the part) and  the VOC that remain on the part (or panel) when the part (or panel)  leaves the controlled spray booth zone. For solvent-borne coatings  essentially all of the VOC associated with the coating solids deposited  on a part (or panel) in a controlled spray booth zone that volatilize in  the controlled spray booth zone pass through the waterwash and are  exhausted from the controlled spray booth zone to the control device.</p><p class="depth0">1.2.2 The VOC associated with the overspray coating solids in a  controlled spray booth zone partition themselves between the VOC that  volatilize in the controlled spray booth zone and the VOC that are still  tied to the overspray coating solids when the overspray coating solids  hit the waterwash. For solvent-borne coatings almost all of the VOC  associated with the overspray coating solids that volatilize in the  controlled spray booth zone pass through the waterwash and are exhausted  from the controlled spray booth zone to the control device. The exact  fate of the VOC still tied to the overspray coating solids when the  overspray coating solids hit the waterwash is unknown. This procedure  assumes that none of the VOC still tied to the overspray coating solids  when the overspray coating solids hit the waterwash are captured and  delivered to the control device. Much of this VOC may become entrained  in the water along with the overspray coating solids. Most of the VOC  that become entrained in the water along with the overspray coating  solids leave the water, but the point at which this VOC leave the water  is unknown. Some of the VOC still tied to the overspray coating solids  when the overspray coating solids hit the waterwash may pass through the  waterwash and be exhausted from the controlled spray booth zone to the  control device.</p><p class="depth0">1.2.3 This procedure assumes that the portion of the VOC associated  with the overspray coating solids in a controlled spray booth zone that  volatilizes in the controlled spray booth zone, passes through the  waterwash and is exhausted from the controlled spray booth zone to the  control device is equal to the portion of the VOC associated with the  coating solids deposited on a part (or panel) in that controlled spray  booth zone that volatilizes in the controlled spray booth zone, passes  through the waterwash, and is exhausted from the controlled spray booth  zone to the control device. This assumption is equivalent to treating  all of the coating solids sprayed in the controlled spray booth zone as  if they are deposited coating solids (i.e., assuming 100 percent  transfer efficiency) for purposes of using a panel test to determine  spray booth capture efficiency.</p><p class="depth0">1.2.4 This is a conservative (low) assumption for the portion of the  VOC associated with the overspray coating solids in a controlled spray  booth zone that volatilizes in the controlled spray booth zone. Thus,  this assumption results in an underestimate of conservative capture  efficiency. The overspray coating solids have more travel time and  distance from the spray gun to the waterwash than the deposited coating  solids have between the spray gun and the part (or panel). Therefore,  the portion of the VOC associated with the overspray coating solids in a  controlled spray booth zone that volatilizes in the controlled spray  booth zone should be greater than the portion of the VOC associated with  the coating solids deposited on a part (or panel) in that controlled  spray booth zone that volatilizes in that controlled spray booth zone.</p><p class="depth0">1.3 Summary of Procedure.</p><p class="depth0">1.3.1 A panel test is performed to determine the mass of VOC that  remains on the panel when the panel leaves a controlled spray booth  zone. The total mass of VOC associated with the coating solids deposited  on the panel is calculated.</p><p class="depth0">1.3.2 The percent of the total VOC associated with the coating  solids deposited on the panel in the controlled spray booth zone that  remains on the panel when the panel leaves the controlled section of the  spray booth is then calculated from the ratio of the two previously  determined masses. The percent of the total VOC associated with the  coating solids deposited on the panel in the controlled spray booth zone  that is captured and delivered to the control device equals 100 minus  this percentage. (The mass of VOC associated with the coating solids  deposited on the panel which is volatilized and captured in the  controlled spray booth zone equals the difference between the total mass  of VOC associated with the coating solids deposited on the panel and the  mass of VOC remaining with the coating solids deposited on the panel  when the panel leaves the controlled spray booth zone.)</p><p class="depth0">1.3.3 The percent of the total VOC associated with the coating  sprayed in the controlled spray booth zone that is captured and  delivered to the control device is assumed to be equal to the percent of  the total VOC associated with the coating solids deposited on the panel  in the controlled spray booth zone that is captured and delivered to the  control device. The percent of the total VOC associated with the coating  sprayed in the entire spray booth that is captured and delivered to the  control device can be calculated by multiplying the percent of the total  VOC associated with the coating sprayed in the controlled spray booth  zone that is captured and   delivered to the control device by the fraction of coating sprayed in  the spray booth that is sprayed in the controlled spray booth zone.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Procedure.</p><p class="depth0">2.1 You may conduct panel testing to determine the capture  efficiency of spray booth emissions. You must follow the instructions  and calculations in this appendix A, and use the panel testing  procedures in ASTM Method D5087-02, ``Standard Test Method for  Determining Amount of Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Released from  Solventborne Automotive Coatings and Available for Removal in a VOC  Control Device (Abatement)'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  63.14), or the guidelines presented in ``Protocol for Determining Daily  Volatile Organic Compound Emission Rate of Automobile and Light-Duty  Truck Topcoat Operations,'' EPA-450/3-88-018 (Docket ID No. OAR-2002- 0093 and Docket ID No. A-2001-22). You must weigh panels at the points  described in section 2.5 of this appendix A and perform calculations as  described in sections 3 and 4 of this appendix A. You may conduct panel  tests on the production paint line in your facility or in a laboratory  simulation of the production paint line in your facility.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 You may conduct panel testing on representative coatings as  described in ``Protocol for Determining Daily Volatile Organic Compound  Emission Rate of Automobile and Light-Duty Truck Topcoat Operations,''  EPA-450/3-88-018 (Docket ID No. OAR-2002-0093 and Docket ID No. A-2001- 22). If you panel test representative coatings, then you may calculate  either a unique percent capture efficiency value for each coating  grouped with that representative coating, or a composite percent capture  efficiency value for the group of coatings. If you panel test each  coating, then you must convert the panel test result for each coating to  a unique percent capture efficiency value for that coating.</p><p class="depth0">2.3 Identification of Controlled Spray Booth Zones.</p><p class="depth0">You must identify each controlled spray booth zone or each group of  contiguous controlled spray booth zones to be tested. (For example, a  controlled bell zone immediately followed by a controlled robotic zone.)  Separate panel tests are required for non-contiguous controlled spray  booth zones. The flash zone between the last basecoat zone and the first  clearcoat zone makes these zones non-contiguous.</p><p class="depth0">2.4 Where to Apply Coating to the Panel.</p><p class="depth0">If you are conducting a panel test for a single controlled spray  booth zone, then you must apply coating to the panel only in that  controlled spray booth zone. If you are conducting a panel test for a  group of contiguous controlled spray booth zones, then you must apply  coating to the panel only in that group of contiguous controlled spray  booth zones.</p><p class="depth0">2.5 How to Process and When to Weigh the Panel.</p><p class="depth0">The instructions in this section pertain to panel testing of  coating, i, or of the coating representing the group of coatings that  includes coating, i.</p><p class="depth0">2.5.1 You must weigh the blank panel. (Same as in bake oven panel  test.) The mass of the blank panel is represented by Wblank,i  (grams).</p><p class="depth0">2.5.2 Apply coating, i, or the coating representing coating, i, to  the panel in the controlled spray booth zone or group of contiguous  controlled spray booth zones being tested (in plant test), or in a  simulation of the controlled spray booth zone or group of contiguous  controlled spray booth zones being tested (laboratory test).</p><p class="depth0">2.5.3 Remove and weigh the wet panel as soon as the wet panel leaves  the controlled spray booth zone or group of contiguous controlled spray  booth zones being tested. (Different than bake oven panel test.) This  weighing must be conducted quickly to avoid further evaporation of VOC.  The mass of the wet panel is represented by Wwet,i (grams).</p><p class="depth0">2.5.4 Return the wet panel to the point in the coating process or  simulation of the coating process where it was removed for weighing.</p><p class="depth0">2.5.5 Allow the panel to travel through the rest of the coating  process in the plant or laboratory simulation of the coating process.  You must not apply any more coating to the panel after it leaves the  controlled spray booth zone (or group of contiguous controlled spray  booth zones) being tested. The rest of the coating process or simulation  of the coating process consists of:</p><p class="depth0">2.5.5.1 All of the spray booth zone(s) or simulation of all of the  spray booth zone(s) located after the controlled spray booth zone or  group of contiguous controlled spray booth zones being tested and before  the bake oven where the coating applied to the panel is cured,</p><p class="depth0">2.5.5.2 All of the flash-off area(s) or simulation of all of the  flash-off area(s) located after the controlled spray booth zone or group  of contiguous controlled spray booth zones being tested and before the  bake oven where the coating applied to the panel is cured, and</p><p class="depth0">2.5.5.3 The bake oven or simulation of the bake oven where the  coating applied to the panel is cured.</p><p class="depth0">2.5.6 After the panel exits the bake oven, you must cool and weigh  the baked panel.
