To demonstrate that a control device meets the required control efficiency, a design evaluation must address the composition and HAP concentration of the vent stream entering the control device. A design evaluation also must address other vent stream characteristics and control device operating parameters as specified in any one of paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (vii) of this section, depending on the type of control device that is used. If the vent stream is not the only inlet to the control device, the efficiency demonstration also must consider all other vapors, gases, and liquids, other than fuels, received by the control device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For an enclosed combustion device used to comply with the provisions of Sec.  63.1362(b)(2)(iv), (b)(4)(ii), (c)(2)(iv)(B), or (c)(3) with a minimum residence time of 0.5 seconds and a minimum temperature of 760 C, the design evaluation must document that these conditions exist.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For a combustion control device that does not satisfy the criteria in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the design evaluation must document control efficiency and address the following characteristics, depending on the type of control device:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For a thermal vapor incinerator, the design evaluation must consider the autoignition temperature of the organic HAP, must consider the vent stream flow rate, and must establish the design minimum and average temperature in the combustion zone and the combustion zone residence time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For a catalytic vapor incinerator, the design evaluation must consider the vent stream flow rate and must establish the design minimum and average temperatures across the catalyst bed inlet and outlet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For a boiler or process heater, the design evaluation must consider the vent stream flow rate, must establish the design minimum and average flame zone temperatures and combustion zone residence time, and must describe the method and location where the vent stream is introduced into the flame zone.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For a condenser, the design evaluation must consider the vent stream flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature, and must establish the maximum temperature of the condenser exhaust vent stream and the corresponding outlet organic HAP compound concentration level or emission rate for which the required reduction is achieved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For a carbon adsorption system that regenerates the carbon bed directly onsite in the control device such as a fixed-bed adsorber, the design evaluation must consider the vent stream flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature, and must establish the design exhaust vent stream organic

compound concentration level, adsorption cycle time, number of carbon beds and their capacities, type and working capacity of activated carbon used for the carbon beds, design total regeneration stream mass or volumetric flow over the period of each complete carbon bed regeneration cycle, design carbon bed temperature after regeneration, design carbon bed regeneration time, and design service life of carbon.

The TOC concentration or total organic HAP concentration is the sum of the concentrations of the individual components. If compliance is being determined based on TOC, the owner or operator shall compute TOC for each run using Equation 6 of this subpart. If compliance is being determined based on total organic HAP, the owner or operator shall compute total organic HAP using Equation 6 of this subpart, except that only organic HAP compounds shall be summed; when determining compliance with the wastewater provisions of Sec.  63.1362(d), the organic HAP compounds shall consist of the organic HAP compounds in Table 9 of subpart G of this part.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR20SE02.024

Initial compliance with the 20 ppmv TOC or total organic HAP concentration is demonstrated when the outlet TOC or total organic HAP concentration is 20 ppmv or less. Initial compliance with the 20 ppmv HCl and chlorine concentration is demonstrated when the outlet HCl and chlorine concentration is 20 ppmv or less. To demonstrate initial compliance, the operator shall use applicable test methods described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (9) of this section, and test under conditions described in paragraph (b)(10) or (11) of this section, as applicable. The owner or operator shall comply with the monitoring provisions in Sec.  63.1366(b)(1) through (5) on the initial compliance date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Outlet concentration correction for supplemental gases. If supplemental gases are added to a vent stream for which compliance with an outlet concentration standard in Sec.  63.1362 or 63.1363 will be demonstrated, the owner or operator must correct the outlet concentration as specified in paragraphs (a)(7)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Combustion device.

When testing is conducted to measure emissions from an affected source, the test methods specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (9) of this section shall be used. Compliance and performance tests shall be performed under such conditions as the Administrator specifies to the owner or operator based on representative performance of the affected source for the period being tested and as specified in paragraphs (b)(10) and (11) of this section. Representative conditions exclude periods of startup and shutdown unless specified by the Administrator or an applicable subpart. The owner or operator may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. The owner or operator must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Method 1 or 1A of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 shall be used for sample and velocity traverses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 shall be used for velocity and volumetric flow rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Method 3 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 shall be used for gas analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Method 4 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 shall be used for stack gas moisture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Concentration measurements shall be adjusted to negate the dilution effects of introducing nonaffected gaseous streams into the vent streams prior to control or measurement.

For the purpose of using Method 8260 or 8270 to comply with this subpart, the owner or operator must maintain a formal quality assurance program consistent with either Section 8 of Method 8260 or Method 8270. This program must include the elements related to measuring the concentrations of volatile compounds that are specified in paragraphs (b)(8)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Documentation of site-specific procedures to minimize the loss of compounds due to volatilization, biodegradation, reaction, or sorption during the sample collection, storage, and preparation steps.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Documentation of specific quality assurance procedures followed during sampling, sample preparation, sample introduction, and analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Measurement of the average accuracy and precision of the specific procedures, including field duplicates and field spiking of the material source before or during sampling with compounds having similar chemical characteristics to the target analytes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Method 22 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 shall be used to determine visible emissions from flares.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Testing conditions for continuous processes. Testing of process vents on equipment operating as part of a continuous process shall consist of three one-hour runs. Gas stream volumetric flow rates shall be measured every 15 minutes during each 1-hour run. Organic HAP concentration shall be determined from samples collected in an integrated sample over the duration of each one-hour test run, or from grab samples collected simultaneously with the flow rate measurements (every 15 minutes). If an integrated sample is collected for laboratory analysis, the sampling rate shall be adjusted proportionally to reflect variations in flow rate. For continuous gas streams, the emission rate used to determine compliance shall be the average emission rate of the three test runs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Testing conditions for batch processes. Testing of emissions on equipment where the flow of gaseous emissions is intermittent (batch operations) shall be conducted at absolute peak-case conditions or hypothetical peak-case conditions, as specified in paragraphs (b)(11)(i) and (ii) of this section, respectively. Gas stream volumetric flow rates shall be measured at 15-minute intervals. Organic HAP, TOC, or HCl and chlorine concentration shall be determined from samples collected in an integrated sample over the duration of the test, or from grab samples collected simultaneously with the flow rate measurements (every 15 minutes). If an integrated sample is collected for laboratory analysis, the sampling rate shall be adjusted proportionally to reflect variations in flow rate. In all cases, a site-specific test plan shall be submitted to the Administrator for approval prior to testing in accordance with Sec.  63.7(c). The test plan shall include the emissions profile described in paragraph (b)(11)(iii) of this section. The term ``HAP mass loading'' as used in paragraphs (b)(11)(i) through (iii) of this section refers to the class of HAP,

either organic or HCl and chlorine, that the control device is intended to control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Absolute peak-case. If the most challenging conditions for the control device occur under maximum HAP load, the absolute peak-case conditions shall be characterized by the criteria presented in paragraph (b)(11)(i)(A) or (B) of this section. Otherwise, absolute peak-case conditions are defined by the conditions in paragraph (b)(11)(i)(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The period in which the inlet to the control device will contain at least 50 percent of the maximum HAP mass load that may be vented to the control device over any 8-hour period. An emission profile as described in paragraph (b)(11)(iii)(A) of this section shall be used to identify the 8-hour period that includes the maximum projected HAP load.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A 1-hour period of time in which the inlet to the control device will contain the highest hourly HAP mass loading rate that may be vented to the control device. An emission profile as described in paragraph (b)(11)(iii)(A) of this section shall be used to identify the 1-hour period of maximum HAP loading.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The period of time when a condition other than the maximum HAP load is most challenging for the control device. These conditions include, but are not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Periods when the streams contain the highest combined VOC and HAP hourly load, as described by the emission profiles in paragraph (b)(11)(iii) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Periods when the streams contain HAP constituents that approach the limits of solubility for scrubbing media; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Periods when the streams contain HAP constituents that approach the limits of adsorptivity for carbon adsorption systems.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Hypothetical peak-case. Hypothetical peak-case conditions are simulated test conditions that, at a minimum, contain the highest total average hourly HAP load of emissions that would be predicted to be vented to the control device from the emissions profile described in either paragraph (b)(11)(iii)(B) or (C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Emissions profile. The owner or operator may choose to perform tests only during those periods of the peak-case episode(s) that the owner or operator selects to control as part of achieving the required emission reduction. Except as specified in paragraph (b)(11)(iii)(D) of this section, the owner or operator shall develop an emission profile for the vent to the control device that describes the characteristics of the vent stream at the inlet to the control device under either absolute or hypothetical peak-case conditions. The emissions profile shall be developed based on the applicable procedures described in paragraphs (b)(11)(iii)(A) through (C) of this section, as required by paragraphs (b)(11)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Emissions profile by process. The emissions profile must consider all emission episodes that could contribute to the vent stack for a period of time that is sufficient to include all processes venting to the stack and shall consider production scheduling. The profile shall describe the HAP load to the device that equals the highest sum of emissions from the episodes that can vent to the control device during the period of absolute peak-case conditions specified in paragraph (b)(11)(i)(A), (B), or (C) as appropriate. Emissions per episode shall be calculated using the procedures specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. When complying with paragraph (b)(11)(i)(B) of this section, emissions per episode shall be divided by the duration of the episode if the duration of the episode is longer than 1 hour.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Emission profile by equipment. The emission profile must consist of emissions that meet or exceed the highest hourly HAP load that would be expected under actual processing conditions. The profile shall describe equipment configurations used to generate the emission events, volatility of materials processed in the equipment, and the rationale used to identify and characterize the emission events. The emissions may be based on using a compound more volatile than compounds actually used in the process(es), and the emissions may be generated from all equipment in the process(es) or only selected equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Emission profile by capture and control device limitation. The emission profile shall consider the capture and control system limitations and the highest hourly emissions that can be routed to the control device, based on maximum flow rate and concentrations possible because of limitations on conveyance and control equipment (e.g., fans, LEL alarms and safety bypasses).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Exemptions. The owner or operator is not required to develop an emission profile under the circumstances described in paragraph (b)(11)(iii)(D)(1) or (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If all process vents for a process are controlled using a control device or series of control devices that reduce HAP emissions by 98 percent or more, no other emission streams are vented to the control device when it is used to control emissions from the subject process, and the performance test is conducted over the entire batch cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If a control device is used to comply with the outlet concentration limit for process vent emission streams from a single process (but not necessarily all of the process vents from that process), no other emission streams are vented to the control device while it is used to control emissions from the subject process, and the performance test is conducted over the entire batch cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Test duration. Three runs, at a minimum of 1 hour each, are required for performance testing. When complying with a percent reduction standard, each test run may be a maximum of either 24 hours or the duration of the longest batch controlled by the control device, whichever is shorter, and each run must include the same absolute or hypothetical peak-case conditions, as defined in paragraph (b)(11)(i) or (ii) of this section. When complying with an outlet concentration limit, each run must include the same absolute or hypothetical peak-case conditions, as defined in paragraph (b)(11)(i) or (ii) of this section, and the duration of each run may not exceed the duration of the applicable peak-case condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Initial compliance with process vent provisions. The owner or operator of an affected source shall demonstrate compliance with the process vent standards in Sec.  63.1362(b) using the procedures described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Compliance with the process vent standards in Sec.  63.1362(b) shall be demonstrated in accordance with the provisions specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (viii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Initial compliance with the emission limit cutoffs in Sec.  63.1362(b)(2)(i) and (b)(4)(i) is demonstrated when the uncontrolled organic HAP emissions from the sum of all process vents within a process are less than or equal to 0.15 Mg/yr. Uncontrolled HAP emissions shall be determined using the procedures described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Initial compliance with the emission limit cutoffs in Sec.  63.1362(b)(3)(i) and (b)(5)(i) is demonstrated when the uncontrolled HCl and Cl2 emissions from the sum of all process vents within a process are less than or equal to 6.8 Mg/yr.
