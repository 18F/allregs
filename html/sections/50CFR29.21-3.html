                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where the land administered by the Secretary is owned in fee by  the United States and the right-of-way is compatible with the objectives  of the area, permit or easement may be approved and granted by the  Regional Director. Generally an easement or permit will be issued for a  term of 50 years or so long as it is used for the purpose granted, or  for a lesser term when considered appropriate. For rights-of-way granted  under authority of section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as  amended, for pipelines for the transportation of oil, natural gas,  synthetic liquid or gaseous fuels, or any refined product produced  therefrom, the grant may be for a term not to exceed 30 years and the  right-of-way may not exceed 50 feet, plus the area occupied by the  pipeline and its related facilities unless the Regional Director finds,  and records the reasons for his finding, that, in his judgment, a wider  right-of-way is necessary for operation and maintenance after  construction, or to protect the environment or public safety. Related  facilities include but are not limited to valves, pump stations,  supporting structures, bridges, monitoring and communication devices,  surge and storage tanks, terminals, etc. However, a temporary permit  supplementing a right-of-way may be granted for additional land needed  during construction, operation, maintenance, or termination of the  pipeline, or to protect the natural environment or public safety.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unless otherwise provided, no interest granted shall give the  grantee any right whatever to remove any material, earth, or stone for  construction or other purpose, except that stone or earth necessarily  removed from the right-of-way in the construction of a project may be  used elsewhere along the same right-of-way in the construction of the  same project.
