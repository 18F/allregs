                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Every manufacturer engaged in smelting or refining, or both, shall immediately notify the director of the port nearest which the plant is located of any material change in the character of the metal-bearing materials smelted or refined and of any change in the methods of smelting or refining. Each plant for which any of the deductions provided for in Chapter 26, Additional U.S. Note 1, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, is to be claimed shall maintain complete smelting and refining records showing the receipts and disposition of each shipment of materials received in the plant. If losses are to be claimed under paragraph (c) of said headnote, a record shall be kept which will become a part of the annual statement described in paragraph (b) of this section. These records shall be retained for a period of not less than 5 years. In the case of records forming the basis of such an annual statement, the period for retention shall run from the date of the related annual statement. All such records shall be made available to the port director for such inspection and verification as he may deem advisable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Every manufacturer engaged in smelting or refining, or both, must prepare and submit to the port director at the port nearest which the plant is located an annual statement for the fiscal year for the plant involved not later than 60 days after the termination of that fiscal year. The annual statement for the smelting or refining warehouse or both, shall be in lieu of the warehouse proprietors submission

The statement shall contain such further information concerning the quantities and kinds of metals and intermediary products produced at the plant as will show the wastage sustained in the smelting and refining operation.
