                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligibility. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any high seas fishing vessel of the United  States is eligible to receive a permit under this subpart, unless the  vessel was previously authorized to be used for fishing on the high seas  by a foreign nation, and--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The foreign nation suspended such authorization, because the  vessel undermined the effectiveness of international conservation and  management measures, and the suspension has not expired; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The foreign nation, within the 3 years preceding application  for a permit under this section, withdrew such authorization, because  the vessel undermined the effectiveness of international conservation  and management measures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The restrictions in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this  section do not apply if ownership of the vessel has changed since the  vessel undermined the effectiveness of international conservation and  management measures, and the new owner has provided sufficient evidence  to the Regional Administrator demonstrating that the owner and operator  at the time the vessel undermined the effectiveness of such measures has  no further legal, beneficial, or financial interest in, or control of,  the vessel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The restrictions in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this  section do not apply if it is determined by the Regional Administrator  that issuing a permit would not subvert the purposes of the Agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application forms. The owner or operator of a high seas fishing  vessel may apply for a permit under this subpart by completing an  application form. Applicants may obtain an application form from a  Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Application information. An applicant must submit a complete and  accurate permit application, signed by the owner or operator, to the  appropriate Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Fees. NMFS will charge a fee to recover the administrative  expenses of permit issuance. The amount of the fee will be determined in  accordance with the procedures of the NOAA Finance Handbook, available  from a Regional Administrator, for determining administrative costs of  each special product or service. The fee is specified with the  application form. The appropriate fee must accompany each application.  Failure to pay the fee will preclude issuance of the permit. Payment by  a   commercial instrument later determined to be insufficiently funded will  invalidate any permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Issuance. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part  904, the Regional Administrator will issue a permit, which will include  appropriate conditions or restrictions, within 30 days of receipt of a  completed application and payment of the appropriate fee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Regional Administrator will notify the applicant of any  deficiency in the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Validity. Permits issued under this subpart are valid for 5  years from the date of issuance. Renewal of a permit prior to its  expiration is the responsibility of the permit holder. For a permit to  remain valid to its expiration date, the vessel's USCG documentation or  state registration must be kept current. A permit issued under this  subpart is void when the name of the owner or vessel changes, or in the  event the vessel is no longer eligible for U.S. documentation, such  documentation is revoked or denied, or the vessel is removed from such  documentation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Change in application information. Any changes in vessel  documentation status or other permit application information must be  reported to the Regional Administrator in writing within 15 days of such  changes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Transfer. A permit issued under this subpart is not transferable  or assignable to another vessel or owner; it is valid only for the  vessel and owner to which it is issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Display. A valid permit, or a copy thereof, issued under this  subpart must be on board the vessel while operating on the high seas and  available for inspection by an authorized officer. Faxed copies of  permits are acceptable.  [61 FR 35550, July 5, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 15, Jan. 4, 1999]</p>
