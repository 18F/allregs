                                Sec.  102.44  Representatives of requesters.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Persons other than a requester (e.g., a lawyer, guardian, friend) may file a Request Package on a requester's behalf as his or her representative. A requester need not use the services of a lawyer to secure benefits under this Program. A representative (who does not need to be a lawyer) is only required, as described in this section, for requesters who are minors or legally incompetent adults. In the event that a representative files on behalf of a requester, the representative will be bound by the obligations and documentation requirements that apply to the requester (e.g., if a requester is required to submit employment records, the representative must file the requester's employment records). The representative must also satisfy the requirements specific to representatives set forth in this regulation. If a requester has a representative, all communications from the Secretary will be directed exclusively to the representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Representatives of legally competent adults. A requester who is a legally competent adult may use a representative to submit a Request Package on his or her behalf. In such circumstances, the requester must certify on the Request Form that he or she is authorizing the representative to pursue benefits under this Program on his or her behalf.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Representatives of minors and legally incompetent adults. A requester who is a minor or a legally incompetent adult must use a representative to pursue benefits under this Program on his or her behalf. In such circumstances, the representative must certify, in the place provided on the Request Form, that the requester is a minor or a legally incompetent adult and that the representative is filing on behalf of the requester. In addition, before the requester will be paid by the Program, the representative must submit the documentation described in Sec.  102.63.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No payment or reimbursement for representatives' fees or costs. The Act does not authorize the Secretary to pay, or reimburse for, any fees or costs associated with the requester's use of a personal representative under this Program, including those of an attorney.
