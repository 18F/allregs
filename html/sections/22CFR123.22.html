                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any export, as defined in this subchapter, of a defense article  controlled by this subchapter, to include defense articles transiting  the United States, requires the electronic reporting of export  information. The reporting of the export information shall be to the  U.S. Customs and Border Protection using the Automated Export System  (AES) or directly to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC).  Any license or other approval authorizing the permanent export of  hardware must be filed at a U.S. Port before any export. Licenses or  other approvals for the permanent export of technical data and defense  services shall be retained by the applicant who will send the export  information directly to DDTC. Temporary export or temporary import  licenses for such items need not be filed with the U.S. Customs and  Border Protection, but must be presented to the U.S. Customs and Border  Protection for decrementing of the shipment prior to departure and at  the time of entry. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection will only  decrement a shipment after the export information has been filed  correctly using the AES. Before the export of any hardware using an  exemption in this subchapter, the DDTC registered applicant/exporter, or  an agent acting on the filer's behalf, must electronically provide  export information using the AES (see paragraph (b) of this section). In  addition to electronically providing the export information to the U.S.  Customs and Border Protection before export, all the mandatory  documentation must be presented to the port authorities (e.g.,  attachments, certifications, proof of AES filing; such as the Internal  Transaction Number (ITN)). Export authorizations shall be filed,  retained, decremented or returned to DDTC as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Filing of licenses and documentation for the permanent export of  hardware. For any permanent export of hardware using a license (e.g.,  DSP-5, DSP-94) or an exemption in this subchapter, the exporter must,  prior to an AES filing, deposit the license and provide any required  documentation for the license or   the exemption with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, unless  otherwise directed in this subchapter (e.g., Sec. 125.9). If necessary,  an export may be made through a port other than the one designated on  the license if the exporter complies with the procedures established by  the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Presentation and retention by the applicant of temporary  licenses and related documentation for the export of unclassified  defense articles. Licenses for the temporary export or temporary import  of unclassified defense articles need not be filed with the U.S. Customs  and Border Protection, but must be retained by the applicant and  presented to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the time of  temporary import and temporary export. When a defense article is  temporarily exported from the United States and moved from one  destination authorized on a license to another destination authorized on  the same or another temporary license, the applicant, or an agent acting  on the applicant's behalf, must ensure that the U.S. Customs and Border  Protection decrements both temporary licenses to show the exit and entry  of the hardware.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Filing and reporting of export information--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Filing of export  information with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Before  exporting any hardware controlled by this subchapter, using a license or  exemption, the DDTC registered applicant/exporter, or an agent acting on  the filer's behalf, must electronically file the export information with  the U.S. Customs and Border Protection using the Automated Export System  (AES) in accordance with the following timelines:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Air or truck shipments. The export information must be  electronically filed at least 8 hours prior to departure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sea or rail Shipments. The export information must be  electronically filed at least 24 hours prior to departure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Emergency shipments of hardware that cannot meet the pre- departure filing requirements. U.S. Customs and Border Protection may  permit an emergency export of hardware by truck (e.g., departures to  Mexico or Canada) or air, by a U.S. registered person, when the exporter  is unable to comply with the Electronic Export Information (EEI) filing  timeline in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. The applicant, or an  agent acting on the applicant's behalf, in addition to providing the EEI  using the AES, must provide documentation required by U.S. Customs and  Border Protection and this subchapter. The documentation provided to  U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the port of exit must include the  Internal Transaction Number (ITN) for the shipment and a copy of a  notification to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls stating that  the shipment is urgent and must be accompanied by an explanation for the  urgency. The original of the notification must be immediately provided  to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. The AES filing of the  export information must be made at least two hours prior to any  departure by air from the United States. When shipping via ground, the  AES filing must be made at the time when the exporter provides the  articles to the carrier or at least one hour prior to departure from the  United States, when the permanent export of the hardware has been  authorized for export:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In accordance with Sec. 126.4 of this subchapter, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> On a valid license (i.e., DSP-5, DSP-94) and the ultimate  recipient and ultimate end user identified on the license is a foreign  government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reporting of export information on technical data and defense  service. When an export is being made using a DDTC authorization (e.g.,  technical data license, agreement or a technical data exemption provided  in this subchapter), the DDTC registered exporter will retain the  license or other approval and provide the export information  electronically to DDTC as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Technical data license. Prior to the permanent export of  technical data licensed using a Form DSP-5, the applicant shall  electronically provide export information using the system for direct  electronic reporting to DDTC of export information and self validate the  original of the license. When the initial export of all the technical  data authorized on the license has been made, the   license must be returned to DDTC. Exports of copies of the licensed  technical data should be made in accordance with existing exemptions in  this subchapter. Should an exemption not apply, the applicant may  request a new license.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Manufacturing license and technical assistance agreements.  Prior to the initial export of any technical data and defense services  authorized in an agreement the U.S. agreement holder must electronically  inform DDTC that exports have begun. In accordance with this subchapter,  all subsequent exports of technical data and services are not required  to be filed electronically with DDTC except when the export is done  using a U.S. Port. Records of all subsequent exports of technical data  shall be maintained by the exporter in accordance with this subchapter  and shall be made immediately available to DDTC upon request. Exports of  technical data in furtherance of an agreement using a U.S. Port shall be  made in accordance with Sec. 125.4 of this subchapter and made in  accordance with the procedures in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Technical data and defense service exemptions. In any instance  when technical data is exported using an exemption in this subchapter  (e.g., Sec. Sec. 125.4(b)(2), 125.4(b)(4), 126.5) from a U.S. port, the  exporter is not required to report using AES, but must, effective  January 18, 2004, provide the export data electronically to DDTC. A copy  of the electronic notification to DDTC must accompany the technical data  shipment and be made available to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection  upon request.</p><p class="depth4">Note to paragraph (b)(3)(iii): Future changes to the electronic  reporting procedure will be amended by publication of a rule in the  Federal Register. Exporters are reminded to continue maintaining records  of all export transactions, including exemption shipments, in accordance  with this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Return of licenses. Per Sec. 123.21 of this subchapter, all DSP  licenses issued by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) must  be disposed of in accordance with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A DSP-5 license issued electronically by DDTC and decremented  electronically by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection through the  Automated Export System (AES) is not required to be returned to DDTC. If  a DSP-5 license issued electronically is decremented physically in one  or more instance the license must be returned DDTC. A copy of the DSP-5  license must be maintained by the applicant in accordance with Sec.  122.5 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>  of this section), must be returned by the applicant, or the government  agency with which the license was filed, to DDTC upon expiration, to  include when the total authorized value or quantity has been shipped. A  copy of the license must be maintained by the applicant in accordance  with Sec. 122.5 of this subchapter. AES does not decrement the DSP-61,  DSP-73, and DSP-85 licenses. Submitting the Electronic Export  Information is not considered to be decremented electronically for these  licenses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A DSP-94 authorization filed with the U.S. Customs and Border  Protection must be returned by the applicant, or the government agency  with which the authorization was filed, to DDTC upon expiration, to  include when the total authorized value or quantity has been shipped, or  when all shipments against the Letter of Offer and Acceptance have been  completed. AES does not decrement the DSP-94 authorization. Submitting  the Electronic Export Information is not considered to be decremented  electronically for the DSP-94. A copy of the DSP-94 must be maintained  by the applicant in accordance with Sec. 122.5 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A license issued by DDTC but not used by the applicant does not  need to be returned to DDTC, even when expired.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A license revoked by DDTC is considered expired and must be  handled in   accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.
