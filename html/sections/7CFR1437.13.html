The crop acreage may include a crop intended for  harvest before planting of a succeeding crop or a succeeding crop  interseeded with the preceding crop prior to intended harvest of the  preceding crop. The acreage must be in an area where the practice is  recognized as a good farming practice, as determined by FSA, and all  crops are recognized by FSA as able to achieve the expected yield, as  determined by FSA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> FSA may consider crop acreage that is harvested more than once  during the same crop year from the same plant as a single crop. The  acreage must be in an area where the practice is recognized as a good  farming practice, as determined by FSA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> FSA may consider each planting period of multiple planted  acreage as a separate crop. The acreage must be in an area where the  practice is recognized as a good farming practice, as determined by FSA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> FSA may define forage as separate crops according to the  intended method of harvest, either mechanical harvest or grazed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Forage acreage intended to be grazed may be further defined as  warm and cool season forage crops.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Forage acreage intended to be mechanically harvested may be  defined as a separate crop from grazed forage and may be separated based  upon the commodity used as forage, to the extent such separation is  allowed under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Crop acreage intended for the production of seed may be  considered a separate crop from other intended uses,   as determined by FSA, if all the following criteria apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(1)</em> The specific crop acreage is seeded, or intended to be seeded,  with an intent of producing commercial seed as its primary intended use;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(2)</em> There is no possibility of other commercial uses of production  from the same crop without regard to market conditions; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(3)</em> The growing period of the specific crop acreage is uniquely  conducive to the production of commercial seed and not conducive to the  production of any other intended use of the crop, (e.g. vernalization in  a biennial crop such as carrots and onions) and that accommodation  renders the possibility of production for any other intended use of the  crop improbable.
