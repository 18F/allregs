A concurrence shall not be used as authority to  file joint fares or charges in which the carrier to whom the concurrence  is given does not participate, and it shall not be used as authority to  file local fares or charges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Number of copies. Each concurrence shall be prepared in  triplicate. The original of each concurrence shall be filed with the  Department, the duplicate thereof shall be given to the carrier in whose  favor the concurrence is issued, and the third copy shall be retained by  the carrier who issued the concurrence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Conflicting authority to be avoided. Care should be taken to  avoid giving authority to two or more carriers which, if used, would  result in conflicting or duplicate tariff provisions.</p>
