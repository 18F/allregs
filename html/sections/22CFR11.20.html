                                Sec. 11.20  Foreign Service specialist career candidate
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General considerations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Section 303 of the Foreign Service  Act of 1980 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) authorizes the  appointment of members of the Service (other than Presidential  appointments).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Section 306 of the Act provides that, before receiving a career  appointment in the Foreign Service, an individual shall first serve  under a limited appointment for a trial period of service as a career  candidate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> This section governs the appointment by the Department of State  of Foreign Service specialist career candidates to classes FS-1 and  below. Specialist candidates comprise all candidates for career  appointment in all occupational categories other than generalists (that  is, administrative, consular, economic, political, and program  direction), who are governed by the regulations respecting Foreign  Service officer career candidates. The appointment of all Senior Foreign  Service career candidates regardless of occupational category is  governed by Sec. 11.30 (to be supplied). Regulations governing trial  service and tenuring of specialist candidates are found in Volume 3  (Personnel), Foreign Affairs Manual, section 580.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Veterans' preference shall apply to the selection and  appointment of Foreign Service specialist career candidates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Specialist career candidate appointments--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Certification of  need. Candidates for appointment as specialist career candidates must be  world-wide available and must have a professional or a functional skill  for which there is a continuing need in the Foreign Service. Before an  application can be processed, the Director General of the Foreign  Service must certify that there is a need for the applicant as a career  candidate in the specialist category at or above the proposed class of  appointment. No applicant shall be appointed at a class level for which  there is no certified need. This individual certification of need is not  required for those specialist occupations which the Director General  determines in advance to be shortage or continuous recruitment  categories, and for which the Director General has certified the need  for a specific number of appointments at given levels. Such  appointments, including an appointment of an individual who is the  employee of any agency, may not exceed 5 years in duration, and may not  be renewed or extended beyond 5 years. A specialist candidate denied  tenure under Volume 3 (Personnel), Foreign Affairs Manual, section 580,  may not be reappointed as a career candidate in the same occupational  category.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Eligibility. An applicant must be a citizen of the United States  and at least 20 years of age. The minimum age for appointment as a  career candidate is 21. All career candidate appointments shall be made  before the candidate's 60th birthday. The maximum age for appointment  under the program is based on the requirement that all career candidates  shall be able to (i) complete at least two full tours of duty, exclusive  of orientation and training, (ii) complete the requisite eligibility  period for tenure consideration, and (iii) complete the requisite  eligibility period to receive retirement benefits, prior to reaching the  mandatory retirement age of 65 prescribed by the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Selection and initial screening. Specialist career candidates  will be selected on the basis of education, experience, suitability,  performance potential, and physical fitness for world-wide service.  Applicants normally will be given personal interviews and will be  subject to such written, oral, physical, foreign language, and other  examinations as may be prescribed by the Board of Examiners for the  Foreign Service and administered by the Office of Recruitment,  Examination, and Employment (PER/REE). The Board of Examiners will  identify and/or approve the knowledge, skills, abilities, and personal  characteristics required to perform the tasks and duties of Foreign  Service specialists in each functional field. PER/REE will screen  applications for appointment as Foreign Service specialist career  candidates under approved criteria and select those who meet the  requirements for further processing under these regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Oral examination. Candidates selected through the initial  screening will be eligible for an oral examination unless they are  candidates for appointment in occupational categories for which the oral  examination may be waived by the Director General. This waiver normally  will apply only to continuous-recruitment categories and to appointments  below the FS-6 level, and   where such waivers occur, a thorough oral interview will be conducted.  The oral examination will be given by a panel of deputy examiners, at  least one of whom will be a career Foreign Service specialist proficent  in the functional field for which the candidate is being tested. The  examination may include a writing sample. Candidates taking the oral  examination will be graded numerically according to standards set by the  Board of Examiners. The candidacy of anyone whose score is at or above  the passing level set by the Board will be continued. The candidacy of  anyone whose score is below the passing level will be terminated and may  not be considered again for 1 year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Background investigation. Candidates who have passed the oral  examination, and candidates who have passed the initial screening if the  oral examination has been waived, will be eligible for selection for the  background investigation to determine their suitability for appointment  to the Foreign Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Medical examination. Such candidates and their dependents will  be eligible for selection for the medical examination. The medical  examination shall be conducted to determine the candidate's physical  fitness to perform the duties of a Foreign Service specialist on a  world-wide basis and, for candidates and dependents, to determine the  presence of any physical, neurological, or mental condition of such a  nature as to make it unlikely that they would be able to function on a  world-wide basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Final review panel. After the results of the medical examination  and background investigation have been received, a Final Review Panel,  consisting of two or more deputy examiners of the Board of Examiners, or  by another appropriate panel appointed for the purpose by the Director  of PER/REE, will review and grade the candidate's entire file.  Candidates approved by the Final Review Panel will have their names  placed on a rank-order register for the functional specialty for which  they are qualified. Candidates will remain eligible for appointment for  18 months from the date of placement on the rank-order register. The  Board of Examiners may extend this eligibility period when such  extension is, in its judgment, justified in the interests of the Foreign  Service. The candidacy of anyone who is not recommended for appointment  by the Final Review Board shall be terminated and the candidate so  informed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Limited non-career appointments. Other Foreign Service  specialist appointments may be made on a limited non-career basis.  Before an application for a limited non-career appointment can be  processed, the Director General of the Foreign Service must certify that  there is a need for the applicant. Such limited specialists must serve  overseas, and they will be subject to the same conditions as those  outlined in these regulations for career candidates, with the exception  that the maximum age of 59 does not apply to such appointments. However,  because members of the Foreign Service generally are subject to the  mandatory retirement age of 65 under section 812 of the Act, limited  non-career appointments normally will not extend beyond the appointee's  65th birthday. Applicants for limited non-career appointments will be  subject to the same screening, medical examination, background  investigation, and final review process required of career candidates,  but normally they will not be subject to a written or oral examination.  Their appointments will normally be limited to the duration of the  specific assignment for which they are to be hired, may not exceed 5  years in duration, and may not be renewed or extended beyond 5 years.  Ordinarily, no limited non-career appointee will be reappointed until at  least 1 year has elapsed since the expiration of a previous appointment.  However, earlier reappointment may be granted in cases of special need,  provided the exclusive employee representative is advised in advance and  is afforded an opportunity to comment. Prior to the expiration of their  limited appointments, if otherwise eligible, non-career appointees may  compete for career candidate status by qualifying at that time for and  taking the examinations required of career candidates. If successful,  their names would be entered on the rank-   order register for their functional specialty. If appointed as career  candidates, the length of service under their previous limited non- career appointments may be counted as part of the trial period of  service prescribed before a candidate can receive a career appointment.
