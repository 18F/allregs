                            <p class="depth0">The Department shall seek to charge fees that recoup the full  allowable direct costs it incurs in processing a FOIA request. It shall  use the most efficient and least costly methods to comply with requests  for documents made under the FOIA. The Department will not charge fees  to any requester, including commercial use requesters, if the cost of  collecting a fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself. With  the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, the  Department will provide the first two hours of search time and the first  100 pages of duplication without charge. By making a FOIA request, the  requester shall be considered to have agreed to pay all applicable fees  up to $25.00 unless a fee waiver has been granted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Searches for responsive records. If the Department estimates  that the search costs will exceed $25.00, the requester shall be so  notified. Such notice shall offer the requester the opportunity to  confer with Department personnel with the object of reformulating the  request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost. The request shall  not be processed further unless the requester agrees to pay the  estimated fees. For both manual and computer searches, the Department  shall charge the estimated direct cost of each search based on the  average current salary rates of the categories of personnel doing the  searches. Further information on search fees is available by clicking on  ``FOIA'' at the Department's Web site at http://www.state.gov or  directly at the FOIA home page at http://foia.state.gov.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Manual searches. The Department will charge at the salary rate  (i.e., basic pay plus 16 percent of basic pay) of the employee making  the search.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Computer searches. The Department will charge at the actual  direct cost of providing the service. This will include the cost of  operating the central processing unit (CPU) for that portion of  operating time that is directly attributable to searching for records  responsive to a FOIA request and operator/programmer salary attributable  to the search.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Review of records. Only requesters who are seeking documents for  commercial use may be charged for time spent reviewing records to  determine whether they are releasable. Charges may be assessed for the  initial review only; i.e., the review undertaken the first time the  Department analyzes the applicability of a specific exemption to a  particular record or portion of a record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Duplication of records. Records shall be duplicated at a rate of  $.15 per page. For copies prepared by computer, such as tapes or  printouts, the Department shall charge the actual cost, including  operator time, of production of the tape or printout. For other methods  of reproduction or duplication, the Department shall charge the actual  direct costs of producing the document. If the Department estimates that  the duplication costs will exceed $25.00, the requester shall be so  informed. The request shall not be processed further unless the  requester agrees to pay the estimated fees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other charges. The Department shall recover the full costs of  providing services such as those enumerated below:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Certifying that records are true copies (see part 22 of this  chapter);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sending records by special methods such as express mail,  overnight courier, etc.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Payment shall be in the form either of a personal check or bank  draft drawn on a bank in the United States, or a postal money order.  Remittances shall be made payable to the order of the Treasury of the  United States and mailed to the Information and Privacy Coordinator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A receipt for fees paid will be given upon request. Refund of  fees paid for services actually rendered will not be made.  [69 FR 63935, Nov. 3, 2004, as amended at 72 FR 57858, Oct. 11, 2007]</p>
