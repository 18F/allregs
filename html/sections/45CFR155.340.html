                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirement to provide information to enable advance payments of  the premium tax credit and cost-sharing reductions. In the event that  the Exchange determines that a tax filer is eligible for advance  payments of the premium tax credit, an applicant is eligible for cost- sharing reductions, or that such eligibility for such programs has  changed, the Exchange must, simultaneously--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Transmit eligibility and enrollment information to HHS necessary  to enable HHS to begin, end, or change advance payments of the premium  tax credit or cost-sharing reductions; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notify and transmit information necessary to enable the issuer  of the QHP to implement, discontinue the implementation, or modify the  level of advance payments of the premium tax credit or cost-sharing  reductions, as applicable, including:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The dollar amount of the advance payment; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The cost-sharing reductions eligibility category.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requirement to provide information related to employer  responsibility. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the event that the Exchange determines that an  individual is eligible for advance payments of the premium tax credit or  cost-sharing reductions based in part on a finding that an individual's  employer does not provide minimum essential coverage, or provides  minimum essential coverage that is unaffordable, within the standard of  26 CFR 1.36B-2(c)(3)(v), or provide minimum essential coverage that does  not meet the minimum value standard of Sec. 156.145, the Exchange must  transmit the individual's name and taxpayer identification number to  HHS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an enrollee for whom advance payments of the premium tax  credit are made or who is receiving cost-sharing reductions notifies the  Exchange that he or she has changed employers, the Exchange must  transmit the enrollee's name and taxpayer identification number to HHS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the event that an individual for whom advance payments of the  premium tax credit are made or who is receiving cost-sharing reductions  terminates coverage from a QHP through the Exchange during a benefit  year, the Exchange must--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Transmit the individual's name and taxpayer identification  number, and the effective date of coverage termination, to HHS, which  will transmit it to the Secretary of the Treasury; and,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Transmit the individual's name and the effective date of the  termination of coverage to his or her employer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requirement to provide information related to reconciliation of  advance payments of the premium tax credit. The Exchange must comply  with the requirements of 26 CFR 1.36B-5 regarding reporting to the IRS  and to taxpayers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Timeliness standard. The Exchange must transmit all information  required in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section  promptly and without undue delay.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Allocation of advance payments of the premium tax credit among  policies. If one or more advance payments of the premium tax credit are  to be made on behalf of a tax filer (or two tax filers covered by the  same plan(s)), and individuals in the tax filers' tax households are  enrolled in more than one QHP or stand-alone dental plan, then the  advance payment must be allocated as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That portion of the advance payment of the premium tax credit  that is less than or equal to the aggregate adjusted monthly premiums,  as defined in 26 CFR 1.36B-3(e), for the QHP policies properly allocated  to EHB must be allocated among the QHP policies in a reasonable and  consistent manner specified by the Exchange; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any remaining advance payment of the premium tax credit must be  allocated among the stand-alone dental policies in a reasonable and  consistent manner specified by the Exchange.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That portion of the advance payment(s) of the premium tax credit  to be allocated among QHP policies will be allocated based on the number  of enrollees covered under the QHP, weighted by the age of the  enrollees, using the default uniform age rating curve established by the  Secretary of HHS under 45 CFR 147.102(e), with the portion allocated to  any single QHP policy not to exceed the portion of the QHP's adjusted  monthly premium properly allocated to EHB. If the portion of the advance  payment(s) of the premium tax credit allocated to a QHP under this  subparagraph exceeds the portion of the same QHP's adjusted monthly  premium properly allocated to EHB, the remainder will be allocated  evenly among all other QHPs in which individuals in the tax filers' tax  households are enrolled.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That portion of the advance payment(s) of the premium tax credit  to be allocated among stand-alone dental policies will be allocated  based on the number of enrollees covered under the stand-alone dental  policy, weighted by the age of the enrollees, using the default uniform  age rating curve established by the Secretary of HHS under 45 CFR  147.102(e), with the portion allocated to any single stand-alone dental  policy not to exceed the portion of the stand-alone dental policy  premium properly allocated to EHB. If the portion of the advance  payment(s) of the premium tax credit allocated to a stand-alone dental  policy under this subparagraph exceeds the portion of the same policy's  premium properly allocated to EHB, the remainder will be allocated  evenly among all other stand-alone dental policies in which individuals  in the tax filers' tax households are enrolled.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Reduction of enrollee's portion of premium to account for  advance payments of the premium tax credit. If an Exchange is  facilitating the collection and payment of premiums to QHP issuers and  stand-alone dental plans on behalf of enrollees under Sec. 155.240, and  if a QHP issuer or stand-alone dental plan has been notified that it  will receive an advance payment of the premium tax credit on behalf of  an enrollee for whom the Exchange is facilitating such functions, the  Exchange must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reduce the portion of the premium for the policy collected from  the individual for the applicable month(s) by the amount of the advance  payment of the premium tax credit; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Include with each billing statement, as applicable, to or for  the individual the amount of the advance payment of the premium tax  credit for the applicable month(s) and the remaining premium owed for  the policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Failure to reduce enrollee's premiums to account for advance  payments of the premium tax credit. If the Exchange discovers that it  did not reduce an enrollee's premium by the amount of the advance  payment of the premium tax credit, then the Exchange must notify the  enrollee of the improper reduction within 45 calendar days of discovery  of the improper reduction and refund the enrollee any excess premium  paid by or for the enrollee as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unless a refund is requested by or for the enrollee, the  Exchange must, within 45 calendar days of discovery of the error, apply  the excess premium paid by or for the enrollee to the enrollee's portion  of the premium (or refund the amount directly). If any excess premium  remains, the Exchange must then apply the excess premium to the  enrollee's portion of the premium for each subsequent month for the  remainder of the period of enrollment or benefit year until the excess  premium is fully refunded (or refund the remaining amount directly). If  any excess premium remains at the end of the period of enrollment or  benefit year, the Exchange must refund any excess premium within 45  calendar days of the   end of the period of enrollment or benefit year, whichever comes first.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a refund is requested by or for the enrollee, the refund must  be provided within 45 calendar days of the date of the request.
