                            <p class="depth0">The interpretations of the law contained in this part are official  interpretations which may be relied upon as provided in section 10 of  the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947. In addition, the Supreme Court has  recognized that such interpretations of the Act ``provide a practical  guide to employers and employees as to how the office representing the  public interest in its enforcement will seek to apply it'' and  ``constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts  and litigants may properly resort for guidance.'' Further, as stated by  the Court: ``Good administration of the Act and good judicial  administration alike require that the standards of public enforcement  and those for determining private rights shall be at variance only where  justified by very good reasons.'' (Skidmore v. Swift, 323 U.S. 134.)  Some of the interpretations in subpart D of this part relating to the  scope of the exemption provided for retail or service establishments are  interpretations of this exemption as it appeared in the original Act  before amendment in 1949 and 1961, which have remained unchanged because  they were consistent with the amendments. These interpretations may be  said to have Congressional sanction because ``When Congress amended the  Act in 1949 it provided that pre-1949 rulings and interpretations by the  Administrator should remain in effect unless inconsistent with the  statute as amended. 63 Stat. 920.'' (Mitchell v. Kentucky Finance Co.,  359 U.S. 290.)</p>
