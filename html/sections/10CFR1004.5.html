                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> FOIA Officers will be responsible for processing requests for records submitted pursuant to this part. Upon receiving such a request, the FOIA Officer will, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, ascertain which Authorizing Official has responsibility for, custody of, or concern with the records requested. The FOIA Officer will review the request, consulting with the Authorizing Official where appropriate, to determine its compliance with Sec. 1004.4. Where a request complies with Sec. 1004.4, the FOIA Officer will acknowledge receipt of the request to the requester and forward the request to the Authorizing Official for action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Authorizing Official will promptly identify and review the records encompassed by the request. The Authorizing Official or FOIA Officer will prepare a written response (1) granting the request, (2) denying the request, (3) granting/denying it in part, (4) replying with a response stating that the request has been referred to another agency under Sec. 1004.4(f) or Sec. 1004.6(e), (5) informing the requester that responsive records cannot be located or do not exist.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where a request involves records which are in the custody of or are the concern of more than one Authorizing Official or FOIA Officer, the FOIA Officer will identify all concerned all Authorizing Officials, send copies of the request to them and forward the request for action to the Authorizing Official or FOIA Officer that can reasonably be expected to have custody of most of the requested records. This Authorizing Official or FOIA Officer will prepare a DOE response to the requester consistent with paragraph (b) of this section, which will identify any other Authorizing Official or FOIA Officer, having responsibility for the denial of records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Time for processing requests. (1) Action pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section will be taken within 20 working days of receipt of a request for DOE records (``receipt'' is defined in Sec. 1004.4(a)), except that,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Action pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section will be taken within 20 working days of receipt of a request for DOE records (``receipt'' is defined in Sec. 1004.4(a)), except that,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> One request can be made to the requester for information and the DOE can toll the 20-day response period

while it waits for the requester's response;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If necessary to clarify with the requester issues regarding fee assessment and the DOE can toll the 20-day response period; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em>If unusual circumstances require an extension of time before a decision on a request can be reached and the person requesting records is promptly informed in writing by the Authorizing Official or FOIA Officer of the reasons for such extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched, then the Authorizing Official or FOIA Officer may take an extension not to exceed 10 working days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of this section and Sec. 1004.8(d), the term ``unusual circumstances'' may include but is not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the offices processing the request;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The need to search for, collect and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are responsive to a single request; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request, or among two or more components of the Department having substantial subject matter interest therein.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The requester must be promptly notified in writing of the extension, the reasons for the extension, and the date on which a determination is expected to be made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If no determination has been made at the end of the 20-day period, or the last extension thereof, the requester may deem his adminstrative remedies to have been exhausted, giving rise to a right of review in a district court of the United States as specified in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4). When no determination can be made within the applicable time limit, the responsible Authorizing Official or FOIA Officer will nevertheless continue to process the request. If the DOE is unable to provide a response within the statutory period, the Authorizing Official or FOIA Officer will inform the requester of the reason for the delay; the date on which a determination may be expected to be made; that the requester can seek remedy through the courts, but ask the requester to forego such action until a determination is made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Nothing in this part shall preclude the Authorizing Official or FOIA Officer and a requester from agreeing to an extension of time for the initial determination on a request. Any such agreement will be confirmed in writing and will clearly specify the total time agreed upon.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Expedited processing. Generally, the DOE will respond to requests in the order of receipt. Requests will be processed out of order and processed as soon as practicable when it is determined, based upon information supplied by the requester or otherwise known to the DOE, that a compelling need exists to provide the records in an expeditious manner. The FOIA states that a compelling need exists when failure to obtain records expeditiously could reasonably be expected to pose a threat to the life or physical safety of an individual or, when a request is submitted by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information and there is an urgency to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A determination to grant or deny a request for expedited processing will be made by the appropriate FOIA Officer within 10 days after receipt of the request. The requester will be notified of the determination and informed that any denial may be appealed within 30 calendar days to the Office of Hearings and Appeals.''
