All cytology slide preparations  must be evaluated on the premises of a laboratory certified to conduct  testing in the subspecialty of cytology.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Staining. The laboratory must have available and follow written  policies and procedures for each of the following, if applicable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All gynecologic slide preparations must be stained using a  Papanicolaou or modified Papanicolaou staining method.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Effective measures to prevent cross-contamination between  gynecologic and nongynecologic specimens during the staining process  must be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Nongynecologic specimens that have a high potential for cross- contamination must be stained separately from other nongynecologic  specimens, and the stains must be filtered or changed following  staining.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Control procedures. The laboratory must establish and follow  written policies and procedures for a program designed to detect errors  in the performance of cytologic examinations and the reporting of  results. The program must include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The review must be performed by an individual who meets one of  the following qualifications:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A technical supervisor qualified under Sec. 493.1449(b) or (k).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A cytology general supervisor qualified under Sec. 493.1469.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A cytotechnologist qualified under Sec. 493.1483 who has the  experience specified in Sec. 493.1469(b)(2).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Cases must be randomly selected from the total caseload and  include negatives and those from patients or groups of patients that are  identified as having a higher than average probability of developing  cervical cancer based on available patient information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The review of those cases selected must be completed before  reporting patient results.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Laboratory comparison of clinical information, when available,  with cytology reports and comparison of all gynecologic cytology reports  with a diagnosis of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL),  adenocarcinoma, or other malignant neoplasms with the histopathology  report, if available in the laboratory (either on-site or in storage),  and determination of the causes of any discrepancies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For each patient with a current HSIL, adenocarcinoma, or other  malignant neoplasm, laboratory review of all normal or negative  gynecologic specimens received within the previous 5 years, if available  in the laboratory (either on-site or in storage).

The laboratory must establish and follow  written policies and procedures that ensure the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The technical supervisor establishes a maximum workload limit  for each individual who performs primary screening.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The workload limit is based on the individual's performance  using evaluations of the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Review of 10 percent of the cases interpreted as negative for  the conditions defined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Comparison of the individual's interpretation with the technical  supervisor's confirmation of patient smears specified in paragraphs  (e)(1) and (e)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each individual's workload limit is reassessed at least every 6  months and adjusted when necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The maximum number of slides examined by an individual in each  24-hour period does not exceed 100 slides (one patient specimen per  slide; gynecologic, nongynecologic, or both) irrespective of the site or  laboratory.

In  addition--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The maximum number of 100 slides is examined in no less than an  8-hour workday;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For the purposes of establishing workload limits for  individuals examining slides in less than an 8-hour workday (includes  full-time employees with duties other than slide examination and part- time employees), a period of 8 hours is used to prorate the number of  slides that may be examined.
