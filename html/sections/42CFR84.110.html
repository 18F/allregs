submittal of an application in writing for approval to the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory listing the gas or vapor and suggested maximum use concentration for the specific type of gas mask. The Institute will consider the application and accept or reject it on the basis of effect on the wearer's health and safety and any field experience in use of gas masks for such exposures. If the application is accepted, the Institute will test such masks in accordance with the requirements of this subpart.
