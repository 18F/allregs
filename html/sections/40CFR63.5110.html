                            <p class="depth0">All terms used in this subpart that are not defined in this section have the meaning given to them in the Clean Air Act (CAA) and in subpart A of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Always-controlled work station means a work station associated with a curing oven from which the curing oven exhaust is delivered to a control device with no provision for the oven exhaust to bypass the control device. Sampling lines for analyzers and relief valves needed for safety purposes are not considered bypass lines.</p><p class="depth0">Capture efficiency means the fraction of all organic HAP emissions generated by a process that is delivered to a control device, expressed as a percentage.</p><p class="depth0">Capture system means a hood, enclosed room, or other means of collecting organic HAP emissions and conveying them to a control device.</p><p class="depth0">Car-seal means a seal that is placed on a device that is used to change the position of a valve or damper (e.g., from open to closed) in such a way that the position of the valve or damper cannot be changed without breaking the seal.</p><p class="depth0">Coating means material applied onto or impregnated into a substrate for decorative, protective, or functional purposes. Such materials include, but are not limited to, paints, varnishes, sealants, inks, adhesives, maskants, and temporary coatings. Decorative, protective, or functional materials

that consist only of solvents, protective oils, acids, bases, or any combination of these substances are not considered coatings for the purposes of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Coating material means the coating and other products (e.g., a catalyst and resin in multi-component coatings) combined to make a single material at the coating facility that is applied to metal coil. For the purposes of this subpart, an organic solvent that is used to thin a coating prior to application to the metal coil is considered a coating material.</p><p class="depth0">Coil coating line means a process and the collection of equipment used to apply an organic coating to the surface of metal coil. A coil coating line includes a web unwind or feed section, a series of one or more work stations, any associated curing oven, wet section, and quench station. A coil coating line does not include ancillary operations such as mixing/thinning, cleaning, wastewater treatment, and storage of coating material.</p><p class="depth0">Control device means a device such as a solvent recovery device or oxidizer which reduces the organic HAP in an exhaust gas by recovery or by destruction.</p><p class="depth0">Control device efficiency means the ratio of organic HAP emissions recovered or destroyed by a control device to the total organic HAP emissions that are introduced into the control device, expressed as a percentage.</p><p class="depth0">Curing oven means the device that uses heat or radiation to dry or cure the coating material applied to the metal coil.</p><p class="depth0">Day means a 24-consecutive-hour period.</p><p class="depth0">Deviation means any instance in which an affected source, subject to this subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Fails to meet any requirement or obligation established by this subpart including, but not limited to, any emission limitation (including any operating limit) or work practice standard;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Fails to meet any term or condition that is adopted to implement an applicable requirement in this subpart and that is included in the operating permit for any affected source required to obtain such a permit; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Fails to meet any emission limitation (including any operating limit) or work practice standard in this subpart during start-up, shutdown, or malfunction, regardless of whether or not such failure is permitted by this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Existing affected source means an affected source the construction of which commenced on or before July 18, 2000, and it has not subsequently undergone reconstruction as defined in Sec. 63.2.</p><p class="depth0">Facility means all contiguous or adjoining property that is under common ownership or control, including properties that are separated only by a road or other public right-of-way.</p><p class="depth0">Flexible packaging means any package or part of a package the shape of which can be readily changed. Flexible packaging includes but is not limited to bags, pouches, labels, liners and wraps utilizing paper, plastic, film, aluminum foil, metalized or coated paper or film, or any combination of these materials.</p><p class="depth0">HAP applied means the organic HAP content of all coating materials applied to a substrate by a coil coating line.</p><p class="depth0">Intermittently-controllable work station means a work station associated with a curing oven with provisions for the curing oven exhaust to be delivered to a control device or diverted from a control device through a bypass line, depending on the position of a valve or damper. Sampling lines for analyzers and relief valves needed for safety purposes are not considered bypass lines.</p><p class="depth0">Metal coil means a continuous metal strip that is at least 0.15 millimeter (0.006 inch) thick, which is packaged in a roll or coil prior to coating. After coating, it may or may not be rewound into a roll or coil. Metal coil does not include metal webs that are coated for use in flexible packaging.</p><p class="depth0">Month means a calendar month or a pre-specified period of 28 days to 35 days to allow for flexibility in recordkeeping when data are based on a business accounting period.</p><p class="depth0">Never-controlled work station means a work station which is not equipped with provisions by which any emissions, including those in the exhaust from any associated curing oven, may be delivered to a control device.</p><p class="depth0">New affected source means an affected source the construction or reconstruction of which commenced after July 18, 2000.</p><p class="depth0">Overall organic HAP control efficiency means the total efficiency of a control system, determined either by:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The product of the capture efficiency as determined in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 63.5160(e) and the control device efficiency as determined in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 63.5160(a)(1)(i) and (ii) or Sec. 63.5160(d); or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> A liquid-liquid material balance in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 63.5170(e)(1).</p><p class="depth2">Permanent total enclosure (PTE) means a permanently installed enclosure that meets the criteria of Method 204 of appendix M, 40 CFR part 51 for a PTE, and that directs all the exhaust gases from the enclosure to a control device.</p><p class="depth2">Protective oil means an organic material that is applied to metal for the purpose of providing lubrication or protection from corrosion without forming a solid film. This definition of protective oil includes but is not limited to lubricating oils, evaporative oils (including those that evaporate completely), and extrusion oils.</p><p class="depth2">Research or laboratory equipment means any equipment for which the primary purpose is to conduct research and development into new processes and products, where such equipment is operated under the close supervision of technically trained personnel and is not engaged in the manufacture of products for commercial sale in commerce, except in a de minimis manner.</p><p class="depth2">Temporary total enclosure (TTE) means an enclosure constructed for the purpose of measuring the capture efficiency of pollutants emitted from a given source, as defined in Method 204 of 40 CFR part 51, appendix M.</p><p class="depth2">Work station means a unit on a coil coating line where coating material is deposited onto the metal coil substrate.</p><p class="depth2">Emission Standards and Compliance Dates</p>
