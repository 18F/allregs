                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Making a request for records. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The request shall be submitted  in writing to the Executive Director:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> By facsimile clearly marked ``Freedom of Information Act  Request'' to (202) 293-6251;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> By letter to the Executive Director marked ``Freedom of  Information Act Request''; 2000 K Street, NW., Suite 301; Washington, DC  20006; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> By sending Internet e-mail to the Executive Director marked  ``Freedom of Information Act Request'' at his or her e-mail address  listed on the ASC's World Wide Web site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The request shall contain the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The name and address of the requester, an electronic mail  address, if available, and the telephone number at which the requester  may be reached during normal business hours;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Whether the requester is an educational institution, non- commercial scientific institution, or news media representative;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A statement agreeing to pay the applicable fees, or a  statement identifying a maximum fee that is acceptable to the requester,  or a request for a waiver or reduction of fees that satisfies paragraph  (e)(1)(x) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The preferred form and format of any responsive information  requested, if other than paper copies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A request for identifiable records shall reasonably describe the  records in a way that enables the ASC's staff to identify and produce  the records with reasonable effort and without unduly burdening or  significantly interfering with any ASC operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Defective requests. The ASC need not accept or process a request  that does not reasonably describe the records requested or that does not  otherwise comply with the requirements of this subpart. The ASC may  return a defective request, specifying the deficiency. The requester may  submit a corrected request, which will be treated as a new request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Processing requests--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Receipt of requests. Upon receipt of  any request that satisfies paragraph (a) of this section, the Executive  Director shall assign the request to the appropriate processing track  pursuant to this section. The date of receipt for any request, including  one that is addressed incorrectly or that is referred by another agency,  is the date the Executive Director actually receives the request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Expedited processing. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Where a person requesting expedited  access to records has demonstrated a compelling need for the records, or  where the ASC has determined to expedite the response, the ASC shall  process the request as soon as practicable. To show a compelling need  for expedited processing, the requester shall provide a statement  demonstrating that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The failure to obtain the records on an expedited basis could  reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or  physical safety of an individual; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The requester can establish that it is primarily engaged in  information dissemination as its main professional occupation or  activity, and there is urgency to inform the public of the government  activity involved in the re request; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The requester's statement must be certified to be true and  correct to the best of the person's knowledge and belief and explain in  detail the basis for requesting expedited processing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The formality of the certification required to obtain expedited  treatment may be waived by the Executive Director as a matter of  administrative discretion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A requester seeking expedited processing will be notified  whether expedited processing has been granted within ten (10) working  days of the receipt of the request. If the request for expedited  processing is denied, the requester may file an appeal pursuant to the  procedures set forth in paragraph (g) of this section, and the ASC shall  respond to the appeal within ten (10) working days after receipt of the  appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Priority of responses. Consistent with sound administrative  process, the ASC processes requests in the order they are received.  However, in the ASC's discretion, or upon a court order in a matter to  which the ASC is a party, a particular request may be processed out of  turn.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Notification. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The time for response to requests will be  twenty (20) working days except:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In the case of expedited treatment under paragraph (c)(2) of  this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Where the running of such time is suspended for the calculation  of a cost estimate for the requester if the ASC determines that the  processing of the request may exceed the requester's maximum fee  provision or if the charges are likely to exceed $250 as provided for in  paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Where the running of such time is suspended for the payment of  fees pursuant to the paragraph (c)(5)(i)(B) and (e)(1) of this section;  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> In unusual circumstances, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)  and further described in paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In unusual circumstances as referred to in paragraph  (c)(5)(i)(D) of this section, the time limit may be extended for a  period of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Ten (10) working days as provided by written notice to the  requester, setting forth the reasons for the extension and the date on  which a determination is expected to be dispatched; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Such alternative time period as agreed to by the requester or as  reasonably determined by the ASC when the ASC notifies the requester  that the request cannot be processed in the specified time limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Unusual circumstances may arise when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The records are in facilities that are not located at the ASC's  Washington office;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The records requested are voluminous or are not in close  proximity to one another; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> There is a need to consult with another agency or among two or  more components of the ASC having a substantial interest in the  determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Response to request. In response to a request that satisfies the  requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a search shall be  conducted of records maintained by the ASC in existence on the date of  receipt of the request, and a review made of any responsive information  located. To the extent permitted by law, the ASC may redact identifying  details when it makes available or publishes any records. If redaction  is appropriate, the ASC will, to the extent technically feasible,  indicate the amount of material deleted at the place in the record where  such deletion is made unless that indication in and of itself will  jeopardize the purpose for the redaction. The ASC shall notify the  requester of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The ASC's determination of the request;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The reasons for the determination;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the response is a denial of an initial request or if any  information is withheld, the ASC will advise the requester in writing:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the denial is in part or in whole;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The name and title of each person responsible for the denial  (when other than the person signing the notification);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The exemptions relied on for the denial; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The right of the requester to appeal the denial to the Chairman  of the ASC within 30 business days following receipt of the  notification, as specified in paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Providing responsive records. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Copies of requested records  shall be sent to the requester by regular U.S. mail to the address  indicated in the request, unless the requester elects to take delivery  of the documents at the ASC or makes other acceptable arrangements, or  the ASC deems it appropriate to send the documents by another means.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The ASC shall provide a copy of the record in any form or format  requested if the record is readily reproducible by the ASC in that form  or format, but the ASC need not provide more than one copy of any record  to a requester.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> By arrangement with the requester, the ASC may elect to send the  responsive records electronically if a substantial portion of the  request is in electronic format. If the information requested is made  pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, it will not be sent  by electronic means unless reasonable security measures can be provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Fees--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rules. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Persons requesting records of the  ASC shall be charged for the direct costs of search, duplication, and  review as set forth in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section,  unless such costs are less than the ASC's cost of processing the  requester's remittance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Requesters will be charged for search and review costs even if  responsive records are not located or, if located, are determined to be  exempt from disclosure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Multiple requests seeking similar or related records from the  same requester or group of requesters will be aggregated for the  purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If the ASC determines that the estimated costs of search,  duplication, or review of requested records will exceed the dollar  amount specified in the request, or if no dollar amount is specified,  the ASC will advise the requester of the estimated costs. The requester  must agree in writing to pay the costs of search, duplication, and  review prior to the ASC initiating any records search.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If the ASC estimates that its search, duplication, and review  costs will exceed $250, the requester must pay an amount equal to 20  percent of the estimated costs prior to the ASC initiating any records  search.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The ASC ordinarily will collect all applicable fees under the  final invoice before releasing copies of requested records to the  requester.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The ASC may require any requester who has previously failed to  pay charges under this section within 30 calendar days of mailing of the  invoice to pay in advance the total estimated costs of search,  duplication, and review. The ASC also may require a requester who has  any charges outstanding in excess of 30 calendar days following mailing  of the invoice to pay the full amount due, or demonstrate that the fee  has been paid in full, prior to the ASC initiating any additional  records search.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> The ASC may begin assessing interest charges on unpaid bills  on the 31st day following the day on which the invoice was sent.  Interest will be at the rate prescribed in Sec. 3717 of title 31 of the  United States Code and will accrue from the date of the invoice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> The time limit for the ASC to respond to a request will not  begin to run until the ASC has received the requester's written  agreement under paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section, and advance  payment under paragraph (e)(1)(v) or (vii) of this section, or payment  of outstanding charges under paragraph (e)(1)(vii) or (viii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> As part of the initial request, a requester may ask that the ASC  waive or reduce fees if disclosure of the records is in the public  interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public  understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is  not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.  Determinations as to a waiver or reduction of fees will be made by the  Executive Director (or designee), and the requester will be notified in  writing of his or her determination. A determination not to grant a  request for a waiver or reduction of fees under this paragraph may be  appealed to the ASC's Chairman pursuant to the procedure set forth in  paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Chargeable fees by category of requester. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Commercial use  requesters shall be charged search, duplication, and review costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Educational institutions, noncommercial scientific  institutions, and news media representatives shall be charged  duplication costs, except for the first 100 pages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Requesters not described in paragraph (e)(2)(i) or (ii) of  this section shall be charged the full reasonable direct cost of search  and duplication, except for the first two hours of search time and first  100 pages of duplication.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fee schedule. The dollar amount of fees which the ASC may charge  to records requesters will be established by the Executive Director. The  ASC may charge fees that recoup the full allowable direct costs it  incurs. Fees are subject to change as costs change. The fee schedule  will be published periodically on the ASC's Internet World Wide Web site  (http://www.asc.gov) and will be effective on the date of publication.   Copies of the fee schedule may be obtained by request at no charge by  contacting the Executive Director by letter, Internet email or  facsimile.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Manual searches for records. The ASC will charge for manual  searches for records at the basic rate of pay of the employee making the  search plus 16 percent to cover employee benefit costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Computer searches for records. The fee for searches of  computerized records is the actual direct cost of the search, including  computer time, computer runs, and the operator's time apportioned to the  search multiplied by the operator's basic rate of pay plus 16 percent to  cover employee benefit costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Duplication of records. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The per-page fee for paper copy  reproduction of documents is $.25.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For other methods of reproduction or duplication, the ASC will  charge the actual direct costs of reproducing or duplicating the  documents, including each involved employee's basic rate of pay plus 16  percent to cover employee benefit costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Review of records. The ASC will charge commercial use  requesters for the review of records at the time of processing the  initial request to determine whether they are exempt from mandatory  disclosure at the basic rate of pay of the employee making the search  plus 16 percent to cover employee benefit costs. The ASC will not charge  at the administrative appeal level for review of an exemption already  applied. When records or portions of records are withheld in full under  an exemption which is subsequently determined not to apply, the ASC may  charge for a subsequent review to determine the applicability of other  exemptions not previously considered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Other services. Complying with requests for special services,  other than a readily produced electronic form or format, is at the ASC's  discretion. The ASC may recover the full costs of providing such  services to the requester.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Use of contractors. The ASC may contact with independent  contractors to locate, reproduce, and/or disseminate records; provided,  however, that the ASC has determined that the ultimate cost to the  requester will be no greater than it would be if the ASC performed these  tasks itself. In no case will the ASC contract our responsibilities  which FOIA provides that the ASC alone may discharge, such as  determining the applicability of an exemption or whether to waive or  reduce fees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Exempt information. A request for records may be denied if the  requested record contains information that falls into one or more of the  following categories. \1\ If the requested record contains both exempt  and nonexempt information, the nonexempt portions, which may reasonable  be segregated from the exempt portions, will be released to the  requester. If redaction is necessary, the ASC will, to the extent  technically feasible, indicate the amount of material deleted at the  place in the record where such deletion is made unless that indication  in and of itself will jeopardize the purpose for the redaction. The  categories of exempt records are as follows: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ Classification of a record as exempt from disclosure under the  provisions of this paragraph (f) shall not be construed as authority to  withhold the record if it is otherwise subject to disclosure under the  Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) or other Federal statute, any  applicable regulation of ASC or any other Federal agency having  jurisdiction thereof, or any directive or order of any court of  competent jurisdiction. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Records that are specifically authorized under criteria  established by an Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of  national defense or foreign policy and are in fact properly classified  pursuant to such Executive Order;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Records related solely to the internal personnel rules and  practices of the ASC;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Records specifically exempted from disclosure by statute,  provided that such statute:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a  manner as to leave no discretion on the issue; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to  particular types of matters to be withheld;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained  from a   person that is privileged or confidential;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Interagency or intra-agency memoranda or letters that would not  be available by law to a private party in litigation with the ASC;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Personnel, medical, and similar files (including financial  files) the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted  invasion of personal privacy;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the  extent that the production of such law enforcement records:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement  proceedings;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trail or an  impartial adjudication;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted  invasion of personal privacy;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a  confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or  authority or any private institution which furnished records on a  confidential basis;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement  investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law  enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could  reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical  safety of any individual;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Records that are contained in or related to examination,  operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the  use of the ASC or any agency responsible for the regulation or  supervision of financial institutions; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Geological and geophysical information and data, including maps,  concerning wells.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Appeals. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Appeals should be addressed to the Executive  Director; ASC; 2000 K Street, NW., Suite 310; Washington, DC 20006.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A person whose initial request for records under this section,  or whose request for a waiver of fees under paragraph (e)(1)(x) of this  section, has been denied, either in part or in whole, has the right to  appeal the denial to the ASC's Chairman (or designee) within 30 business  days after receipt of notification of the denial. Appeals of denials of  initial requests or for a waiver of fees must be in writing and include  any additional information relevant to consideration of the appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> of this section, the ASC will notify the appellant in  writing within 20 business days after receipt of the appeal and will  state:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Whether it is granted or denied in whole or in part;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The name and title of each person responsible for the denial  (if other than the person signing the notification);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The exemptions relied upon for the denial in the case of  initial requests for records; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The right to judicial review of the denial under the FOIA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If a requester is appealing for denial of expedited treatment,  the ASC will notify the appellant within ten business days after receipt  of the appeal of the ASC's disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Complete payment of any outstanding fee invoice will be required  before an appeal is processed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Records of another agency. If a requested record is the property  of another Federal agency or department, and that agency or department,  either in writing or by regulation, expressly retains ownership of such  record, upon receipt of a request for the record the ASC will promptly  inform the requester of this ownership and immediately shall forward the  request to the proprietary agency or department either for processing in  accordance with the latter's regulations or for guidance with respect to  disposition.  [64 FR 72497, Dec. 28, 1999; 65 FR 31960, May 19, 2000, as amended at 69  FR 2501, Jan. 16, 2004]</p>
