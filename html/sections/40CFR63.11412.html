                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Terms used in this subpart are defined in the CAA, in 40 CFR 63.2, and in this section as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Bag leak detection system means a system that is capable of continuously monitoring relative particulate matter (dust loadings) in the exhaust of a baghouse to detect bag leaks and other upset conditions. A bag leak detection system includes, but is not limited to, an instrument that operates on triboelectric, light scattering, light transmittance, or other effect to continuously monitor relative particulate matter loadings.</p><p class="depth0">Chromic acid means chromium trioxide (CrO3). It is produced by the electrolytic reaction or acidification of sodium dichromate.</p><p class="depth0">Chromium compounds manufacturing means any process that uses chromite ore as the basic feedstock to manufacture chromium compounds, primarily sodium dichromate, chromic acid, and chromic oxide.</p><p class="depth0">Chromium compounds manufacturing facility means the collection of processes and equipment at a plant engaged in chromium compounds manufacturing.</p><p class="depth0">Chromite ore means an oxide of chromium and iron (FeCr2O4) that is the primary feedstock for chromium compounds manufacturing.</p><p class="depth0">Chromic oxide means Cr2O3. In the production of chromic oxide, ammonium sulfate and sodium dichromate that have been concentrated by evaporation are mixed and fed to a rotary roasting kiln to produce chromic oxide, sodium sulfate and nitrogen gas.</p><p class="depth0">Roasting means a heating (oxidizing) process where ground chromite ore is mixed with alkaline material (such as soda ash, sodium bicarbonate, and sodium hydroxide) and fed to a rotary kiln where it is heated to about 2,000 F, converting the majority of the chromium in the ore from trivalent to hexavalent chromium.</p><p class="depth0">Sodium chromate means Na2CrO4. It is produced by roasting chromite ore in a rotary kiln.</p><p class="depth0">Sodium dichromate means sodium bichromate or sodium bichromate dihydrate and is known technically as sodium dichromate dihydrate (Na2Cr2O7  2H2O). It is produced by the electrolytic reaction or acidification of sodium chromate.</p>
