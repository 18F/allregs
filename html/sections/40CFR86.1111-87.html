                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For heavy-duty engines, the prescribed test procedure for PCA  testing is the Federal Test Procedure as described in subparts N, I, and  P of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For heavy-duty vehicles, the prescribed test procedure for PCA  testing is described in subpart M of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For light-duty trucks, the prescribed test procedure for PCA  testing is the Federal Test Procedure as described in subparts B and P  of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> During the testing of heavy-duty diesel engines, the  manufacturer shall decide for each engine, prior to the start of the  initial cold cycle, whether the measurement of background particulate is  required for the cold and hot cycles to be valid. The manufacturer may  choose to have different requirements for the cold and hot cycles. If a  manufacturer chooses to require the measurement of background  particulate, failure to measure background particulate shall void the  test cycle regardless of the test results. If a test cycle is void, the  manufacturer shall retest using the same validity requirements of the  initial test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When testing light-duty trucks, the following exceptions to the  test procedures in subpart B are applicable:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The manufacturer may use gasoline test fuel meeting the  specifications of paragraph (a) of Sec. 86.113 for mileage accumulation.  Otherwise, the manufacturer may use fuels other than those specified in  this section only with advance approval of the Administrator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The manufacturer may measure the temperature of the test fuel  at other than the approximate midvolume of the fuel tank, as specified  in paragraph (a) of Sec. 86.131, and may drain the test fuel from other  than the lowest point of the fuel tank, as specified in paragraph (b) of  Sec. 86.131, with the advance approval of the Administrator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The manufacturer may perform additional preconditioning on PCA  test vehicles other than the preconditioning specified in Sec. 86.132  only if the additional preconditioning has been performed on  certification test vehicles of the same configuration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The manufacturer shall perform the heat build procedure 11 to  34 hours following vehicle preconditioning rather than according to the  time period specified in paragraph (a) of Sec. 86.133.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The manufacturer may substitute slave tires for the drive wheel  tires on the vehicle as specified in paragraph (e) of Sec. 86.135,  provided that the slave tires are the same size as the drive wheel  tires.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The cold start exhaust emission test described in Sec. 86.137  shall follow the heat build procedure described in Sec. 86.133 by not  more than one hour.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> In performing exhaust sample analysis under Sec. 86.140:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> When testing diesel vehicles, the manufacturer shall allow a  minimum of 20 minutes warm-up for the HC analyzer, and a minimum of 2  hours warm-up for the CO, CO2 and NOX analyzers.  [Power is normally left on for infrared and chemiluminescent analyzers.  When not in use, the chopper motors of the infrared analyzers are turned  off and the phototube high voltage supply to the chemiluminescent  analyzers is placed in the standby position.]</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The manufacturer shall exercise care to prevent moisture from  condensing in the sample collection bags.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> The manufacturer need not comply with Sec. 86.142, since the  records required therein are provided under other provisions of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> In addition to the requirements of subpart B of this part, the  manufacturer shall prepare gasoline-fueled vehicles as follows prior to  exhaust emission testing:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The manufacturer shall inspect the fuel system to insure the  absence   of any leaks of liquid or vapor to the atmosphere by applying a pressure  of 14.5 [0.5 inches of water to the fuel system, allowing the pressure  to stabilize, and isolating the fuel system from the pressure source.  Following isolation of the fuel system, pressure must not drop more than  2.0 inches of water in 5 minutes. If required, the manufacturer shall  perform corrective action in accordance with paragraph (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> When performing this pressure check, the manufacturer shall  exercise care to neither purge nor load the evaporative emission control  system.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The manufacturer shall not modify the test vehicle's evaporative  emission control system by component addition, deletion, or  substitution, except to comply with paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section  if approved in advance by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The manufacturer shall not adjust, repair, prepare, or modify  the engines or vehicles selected for testing and shall not perform any  emission tests on engines or vehicles selected for testing pursuant to a  PCA request unless the adjustment, repair, preparation, modification, or  tests are documented in the manufacturer's engine or vehicle assembly  and inspection procedures and are actually performed on all engines or  vehicles produced or unless these adjustments or tests are required or  permitted under this subpart or are approved in advance by the  Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For 1984 and later model years the Administrator may adjust or  cause to be adjusted any engine parameter which the Administrator has  determined to be subject to adjustment for certification, Selective  Enforcement Audit and Production. Compliance Audit testing in accordance  with Sec. 86.084-22(e)(1), to any setting within the physically  adjustable range of that parameter, as determined by the Administrator  in accordance with Sec. 86.084-2(e)(3)(ii), prior to the performance of  any tests. However, if the idle speed parameter is one which the  Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment, the  Administrator shall not adjust it to any setting which causes a lower  engine idle speed than would have been possible within the physically  adjustable range of the idle speed parameter if the manufacturer had  accumulated 125 hours of service on the engine or 4,000 miles on the  vehicle under paragraph (c) of this section, all other parameters being  identically adjusted for the purpose of the comparison. The manufacturer  may be requested to supply information to establish such an alternative  minimum idle speed. The Administrator, in making or specifying these  adjustments, may consider the effect of the deviation from the  manufacturer's recommended setting on emissions performance  characteristics as well as the likelihood that similar settings will  occur on in-use heavy-duty engines or light-duty trucks. In determining  likelihood, the Administrator may consider factors such as, but not  limited to, the effect of the adjustment on engine or vehicle  performance characteristics and surveillance information from similar  in-use engines or vehicles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Prior to performing emission testing on a PCA test engine, the  manufacturer may accumulate on each engine a number of hours of service  equal to the greater of 125 hours or the number of hours the  manufacturer accumulated during certification on the emission-data  engine corresponding to the configuration tested during PCA. Prior to  performing emission testing on a PCA test vehicle, the manufacturer may  accumulate a number of miles equal to the greater of 4,000 miles or the  number of miles the manufacturer accumulated during certification on the  emission-data vehicle corresponding to the configuration tested during  PCA. Service or mileage accumulation may be performed in any manner the  manufacturer desires.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No maintenance shall be performed on test engines or vehicles  after selection for testing nor will any test engine or vehicle  substitution or replacement be allowed, unless requested of and approved  by the Administrator in advance of the performance of any maintenance or  engine or vehicle substitution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The manufacturer shall expeditiously ship test engines or  vehicles from the point of selection to the test facility or other  location to meet any other requirements of this subpart. If   the test facility is not located at or in close proximity to the point  of selection, the manufacturer shall assure that test engines or  vehicles arrive at the test facility within 24 hours of selection,  except that the Administrator may approve more time based upon a request  by the manufacturer accompanied by a satisfactory justification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If an engine or vehicle cannot complete the service or mileage  accumulation or emission tests because of engine or vehicle malfunction,  the manufacturer may request that the Administrator authorize the repair  of the engine or vehicle. If the engine or vehicle cannot be repaired  expeditiously, EPA may delete it from the test sequence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Heavy-duty engine manufacturers with projected sales bound  for the United States market for that year of 30,000 or greater, as made  in their respective Applications for Certification, shall complete  emission testing at their testing facility on a minimum of two engines  per 24 hour period, including voided tests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Heavy-duty engine manufacturers with projected sales bound for  the United States market for that year of less than 30,000, as made in  their respective Applications for Certification, Shall complete emission  testing at one engine per 24 hour period, including voided tests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Light-duty truck manufacturers shall complete emission testing  on a minimum of four vehicles per 24 hour period, including voided  tests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Administrator may approve a longer period of time for  conducting emission tests based upon a request by a manufacturer  accompanied by a satisfactory justification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The manufacturer shall perform test engine or vehicle selection,  shipping, preparation, service or mileage accumulation, and testing in  such a manner as to insure that the audit is performed in an expeditious  manner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The manufacturer may retest any engines or vehicles tested  during a Production Compliance Audit once a compliance level has been  established in accordance with Sec. 86.1112-87 based on the first test  on each engine or vehicle. The Administrator may approve retesting at  other times based upon a request by the manufacturer accompanied by a  satisfactory justification. The manufacturer may test each engine or  vehicle a total of three times. The manufacturer shall test each engine  or vehicle the same number of times. The manufacturer may accumulate  additional service or mileage before conducting a retest, subject to the  provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.
