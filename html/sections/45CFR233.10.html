                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> State plan requirements. A State plan under title I, IV--A, X,  XIV, or XVI, of the Social Security Act must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Specify the groups of individuals, based on reasonable  classifications, that will be included in the program, and all the  conditions of eligibility that must be met by the individuals in the  groups. The groups selected for inclusion in the plan and the  eligibility conditions imposed must not exclude individuals or groups on  an arbitrary or unreasonable basis, and must not result in inequitable  treatment of individuals or groups in the light of the provisions and  purposes of the public assistance titles of the Social Security Act.  Under this requirement:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A State shall impose each condition of eligibility required by  the Social Security Act; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A State may:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Provide more limited public assistance coverage than that  provided by the Act only where the Social Security Act or its  legislative history authorizes more limited coverage;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Impose conditions upon applicants for and recipients of public  assistance which, if not satisfied, result in the denial or termination  of public assistance, if such conditions assist the State in the  efficient administration of its public assistance programs, or further  an independent State welfare policy, and are not inconsistent with the  provisions and purposes of the Social Security Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> There must be clarity as to what groups are included in the  plan, and which are within, and which are outside, the scope of Federal  financial participation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Eligibility conditions must be applied on a consistent and  equitable basis throughout the State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A plan under title XVI must have the same eligibility conditions  and other requirements for the aged, blind, and disabled, except as  otherwise specifically required or permitted by the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Eligibility conditions or agency procedures or methods must not  preclude the opportunity for an individual to apply and obtain a  determination of eligibility or ineligibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Methods of determining eligibility must be consistent with the  objective of assisting all eligible persons to qualify.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Provide that the State agency will establish methods for  identifying the expenditures for assistance for any groups included in  the plan for whom Federal financial participation in assistance may not  be claimed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In addition, a State plan under title IV-A, X, XIV, or XVI of  the Act, must: Provided that no aid or assistance will be provided under  the plan to an individual with respect to a period for which he is  receiving aid or assistance under a State plan approved under any other  of such titles or under title I of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Federal financial participation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The provisions which govern  Federal financial participation in assistance payments are set forth in  the Social Security Act, throughout this chapter, and in other policy  issuances of the Secretary. Where indicated, State plan provisions are  prerequisite to Federal financial participation with respect to the  applicable group and payments. State plan provisions on need, the amount  of assistance, and eligibility determine the limits of Federal financial  participation. Federal financial   participation is excluded from assistance payments in which the State  refuses to participate because of the failure of a local authority to  apply such State plan provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The following is a summary statement regarding the groups for  whom Federal financial participation is available.

Federal financial  participation is available where assistance is required to be continued  unadjusted because a hearing has been requested.
