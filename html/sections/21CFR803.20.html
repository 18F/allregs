All electronic submissions must  include information about the patient, the event, the device, and the  ``initial reporter.'' An electronic submission from a user facility or  importer must include the information from block F. An electronic  submission from a manufacturer must include the information from blocks  G and H. If you are a manufacturer and you receive a report from a user  facility or importer, you must incorporate that information in your  electronic submission and include any corrected or missing information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To whom must I submit reports and when?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If you are a user facility, you must submit MDR reports to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The manufacturer and to us no later than 10 work days after the  day that you become aware of information that reasonably suggests that a  device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The manufacturer no later than 10 work days after the day that  you become aware of information that reasonably suggests that a device  has or may have caused or contributed to a serious injury. If the  manufacturer is not known, you must submit this report to us.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you are an importer, you must submit MDR reports to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The manufacturer and to us, no later than 30 calendar days after  the day that you become aware of information that reasonably suggests  that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or  serious injury or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The manufacturer, no later than 30 calendar days after  receiving information that a device you market has malfunctioned and  that this device or a similar device that you market would be likely to  cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were  to recur.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If you are a manufacturer, you must submit MDR reports to us:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No later than 30 calendar days after the day that you become  aware of information that reasonably suggests that a device may have  caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> No later than 30 calendar days after the day that you become  aware of information that reasonably suggests a device has malfunctioned  and that this device or a similar device that you market would be likely  to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction  were to recur; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Within 5 work days if required by Sec. 803.53.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> What kind of information reasonably suggests that a reportable  event has occurred?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any information, including professional, scientific, or medical  facts, observations, or opinions, may reasonably suggest that a device  has caused or may have caused or contributed to an MDR reportable event.  An MDR reportable event is a death, a serious injury, or, if you are a  manufacturer or importer, a malfunction that would be likely to cause or  contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to  recur.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you are a user facility, importer, or manufacturer, you do  not have to report an   adverse event if you have information that would lead a person who is  qualified to make a medical judgment reasonably to conclude that a  device did not cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, or that  a malfunction would not be likely to cause or contribute to a death or  serious injury if it were to recur. Persons qualified to make a medical  judgment include physicians, nurses, risk managers, and biomedical  engineers. You must keep in your MDR event files (described in Sec.  803.18) the information that the qualified person used to determine  whether or not a device-related event was reportable.</p>
