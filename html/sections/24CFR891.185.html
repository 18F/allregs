                            <p class="depth0">The Department finds that it is necessary and desirable to assist  project owners to preserve the continued viability of each project  assisted under this part (except subpart E) as a housing resource for  very low-income elderly persons or persons with disabilities. The  Department also finds that it is necessary to protect the substantial  economic interest of the Federal Government in those projects.  Therefore, the Department concludes that it is in the national interest  to preempt, and it does hereby preempt, the entire field of rent  regulation by local rent control boards or other authority acting  pursuant to state or local law as it affects those projects. Part 246 of  this title applies to projects covered by subpart E of this part.  [63 FR 64803, Nov. 23, 1998]</p>
