The applicant must identify and define as downstream relevant products all products sold by merging entities in relevant downstream geographic markets, as outlined in paragraph (c)(1) of Sec. 33.3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Upstream relevant products. The applicant must identify and define as upstream relevant products all inputs to electricity products provided by upstream merging entities in the most recent two years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Define geographic markets--(i) Downstream geographic markets.

Any mitigation measures proposed by the applicant (including, for example, divestiture or participation in an Regional Transmission Organization) which are intended to mitigate the adverse effect of the proposed transaction must, to the extent possible, be factored into the vertical competitive analysis as an additional post-transaction analysis. Any mitigation measures that involve facilities must identify the facilities affected by the commitment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Additional factors. (1) If the applicant does not propose mitigation measures, the applicant must address:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The potential adverse competitive effects of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The potential for entry in the market and the role that entry could play in mitigating adverse competitive effects of the transaction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The efficiency gains that reasonably could not be achieved by other means; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Whether, but for the proposed transaction, one or more of the parties to the transaction would be likely to fail, causing its assets to exit the market.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The applicant must address each of the additional factors in the context of whether the proposed transaction is likely to present concerns about raising rivals' costs or anticompetitive coordination.</p>
