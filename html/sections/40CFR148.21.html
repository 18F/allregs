for existing sites where sufficient data are available;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An approved quality assurance and quality control plan shall address all aspects of the demonstration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Reasonably conservative values shall be used whenever values taken from the literature or estimated on the basis of known information are used instead of site-specific measurements; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> An analysis shall be performed to identify and assess aspects of the demonstration that contribute significantly to uncertainty. The petitioner shall conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect that significant uncertainty may contribute to the demonstration. The demonstration shall then be based on conservative assumptions identified in the analysis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any petitioner under Sec.  148.20(a)(1)(i) shall provide sufficient site-specific information to support the demonstration, such as:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Thickness, porosity, permeability and extent of the various strata in the injection zone;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Thickness, porosity, permeability, extent, and continuity of the confining zone;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Hydraulic gradient in the injection zone;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Hydrostatic pressure in the injection zone; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Geochemical conditions of the site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In addition to the information in Sec.  148.21(b), any petitioner under Sec.  148.20(a)(1)(ii) shall provide sufficient waste-specific information to ensure reasonably reliant predictions about the waste transformation.
