                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Allowance of deduction. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Section 213 permits a deduction of  payments for certain medical expenses (including expenses for medicine  and drugs). Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section  (relating to special rule for decedents) a deduction is allowable only  to individuals and only with respect to medical expenses actually paid  during the taxable year, regardless of when the incident or event which  occasioned the expenses occurred and regardless of the method of  accounting employed by the taxpayer in making his income tax return.  Thus, if the medical expenses are incurred but not paid during the  taxable year, no deduction for such expenses shall be allowed for such  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Except as provided in subparagraphs (4)(i) and (5)(i) of this  paragraph, only such medical expenses (including the allowable expenses  for medicine and drugs) are deductible as exceed 3 percent of the  adjusted gross income for the taxable year. For taxable years beginning  after December 31, 1966, the amounts paid during the taxable year for  insurance that constitute expenses paid for medical care shall, for  purposes of computing total medical expenses, be reduced by the amount  determined under subparagraph (5)(i) of this paragraph. For the amounts  paid during the taxable year for medicine and drugs which may be taken  into account in computing total medical expenses, see paragraph (b) of   this section. For the maximum deduction allowable under section 213 in  the case of certain taxable years, see paragraph (c) of this section. As  to what constitutes ``adjusted gross income'', see section 62 and the  regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For medical expenses paid (including expenses paid for  medicine and drugs) to be deductible, they must be for medical care of  the taxpayer, his spouse, or a dependent of the taxpayer and not be  compensated for by insurance or otherwise. Expenses paid for the medical  care of a dependent, as defined in section 152 and the regulations  thereunder, are deductible under this section even though the dependent  has gross income equal to or in excess of the amount determined pursuant  to Sec. 1.151-2 applicable to the calendar year in which the taxable  year of the taxpayer begins. Where such expenses are paid by two or more  persons and the conditions of section 152(c) and the regulations  thereunder are met, the medical expenses are deductible only by the  person designated in the multiple support agreement filed by such  persons and such deduction is limited to the amount of medical expenses  paid by such person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An amount excluded from gross income under section 105 (c) or  (d) (relating to amounts received under accident and health plans) and  the regulations thereunder shall not constitute compensation for  expenses paid for medical care. Exclusion of such amounts from gross  income will not affect the treatment of expenses paid for medical care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The application of the rule allowing a deduction for medical  expenses to the extent not compensated for by insurance or otherwise may  be illustrated by the following example in which it is assumed that  neither the taxpayer nor his wife has attained the age of 65:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Taxpayer H, married to W and having one dependent child,  had adjusted gross income for 1956 of $3,000. During 1956 he paid $300  for medical care, of which $100 was for treatment of his dependent child  and $200 for an operation on W which was performed in September 1955. In  1956 he received a payment of $50 for health insurance to cover a  portion of the cost of W's operation performed during 1955. The  deduction allowable under section 213 for the calendar year 1956,  provided the taxpayer itemizes his deductions and does not compute his  tax under section 3 by use of the tax table, is $160, computed as  follows:  Payments in 1956 for medical care............................       $300 Less: Amount of insurance received in 1956...................         50</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0">Payments in 1956 for medical care not compensated for            250</p><p class="depth0">during 1956............................................. Less: 3 percent of $3,000 (adjusted gross income)............         90</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0">Excess, allowable as a deduction for 1956................        160</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, where  either the taxpayer or his spouse has attained the age of 65 before the  close of the taxable year, the 3-percent limitation on the deduction for  medical expenses does not apply with respect to expenses for medical  care of the taxpayer or his spouse. Moreover, for taxable years  beginning after December 31, 1959, and before January 1, 1967, the 3- percent limitation on the deduction for medical expenses does not apply  to amounts paid for the medical care of a dependent (as defined in sec.  152) who is the mother or father of the taxpayer or his spouse and who  has attained the age of 65 before the close of the taxpayer's taxable  year. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, and for  taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, all amounts paid by the  taxpayer for medicine and drugs are subject to the 1-percent limitation  provided by section 213(b). For taxable years beginning after December  31, 1963, and before January 1, 1967, the 1-percent limitation provided  by section 213(b) does not apply, under certain circumstances, to  amounts paid by the taxpayer for medicine and drugs for the taxpayer and  his spouse or for a dependent (as defined in sec. 152) who is the mother  or father of the taxpayer or of his spouse. (For additional provisions  relating to the 1-percent limitation with respect to medicine and drugs,  see paragraph (b) of this section.) For taxable years beginning before  January 1, 1967, whether or not the 3-percent or 1-percent limitation  applies, the total medical expenses deductible under section 213 are  subject to the limitations described in section 213(c) and paragraph (c)  of this section and, where applicable, to the   limitations described in section 213(g) and Sec. 1.213-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The age of a taxpayer shall be determined as of the last day of  his taxable year. In the event of the taxpayer's death, his taxable year  shall end as of the date of his death. The age of a taxpayer's spouse  shall be determined as of the last day of the taxpayer's taxable year,  except that, if the spouse dies within such taxable year, her age shall  be determined as of the date of her death. Likewise, the age of the  taxpayer's dependent who is the mother or father of the taxpayer or of  his spouse shall be determined as of the last day of the taxpayer's  taxable year but not later than the date of death of such dependent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The application of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Taxpayer A, who attained the age of 65 on February 22,  1956, makes his return on the basis of the calendar year. During the  year 1956, A had adjusted gross income of $8,000, and paid the following  medical bills: (a) $560 (7 percent of adjusted gross income) for the  medical care of himself and his spouse, and (b) $160 (2 percent of  adjusted gross income) for the medical care of his dependent son. No  part of these payments was for medicine and drugs nor compensated for by  insurance or otherwise. The allowable deduction under section 213 for  1956 is $560, the full amount of the medical expenses for the taxpayer  and his spouse. No deduction is allowable for the amount of $160 paid  for medical care of the dependent son since the amount of such payment  (determined without regard to the payments for the care of the taxpayer  and his spouse) does not exceed 3 percent of adjusted gross income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. H and W, who have a dependent child, made a joint return  for the calendar year 1956. H became 65 years of age on August 15, 1956.  The adjusted gross income of H and W in 1956 was $40,000 and they paid  in such year the following amounts for medical care: (a) $3,000 for the  medical care of H; (b) $2,000 for the medical care of W; and (c) $3,000  for the medical care of the dependent child. No part of these payments  was for medicine and drugs nor compensated for by insurance or  otherwise. The allowable deduction under section 213 for medical  expenses paid in 1956 is $6,800 computed as follows:  Payments for medical care of H and W in 1956.................     $5,000 Payments for medical care of the dependent in 1956     $3,000 Less: 3 percent of $40,000 (adjusted gross income)      1,200</p><p class="depth0">--------      1,800</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0">Allowable deduction for 1956..................  .........      6,800</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. D and his wife, E, made a joint income tax return for the  calendar year 1962, and reported adjusted gross income of $30,000. On  December 13, 1962, D attained the age of 65. During the year 1962, D's  father, F, who was 87 years of age, received over half of his support  from, and was a dependent (as defined in section 152) of, D. However, D  could not claim an exemption under section 151 for F because F had gross  income from rents in 1962 of $800. D paid the following medical expenses  in 1962, none of which were compensated for by insurance or otherwise:  hospital and doctor bills for D and E, $6,500; hospital and doctor bills  for F, $4,850; medicine and drugs for D and E, $225, and for F, $225.  Since none of the medical expenses are subject to the 3-percent  limitation, the amount of medical expenses to be taken into account  (before computing the maximum deduction) is $11,500, computed as  follows:  Hospital and doctor bills--for D and E............  .........     $6,500 Hospital and doctor bills--for F..................  .........      4,850 Medicine and drugs--for D and E...................       $225 Medicine and drugs--for F.........................       $225</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0">Total medicine and drugs......................        450 Less: 1 percent of adjusted gross income ($30,000)        300</p><p class="depth0">----------- Allowable expenses for medicine and drugs.........  .........       $150</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0">Total medical expenses taken into account.....  .........     11,500</p><p class="depth0">Since an exemption cannot be claimed for F on the 1962 return of D and  E, their deduction for medical expenses (assuming that section 213(g)  does not apply) is limited to $10,000 for that year ($5,000 multiplied  by the two exemptions allowed for D and E under section 151(b)). If  these identical facts had occurred in a taxable year beginning before  January 1, 1962, the medical expense deduction for D and E would, for  such taxable year, be limited to $5,000 ($2,500 multiplied by the two  exemptions allowed for D and E under section 151(b)). See paragraph (c)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Assume the same facts as in Example 3, except that D  furnished the entire support of his father's twin sister, G, who had no  gross income during 1962 and for whom D was entitled to a dependency  exemption. In addition, D paid $4,800 to doctors and hospitals during  1962 for the medical care of G. No part of the $4,800 was for medicine  and drugs, and no amount was compensated for by insurance or otherwise.  For purposes of the maximum limitation under section 213(c), the maximum  deduction for medical expenses on the 1962 return of D and E is limited  to $15,000 ($5,000 multiplied by 3, the   number of exemptions allowed under section 151, exclusive of the  exemptions for old age or blindness). If these identical facts had  occurred in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1962, the medical  expense deduction for D and E would, for such taxable year, be limited  to $7,500 ($2,500 multiplied by the three exemptions allowed under  section 151, exclusive of the exemptions for old age or blindness). The  medical expenses to be taken into account by D and E for 1962 and the  maximum deductions allowable for such expenses are $15,400 and $15,000,  respectively, computed as follows:  Medical expenses per Example 3....................  .........    $11,500 Add: Expenses paid for G..........................     $4,800 Less: 3 percent of adjusted gross income ($30,000)        900</p><p class="depth0">--------      3,900</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0">Total medical expenses taken into account................     15,400 Maximum deduction for 1962 ($5,000 multiplied by 3                15,000</p><p class="depth0">exemptions).................................................</p><p class="depth0">---------- Medical expenses not deductible..............................        400</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Assume that the facts set forth in Example 3 had occurred  in respect of the calendar year 1964 rather than the calendar year 1962.  Since both D and his father, F, had attained the age of 65 before the  close of the taxable year, the 1-percent limitation does not apply to  the amounts paid for medicine and drugs for D, E, and F. Accordingly,  the total medical expenses taken into account by D and E for 1964 would  be $11,800 (rather than $11,500 as in Example 3) computed as follows:  Hospital and doctor bills--for D and E......................      $6,500 Hospital and doctor bills--for F............................       4,350 Medicine and drugs--for D and E.............................         225 Medicine and drugs--for F...................................         225</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0">Total medical expenses taken into account.................      11,800</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, there  may be deducted without regard to the 3-percent limitation the lesser  of--(a) One-half of the amounts paid during the taxable year for  insurance which constitute expenses for medical care for the taxpayer,  his spouse, and dependents; or (b) $150.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The application of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph may be  illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. H and W made a joint return for the calendar year 1967. The  adjusted gross income of H and W for 1967 was $10,000 and they paid in  such year $370 for medical care of which amount $350 was paid for  insurance which constitutes medical care for H and W. No part of the  payment was for medicine and drugs or was compensated for by insurance  or otherwise. The allowable deduction under section 213 for medical  expenses paid in 1967 is $150, computed as follows:  (1) Lesser of $175 (one-half of amounts paid for insurance) or      $150</p><p class="depth0">$150...........................................................

(i) Amounts paid during taxable years  beginning before January 1, 1964, for medicine and drugs are to be taken  into account in computing the allowable deduction for medical expenses  paid during the taxable year only to the extent that the aggregate of  such amounts exceeds 1 percent of the adjusted gross income for the  taxable year. Thus, if the aggregate of the amounts paid for medicine  and drugs exceeds 1 percent of adjusted gross income, the excess is  added to other medical expenses for the purpose of computing the medical  expense deduction. The application of this subdivision may be  illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. The taxpayer, a single individual with no dependents, had  an adjusted gross income of $6,000 for the calendar year 1956. During  1956, he paid a doctor $300 for medical services, a hospital $100 for  hospital care, and also spent $100 for medicine and drugs. These  payments were not compensated for by insurance or otherwise. The  deduction allowable under section 213 for the calendar year 1956 is  $260, computed as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Payments for medical care in 1956:  Doctor..........................................................    $300 Hospital........................................................     100 Medicine and drugs......................................    $100 Less: 1 percent of $6,000 (adjusted gross income).......      60      40</p><p class="depth0">---------------</p><p class="depth0">Total medical expenses taken into account.....................     440 Less: 3 percent of $6,000 (adjusted gross income)...............     180</p><p class="depth0">------- Allowable deduction for 1956....................................     260</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> may be  illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example.

During  the year, H and W paid the following amounts for medical care: (i)  $1,000 for doctors and hospital expenses and $180 for medicine and drugs  for themselves; and (ii) $500 for doctors and hospital expenses and $140  for medicine and drugs for the dependent child. These payments were not  compensated for by insurance or otherwise.

Expenses paid for ``medical care'' shall include those paid for the  purpose of affecting any structure or function of the body or for  transportation primarily for and essential to medical care. See  subparagraph (4) of this paragraph for provisions relating to medical  insurance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Amounts paid for operations or treatments affecting any portion  of the body, including obstetrical expenses and expenses of therapy or  X-ray treatments, are deemed to be for the purpose of affecting any  structure or function of the body and are therefore paid for medical  care. Amounts expended for illegal operations or treatments are not  deductible. Deductions for expenditures for medical care allowable under  section 213 will be confined strictly to expenses incurred primarily for  the prevention or alleviation of a physical or mental defect or illness.  Thus, payments for the following are payments for medical care: hospital  services, nursing services (including nurses' board where paid by the  taxpayer), medical, laboratory, surgical, dental and other diagnostic  and healing services, X-rays, medicine and drugs (as defined in  subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, subject to the 1-percent limitation  in paragraph (b) of this section), artificial teeth or limbs, and  ambulance hire. However, an expenditure which is merely beneficial to  the general health of an individual, such as an expenditure for a  vacation, is not an expenditure for medical care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Capital expenditures are generally not deductible for Federal  income tax purposes. See section 263 and the regulations thereunder.  However, an expenditure which otherwise qualifies as a medical expense  under section 213 shall not be disqualified merely because it is a  capital expenditure. For purposes of section 213 and this paragraph, a  capital expenditure made by the taxpayer may qualify as a medical  expense, if it has as its primary purpose the medical care (as defined  in subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph) of the taxpayer, his  spouse, or his dependent. Thus, a capital expenditure which is related  only to the sick person and is not related to permanent improvement or  betterment of property, if it otherwise qualifies as an expenditure for  medical care, shall be deductible; for example, an expenditure for eye  glasses, a seeing eye dog, artificial teeth and limbs, a wheel chair,  crutches, an inclinator or an air conditioner which is detachable from  the property and purchased only for the use of a sick person, etc.  Moreover, a capital expenditure for permanent improvement or betterment  of property which would not ordinarily be for the purpose of medical  care (within the meaning of this paragraph) may, nevertheless, qualify  as a medical expense to the extent that the expenditure exceeds the  increase in the value of the related property, if the particular  expenditure is related directly to medical care. Such a situation could  arise, for example, where a taxpayer is advised by a physician to  install an elevator in his residence so that the taxpayer's wife who is  afflicted with heart disease will not be required to climb stairs. If  the cost of installing the elevator is $1,000 and the increase in the  value of the residence is determined to be only $700, the difference of  $300, which is the   amount in excess of the value enhancement, is deductible as a medical  expense. If, however, by reason of this expenditure, it is determined  that the value of the residence has not been increased, the entire cost  of installing the elevator would qualify as a medical expense.  Expenditures made for the operation or maintenance of a capital asset  are likewise deductible medical expenses if they have as their primary  purpose the medical care (as defined in subdivisions (i) and (ii) of  this subparagraph) of the taxpayer, his spouse, or his dependent.  Normally, if a capital expenditure qualifies as a medical expense,  expenditures for the operation or maintenance of the capital asset would  also qualify provided that the medical reason for the capital  expenditure still exists. The entire amount of such operation and  maintenance expenditures qualifies, even if none or only a portion of  the original cost of the capital asset itself qualified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Expenses paid for transportation primarily for and essential to  the rendition of the medical care are expenses paid for medical care.  However, an amount allowable as a deduction for ``transportation  primarily for and essential to medical care'' shall not include the cost  of any meals and lodging while away from home receiving medical  treatment. For example, if a doctor prescribes that a taxpayer go to a  warm climate in order to alleviate a specific chronic ailment, the cost  of meals and lodging while there would not be deductible. On the other  hand, if the travel is undertaken merely for the general improvement of  a taxpayer's health, neither the cost of transportation nor the cost of  meals and lodging would be deductible. If a doctor prescribes an  operation or other medical care, and the taxpayer chooses for purely  personal considerations to travel to another locality (such as a resort  area) for the operation or the other medical care, neither the cost of  transportation nor the cost of meals and lodging (except where paid as  part of a hospital bill) is deductible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The cost of in-patient hospital care (including the cost of  meals and lodging therein) is an expenditure for medical care. The  extent to which expenses for care in an institution other than a  hospital shall constitute medical care is primarily a question of fact  which depends upon the condition of the individual and the nature of the  services he receives (rather than the nature of the institution). A  private establishment which is regularly engaged in providing the types  of care or services outlined in this subdivision shall be considered an  institution for purposes of the rules provided herein. In general, the  following rules will be applied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Where an individual is in an institution because his condition  is such that the availability of medical care (as defined in  subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph) in such institution is a  principal reason for his presence there, and meals and lodging are  furnished as a necessary incident to such care, the entire cost of  medical care and meals and lodging at the institution, which are  furnished while the individual requires continual medical care, shall  constitute an expense for medical care. For example, medical care  includes the entire cost of institutional care for a person who is  mentally ill and unsafe when left alone. While ordinary education is not  medical care, the cost of medical care includes the cost of attending a  special school for a mentally or physically handicapped individual, if  his condition is such that the resources of the institution for  alleviating such mental or physical handicap are a principal reason for  his presence there. In such a case, the cost of attending such a special  school will include the cost of meals and lodging, if supplied, and the  cost of ordinary education furnished which is incidental to the special  services furnished by the school. Thus, the cost of medical care  includes the cost of attending a special school designed to compensate  for or overcome a physical handicap, in order to qualify the individual  for future normal education or for normal living, such as a school for  the teaching of braille or lip reading. Similarly, the cost of care and  supervision, or of treatment and training, of a mentally retarded or  physically handicapped individual at an institution is within the  meaning of the term medical care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Where an individual is in an institution, and his condition is  such that the availability of medical care in such institution is not a  principal reason for his presence there, only that part of the cost of  care in the institution as is attributable to medical care (as defined  in subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph) shall be considered  as a cost of medical care; meals and lodging at the institution in such  a case are not considered a cost of medical care for purposes of this  section. For example, an individual is in a home for the aged for  personal or family considerations and not because he requires medical or  nursing attention. In such case, medical care consists only of that part  of the cost for care in the home which is attributable to medical care  or nursing attention furnished to him; his meals and lodging at the home  are not considered a cost of medical care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> It is immaterial for purposes of this subdivision whether the  medical care is furnished in a Federal or State institution or in a  private institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> See section 262 and the regulations thereunder for disallowance  of deduction for personal living, and family expenses not falling within  the definition of medical care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Medicine and drugs. The term medicine and drugs shall include  only items which are legally procured and which are generally accepted  as falling within the category of medicine and drugs (whether or not  requiring a prescription). Such term shall not include toiletries or  similar preparations (such as toothpaste, shaving lotion, shaving cream,  etc.) nor shall it include cosmetics (such as face creams, deodorants,  hand lotions, etc., or any similar preparation used for ordinary  cosmetic purposes) or sundry items. Amounts expended for items which,  under this subparagraph, are excluded from the term medicine and drugs  shall not constitute amounts expended for ``medical care''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Status as spouse or dependent. In the case of medical expenses  for the care of a person who is the taxpayer's spouse or dependent, the  deduction under section 213 is allowable if the status of such person as  ``spouse'' or ``dependent'' of the taxpayer exists either at the time  the medical services were rendered or at the time the expenses were  paid. In determining whether such status as ``spouse'' exists, a  taxpayer who is legally separated from his spouse under a decree of  separate maintenance is not considered as married. Thus, payments made  in June 1956 by A, for medical services rendered in 1955 to B, his wife,  may be deducted by A for 1956 even though, before the payments were  made, B may have died or in 1956 secured a divorce. Payments made in  July 1956 by C, for medical services rendered to D in 1955 may be  deducted by C for 1956 even though C and D were not married until June  1956.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Medical insurance. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(a)</em> For taxable years beginning after  December 31, 1966, expenditures for insurance shall constitute expenses  paid for medical care only to the extent that such amounts are paid for  insurance covering expenses of medical care referred to in subparagraph  (1) of this paragraph. In the case of an insurance contract under which  amounts are payable for other than medical care (as, for example, a  policy providing an indemnity for loss of income or for loss of life,  limb, or sight):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this  paragraph unless the charge for such insurance is either separately  stated in the contract or furnished to the policyholder by the insurer  in a separate statement,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount taken into account as the amount paid for such  medical insurance shall not exceed such charge, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> No amount shall be treated as paid for such medical insurance if  the amount specified in the contract (or furnished to the policyholder  by the insurer in a separate statement) as the charge for such insurance  is unreasonably large in relation to the total charges under the  contract.  For purposes of the preceding sentence, amounts will be considered  payable for other than medical care under the contract if the contract  provides for the waiver of premiums upon the occurrence of an event. In  determining whether a separately stated charge for insurance covering  expenses of medical care is unreasonably large in relation   to the total premium, the relationship of the coverages under the  contract together with all of the facts and circumstances shall be  considered. In determining whether a contract constitutes an  ``insurance'' contract it is irrelevant whether the benefits are payable  in cash or in services. For example, amounts paid for hospitalization  insurance, for membership in an association furnishing cooperative or  so-called free-choice medical service, or for group hospitalization and  clinical care are expenses paid for medical care. Premiums paid under  Part B, title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395j-1395w),  relating to supplementary medical insurance benefits for the aged, are  amounts paid for insurance covering expenses of medical care. Taxes  imposed by any governmental unit do not, however, constitute amounts  paid for such medical insurance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, subject to  the rules of (a) of this subdivision, premiums paid during a taxable  year by a taxpayer under the age of 65 for insurance covering expenses  of medical care for the taxpayer, his spouse, or a dependent after the  taxpayer attains the age of 65 are to be treated as expenses paid during  the taxable year for insurance covering expenses of medical care if the  premiums for such insurance are payable (on a level payment basis) under  the contract:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For a period of 10 years or more, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Until the year in which the taxpayer attains the age of 65 (but  in no case for a period of less than 5 years).  For purposes of this subdivision (b), premiums will be considered  payable on a level payment basis if the total premium under the contract  is payable in equal annual or more frequent installments. Thus, a total  premium of $10,000 payable over a period of 10 years at $1,000 a year  shall be considered payable on a level payment basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, expenses  paid for medical care shall include amounts paid for accident or health  insurance. In determining whether a contract constitutes an  ``insurance'' contract it is irrelevant whether the benefits are payable  in cash or in services. For example, amounts paid for hospitalization  insurance, for membership in an association furnishing cooperative or  so-called free-choice medical service, or for group hospitalization and  clinical care are expenses paid for medical care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Exclusion of amounts allowed for care of certain dependents.  Amounts taken into account under section 44A in computing a credit for  the care of certain dependents shall not be treated as expenses paid for  medical care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Reimbursement for expenses paid in prior years. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Where  reimbursement, from insurance or otherwise, for medical expenses is  received in a taxable year subsequent to a year in which a deduction was  claimed on account of such expenses, the reimbursement must be included  in gross income in such subsequent year to the extent attributable to  (and not in excess of) deductions allowed under section 213 for any  prior taxable year. See section 104, relating to compensation for  injuries or sickness, and section 105(b), relating to amounts expended  for medical care, and the regulations thereunder, with regard to amounts  in excess of or not attributable to deductions allowed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If no medical expense deduction was taken in an earlier year,  for example, if the standard deduction under section 141 was taken for  the earlier year, the reimbursement received in the taxable year for the  medical expense of the earlier year is not includible in gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In order to allow the same aggregate medical expense deductions  as if the reimbursement received in a subsequent year or years had been  received in the year in which the payments for medical care were made,  the following rules shall be followed:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the amount of the reimbursement is equal to or less than the  amount which was deducted in a prior year, the entire amount of the  reimbursement shall be considered attributable to the deduction taken in  such prior year (and hence includible in gross income); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the amount of the reimbursement received in such subsequent  year or years is greater than the amount which was deducted for the  prior year,   that portion of the reimbursement received which is equal in amount to  the deduction taken in the prior year shall be considered as  attributable to such deduction (and hence includible in gross income);  but</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the deduction for the prior year would have been greater  but for the limitations on the maximum amount of such deduction provided  by section 213 (c), then the amount of the reimbursement attributable to  such deduction (and hence includible in gross income) shall be the  amount of the reimbursement received in a subsequent year or years  reduced by the amount disallowed as a deduction because of the maximum  limitation, but not in excess of the deduction allowed for the previous  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The application of subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this  paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples. Examples 1 and 2  reflect the maximum limitation on the medical expense deduction  applicable to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1961. Examples  3 and 4 reflect the maximum limitation on the medical expense deduction  applicable to taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 1962. For  explanation of such maximum medical expense limitations, see paragraph  (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1.
