                                Sec. 121.101  What are SBA size standards?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> SBA's size standards define whether a business entity is small  and, thus, eligible for Government programs and preferences reserved for  ``small business'' concerns. Size standards have been established for  types of economic activity, or industry, generally under the North  American Industry Classification System (NAICS).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> NAICS is described in the North American Industry Classification  Manual-United States, which is available from the National Technical  Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161; by  calling 1(800) 553-6847 or 1(703) 605-6000; or via the Internet at  http://www.ntis.gov/products/naics.aspx. The manual includes definitions  for each industry, tables showing relationships between 1997 NAICS and  1987 SICs, and a comprehensive index. NAICS assigns codes to all  economic activity within twenty broad sectors. Section 121.201 provides  a full table of small business size standards matched to the U.S. NAICS  industry codes. A full table matching a size standard with each NAICS  Industry or U.S. Industry code is also published annually by SBA in the  Federal Register.
