would result if all water were removed from the actual product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The term surfactant shall mean those methylene blue active substances amenable to measurement by the method described in ``Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and Wastes,'' 1971, Environmental Protection Agency, Analytical Quality Control Laboratory, page 131.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The term normal operation of a spray tower shall mean operation utilizing formulations that present limitted air quality problems from stack gases and associated need for extensive wet scrubbing, and without more than 6 turnarounds in a 30 consecutive day period, thus permitting essentially complete recycle of waste water.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The term air quality restricted operation of a spray tower shall mean an operation utilizing formulations (e.g., those with high non-ionic content) which require a very high rate of wet scrubbing to maintain desirable quality of stack gases, and thus generate much greater quantities of waste water than can be recycled to process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The term fast turnaround operation of a spray drying tower shall mean operation involving more than 6 changes of formulation in a 30 consecutive day period that are of such degree and type (e.g., high phosphate to no phosphate) as to require cleaning of the tower to maintain minimal product quality.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The term BOD7 shall mean the biochemical oxygen demand as determined by incubation at 20 degrees C for a period of 7 days using an acclimated seed. Agitation employing a magnetic stirrer set at 200 to 500 rpm may be used.
