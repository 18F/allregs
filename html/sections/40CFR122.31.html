                                Sec. 122.31  As a Tribe, what is my role under the NPDES storm
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">As a Tribe you may:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Be authorized to operate the NPDES program including the storm  water program, after EPA determines that you are eligible for treatment  in the same manner as a State under Sec. Sec. 123.31 through 123.34 of  this chapter. (If you do not have an authorized NPDES program, EPA  implements the program for discharges on your reservation as well as  other Indian country, generally.);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Be classified as an owner of a regulated small MS4, as defined  in Sec. 122.32. (Designation of your Tribe as an owner of a small MS4  for purposes of this part is an approach that is consistent with EPA's  1984 Indian Policy of operating on a government-to-government basis with  EPA looking to Tribes as the lead governmental authorities to address  environmental issues on their reservations as appropriate. If you  operate a separate storm sewer system that meets the definition of a  regulated small MS4, you are subject to the requirements under  Sec. Sec. 122.33 through 122.35. If you are not designated as a  regulated small MS4, you may ask EPA to designate you as such for the  purposes of this part.); or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Be a discharger of storm water associated with industrial  activity or small construction activity under Sec. Sec. 122.26(b)(14)  or (b)(15), in which case you must meet the applicable requirements.  Within Indian country, the NPDES permitting authority is generally EPA,  unless you are authorized to administer the NPDES program.  [64 FR 68842, Dec. 8, 1999]</p>
