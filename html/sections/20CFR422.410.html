However, we may send the administrative wage  garnishment order to your employer without further delay. If we sent the  administrative wage garnishment order to your employer and we do not  make our decision on your request within 60 calendar days from the date  that we received your request, we will tell your employer to stop  withholding from your disposable pay. Withholding will not resume before  we conduct the review and notify you of our decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> We may send an administrative wage garnishment order to your  employer without further delay if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You request an installment payment plan after receiving the  notice described in Sec. 422.405, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> We arrange such a plan with you, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You fail to make payments in accordance with that arrangement  for two consecutive months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Good cause for failing to request review on time. If we decide  that you had good cause for failing to request review within the 60-day  period mentioned in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, we will treat your  request for review as if we received it within that 60-day period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determining good cause. In determining whether you had good  cause, we will consider--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any circumstances that kept you from making the request on time;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whether our action misled you;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Whether you had any physical, mental, educational, or  linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the English  language) which prevented you from making a request on time or from  understanding the need to make a request on time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Examples of good cause. Examples of facts supporting good cause  include, but are not limited to, the following.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Your serious illness prevented you from contacting us yourself  or through another person.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> There was a death or serious illness in your family.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Fire or other accidental cause destroyed important records.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> You did not receive the notice described in Sec. 422.405.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> In good faith, you sent the request to another government agency  within the 60-day period, and we received the request after the end of  that period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If we issued the administrative wage garnishment order. If we  determine that you had good cause under paragraph (b) of this section  and we already had sent an administrative wage garnishment order to your  employer, we will tell your employer to stop withholding from your  disposable pay.
