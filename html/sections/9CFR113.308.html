                            <p class="depth0">Encephalomyelitis Vaccine, Venezuelan, shall be prepared from virus- bearing cell culture fluids. Only Master Seed which has been established  as pure, safe, and immunogenic shall be used for preparing seeds for  vaccine production. All serials of vaccine shall be prepared from the  first through the fifth passage from the Master Seed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Master Seed shall meet the applicable general requirements  prescribed in Sec. 113.300 except (b), and the requirements prescribed  in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each lot of Master Seed shall be tested for immunogenicity. The  selected virus dose from the lot of Master Seed shall be established as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Tests conducted by the Department have established that horses  having Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis antibody titers of 1:20 by  the hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) method or 1:40 by the serum  neutralization (SN) method were immune to challenge with virulent virus.  The immunogenicity test is based on the demonstration of a serological  response of at least that magnitude following vaccination of  serologically negative horses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At least 22 horses (20 vaccinates and 2 controls), susceptible  to Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis, shall be used as test animals.  Blood samples shall be taken from each horse and the serums individually  tested for neutralizing antibody. Horses shall be considered susceptible  if there is no neutralization at a 1:2 final serum dilution in a  constant virus-varying serum neutralization test using 60 to 300  TCID50 of Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A geometric mean titer of the vaccine produced from the highest  passage of the Master Seed shall be established using a method  acceptable to Veterinary Services before the immunogenicity test is  conducted. The 20 horses used as vaccinates shall be injected with a  predetermined quantity of vaccine virus by the method to be recommended  on the label. To confirm the dosage administered, five replicate virus  titrations shall be conducted on a sample of the vaccine virus dilution  used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Twenty-one to twenty-eight days postvaccination, blood samples  shall be drawn from all test animals. For a valid test, the controls  shall remain seronegative at 1:2 final serum dilution. In a valid test,  if at least 19 of 20 vaccinates do not have antibody titers of at least  1:20 in a hemagglutination-inhibition test or at least 1:40 in a serum  neutralization test, the Master Seed is unsatisfactory.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An Outline of Production change shall be made before authority  for use of a new lot of Master Seed shall be granted by Animal and Plant  Health Inspection Service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Test requirements for release. Each serial and subserial shall  meet the applicable general requirements prescribed in Sec. 113.300 and  special requirements in this paragraph. Any serial or subserial found  unsatisfactory by a prescribed test shall not be released.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Safety test. The mouse safety test prescribed in Sec. 113.33(b)  shall be conducted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Virus titer requirements. Final container samples of completed  product shall be tested for virus titer using the method in paragraph  (b)(3) of this section. To be eligible for release, each serial and  subserial shall have a virus titer sufficiently greater than the titer  of the vaccine used in the immunogenicity test prescribed in paragraph  (b) of this section to assure that, when tested at any time within   the expiration period, each serial and subserial shall have a virus  titer of 10\0.7\ greater than that used in the immunogenicity test, but  not less than 10\2.5\ TCID50 per dose.
