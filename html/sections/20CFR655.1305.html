Any U.S. workers who  applied or apply for the job were   or will be rejected only for lawful, job-related reasons, and those not  rejected on this basis have been or will be hired. In addition, the  employer attests that it will retain records of all rejections as  required by Sec. 655.119.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The employer is offering terms and working conditions which are  not less favorable than those offered to the H-2A worker(s) and are not  less than the minimum terms and conditions required by this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The specific job opportunity for which the employer is  requesting H-2A certification is not vacant because the former occupant  is on strike or being locked out in the course of a labor dispute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The employer will continue to cooperate with the SWA by  accepting referrals of all eligible U.S. workers who apply (or on whose  behalf an application is made) for the job opportunity until the end of  the recruitment period as specified in Sec. 655.102(f)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> During the period of employment that is the subject of the labor  certification application, the employer will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Comply with applicable Federal, State and local employment- related laws and regulations, including employment-related health and  safety laws;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide for or secure housing for those workers who are not  reasonably able to return to their permanent residence at the end of the  work day, without charge to the worker, that complies with the  applicable standards as set forth in Sec. 655.104(d);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where required, has timely requested a preoccupancy inspection  of the housing and, if one has been conducted, received certification;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Provide insurance, without charge to the worker, under a State  workers' compensation law or otherwise, that meets the requirements of  Sec. 655.104(e); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Provide transportation in compliance with all applicable  Federal, State or local laws and regulations between the worker's living  quarters (i.e., housing provided by the employer under Sec. 655.104(d))  and the employer's worksite without cost to the worker.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Upon the separation from employment of H-2A worker(s) employed  under the labor certification application, if such separation occurs  prior to the end date of the employment specified in the application,  the employer will notify the Department and DHS in writing (or any other  method specified by the Department or DHS) of the separation from  employment not later than 2 work days after such separation is  discovered by the employer.

For purposes of this  paragraph, payment includes, but is not limited to, monetary payments,  wage concessions (including deductions from wages, salary, or benefits),  kickbacks, bribes, tributes, in kind payments, and free labor. This  provision does not prohibit employers or their agents from receiving  reimbursement for costs that are the responsibility of the worker, such  as government required passport or visa fees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> The employer has contractually forbidden any foreign labor  contractor or recruiter whom the employer engages in international  recruitment of H-2A workers to seek or receive payments from prospective  employees, except as provided for in DHS regulations at 8 CFR  214.2(h)(5)(xi)(A).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> The applicant is either a fixed-site employer, an agent or  recruiter, an H-2ALC (as defined in these regulations), or an  association.</p>
