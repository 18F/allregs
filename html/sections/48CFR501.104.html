Part 570  establishes rules for the acquisition of leasehold interests in real  property. Other provisions of 48 CFR chapter 5 (GSAR) do not apply to  leases of real property unless specifically cross-reference in part 570.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Relationship to state. Some GSAR rules implement and interpret  laws and other authorities affecting procurement. A GSAR rule  specifically directed by statute has the force and effect of law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> GSAR/FAR Relationship. The GSAR may deviate from the Federal  Acquisition Regulation (FAR) if authorized. If the GSAR does not  implement the FAR, the FAR alone governs.</p>
