                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The purpose of this section is to describe the process  the FDIC will use to determine deposit and other liability account  balances for insurance coverage and receivership purposes at a failed  insured depository institution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The FDIC Cutoff Point means the point in time  the FDIC establishes after it has been appointed receiver of a failed  insured depository institution and takes control of the failed  institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Applicable Cutoff Time for a specific type of deposit  account transaction means the earlier of either the failed institution's  normal cutoff time for that specific type of transaction or the FDIC  Cutoff Point.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Close-of-Business Account Balance means the closing end-of-day  ledger balance of a deposit or other liability account on the day of  failure of an insured depository institution determined by using the  Applicable Cutoff Times. This balance may be adjusted to reflect steps  taken by the receiver to ensure that funds are not received by or  removed from the institution after the FDIC Cutoff Point.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A sweep account is an account held pursuant to a contract  between an insured depository institution and its customer involving the  pre-arranged, automated transfer of funds from a deposit account to  either another account or investment vehicle located within the  depository institution (internal sweep account), or an investment  vehicle located outside the depository institution (external sweep  account).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Principles--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In making deposit insurance determinations and  in determining the value and nature of claims against the receivership  on the institution's date of failure, the FDIC, as insurer and receiver,  will treat deposits and other liabilities of the failed institution  according to the ownership and nature of the underlying obligations  based on end-of-day ledger balances for each account using, except as  expressly provided otherwise in this section, the depository  institution's normal posting procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In its role as receiver of a failed insured depository  institution, in order to ensure the proper distribution of the failed  institution's assets under the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(11)) as of the  FDIC Cutoff Point, the FDIC will use its best efforts to take all steps  necessary to stop the generation, via transactions or transfers coming  from or going outside the institution, of new liabilities or  extinguishing existing liabilities for the depository institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> End-of-day ledger balances are subject to corrections for posted  transactions that are inconsistent with the above principles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Determining closing day balances--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In determining account  balances for insurance coverage and receivership purposes at a failed  insured depository institution, the FDIC will use Close-of-Business  Account Balances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A check posted to the Close-of-Business Account Balance but not  collected by the depository institution will be included as part of the  balance, subject to the correction of errors and omissions and  adjustments for uncollectible items that the FDIC may make in its role  as receiver of the failed depository institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In determining Close-of-Business Account Balances involving  sweep accounts:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For internal sweep accounts, the FDIC will determine the  ownership of the funds and the nature of the receivership claim based on  the records established and maintained by the institution for that  specific account or investment vehicle as of the closing day   end-of-day ledger balance. (For example, if a sweep account entails the  daily transfer of funds from a demand deposit account to a Eurodollar  account at a foreign branch of the insured depository institution, if  the institution should fail on that day, the FDIC would treat the funds  swept to the Eurodollar account, as reflected on the institution's end- of-day records, as an unsecured general creditor's claim against the  receivership.);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For external sweep accounts, the FDIC will treat swept funds  consistent with their status in the end-of-day ledger balances of the  depository institution and the external entity, as long as the transfer  of funds is completed prior to the Applicable Cutoff Time. (For example,  if funds held in connection with a money market sweep account are wired  from a customer's deposit account at the insured depository institution  to the mutual fund prior to the Applicable Cutoff Time, if the  institution should fail on that day, the FDIC would recognize that sweep  transaction as completed for claims and receivership purposes.);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For repurchase agreement sweep accounts, where, as a result of  the sweep transaction, the customer becomes either the legal owner of  identified assets subject to repurchase or obtains a perfected security  interest in those assets, the FDIC will recognize, for receivership  purposes, the customer's ownership interest or security interest in the  assets.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For deposit insurance and receivership purposes in connection  with the failure of an insured depository institution, the FDIC will  determine the rights of the depositor or other liability holder as of  the point the Close-of-Business Account Balance is calculated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Disclosure requirements. Beginning July 1, 2009, in all new  sweep account contracts, in renewals of existing sweep account contracts  and within sixty days after July 1, 2009, and no less than annually  thereafter, institutions must prominently disclose in writing to sweep  account customers whether their swept funds are deposits within the  meaning of 12 U.S.C. 1813(l). If the funds are not deposits, the  institution must further disclose the status such funds would have if  the institution failed--for example, general creditor status or secured  creditor status. Such disclosures must be consistent with how the  institution reports such funds on its quarterly Consolidated Reports of  Condition and Income or Thrift Financial Reports. The disclosure  requirements imposed under this provision do not apply to sweep accounts  where: The transfers are within a single account, or a sub-account; or  the sweep account involves only deposit-to-deposit sweeps, such as zero- balance accounts, unless the sweep results in a change in the customer's  insurance coverage.
