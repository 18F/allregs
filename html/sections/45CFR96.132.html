                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> With respect to individuals seeking treatment services, the State is required to improve (relative to fiscal year 1992) the process in the State for referring the individuals to treatment facilities that can provide to the individuals the treatment modality that is most appropriate for the individuals. Examples of how this may be accomplished include the development and implementation of a capacity management/waiting list management system; the utilization of a toll-free number for programs to report available capacity and waiting list data; and the utilization of standardized assessment procedures that facilitate the referral process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> With respect to any facility for treatment services or prevention activities that is receiving amounts from a Block Grant, continuing education in such services or activities (or both, as the case may be) shall be made available to employees of the facility who provide the services or activities. The States will ensure that such programs include a provision for continuing education for employees of the facility in its funding agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The State shall coordinate prevention and treatment activities with the provision of other appropriate services (including health, social, correctional and criminal justice, educational, vocational rehabilitation, and employment services). In evaluating compliance with this section, the Secretary will consider such factors as the existence of memoranda of understanding between various service providers/agencies and evidence that the State has included prevention and treatment services coordination in its grants and contracts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Upon the request of a State, the Secretary may provide to a State a waiver of any or all of the requirements established in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section, if the Secretary determines that, with respect to services for the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, the requirement involved is unnecessary for maintaining quality in the provision of such services in the State. In evaluating whether to grant or deny a waiver, the Secretary will rely on information drawn from the independent peer review/quality assurance activities conducted by the State. For example, a State may be eligible for a waiver of the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section if a State already has a well developed process for referring individuals to treatment facilities that can provide to the individuals the treatment modality that is most appropriate for the individuals. The Secretary will approve or deny a request for a waiver not later than 120 days after the date on which the request is made. Any waiver provided by the Secretary for paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section, will be applicable only to the fiscal year involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The State is also required to have in effect a system to protect from inappropriate disclosure patient records maintained by the State in connection with an activity funded under the program involved or by any entity which is receiving amounts from the grant

and such system shall be in compliance with all applicable State and Federal laws and regulations, including 42 CFR part 2. This system shall include provisions for employee education on the confidentiality requirements and the fact that disciplinary action may occur upon inappropriate disclosures. This requirement cannot be waived.</p>
