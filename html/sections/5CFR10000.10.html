                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> We will charge fees that recoup the full allowable direct costs we incur in processing your FOIA request. Fees may be charged for search, review or duplication. We will use the most efficient and least costly methods to comply with your request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> With regard to manual searches for records, we will charge the salary rate(s) (calculated as the basic rate of pay plus 16 percent of that basic rate to cover benefits) of the employee(s) performing the search.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In calculating charges for computer searches for records, we will charge at the actual direct cost of providing the service, including the cost of operating the central processing unit directly attributable to searching for records potentially responsive to your FOIA request and the portion of the salary of the operators/programmers performing the search.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Review fees shall be charged for requesters who make commercial use requests. Review fees shall be assessed only for the initial review--that is the review undertaken the first time we analyze the applicability of a specific exemption to a particular record or portion of a record. Records or portions of records withheld in full under an exemption that is subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed again to determine the applicability of other exemptions not previously considered. We may assess the costs for such subsequent review. Review fees are charged at the same rates as those charged for a search.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the Council determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed in accordance with this section will exceed $25.00, the Council shall notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, including a breakdown of the fees for search, review or duplication, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, the Council shall advise the requester accordingly. If the requester is a noncommercial use requester, the notice shall specify that the requester is entitled to the statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication or equivalent at no charge. For example, 100 pages burned to a single CD would be considered equivalent to 100 pages of duplication. And, if the requester is charged search fees, two hours of search time at no charge, and shall advise the requester whether those entitlements have been provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In cases in which a requester has been notified that the actual or estimated fees are in excess of $25.00, the request shall not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designates some amount of fees the requester is willing to pay, or in the case of a noncommercial use requester who has not yet been provided with the requester's statutory entitlements, designates that the requester seeks only that which can be provided by the statutory entitlements. The requester must provide the commitment or designation in writing, and must, when applicable, designate an exact dollar amount the requester is willing to pay. The Council is not required to accept payments in installments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some designated amount of fees, but the Council estimates that the total fee will exceed that amount, the Council shall toll the processing of the request when it notifies the requester of the estimated fees in excess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. The Council shall inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the amount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the request. Once the requester responds, the time to respond will resume from where it was at the date of the notification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Council shall make available its FOIA Public Liaison or other FOIA professional to assist any requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> We will charge you the full costs of providing you with the following services:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Certifying that records are true copies; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sending records by special methods such as express or certified mail.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> We may assess interest charges on an unpaid bill starting on the 31st calendar day following the day on which the billing was sent. Interest shall be at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date of the billing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> We will not charge a search fee for requests by educational institutions, non-commercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media. A search fee will be charged for a commercial use requests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Except for a commercial use request, we will not charge you for the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of search.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> If the Council fails to comply with the time limits in which to respond to a request, and if no unusual or exceptional circumstances, as those terms are defined by the FOIA, apply to the processing of the request, it may not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters requests by educational institutions (unless the records are sought for a commercial use), noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media, may not charge duplication fees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> After processing, actual fees must be equal to or exceed $25, for the Council to require payment of fees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> You may not file multiple requests, each seeking portions of a document or documents, solely for the purpose of avoiding payment of fees. When the Council reasonably believes that a requester, or a group of requesters acting in concert, has submitted requests that constitute a single request involving clearly related matters, we may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> We may not require you to make payment before we begin work to satisfy the request or to continue work on a request, unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> We estimate or determine that the allowable charges that you may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You have previously failed to pay a fee charged within 30 days of the date of billing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Upon written request, we may waive or reduce fees that are otherwise chargeable under this part. If you request a waiver or reduction in fees, you must demonstrate that a waiver or reduction in fees is in the public interest because disclosure of the requested records is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in your commercial interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In deciding whether disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of operations or activities of the government, the Council shall consider all four of the following factors:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government, with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities in order to be ``likely to contribute'' to an increased public understanding of those operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not contribute to such understanding where nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public shall be considered. It shall be presumed that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The public's understanding of the subject in question must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. However, components shall not make value judgments about whether the information at issue is ``important'' enough to be made public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, the Council shall consider the following factors:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Council shall identify any commercial interest of the requester, as defined in Sec. 10000.2, that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. Requesters shall be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A waiver or reduction of fees is justified where the public interest is greater than any identified commercial interest in disclosure. The Council ordinarily shall presume that where a news media requester has satisfied the

public interest standard, the public interest will be the interest primarily served by disclosure to that requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return shall not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver shall be granted for those records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to the component and should address the criteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester shall be required to pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.</p>
