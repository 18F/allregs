                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, an individual who would be assigned to more than 1 generation is assigned to the youngest of the generations to which that individual would be assigned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exception. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, an adopted individual (as defined in this paragraph) will be treated as a member of the generation that is one generation below the adoptive parent for purposes of determining whether a transfer to the adopted individual from the adoptive parent (or the spouse or former spouse of the adoptive parent, or a lineal descendant of a grandparent of the adoptive parent) is subject to chapter 13 of the Internal Revenue Code. For purposes of this paragraph (b), an adopted individual is an individual who is--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Legally adopted by the adoptive parent;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A descendant of a parent of the adoptive parent (or the spouse or former spouse of the adoptive parent);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Under the age of 18 at the time of the adoption; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Not adopted primarily for the purpose of avoiding GST tax. The determination of whether an adoption is primarily for GST tax-avoidance purposes is made based upon all of the facts and circumstances. The most significant factor is whether there is a bona fide parent/child relationship between the adoptive parent and the adopted individual, in which the adoptive parent has fully assumed all significant responsibilities for the care and raising of the adopted child. Other factors may include (but are not limited to), at the time of the adoption--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The age of the adopted individual (for example, the younger the age of the adopted individual, or the age of the youngest of siblings who are all adopted together, the more likely the

adoption will not be considered primarily for GST tax-avoidance purposes); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The relationship between the adopted individual and the individual's parents (for example, objective evidence of the absence or incapacity of the parents may indicate that the adoption is not primarily for GST tax-avoidance purposes).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special rules--(1) Corresponding generation adjustment. If an individual's generation assignment is adjusted with respect to a transfer in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, a corresponding adjustment with respect to that transfer is made to the generation assignment of each--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Corresponding generation adjustment. If an individual's generation assignment is adjusted with respect to a transfer in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, a corresponding adjustment with respect to that transfer is made to the generation assignment of each--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Spouse or former spouse of that individual;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Descendant of that individual; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Spouse or former spouse of each descendant of that individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Continued application of generation assignment. If a transfer to a trust would be a generation-skipping transfer but for paragraph (b) of this section, any generation assignment determined under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section continues to apply in determining whether any subsequent distribution from (or termination of an interest in) the portion of the trust attributable to that transfer is a generation-skipping transfer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of this section:</p><p class="depth2">Example. T has a child, C. C has a 20-year-old child, GC. T legally adopts GC and transfers $100,000 to GC. GC's generation assignment is determined by section 2651(b)(1) and GC is assigned to the generation that is two generations below T. In addition, because T has legally adopted GC, GC is generally treated as a child of T under state law. Under these circumstances, GC is an individual who is assigned to more than one generation and the exception in Sec. 26.2651-2(b) does not apply. Thus, the special rule under section 2651(f)(1) applies and GC is assigned to the generation that is two generations below T. GC remains a skip person with respect to T and the transfer to GC is a direct skip.
