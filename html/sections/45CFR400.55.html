                            <p class="depth0">A State, or the agency(s) responsible for the provision of RCA, must  make available to refugees the written policies of the RCA program,  including agency policies regarding eligibility standards, the duration  and amount of cash assistance payments, the requirements for  participation in services, the penalties for non-cooperation, and client  rights and responsibilities to ensure that refugees understand what they  are eligible for, what is expected of them, and what protections are  available to them. The State, or the agency(s) responsible for the  provision of RCA, must ensure that agency policy materials and all  notices required in Sec. Sec. 400.54, 400.82, and 400.83, are made  available in written form in English and in appropriate languages where  a significant number or proportion of the recipient population needs  information in a particular language. In regard to refugee language  groups that constitute a small number or proportion of the recipient  population, the State, or the agency(s) responsible for the provision of  RCA, at a minimum, must use an alternative method, such as verbal  translation in the refugee's native language, to ensure that the content  of the agency's policies is effectively communicated to each refugee.</p><p class="depth0">Public/Private RCA Program</p>
