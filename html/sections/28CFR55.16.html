                            <p class="depth0">Compliance with the requirements of section 4(f)(4) and section  203(c) is best measured by results. A jurisdiction is more likely to  achieve compliance with   these requirements if it has worked with the cooperation of and to the  satisfaction of organizations representing members of the applicable  language minority group. In planning its compliance with section 4(f)(4)  or section 203(c), a jurisdiction may, where alternative methods of  compliance are available, use less costly methods if they are equivalent  to more costly methods in their effectiveness.</p>
