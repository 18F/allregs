                            <p class="depth0">Before selecting an individual or organization to act as your representative payee, we will perform an investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Nature of the investigation. As part of the investigation, we do the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conduct a face-to-face interview with the payee applicant unless it is impracticable as explained in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Require the payee applicant to submit documented proof of identity, unless information establishing identity has recently been submitted with an application for title II, VIII or XVI benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Verify the payee applicant's Social Security account number or employer identification number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Determine whether the payee applicant has been convicted of a violation of section 208, 811 or 1632 of the Social Security Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Determine whether the payee applicant has previously served as a representative payee and if any previous appointment as payee was revoked or terminated for misusing title II, VIII or XVI benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Use our records to verify the payee applicant's employment and/or direct receipt of title II, VIII, or XVI benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Verify the payee applicant's concern for the beneficiary with the beneficiary's custodian or other interested person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Require the payee applicant to provide adequate information showing his or her relationship to the beneficiary and to describe his or her responsibility for the care of the beneficiary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Determine whether the payee applicant is a creditor of the beneficiary (see Sec. 416.622(d)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Subsequent face-to-face interviews. After holding a face-to-face interview with a payee applicant, subsequent face-to-face interviews are not required if that applicant continues to be qualified and currently is acting as a payee, unless we determine, within our discretion, that a new face-to-face interview is necessary. We base this decision on the payee's past performance and knowledge of and compliance with our reporting requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Impracticable. We may consider a face-to-face interview impracticable if it would cause the payee applicant undue hardship. For example, the payee applicant would have to travel a great distance to the field office. In this situation, we may conduct the investigation to determine the payee applicant's suitability to serve as a representative payee without a face-to-face interview.
