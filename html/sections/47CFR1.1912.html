                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The term administrative offset has the meaning  provided in Sec. 1.1901.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> This section does not apply to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Debts arising under the Social Security Act, except as provided  in 42 U.S.C. 404;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Payments made under the Social Security Act, except as provided  for in 31 U.S.C. 3716(c) (see 31 CFR 285.4, Federal Benefit Offset);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Debts arising under, or payments made under, the Internal  Revenue Code (see 31 CFR 285.2, Tax Refund Offset) or the tariff laws of  the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Offsets against Federal salaries to the extent these standards  are inconsistent with regulations published to implement such offsets  under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 31 U.S.C. 3716 (see 5 CFR part 550, subpart K,  and 31 CFR 285.7, Federal Salary Offset);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Offsets under 31 U.S.C. 3728 against a judgment obtained by a  debtor against the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Offsets or recoupments under common law, State law, or Federal  statutes specifically prohibiting offsets or recoupments of particular  types of debts; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Offsets in the course of judicial proceedings, including  bankruptcy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Unless otherwise provided for by contract or law, debts or  payments that are not subject to administrative offset under 31 U.S.C.  3716 may be collected by administrative offset under the common law or  other applicable statutory authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Unless otherwise provided by law, administrative offset of  payments under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 3716 to collect a debt may not  be conducted more than 10 years after the Government's right to collect  the debt first accrued, unless facts material to the Government's right  to collect the debt were not known and could not reasonably have been  known by the official or officials of the Government who were charged  with the responsibility to discover and collect such debts. This  limitation does not apply to debts reduced to a judgment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> In bankruptcy cases, the Commission will seek legal advice from  its counsel concerning the impact of the Bankruptcy Code, particularly  11 U.S.C. 106, 362, and 553, on pending or contemplated collections by  offset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Mandatory centralized administrative offset. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Commission  is required to refer past due, legally enforceable nontax debts which  are over 120 days delinquent to the Treasury for   collection by centralized administrative offset. Debts which are less  than 120 days delinquent also may be referred to the Treasury for this  purpose. See FCCS for debt certification requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The names and taxpayer identifying numbers (TINs) of debtors who  owe debts referred to the Treasury as described in paragraph (b)(1) of  this section shall be compared to the names and TINs on payments to be  made by Federal disbursing officials. Federal disbursing officials  include disbursing officials of Treasury, the Department of Defense, the  United States Postal Service, other Government corporations, and  disbursing officials of the United States designated by the Treasury.  When the name and TIN of a debtor match the name and TIN of a payee and  all other requirements for offset have been met, the payment will be  offset to satisfy the debt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Federal disbursing officials will notify the debtor/payee in  writing that an offset has occurred to satisfy, in part or in full, a  past due, legally enforceable delinquent debt. The notice shall include  a description of the type and amount of the payment from which the  offset was taken, the amount of offset that was taken, the identity of  the creditor agency requesting the offset, and a contact point within  the creditor agency who will respond to questions regarding the offset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Before referring a delinquent debt to the Treasury for  administrative offset, and subject to any agreement and/or waiver to the  contrary by the debtor, the Commission shall ensure that offsets are  initiated only after the debtor:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Has been sent written notice of the type and amount of the debt,  the intention of the Commission to use administrative offset to collect  the debt, and an explanation of the debtor's rights under 31 U.S.C.  3716; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The debtor has been given:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The opportunity to request within 15 days of the date of the  written notice, after which opportunity is deemed waived, by the debtor,  to inspect and copy Commission records related to the debt;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The opportunity, unless otherwise waived by the debtor, for a  review within the Commission of the determination of indebtedness; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The opportunity to request within 15 days of the date of the  written notice, after which the opportunity is deemed waived by the  debtor, for the debtor to make a written agreement to repay the debt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Commission may omit the procedures set forth in paragraph  (b)(4)(i) of this section when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The offset is in the nature of a recoupment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The debt arises under a contract as set forth in Cecile  Industries, Inc. v. Cheney, 995 F.2d 1052 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (notice and  other procedural protections set forth in 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) do not  supplant or restrict established procedures for contractual offsets  accommodated by the Contracts Disputes Act); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> In the case of non-centralized administrative offsets conducted  under paragraph (c) of this section, the Commission first learns of the  existence of the amount owed by the debtor when there is insufficient  time before payment would be made to the debtor/payee to allow for prior  notice and an opportunity for review. When prior notice and an  opportunity for review are omitted, the Commission shall give the debtor  such notice and an opportunity for review as soon as practicable and  shall promptly refund any money ultimately found not to have been owed  to the Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> When the Commission previously has given a debtor any of the  required notice and review opportunities with respect to a particular  debt (see 31 CFR 901.2), the Commission need not duplicate such notice  and review opportunities before administrative offset may be initiated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Before the Commission refers delinquent debts to the Treasury,  the Office of Managing Director must certify, in a form acceptable to  the Treasury, that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The debt(s) is (are) past due and legally enforceable; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Commission has complied with all due process requirements  under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) and its regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Payments that are prohibited by law from being offset are exempt  from   centralized administrative offset. The Treasury shall exempt payments  under means-tested programs from centralized administrative offset when  requested in writing by the head of the payment certifying or  authorizing agency. Also, the Treasury may exempt other classes of  payments from centralized offset upon the written request of the head of  the payment certifying or authorizing agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Benefit payments made under the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.  301 et seq.), part B of the Black Lung Benefits Act (30 U.S.C. 921 et  seq.), and any law administered by the Railroad Retirement Board (other  than tier 2 benefits), may be offset only in accordance with Treasury  regulations, issued in consultation with the Social Security  Administration, the Railroad Retirement Board, and the Office of  Management and Budget. See 31 CFR 285.4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716(f), the Treasury may waive the  provisions of the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988  concerning matching agreements and post-match notification and  verification (5 U.S.C. 552a(o) and (p)) for centralized administrative  offset upon receipt of a certification from a creditor agency that the  due process requirements enumerated in 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) have been met.  The certification of a debt in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this  section will satisfy this requirement. If such a waiver is granted, only  the Data Integrity Board of the Department of the Treasury is required  to oversee any matching activities, in accordance with 31 U.S.C.  3716(g). This waiver authority does not apply to offsets conducted under  paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Non-centralized administrative offset. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Generally, non- centralized administrative offsets are ad hoc case-by-case offsets that  the Commission conducts, at the Commission's discretion, internally or  in cooperation with the agency certifying or authorizing payments to the  debtor. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, when centralized  administrative offset is not available or appropriate, past due, legally  enforceable nontax delinquent debts may be collected through non- centralized administrative offset. In these cases, a creditor agency may  make a request directly to a payment-authorizing agency to offset a  payment due a debtor to collect a delinquent debt. For example, it may  be appropriate for a creditor agency to request that the Office of  Personnel Management (OPM) offset a Federal employee's lump-sum payment  upon leaving Government service to satisfy an unpaid advance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Commission will make reasonable effort to ensure that such  offsets may occur only after:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The debtor has been provided due process as set forth in  paragraph (b)(4) of this section (subject to any waiver by the debtor);  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The payment authorizing agency has received written  certification from the Commission that the debtor owes the past due,  legally enforceable delinquent debt in the amount stated, and that the  creditor agency has fully complied with its regulations concerning  administrative offset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Payment authorizing agencies shall comply with offset requests  by creditor agencies to collect debts owed to the United States, unless  the offset would not be in the best interests of the United States with  respect to the program of the payment authorizing agency, or would  otherwise be contrary to law. Appropriate use should be made of the  cooperative efforts of other agencies in effecting collection by  administrative offset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> When collecting multiple debts by non-centralized administrative  offset, agencies should apply the recovered amounts to those debts in  accordance with the best interests of the United States, as determined  by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, particularly the  applicable statute of limitations.
