                                Sec. 553.25  Conditions for use of compensatory time
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section 7(o)(5) of the FLSA provides that any employee of a  public agency who has accrued compensatory time and requested use of  this compensatory time, shall be permitted to use such time off within a  ``reasonable period'' after making the request, if such use does not  ``unduly disrupt'' the operations of the agency. This provision,  however, does not apply to ``other compensatory time'' (as defined below  in Sec. 553.28), including compensatory time accrued for overtime  worked prior to April 15, 1986.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Compensatory time cannot be used as a means to avoid statutory  overtime compensation. An employee has the right to use compensatory  time earned and must not be coerced to accept more compensatory time  than an employer can realistically and in good faith expect to be able  to grant within a reasonable period of his or her making a request for  use of such time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reasonable period. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether a request to use compensatory  time has   been granted within a ``reasonable period'' will be determined by  considering the customary work practices within the agency based on the  facts and circumstances in each case. Such practices include, but are  not limited to (a) the normal schedule of work, (b) anticipated peak  workloads based on past experience, (c) emergency requirements for staff  and services, and (d) the availability of qualified substitute staff.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The use of compensatory time in lieu of cash payment for  overtime must be pursuant to some form of agreement or understanding  between the employer and the employee (or the representative of the  employee) reached prior to the performance of the work. (See Sec.  553.23.) To the extent that the (conditions under which an employee can  take compensatory time off are contained in an agreement or  understanding as defined in Sec. 553.23, the terms of such agreement or  understanding will govern the meaning of ``reasonable period''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Unduly disrupt. When an employer receives a request for  compensatory time off, it shall be honored unless to do so would be  ``unduly disruptive'' to the agency's operations. Mere inconvenience to  the employer is an insufficient basis for denial of a request for  compensatory time off. (See H. Rep. 99-331, p. 23.) For an agency to  turn down a request from an employee for compensatory time off requires  that it should reasonably and in good faith anticipate that it would  impose an unreasonable burden on the agency's ability to provide  services of acceptable quality and quantity for the public during the  time requested without the use of the employee's services.
