Sections 404.999b- 404.999d explain who may be reimbursed for travel expenses, the types of  travel expenses that are reimbursable, and when and how to claim  reimbursement. Generally, the agency that requests you to travel will be  the agency that reimburses you. No later than when it notifies you of  the examination or hearing described in Sec. 404.999b(a), that agency  will give you information about the right to travel reimbursement, the  right to advance payment and how to request it, the rules on means of  travel and unusual travel costs, and the need to submit receipts.

If a State agency reimburses you, the  reimbursement rates shall be determined by the rules in Secs. 404.999b  through 404.999d and that agency's rules and regulations and may differ  from one agency to another and also may differ from the Federal  reimbursement rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When public transportation is used, reimbursement will be made  for the actual costs incurred, subject to the restrictions in paragraph  (a)(2) of this section on reimbursement for first-class air travel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When travel is by a privately owned vehicle, reimbursement will  be made at the current Federal or State   mileage rate specified for that geographic location plus the actual  costs of tolls and parking, if travel by a privately owned vehicle is  determined appropriate under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.  Otherwise, the amount of reimbursement for travel by privately owned  vehicle cannot exceed the total cost of the most economical public  transportation available for travel between the same two points. Total  cost includes the cost for all the authorized travelers who travel in  the same privately owned vehicle. Advance approval of travel by  privately owned vehicle is not required (but could give you assurance of  its approval).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Sometimes your health condition dictates a mode of  transportation different from the most economical and expeditious.
