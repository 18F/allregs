If the PBGC determines that a plan is sufficient for guaranteed benefits but not for benefit liabilities or is sufficient for benefit liabilities, the PBGC will issue to the plan administrator a distribution notice advising the plan administrator--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To issue notices of benefit distribution in accordance with Sec. 4041.48;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To close out the plan in accordance with Sec. 4041.50;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To file a timely post-distribution certification with the PBGC in accordance with Sec. 4041.50(b); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> That either the plan administrator or the contributing sponsor must preserve and maintain plan records in accordance with Sec. 4041.5.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Alternative treatment of majority owner's benefit.
