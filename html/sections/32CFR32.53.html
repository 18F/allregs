                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This section sets forth requirements for record retention and access to records for awards to recipients. DoD Components shall not impose any other record retention or access requirements upon recipients.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to an award shall be retained for a period of three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report. The only exceptions are the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records shall be retained until all litigation, claims or audit findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds shall be retained for 3 years after final disposition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When records are transferred to or maintained by the DoD Component that made the award, the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to the recipient.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, and related records, for which retention requirements are specified in paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Copies of original records may be substituted for the original records if authorized by the grants officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The grants officer shall request that recipients transfer certain records to DoD Component custody when he or she determines that the records possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate recordkeeping, a grants officer may make arrangements for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for joint use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> DoD Components, the Inspector General, Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books, documents, papers, or other records of recipients that are pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, transcripts and copies of such documents. This right also includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents. The rights of access in this paragraph are not limited to the required retention period, but shall last as long as records are retained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Unless required by statute, no DoD Component shall place restrictions on recipients that limit public access to the records of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when the DoD Component can demonstrate that such records shall be kept confidential and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if the records had belonged to the DoD Component making the award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. Paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section apply to the following types of documents, and their supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If submitted for negotiation. If the recipient submits an indirect-cost proposal, plan, or other computation to the Federal agency responsible for negotiating the recipient's indirect cost rate, as the basis for negotiation of the rate, or the subrecipient submits such a proposal, plan, or computation to the recipient, then the 3-year retention period for its supporting records starts on the date of such submission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If not submitted for negotiation. If the recipient is not required to submit

to the cognizant Federal agency or the subrecipient is not required to submit to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year retention period for the proposal, plan, or other computation and its supporting records starts at the end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If the information described in this section is maintained on a computer, recipients shall retain the computer data on a reliable medium for the time periods prescribed. Recipients may transfer computer data in machine readable form from one reliable computer medium to another. Recipients' computer data retention and transfer procedures shall maintain the integrity, reliability, and security of the original computer data. Recipients shall also maintain an audit trail describing the data transfer. For the record retention time periods prescribed in this section, recipients shall not destroy, discard, delete, or write over such computer data.</p><p class="depth2">Termination and Enforcement</p>
