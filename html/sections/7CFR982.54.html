                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Bonding. Compliance by any handler with the requirements of  Sec. 982.50 when restricted hazelnuts may be withheld shall be  temporarily deferred to any date requested by the handler, but not later  than 60 days prior to the end of the marketing year. Such deferment  shall be conditioned upon the voluntary execution and delivery by the  handler to the Board of a written undertaking before beginning to handle  merchantable hazelnuts during the   marketing year. Such written undertaking shall be secured by a bond or  bonds with a surety or sureties acceptable to the Board that on or prior  to such date the handler will have fully satisfied the restricted  obligation required by Sec. 982.50, subject to any adjustment pursuant  to Sec. 982.51.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Bonding requirement. Such bond or bonds shall, at all times  during their effective period, be in such amounts that the aggregate  thereof shall be no less than the total bonding value of the handler's  deferred restricted obligation. The bonding value shall be the deferred  restricted obligation poundage multiplied by the applicable bonding  rate. The cost of such bond or bonds shall be borne by the handler  filing same.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Bonding rate. Said bonding rate shall be an amount per pound as  established by the Board. Such bonding rate shall be based on the  estimated value of restricted credits for the current marketing year.  Until bonding rates for a marketing year are fixed, the rates in effect  for the preceding marketing year shall continue in effect. The Board  should make any necessary adjustments once such new rates are fixed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Restricted credit purchases. Any sums collected through default  of a handler on the handler's bond shall be used by the Board to  purchase restricted credits from handlers, who have such restricted  credits in excess of their needs, and are willing to part with them. The  Board shall at all times purchase the lowest priced restricted credits  offered, and the purchases shall be made from the various handlers as  nearly as practicable in proportion to the quantity of their respective  offerings of the restricted credits to be purchased.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Unexpended sums. Any unexpended sums which have been collected  by the Board through default of a handler on the handler's bond,  remaining in the possession of the Board at the end of a marketing year,  shall be used to reimburse the Board for its expenses, including  administrative and other costs incurred in the collection of such sums,  and in the purchase of restricted credits as provided in paragraph (d)  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Transfer of restricted credit purchases. Restricted credits  purchased as provided for in this section shall be turned over to those  handlers who have defaulted on their bonds for liquidation of their  restricted obligation. The quantity delivered to each handler shall be  that quantity represented by sums collected through default.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Collection upon bonds. Collection upon any defaulted bond shall  be deemed a satisfaction of the restricted obligation represented by the  collection.
