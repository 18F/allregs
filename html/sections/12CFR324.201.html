                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This subpart F establishes risk-based capital requirements for FDIC-supervised institutions with significant exposure to market risk, provides methods for these FDIC-supervised institutions to calculate their standardized measure for market risk and, if applicable, advanced measure for market risk, and establishes public disclosure requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Applicability. (1) This subpart F applies to any FDIC-supervised institution with aggregate trading assets and trading liabilities (as reported in the FDIC-supervised institution's most recent quarterly Call Report), equal to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 10 percent or more of quarter-end total assets as reported on the most recent quarterly Call Report; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> $1 billion or more.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The FDIC may apply this subpart to any FDIC-supervised institution if the FDIC deems it necessary or appropriate because of the level of market risk of the FDIC-supervised institution or to ensure safe and sound banking practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The FDIC may exclude an FDIC-supervised institution that meets the criteria of paragraph (b)(1) of this section from application of this subpart if the FDIC determines that the exclusion is appropriate based on the level of market risk of the FDIC-supervised institution and is consistent with safe and sound banking practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reservation of authority (1) The FDIC may require an FDIC-supervised institution to hold an amount of capital greater than otherwise required under this subpart if the FDIC determines that the FDIC-supervised institution's capital requirement for market risk as calculated under this subpart is not commensurate with the market risk of the FDIC-supervised institution's covered positions. In making determinations under paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section, the FDIC will apply notice and response procedures generally in the same manner as the notice and response procedures set forth in Sec. 324.5(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the FDIC determines that the risk-based capital requirement calculated under this subpart by the FDIC-supervised institution for one or more covered positions or portfolios of covered positions is not commensurate with the risks associated with those positions or portfolios, the FDIC may require the FDIC-supervised institution to assign a different risk-based capital requirement to the positions or portfolios that more accurately reflects the risk of the positions or portfolios.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The FDIC may also require an FDIC-supervised institution to calculate risk-based capital requirements for specific positions or portfolios under this subpart, or under subpart D or subpart E of this part, as appropriate, to more accurately reflect the risks of the positions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Nothing in this subpart limits the authority of the FDIC under any other provision of law or regulation to take supervisory or enforcement action, including action to address unsafe or unsound practices or conditions, deficient capital levels, or violations of law.</p>
