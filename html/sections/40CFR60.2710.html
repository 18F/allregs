Consistent with the definition of CISWI unit, you are subject to the requirements of this subpart at least 6 months following the last date of solid waste combustion. Solid waste combustion is ceased when solid waste is not in the combustion chamber (i.e., the solid waste feed to the combustor has been cut off for a period of time not less than the solid waste residence time).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If you cease combusting solid waste you must be in compliance with any newly applicable standards on the effective date of the waste-to-fuel switch. The effective date of the waste-to-fuel switch is a date selected by you, that must be at least 6 months from the date that you ceased combusting solid waste, consistent with Sec. 60.2710(a)(2). Your source must remain in compliance with this subpart until the effective date of the waste-to-fuel switch.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If you own or operate an existing commercial or industrial combustion unit that combusted a fuel or non-waste material, and you commence or recommence combustion of solid waste, you are subject to the provisions of this subpart as of the first day you introduce or reintroduce solid waste to the combustion chamber, and this date constitutes the effective date of the fuel-to-waste switch. You must complete all initial compliance demonstrations for any Section 112 standards that are applicable to your facility before you commence or recommence combustion of solid waste. You must provide 30 days prior notice of the effective date of the waste-to-fuel switch. The notification must identify:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name of the owner or operator of the CISWI unit, the location of the source, the emissions unit(s) that will cease burning solid waste, and the date of the notice;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The currently applicable subcategory under this subpart, and any 40 CFR part 63 subpart and subcategory that will be applicable after you cease combusting solid waste;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The fuel(s), non-waste material(s) and solid waste(s) the CISWI unit is currently combusting and has combusted over the past 6 months, and the fuel(s) or non-waste materials the unit will commence combusting;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The date on which you became subject to the currently applicable emission limits;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The date upon which you will cease combusting solid waste, and the

required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), and any scheduled maintenance as defined in your site-specific monitoring plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> You must use all the data collected during all energy recovery unit or waste-burning kiln operating hours in assessing the compliance with your operating limit except:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any data collected during monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, or required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities conducted during monitoring system malfunctions are not used in calculations (report any such periods in your annual deviation report);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any data collected during periods when the monitoring system is out of control as specified in your site-specific monitoring plan, repairs associated with periods when the monitoring system is out of control, or required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities conducted during out-of-control periods are not used in calculations (report emissions or operating levels and report any such periods in your annual deviation report);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any PM CPMS data recorded during periods of CEMS data during startup and shutdown, as defined in this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> You must record and make available upon request results of PM CPMS system performance audits, as well as the dates and duration of periods from when the PM CPMS is out of control until completion of the corrective actions necessary to return the PM CPMS to operation consistent with your site-specific monitoring plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> For any deviation of the 30-day rolling average PM CPMS average value from the established operating parameter limit, you must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Within 48 hours of the deviation, visually inspect the air pollution control device;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If inspection of the air pollution control device identifies the cause of the deviation, take corrective action as soon as possible and return the PM CPMS measurement to within the established value; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Within 30 days of the deviation or at the time of the annual compliance test, whichever comes first, conduct a PM emissions compliance test to determine compliance with the PM emissions limit and to verify. Within 45 days of the deviation, you must re-establish the CPMS operating limit. You are not required to conduct additional testing for any deviations that occur between the time of the original deviation and the PM emissions compliance test required under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> PM CPMS deviations leading to more than four required performance tests in a 12-month process operating period (rolling monthly) constitute a violation of this subpart.
