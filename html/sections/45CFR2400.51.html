                            <p class="depth0">The Institute is accredited for six graduate semester credits by the university at which it is held. It is expected that the universities at which Fellows are pursuing their graduate study will, upon Fellows' satisfactory completion of the Institute, accept these credits or their credit-hour equivalent upon transfer from the university at which the Institute is held in fulfillment of the minimum number of credits required for Fellows' graduate degrees. Satisfactory completion of the Institute will fulfill 6 of the Foundation's 12 semester credits required in graduate study of the history and development of the Constitution. Fellows, with the Foundation's assistance, are strongly encouraged to make good faith efforts to have their universities incorporate the Institute into their Plan of Study and accept the 6 Institute credits toward the minimum number of credits required for their master's degrees.</p>
