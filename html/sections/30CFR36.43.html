                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Samples shall be taken to determine the composition of the exhaust gas while the engine is operated at loads and speeds prescribed by MSHA

to determine the volume of air (ventilation) required to dilute the exhaust gas (see Sec. 36.45). The engine shall be at temperature equilibrium before exhaust-gas samples are collected or other test data are observed. At all test conditions the intake mixture shall contain 1.5 0.1 percent, by volume, of Pittsburgh natural gas (see footnote 3) in the air. Test observations shall include the rate of fuel consumption, pressures, temperatures, and other data significant in the safe operation of diesel equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exhaust-gas samples shall be analyzed for carbon dioxide, oxygen, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, methane, nitrogen, oxides of nitrogen, and aldehydes, or any other constituent prescribed by MSHA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The intake and exhaust systems shall be complete with all component equipment such as air cleaners, flame arresters, and exhaust cooling systems. The performance of component equipment shall be observed to determine whether it functions properly.
