                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council) has the  responsibility of adjusting each acquisition-related dollar threshold on  October 1, of each year that is evenly divisible by five. Acquisition- related dollar thresholds are defined as dollar thresholds that are  specified in law as a factor in defining the scope of the applicability  of a policy, procedure, requirement, or restriction provided in that law  to the procurement of property or services by an executive agency as  determined by the FAR Council. 41 U.S.C. 431a(c). Part 125, Government  Contracting Programs, contains acquisition-related dollar thresholds  subject to inflationary adjustments. The FAR Council shall publish a  notice of the adjusted dollar thresholds in the Federal Register. The  adjusted dollar thresholds shall take effect on the date of publication.
