                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. For purposes of section 1411 and the regulations thereunder, net investment income means the excess (if any) of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Gross income from interest, dividends, annuities, royalties, and rents, except to the extent excluded by the ordinary course of a trade or business exception described in paragraph (b) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Other gross income derived from a trade or business described in Sec. 1.1411-5; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Net gain (to the extent taken into account in computing taxable income) attributable to the disposition of property, except to the extent excluded by the exception described in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(A) of this section for gain or loss attributable to property held in a trade or business not described in Sec. 1.1411-5; over</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The deductions allowed by subtitle A that are properly allocable to such gross income or net gain (as determined in paragraph (f) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Ordinary course of a trade or business exception. Gross income described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is excluded from net investment income if it is derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business not described in Sec. 1.1411-5. See Sec. 1.1411-6 for rules regarding working capital. To determine whether gross income described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is derived in a trade or business, the following rules apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the case of an individual, estate, or trust that owns or engages in a trade or business directly (or indirectly through ownership of an interest in an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner under Sec. 301.7701-3), the determination of whether gross income described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is derived in a trade or business is made at the individual, estate, or trust level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of an individual, estate, or trust that owns an interest in a passthrough entity (for example, a partnership or S corporation), and that entity is engaged in a trade or business, the determination of whether gross income described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Derived in a trade or business described in Sec. 1.1411-5(a)(1) is made at the owner level; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Derived in a trade or business described in Sec. 1.1411-5(a)(2) is made at the entity level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (b). For purposes of these examples, assume that the taxpayer is a United States citizen, uses a calendar taxable year, and Year 1 and all subsequent years are taxable years in which section 1411 is in effect:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Multiple passthrough entities. A, an individual, owns an interest in UTP, a partnership, which is engaged in a trade or business. UTP owns an interest in LTP, also a partnership, which is not engaged in a trade or business. LTP receives $10,000 in dividends, $5,000 of which is allocated to A through UTP. The $5,000 of dividends is not derived in a trade or business because LTP is not engaged in a trade or business. This is true even though UTP is engaged in a trade or business. Accordingly, the ordinary course of a trade or business exception described in paragraph (b) of this section does not apply, and A's $5,000 of dividends is net investment income under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Multiple passthrough entities. B, an individual, owns an interest in UTP2, a partnership, which is not engaged in a trade or business. UTP2 owns an interest in LTP2, also a partnership, which is engaged in a commercial lending trade or business. LTP2 is not engaged in a trade or business described in Sec. 1.1411-5(a)(2). LTP2's trade or business is not a passive activity (within the meaning of section 469) with respect to B. LTP2 earns $10,000 of interest income from its trade or business which is allocated to B through UTP2. Although UTP2 is not engaged in a trade or business, the $10,000 of interest income is derived in the ordinary course of LTP2's lending trade or business. Because LTP2 is not engaged in a trade or business described in Sec. 1.1411-5(a)(2) and because LTP2's trade or business is not a passive activity with respect to B (as described in Sec. 1.1411-5(a)(1)), the ordinary course of a trade or business exception described in paragraph (b) of this section applies, and B's $10,000 of interest is not included as net investment income under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Entity engaged in trading in financial instruments. C, an individual, owns an interest in PRS, a partnership, which is engaged in a trade or business of trading in financial instruments (as defined in Sec. 1.1411-5(a)(2)). PRS' trade or business is not a passive activity (within the meaning of section 469) with respect to C. In addition, C is not directly engaged in a trade or business of trading in financial instruments or commodities. PRS earns interest of $50,000, and C's distributive share of the interest is $25,000. Because PRS is engaged in a trade or business described in Sec. 1.1411-5(a)(2), the ordinary course of a trade or business exception described in paragraph (b) of this section does not apply, and C's $25,000 distributive share of the interest is net investment income under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Application of ordinary course of a trade or business exception. D, an individual, owns stock in S corporation, S. S is engaged in a banking trade or business (that is not a trade or business of trading in financial instruments or commodities), and S's trade or business is not a passive activity (within the meaning of section 469) with respect to D because D materially participates in the activity. S earns $100,000 of interest in the ordinary course of its trade or business, of which $5,000 is D's pro rata share. For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the interest income is derived in the ordinary course of S's banking business because it is not working capital under section 1411(c)(3) and Sec. 1.1411-6(a) (because it is considered to be derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business under the principles of Sec. 1.469-2T(c)(3)(ii)(A)). Because S is not engaged in a trade or business described in Sec. 1.1411-5(a)(2) and because S's trade or business is not a passive activity with respect to D (as described in Sec. 1.1411-5(a)(1)), the ordinary course of a trade or business exception described in paragraph (b) of this section applies, and D's $5,000 of interest is not included under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Other gross income from a trade or business described in Sec. 1.1411-5. For a trade or business described in Sec. 1.1411-5, paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section includes all other gross income (within the meaning of section 61) that is not gross income described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section or net gain described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Net gain. This paragraph (d) describes special rules for purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Definition of disposition. For purposes of section 1411 and the regulations thereunder, the term disposition means a sale, exchange, transfer, conversion, cash settlement, cancellation, termination, lapse, expiration, or other disposition (including a deemed disposition, for example, under section 877A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Limitation. The calculation of net gain may not be less than zero. Losses allowable under section 1211(b) are permitted to offset gain from the disposition of assets other than capital assets that are subject to section 1411.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Net gain attributable to the disposition of property--(i) General rule. Net gain attributable to the disposition of property is the gain described in section 61(a)(3) recognized from the disposition of property reduced, but not below zero, by losses deductible under section 165, including losses attributable to casualty, theft, and abandonment or other worthlessness. The rules in subchapter O of chapter 1 and the regulations thereunder apply. See, for example, Sec. 1.61-6(b). For purposes of this paragraph, net gain includes, but is not limited to, gain or loss attributable to the disposition of property from the investment of working capital (as defined in Sec. 1.1411-6); gain or loss attributable to the disposition of a life insurance contract; and gain attributable to the disposition of an annuity contract to the extent the sales price of the annuity exceeds the annuity's surrender value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. Net gain attributable to the disposition of property is the gain described in section 61(a)(3) recognized from the disposition of property reduced, but not below zero, by losses deductible under section 165, including losses attributable to casualty, theft, and abandonment or other worthlessness. The rules in subchapter O of chapter 1 and the regulations thereunder apply. See, for example, Sec. 1.61-6(b). For purposes of this paragraph, net gain includes, but is not limited to, gain or loss attributable to the disposition of property from the investment of working capital (as defined in Sec. 1.1411-6); gain or loss attributable to the disposition of a life insurance contract; and gain attributable to the disposition of an annuity contract to the extent the sales price of the annuity exceeds the annuity's surrender value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (d)(3). For purposes of these examples, assume that the taxpayer is a United States citizen, uses a calendar taxable year, and Year 1 and all subsequent years are taxable years in which section 1411 is in effect:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In Year 1, A, an unmarried individual, realizes a capital loss of $40,000 on the sale of P stock and realizes a capital gain of $10,000 on the sale of Q stock, resulting in a net capital loss of $30,000. Both P and Q are C corporations. A has no other capital gain or capital loss in Year 1. In addition, A receives wages of $300,000 and earns $5,000 of gross income from interest. For income tax purposes, under section 1211(b), A may use $3,000 of the net capital loss against other income. Under section 1212(b)(1), the remaining $27,000 is a capital loss carryover. For purposes of determining A's Year 1 net gain under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, A's gain of $10,000 on the sale of the Q stock is reduced by A's loss of $40,000 on the sale of the P stock. In addition, A may reduce net investment income by the $3,000 of the excess of capital losses over capital gains allowed for income tax purposes under section 1211(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In Year 2, A has a capital gain of $30,000 on the sale of Y stock. Y is a C corporation. A has no other capital gain or capital loss in Year 2. For income tax purposes, A may reduce the $30,000 gain by the Year 1 section 1212(b) $27,000 capital loss carryover. For purposes of determining A's Year 2 net gain under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, A's $30,000 gain may also be reduced by the $27,000 capital loss carryover from Year 1. Therefore, in Year 2, A has $3,000 of net gain for purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Calculation of net gain. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that in Year 1, A also realizes a gain of $20,000 on the sale of Rental Property D, all of which is treated as ordinary income under section 1250. For income tax purposes, under section 1211(b), A may use $3,000 of the net capital loss against other income. Under section 1212(b)(1) the remaining $27,000 is a capital loss carryover. For purposes of determining A's net gain under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, A's gain of $10,000 on the sale of the Q stock is reduced by A's loss of $40,000 on the sale of the P stock. A's $20,000 gain on the sale of Rental Property D is reduced to the extent of the $3,000 loss allowed under section 1211(b). Therefore, A's net gain for Year 1 is $17,000 ($20,000 gain treated as ordinary income on the sale of Rental Property D reduced by $3,000 loss allowed under section 1211).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In Year 1, A, an unmarried individual, sells a house that A has owned and used as A's principal residence for the five years preceding the sale and realizes $200,000 in gain. In addition to the gain realized from the sale of A's principal residence, A also realizes $7,000 in long-term capital gain. A has a $5,000 short-term capital loss carryover from a year preceding the effective date of section 1411.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For income tax purposes, under section 121(a), A excludes the $200,000 gain realized from the sale of A's principal residence from A's Year 1 gross income. In determining A's Year 1 adjusted gross income, A also reduces the $7,000 capital gain by the $5,000 capital loss carryover allowed under section 1211(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For section 1411 purposes, under section 121(a), A excludes the $200,000 gain realized from the sale of A's principal residence from A's Year 1 gross income and, consequently, from A's net investment income. In determining A's Year 1 net gain under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, A reduces the $7,000 capital gain by the $5,000 capital loss carryover allowed under section 1211(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In Year 1, A, an unmarried individual who is not a dealer in real estate, purchases Greenacre, a piece of undeveloped land, for $10,000. A intends to hold Greenacre for investment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In Year 3, A enters into an exchange in which A transfers Greenacre, now valued at $20,000, and $5,000 cash for Blackacre, another piece of undeveloped land, which has a fair market value of $25,000. The exchange is a transaction for which no gain or loss is recognized under section 1031.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In Year 3, for income tax purposes, A does not recognize any gain from the exchange of Greenacre for Blackacre. A's basis in Blackacre is $15,000 ($10,000 substituted basis in Greenacre plus $5,000 additional cost of acquisition). For purposes of section 1411, A's net investment income for Year 3 does not include any realized gain from the exchange of Greenacre for Blackacre.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In Year 5, A sells Blackacre to an unrelated party for $35,000 in cash.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> In Year 5, for income tax purposes, A recognizes capital gain of $20,000 ($35,000 sale price minus $15,000 basis). For purposes of section 1411, A's net investment income includes the $20,000 gain recognized from the sale of Blackacre.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Gains and losses excluded from net investment income--(i) Exception for gain or loss attributable to property held in a trade or business not described in Sec. 1.1411-5--(A) General rule. Net gain does not include gain or loss attributable to property (other than property from the

investment of working capital (as described in Sec. 1.1411-6)) held in a trade or business not described in Sec. 1.1411-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Exception for gain or loss attributable to property held in a trade or business not described in Sec. 1.1411-5--(A) General rule.

To determine whether net gain described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section is from property held in a trade or business--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A partnership interest or S corporation stock generally is not property held in a trade or business. Therefore, gain from the sale of a partnership interest or S corporation stock is generally gain described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section. However, net gain does not include certain gain or loss attributable to the disposition of certain interests in partnerships and S corporations as provided in Sec. 1.1411-7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of an individual, estate, or trust that owns or engages in a trade or business directly (or indirectly through ownership of an interest in an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner under Sec. 301.7701-3), the determination of whether net gain described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section is attributable to property held in a trade or business is made at the individual, estate, or trust level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In the case of an individual, estate, or trust that owns an interest in a passthrough entity (for example, a partnership or S corporation), and that entity is engaged in a trade or business, the determination of whether net gain described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section from such entity is attributable to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Property held in a trade or business described in Sec. 1.1411-5(a)(1) is made at the owner level; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Property held in a trade or business described in Sec. 1.1411-5(a)(2) is made at the entity level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (d)(4)(i). For purposes of these examples, assume the taxpayer is a United States citizen, uses a calendar taxable year, and Year 1 and all subsequent years are taxable years in which section 1411 is in effect:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Gain from rental activity. A, an unmarried individual, rents a boat to B for $100,000 in Year 1. A's rental activity does not involve the conduct of a section 162 trade or business, and under section 469(c)(2), A's rental activity is a passive activity. In Year 2, A sells the boat to B, and A realizes and recognizes taxable gain attributable to the disposition of the boat of $500,000. Because the exception provided in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(A) of this section requires a trade or business, this exception is inapplicable, and therefore, A's $500,000 gain will be taken into account under Sec. 1.1411-4(a)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> PRS, a partnership for Federal income tax purposes, operates an automobile dealership. Therefore, with respect to B and C, PRS is not a trade or business described in section 1411(c)(2) and Sec. 1.1411-5. D owns the remaining 20% of PRS. Assume, for purposes of this example, that PRS is a passive activity with respect to D, and therefore is a trade or business described in section 1411(c)(2)(A) and Sec. 1.1411-5(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)</em> In Year 0, a year preceding the effective date of section 1411, PRS relocates its dealership to a larger location. As a result of the relocation, PRS sells its old dealership facility to a real estate developer in exchange for $1,000,000 cash and a $4,500,000 promissory note, fully amortizing over the subsequent 15 years, and bearing adequate stated interest. PRS reports the sale transaction under section 453. PRS's adjusted tax basis in the old dealership facility is $1,075,000. Assume for purposes of this example that PRS has $300,000 of recapture income (within the meaning of section 453(i)); the buyer is not related to PRS, B, C, or D; and the buyer is not assuming any liabilities of PRS in the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In Year 0, a year preceding the effective date of section 1411, PRS relocates its dealership to a larger location.

PRS reports the sale transaction under section 453. PRS's adjusted tax basis in the old dealership facility is $1,075,000. Assume for purposes of this example that PRS has $300,000 of recapture income (within the meaning of section 453(i)); the buyer is not related to PRS, B, C, or D; and the buyer is not assuming any liabilities of PRS in the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For chapter 1 purposes, PRS has realized gain on the transaction of $4,425,000 ($5,500,000 less $1,075,000). Pursuant to section 453(i), PRS will take into account $300,000 of the recapture income in Year 0, and the gain in excess of the recapture income ($4,125,000) will be taken into account under the installment method. For purposes of section 453, PRS's profit percentage is 75% ($4,125,000 gain divided by $5,500,000 gross selling price). In Year 0, PRS will take into account $750,000 of capital gain attributable to the $1,000,000 cash payment. In the subsequent 15 years, PRS will receive annual payments of $300,000 (plus interest). Each payment will result in PRS recognizing $225,000 of capital gain (75% of $300,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(A)</em> In Year 1, PRS receives a payment of $300,000 plus the applicable amount of interest.

In the case of section 453 installment sales, section 453 governs the timing of the gain recognition, but does not alter the character of the gain. See Sec. 1.1411-1(a). The determination of whether the gain is attributable to the

disposition of property used in a trade or business described in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section constitutes an element of the gain's character for Federal tax purposes. As a result, the applicability of paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section is determined in Year 0 and applies to all gain received on the promissory note during the 15 year payment period. This result is consistent with the section 469 determination of the passive or nonpassive classification of the gain under Sec. 1.469-2T(c)(2)(i)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> In the case of D, PRS's trade or business is described in section 1411(c)(2)(A) and Sec. 1.1411-5(a)(1).

See Sec. 1.1411-1(a). Assume that Estate paid estate taxes of $5,000 that were attributable to the $90,000 of IRD. Pursuant to section 691(c)(4), the amount of gain taken into account in computing Estate's taxable income in Year 3 is $85,000 ($90,000 reduced by the $5,000 of allocable estate taxes). Pursuant to section 691(a)(3) and Sec. 1.691(a)-3(a), the character of the gain to the Estate is the same character as the gain would have been if C had survived to receive it. Although the amount of taxable gain for chapter 1 has been reduced, the remaining $85,000 retains its character attributable to the disposition of property used in a trade or business described in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section.

Net gain, as determined under paragraph (d) of this section, does not include gains and losses excluded from net investment income by any other provision in Secs. 1.1411-1 through 1.1411-10.

SCo is engaged in a trade or business described in section 1411(c)(2)(A). SCo is the only passive activity owned by A. In Year 1, SCo reported a loss of $11,000 to A which was comprised of gross operating income of $29,000 and operating deductions of $40,000. A's at risk amount at the beginning of Year 1 is $7,000. There were no other events that affected A's at risk amount in Year 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of calculating A's net investment income, A's $29,000 distributive share of SCo's gross operating income is income within the meaning of section 1411(c)(1)(A)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> As a result of A's at risk limitation, for chapter 1 purposes, A may only deduct $7,000 of the operating deductions in excess of the gross operating income. The remaining $4,000 deductions are suspended because A's amount at risk at the end of Year 1 is zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For purposes of section 469, A has passive activity gross income of $29,000 and passive activity deductions of $36,000 ($40,000 of operating deductions allocable to A less $4,000 suspended under section 465). Because A has no other passive activity income from any other source, section 469 limits A's passive activity deductions to A's passive activity gross income. As a result, section 469 allows A to deduct $29,000 of SCo's operating deductionsand suspends the remaining $7,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For purposes of calculating A's net investment income, A has $29,000 of properly allocable deductions allowed by section 1411(c)(1)(B) and paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Same facts as Example 1. In Year 2, SCo reported net income of $13,000 to A, which was comprised of gross operating income of $43,000 and operating deductions of $30,000. There were no other events that affected A's at risk amount in Year 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of calculating A's net investment income, A's $43,000 distributive share of gross operating income is income within the meaning of section 1411(c)(1)(A)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Pursuant to section 465(a)(2), A's deductions attributable to the gross income of SCo include the $30,000 deduction allocable to A in Year 2 plus the $4,000 loss that was suspended and carried over to Year 2 from Year 1 pursuant to section 465(a)(2). Under section 465(a)(2), the $4,000 of losses from Year 1 are treated as deductions from the activity in Year 2. As a result, A's net operating income from SCo in Year 2 is $9,000 ($43,000-$30,000-$4,000) in Year 2. A's amount at risk at the end of Year 2 is $9,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For purposes of section 469, A has passive activity gross income of $43,000. A's passive activity deductions attributable to SCo are the sum of the Year 2 operating deductions allocable to A from S ($30,000), deductions formerly suspended by section 465 ($4,000), and passive activity losses suspended by section 469 ($7,000). Therefore, in Year 2, A has passive activity deductions of $41,000. Because A's passive activity gross income exceeds A's passive activity deductions, section 469 does not limit any of the deductions in Year 2. At the end of Year 2, A has no suspended passive activity losses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Although A's distributive share of Year 2 deductions allocable to SCo's operating income was $30,000; the operative provisions of sections 465 and 469 do not change the character of the deductions when such amounts are suspended under either section. Furthermore, section 465(a)(2) and Secs. 1.469-1(f)(4) and 1.469-2T(d)(1) treat amounts suspended from prior years as deductions in the current year. See Sec. 1.1411-1(a). Therefore, for purposes of calculating A's net investment income, A

has $41,000 of properly allocable deductions allowed by section 1411(c)(1)(B) and paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Properly allocable deductions described in section 63(d).

A has $10,000 of income from a trade or business that is a passive activity (as defined in Sec. 1.1411-5(a)(1)) with respect to A. For income tax purposes, under section 163(d)(1), A may not deduct the $4,000 investment interest in Year 1 because A does not have any section 163(d)(4) net investment income. Under section 163(d)(2), the $4,000 investment interest is a carryforward of disallowed interest that is treated as investment interest paid by A in the succeeding taxable year.

PRS is engaged in a trading business described in section 1411(c)(2)(B) and Sec. 1.1411-5(a)(2) and has made a valid and timely election under section 475(f)(2). A's distributive share from PRS in Year 1 consists of $125,000 of interest and dividends and $60,000 of ordinary losses from the trading business. In addition to A's investment in PRS, A sold undeveloped land in Year 1 for a long-term capital gain of $50,000.

Pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, A takes into account the $60,000 at ordinary loss from PRS and the $50,000 of long term capital gain in the computation of A's net gain. A's losses ($60,000) exceed A's gains ($50,000). Therefore, A's net gain under paragraph (d) of this section is zero. Additionally, A is allowed a deduction under paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section for $10,000 (the amount of ordinary losses that were allowable under chapter 1 in excess of the amounts taken into account in computing net gain).

Therefore, T's net gain under paragraph (d) of this section is zero. However, T is allowed a deduction under paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section for $3,000 (the amount of losses that were allowable under chapter 1 in excess of the amounts taken into account in computing net gain). T's net investment income in Year 1 is $14,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In Year 1, B, an unmarried individual, incurs a short-term capital loss of $15,000 on the sale of publicly traded stocks.

Pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, B's net gain does not include the $21,000 long-term capital gain because it is attributable to property held in B's sole proprietorship (a nonpassive activity). Pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, T takes into account the $15,000 capital loss allowed by chapter 1. B's losses ($15,000) exceed B's gains ($0). Therefore, A's net gain under paragraph (d) of this section is zero. However, B is allowed a deduction under paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section for $15,000 (the amount of losses that were allowable under chapter 1 in excess of the amounts taken into account in computing net gain).

In the case of an estate or trust, an allocation of a deduction pursuant to rules described in Sec. 1.652(b)-3(b) (and Sec. 1.641(c)-1(h) in the case of an ESBT) is also a reasonable method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Recoveries of properly allocable deductions--(i) General rule. If a taxpayer is refunded, reimbursed, or otherwise recovers any portion of an amount deducted as a section 1411(c)(1)(B) properly allocable deduction in a prior year, and such amount is not otherwise included in net investment income in the year of recovery under section 1411(c)(1)(A), the amount of the recovery will reduce the taxpayer's total section 1411(c)(1)(B) properly allocable deductions in the year of recovery (but not below zero). The preceding sentence applies regardless of whether the amount of the recovery is excluded from gross income by reason of section 111.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. If a taxpayer is refunded, reimbursed, or otherwise recovers any portion of an amount deducted as a section 1411(c)(1)(B) properly allocable deduction in a prior year, and such amount is not otherwise included in net investment income in the year of recovery under section 1411(c)(1)(A), the amount of the recovery will reduce the taxpayer's total section 1411(c)(1)(B) properly allocable deductions in the year of recovery (but not below zero). The preceding sentence applies regardless of whether the amount of the recovery is excluded from gross income by reason of section 111.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Recoveries of items allocated between net investment income and excluded income. In the case of a refund of any item that was deducted under section 1411(c)(1)(B) in a prior year and the gross amount of the deduction was allocated between items of net investment income and excluded income pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the amount of the reduction in section 1411(c)(1)(B) properly allocable deductions in the year of receipt under this paragraph (g)(2) is the total amount of the refund multiplied by a

fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the amount of the total deduction allocable to net investment income in the prior year to which the refund relates. The denominator of the fraction is the total amount of the deduction in the prior year to which the refund relates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Recoveries with no prior year benefit. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(2), section 111 applies to reduce the amount of any reduction required by paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section to the extent that such previously deducted amount did not reduce the tax imposed by section 1411. To the extent a deduction is taken into account in computing a taxpayer's net operating loss deduction under paragraph (h) of this section, section 111(c) applies. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this paragraph (g)(2), no reduction of section 1411(c)(1)(B) properly allocable deductions is required in a year when such recovered item is attributable to an amount deducted in a taxable year--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Preceding the effective date of section 1411, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In which the taxpayer was not subject to section 1411 solely because that individual's (as defined in Sec. 1.1411-2(a)) modified adjusted gross income (as defined in Sec. 1.1411-2(c)) does not exceed the applicable threshold in Sec. 1.1411-2(d) or such estate's or trust's (as defined in Sec. 1.1411-3(a)(1)(i)) adjusted gross income does not exceed the amount described in section 1411(a)(2)(B)(ii) and Sec. 1.1411-3(a)(1)(ii)(B)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (g)(2). For purposes of these examples, assume the taxpayer is a United States citizen, uses a calendar taxable year, and Year 1 and all subsequent years are taxable years in which section 1411 is in effect:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Recovery of amount included in income. A, an individual, is a 40% limited partner in LP. LP is a passive activity to A. In Year 1, A's distributable share of section 1411(c)(1)(A)(ii) income and properly allocable deductions described in Sec. 1.1411-4(f)(2)(ii) were $50,000 and $37,000, respectively. In Year 2, LP received a refund of a properly allocable deduction described in Sec. 1.1411-4(f)(2)(ii). A's distributable share of the recovered deduction is $2,000. Since the $2,000 recovery constitutes gross income described in section 1411(c)(1)(A)(ii) in Year 2, A does not reduce any properly allocable deductions attributable to Year 2.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. State income tax refund. In Year 1, D, an individual, allocated $15,000 of taxes out of a total of $75,000 to net investment income under paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section. D received no tax benefit from the deduction in Year 1 for chapter 1 purposes due to the alternative minimum tax, but it did reduce D's section 1411 tax. In Year 3, D received a refund of $5,000. For chapter 1 purposes, D excludes the $5,000 refund from gross income in Year 3 by reason of section 111. In Year 3, D allocated $30,000 of state income taxes out of a total of $90,000 to net investment income under paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section. Although the refund is excluded from D's gross income, D must nonetheless reduce Year 3's section 1411(c)(1)(B) properly allocable deductions by $1,000 ($5,000 x ($15,000/$75,000)). D's allocation of 33\1/3%\ of section 164(a)(3) taxes in Year 3 to net investment income is irrelevant to the calculation of the amount of the reduction required by this paragraph (g)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. State income tax refund with no prior year benefit. Same facts as Example 2, except in Year 1, D's section 1411(c)(1)(B) properly allocable deductions exceeded D's section 1411(c)(1)(A) income by $300. As a result, D was not subject to section 1411 in Year 1. Pursuant to paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section, D does not reduce Year 3's section 1411(c)(1)(B) properly allocable deductions for recoveries of amounts to the extent that such deductions did not reduce the tax imposed by section 1411. Therefore, D must reduce Year 3's section 1411(c)(1)(B) properly allocable deductions by $700 ($1,000 less $300).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Deductions described in section 691(b). For purposes of paragraph (f) of this section, properly allocable deductions include items of deduction described in section 691(b), provided that the item otherwise would have been deductible to the decedent under Sec. 1.1411-4(f). For example, an estate may deduct the decedent's unpaid investment interest expense in computing its net investment income because section 691(b) specifically allows the deduction under section 163, and Sec. 1.1411-4(f)(3)(i) allows those deductions as well. However, an estate or trust may not deduct a payment of real estate taxes on the decedent's principal residence that were unpaid at death in computing its net investment income because, although real estate taxes are deductible under section 164 and specifically are allowed by section 691(b), the real estate taxes

would not have been a properly allocable deduction of the decedent under Sec. 1.1411-4(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Amounts described in section 642(h).

Gross income from interest (within the meaning of section 1411(c)(1)(A)(i) and paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section) that is received by the taxpayer from a nonpassive activity of such taxpayer, solely for purposes of section 1411, is treated as derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business not described in Sec. 1.1411-5. The amount of interest income that is treated as derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business not described in Sec. 1.1411-5, and thus excluded from the calculation of net investment income, under this paragraph (g)(5) is limited to the amount that would have been considered passive activity gross income under the rules of Sec. 1.469-7 if the payor was a passive activity of the taxpayer. For purposes of this rule, the term nonpassive activity does not include a trade or business described in Sec. 1.1411-5(a)(2).

B also owns a single family rental property, a passive activity. B materially participates in the retail sales activity of SCorp, but B has $10,000 of suspended losses from prior years when the retail sales activity of SCorp was a passive activity of B. Therefore, the retail sales activity of SCorp is a former passive activity within the meaning of section 469(f)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In Year 1, B reports $205,000 of wages, $7,000 of nonpassive net income, $500 of interest income (attributable to working capital) from SCorp's retail sales activity, and $1,000 of net rental income from the single family rental property. B's Year 1 modified adjusted gross income (as defined in Sec. 1.1411-2(c)) is $205,500; which includes $205,000 of wages, $500 of interest income, $7,000 of nonpassive income from SCorp, $7,000 of section 469(f)(1)(A) losses, $1,000 of passive income from the single family rental property and $1,000 of section 469(f)(1)(C) losses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of the calculation of B's Year 1 net investment income, B includes the $500 of interest income and $1,000 of net passive income from the single family rental property.

Under section 172(d)(4), in determining the net operating loss, the $10,000 nonbusiness expenses are allowed in full against the $15,000 dividend income. The $150,000 net operating loss determined using only properly allocable deductions and gross income items used in determining net investment income is less than A's actual net operating loss for Year 2 of $300,000, and accordingly the applicable portion is $150,000.

In addition, under Sec. 1.1411-2(c), the $540,000 net operating loss will be allowed as a deduction in computing A's Year 3 modified adjusted gross income. Because A's modified adjusted gross income is $0, A is not subject to net investment income tax. The section 1411 NOL amount of the $540,000 net operating loss from Year 1 that A deducts in Year 3 is $108,000 ($540,000 multiplied by 0.2 (the fraction used to calculate the section 1411 NOL amount of the net operating loss)), and this is also the total section 1411 NOL amount for Year 3.

This net operating loss carryover amount includes a section 1411 NOL amount of $92,000 ($460,000 multiplied by 0.2) that may be applied in determining net investment income in Year 4.

For income tax purposes, A deducts the remaining $460,000 of the net operating loss carryover from Year 1 and the $300,000 net operating loss carryover from Year 2, for a total net operating loss deduction in Year 4 of $760,000.
