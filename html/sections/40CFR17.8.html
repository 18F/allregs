                            <p class="depth0">The Administrator delegates to the Environmental Appeals Board  authority to take final action relating to the Equal Access to Justice  Act. The Environmental Appeals Board is described at 40 CFR 1.25(e).  This delegation does not preclude the Environmental Appeals Board from  referring any matter related to the Equal Access to Justice Act to the  Administrator when the Environmental Appeals Board deems it appropriate  to do so. When an appeal or motion is referred to the Administrator by  the Environmental Appeals Board, all parties shall be so notified   and the rules in this part referring to the Environmental Appeals Board  shall be interpreted as referring to the Administrator.
