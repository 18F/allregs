                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Initial application. To apply for an initial grant, an applicant must submit to VA a complete grant application package, as described in the NOFA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Renewal application. After receiving an initial grant, grantees may apply for a renewal grant if the grantee's program will remain substantially the same. The grantee must submit to VA a complete renewal application as described in the NOFA. Because evaluations of renewal applications rely on performance data related to the initial grant, the application and supporting documentation may vary from the initial application; however, renewal applications are competitive grants and will be evaluated under competitive grant selection processes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Noncompetitive application. When a condition exists for a noncompetitive grant as outlined in Sec. 77.15, the adaptive sports entity may submit a noncompetitive application that meets the same format as outlined for competitive grants set forth in the NOFA.
