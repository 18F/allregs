It further directs the Administrator to establish a graduate fellowship program to provide educational assistance to qualified individuals in fields related to space, and to establish an independent committee known as the Space Grant Review Panel to review and advise the Administrator with respect to Space Grant programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The regulations of this part do not apply to awards made by NASA under any other authority.</p>
