                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The Board has considered the question of whether a foreign bank's  California office that may accept deposits from certain foreign sources  (e.g., a United States citizen residing abroad) is a branch or an agency  for the purposes of the grandfather provisions of section 5 of the  International Banking Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 3103(b)). The question has  arisen as a result of the definitions in the International Banking Act  of branch and agency, and the limited deposit-taking capabilities of  certain California offices of foreign banks.</p><p class="depth0">The International Banking Act defines agency as ``any office * * *  at which deposits may not be accepted from citizens or residents of the  United States,'' and defines branch as ``any office * * * of a foreign  bank * * * at which deposits are received'' (12 U.S.C. 3101(1) and (3)).  Offices of foreign banks in California prior to the International  Banking Act were generally prohibited from accepting deposits by the  requirement of State law that such offices obtain Federal deposit  insurance (Cal. Fin. Code 1756); until the passage of the International  Banking Act an office of a foreign bank could not obtain such insurance.  California law, however, permits offices of foreign banks, with the  approval of the Banking Department, to accept deposits from any person  that resides, is domiciled, and maintains its principal place of  business in a foreign country (Cal. Fin. Code 1756.2). Thus, under a  literal reading of the definitions of branch and agency contained in the  International Banking Act, a foreign bank's California office that  accepts deposits from certain foreign sources (e.g., a U.S. citizen  residing abroad), is a branch rather than an agency.</p><p class="depth0">Section 5 of the International Banking Act establishes certain  limitations on the expansion of the domestic deposit-taking capabilities  of a foreign bank outside its home State. It also grandfathers offices  established or applied for prior to July 27, 1978, and permits a foreign  bank to select its home State from among the States in which it operated  branches and agencies on the grandfather date. If a foreign bank's  office that was established or applied for prior to June 27, 1978, is a  branch as defined in the International Banking Act, then it is  grandfathered as a branch. Accordingly, a foreign bank could designate a  State other than California as its home State and subsequently convert  its California office to a full domestic deposit-taking facility by  obtaining Federal deposit insurance. If, however, the office is  determined to be an agency, then it is grandfathered as such and the  foreign bank may not expand its deposit-taking capabilities in  California without declaring California its home State.</p><p class="depth0">In the Board's view, it would be inconsistent with the purposes and  the legislative history of the International Banking Act to enable a  foreign bank to expand its domestic interstate deposit-taking  capabilities by grandfathering these California offices as branches  because of their ability to receive certain foreign source deposits. The  Board also notes that such deposits are of the same general type that  may be received by an Edge Corporation and, hence in accordance with  section 5(a) of the International Banking Act, by branches established  and operated outside a foreign bank's home State. It would be  inconsistent with the structure of the interstate banking provisions of  the International Banking Act to grandfather as full deposit-taking  offices those facilities whose activities have been determined by  Congress to be appropriate for a foreign bank's out-of-home State  branches.</p><p class="depth0">Accordingly, the Board, in administering the interstate banking  provisions of the IBA, regards as agencies   those offices of foreign banks that do not accept domestic deposits but  that may accept deposits from any person that resides, is domiciled, and  maintains its principal place of business in a foreign country.
