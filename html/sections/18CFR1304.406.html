                            <p class="depth0">If, at any time, any dock, wharf, boathouse (fixed or floating), nonnavigable houseboat, outfall, aerial cable,

or other fixed or floating structure or facility (including any navigable boat or vessel that has become deteriorated and is a potential navigation hazard or impediment to flood control) is anchored, installed, constructed, or moored in a manner inconsistent with this part, or is not constructed in accordance with plans approved by TVA, or is not maintained or operated so as to remain in accordance with this part and such plans, or is not kept in a good state of repair and in good, safe, and substantial condition, and the owner or operator thereof fails to repair or remove such structure (or operate or maintain it in accordance with such plans) within ninety (90) days after written notice from TVA to do so, TVA may cancel any license, permit, or approval and remove such structure, and/or cause it to be removed, from the Tennessee River system and/or lands in the custody or control of TVA. Such written notice may be given by mailing a copy thereof to the owner's address as listed on the license, permit, or approval or by posting a copy on the structure or facility. TVA may remove or cause to be removed any such structure or facility anchored, installed, constructed, or moored without such license, permit, or approval, whether such license or approval has once been obtained and subsequently canceled, or whether it has never been obtained. TVA's removal costs shall be charged to the owner of the structure, and payment of such costs shall be a condition of approval for any future facility proposed to serve the tract of land at issue or any tract derived therefrom whether or not the current owner caused such charges to be incurred. In addition, any applicant with an outstanding removal charge payable to TVA shall, until such time as the charge be paid in full, be ineligible to receive a permit or approval from TVA for any facility located anywhere along or in the Tennessee River or its tributaries. TVA shall not be responsible for the loss of property associated with the removal of any such structure or facility including, without limitation, the loss of any navigable boat or vessel moored at such a facility. Any costs voluntarily incurred by TVA to protect and store such property shall be removal costs within the meaning of this section, and TVA may sell such property and apply the proceeds toward any and all of its removal costs. Small businesses seeking expedited consideration of the economic impact of actions under this section may contact TVA's Supplier and Diverse Business Relations staff, TVA Procurement, 1101 Market Street, Chattanooga, Tennessee 37402-2801.</p>
