                            <p class="depth0"><em>(S-90)</em> During acquisition planning, an assessment shall be made as to the likelihood that adequate price competition will exist. If it is anticipated that an award will be based on adequate price competition, the solicitation shall include the provision at 5252.215-9000. If the procurement schedule is critical, this provision with its Alternate I shall be used so that there will be a minimum delay in the event that adequate price competition does not materialize and it is necessary to obtain cost or pricing data. Contracting officers must be judicious in the use of the Alternate I provision, as it may cause offerors to incur certain costs in preparing standby cost or pricing data in anticipation that it may be subsequently requested.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart 5215.6_Source Selection</p>
