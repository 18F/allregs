                            <p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> NMFS will identify and list, in the biennial report to Congress  nations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> whose fishing vessels are engaged, or have been engaged during  the preceding calendar year prior to publication of the biennial report  to Congress, in fishing activities or practices either in waters beyond  any national jurisdiction that result in bycatch of a PLMR, or in waters  beyond the U.S. EEZ that result in bycatch of a PLMR that is shared by  the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> if the nation is a party to or maintains cooperating status  with the relevant international organization with jurisdiction over the  conservation and protection of the relevant PLMRs, or a relevant  international or regional fishery organization, and the organization has  not adopted measures to effectively end or reduce bycatch of such  species; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> the nation has not implemented measures designed to end or  reduce such bycatch that are comparable in effectiveness to U.S.  regulatory requirements, taking into account different conditions that  could bear on the feasibility and efficacy of comparable measures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When determining whether to identify nations as having fishing  vessels engaged in PLMR bycatch, NMFS will take into account all  relevant matters including, but not limited to, the history, nature,  circumstances, extent, duration, and gravity of the bycatch activity in  question.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> NMFS will also examine whether the nation has implemented  measures designed to end or reduce such bycatch that are comparable in  effectiveness to U.S. regulatory requirements. In considering whether a  nation has implemented measures that are comparable in effectiveness to  those of the United States, NMFS will evaluate if different conditions  exist that could bear on the feasibility and efficiency of such measures  to end or reduce bycatch of the pertinent PLMRs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Notification of nations identified as having fishing vessels  engaged in PLMR bycatch. Upon identifying a nation whose vessels have  been engaged in bycatch of PLMRs in the biennial report to Congress, the  Secretary of Commerce will notify the President of such identification.  Within 60 days after submission of the biennial report to Congress, the  Secretary of Commerce, acting through or in consultation with the  Secretary of State, will notify identified nations about the  requirements under the Moratorium Protection Act and this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Consultations and negotiations. Upon submission of the biennial  report to Congress, the Secretary of Commerce, acting through or in  consultation with the Secretary of State, will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Initiate consultations within 60 days after submission of the  biennial report to Congress with the governments of identified nations  for the purposes of encouraging adoption of a regulatory program for  protected living marine resources that is comparable in effectiveness to  that of the United States, taking into account different conditions, and  establishment of a management plan that assists in the collection of  species-specific data;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Seek to enter into bilateral and multilateral treaties with such  nations to protect the PLMRs from bycatch activities described in the  biennial report; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Seek agreements through the appropriate international  organizations calling for international restrictions on the fishing  activities or practices described in the biennial report that result in  bycatch of PLMRs and, as necessary, request the Secretary of State to  initiate the amendment of any existing international treaty to which the  United States is a party for the protection and conservation of the  PLMRs in question to make such agreements consistent with this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> International cooperation and assistance. To the greatest extent  possible, consistent with existing authority and the availability of  funds, the Secretary shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Provide appropriate assistance to nations identified by the  Secretary under paragraph (a) of this section and international  organizations of which those nations are members to assist those nations  in qualifying for a positive certification under paragraph(e) of this  section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Undertake, where appropriate, cooperative research activities on  species assessments and improved bycatch mitigation techniques, with  those nations or organizations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Encourage and facilitate the transfer of appropriate technology  to those nations or organizations to assist those nations in qualifying  for positive certification under paragraph (e) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Provide assistance to those nations or organizations in  designing and implementing appropriate fish harvesting plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Procedures to certify nations identified as having fishing  vessels engaged in PLMR bycatch. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each nation that is identified as  having fishing vessels engaged in PLMR bycatch shall receive either a  positive or a negative certification from the Secretary of Commerce, and  this certification will be published in the biennial report to Congress.  The Secretary of Commerce shall issue a positive certification to an  identified nation upon making a determination that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Such nation has provided evidence documenting its adoption of a  regulatory program to end or reduce bycatch of such PLMRs that is  comparable in effectiveness to regulatory measures required under U.S.  law to address bycatch in the relevant fisheries, taking into account  different conditions that could bear on the feasibility and efficacy of  these measures, and which, in the case of an identified nation with  fishing vessels engaged in pelagic longline fishing, includes the  mandatory use of circle hooks, careful handling and release equipment,  training and observer programs; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Such nation has established a management plan that will assist  in the collection of species-specific data on PLMR bycatch to support  international stock assessments and conservation efforts for PLMRs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Nations will be notified prior to a formal certification  determination and will be provided with an opportunity to support and/or  refute preliminary certification determinations, and communicate any  corrective actions taken to address the activities for which such  nations were identified. The Secretary of Commerce shall consider any  information received during the course of these consultations when  making the subsequent certification determinations.
