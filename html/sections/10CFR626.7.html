Otherwise, DOE may competitively solicit suppliers to deliver oil of comparable value to the SPR in exchange for the receipt of royalty-in-kind oil.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If, based on the market analysis described in paragraph (d) of this section, DOE determines there is a high probability that the cost to the Government can be reduced without significantly affecting national energy security goals, DOE may contract for delivery at a future date in expectation of lower prices and a higher quantity of oil in exchange. Conversely, it may schedule deliveries at an earlier date under the contract in anticipation of higher prices at later dates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Based on the market analysis in paragraph (d) of this section, DOE may, after consultation with DOI, suspend the transfer of royalty oil to DOE if it appears the added demand for oil will add significant upward pressure to prices either regionally or on a world-wide basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fill requirements determination. DOE shall develop SPR fill requirements for each solicitation based on an assessment of national energy security goals, the availability of royalty oil and storage capacity, and need for specific grades and quantities of crude oil.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Market analysis.
