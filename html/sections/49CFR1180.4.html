At any time, the Board may require the submission of additional copies of any document previously filed by any party to the proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Prefiling notification.

The publication shall contain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A brief description of the transaction,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The year to be used for the impact analysis,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The approximate filing date,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A determination that the transaction is major, significant, or minor, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A statement of any additional information which must be filed with the application in order for the application to be considered complete.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A prefiling notice may be amended to indicate a change in the anticipated filing date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Prefiling notification.

The Board will issue, in each proceeding in which such an order is requested, an appropriate protective order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A statement of waybill availability for major transactions. Applicants must indicate, as soon as practicable after the issuance of a protective order, that they will make their 100% traffic tapes available (subject to the terms of the protective order) to any interested party on written request. The applicants may require that, if the requesting party is itself a railroad, applicants will make their 100% traffic tapes available to that party only if it agrees, in its written request, to make its own 100% traffic tapes available to applicants (subject to the terms of the protective order) when it receives access to applicants' tapes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Applicants may also propose the use of a voting trust at this stage, or at a later stage, if that becomes necessary. In each proceeding involving a major transaction, applicants contemplating the use of a voting trust must explain how the trust would insulate them from an unlawful control violation and why their proposed use of the trust, in the context of their impending control application, would be consistent with the public interest. Following a brief period of public comment and replies by applicants, the Board will issue a decision determining whether applicants may establish and use the trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Application.
