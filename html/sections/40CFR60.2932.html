                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must conduct an annual performance test for all of the  pollutants in table 1 of this subpart for each OSWI unit to determine  compliance with the emission limitations. The annual performance test  must be conducted using the test methods listed in table 1 of this  subpart and the procedures in 60.2922.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must continuously monitor carbon monoxide emissions to  determine compliance with the carbon monoxide emissions limitation.  Twelve-hour rolling average values are used to determine compliance. A  12-hour rolling average value above the carbon monoxide emission limit  in table 1 of this subpart constitutes a deviation from the emission  limitation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must continuously monitor the operating parameters specified  in Sec. 60.2916 or established under Sec. 60.2917. Three-hour rolling  average values are used to determine compliance with the operating  limits unless a different averaging period is established under Sec.  60.2917. A 3-hour rolling average value (unless a different averaging  period is established under Sec. 60.2917) above the established maximum  or below the established minimum operating limits constitutes a  deviation from the established operating limits. Operating limits do not  apply during performance tests.</p>
