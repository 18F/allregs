                                Sec. 416.1443  Responsibilities of the adjudication officer.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Under the procedures set out in this section we will  test modifications to the procedures we follow when you file a request  for a hearing before an administrative law judge in connection with a  claim for benefits based on disability where the question of whether you  are under a disability as defined in Secs. 416.905 and 416.906 is at  issue. These modifications will enable   us to test the effect of having an adjudication officer be your primary  point of contact after you file a hearing request and before you have a  hearing with an administrative law judge. The tests may be conducted  alone, or in combination with the tests of the modifications to the  disability determination procedures which we conduct under  Sec. 416.1406. The adjudication officer, working with you and your  representative, if any, will identify issues in dispute, develop  evidence, conduct informal conferences, and conduct any other prehearing  proceeding as may be necessary. The adjudication officer has the  authority to make a decision fully favorable to you if the evidence so  warrants. If the adjudication officer does not make a decision on your  claim, your hearing request will be assigned to an administrative law  judge for further proceedings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Procedures for cases included in the tests. Prior to commencing  tests of the adjudication officer position in selected site(s), we will  publish a notice in the Federal Register. The notice will describe where  the specific test site(s) will be and the duration of the test(s). We  will also state whether the tests of the adjudication officer position  in each site will be conducted alone, or in combination with the tests  of the modifications to the disability determination procedures which we  conduct under Sec. 416.1406. The individuals who participate in the  test(s) will be assigned randomly to a test group in each site where the  tests are conducted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prehearing procedures conducted by an Adjudication Officer.  When you file a request for a hearing before an administrative law judge  in connection with a claim for benefits based on disability where the  question of whether you are under a disability as defined in  Secs. 416.905 and 416.906 is at issue, the adjudication officer will  conduct an interview with you. The interview may take place in person,  by telephone, or by videoconference, as the adjudication officer  determines is appropriate under the circumstances of your case. If you  file a request for an extension of time to request a hearing in  accordance with Sec. 416.1433(c), the adjudication officer may develop  information on, and may decide where the adjudication officer issues a  fully favorable decision to you that you had good cause for missing the  deadline for requesting a hearing. To determine whether you had good  cause for missing the deadline, the adjudication officer will use the  standards contained in Sec. 416.1411.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Representation. The adjudication officer will provide you with  information regarding the hearing process, including your right to  representation. As may be appropriate, the adjudication officer will  provide you with referral sources for representation, and give you  copies of necessary documents to facilitate the appointment of a  representative. If you have a representative, the adjudication officer  will conduct an informal conference with the representative, in person  or by telephone, to identify the issues in dispute and prepare proposed  written agreements for the approval of the administrative law judge  regarding those issues which are not in dispute and those issues  proposed for the hearing. If you decide to proceed without  representation, the adjudication officer may hold an informal conference  with you. If you obtain representation after the adjudication officer  has concluded that your case is ready for a hearing, the administrative  law judge will return your case to the adjudication officer who will  conduct an informal conference with you and your representative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Evidence. You, or your representative, may submit, or may be  asked to obtain and submit, additional evidence to the adjudication  officer. As the adjudication officer determines is appropriate under the  circumstances of your case, the adjudication officer may refer the claim  for further medical or vocational evidence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Referral for a hearing. The adjudication officer will refer the  claim to the administrative law judge for further proceedings when the  development of evidence is complete, and you or your representative  agree that a hearing is ready to be held. If you or your representative  are unable to agree with the adjudication officer that the development  of evidence is complete, the adjudication officer will note your  disagreement and refer the claim to the   administrative law judge for further proceedings. At this point, the  administrative law judge conducts all further hearing proceedings,  including scheduling and holding a hearing, (Sec. 416.1436), considering  any additional evidence or arguments submitted (Secs. 416.1435,  416.1444, 416.1449, 416.1450), and issuing a decision or dismissal of  your request for a hearing, as may be appropriate (Secs. 416.1448,  416.1453, 416.1457). In addition, if the administrative law judge  determines on or before the date of your hearing that the development of  evidence is not complete, the administrative law judge may return the  claim to the adjudication officer to complete the development of the  evidence and for such other action as necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fully favorable decisions issued by an adjudication officer.  If, after a hearing is requested but before it is held, the adjudication  officer decides that the evidence in your case warrants a decision which  is fully favorable to you, the adjudication officer may issue such a  decision. For purposes of the tests authorized under this section, the  adjudication officer's decision shall be considered to be a decision as  defined in Sec. 416.1401. If the adjudication officer issues a decision  under this section, it will be in writing and will give the findings of  fact and the reasons for the decision. The adjudication officer will  evaluate the issues relevant to determining whether or not you are  disabled in accordance with the provisions of the Social Security Act,  the rules in this part and part 422 of this chapter and applicable  Social Security Rulings. For cases in which the adjudication officer  issues a decision, he or she may determine your residual functional  capacity in the same manner that an administrative law judge is  authorized to do so in Sec. 416.946. The adjudication officer may also  evaluate the severity of your mental impairments in the same manner that  an administrative law judge is authorized to do so under Sec. 416.920a.  The adjudication officer's decision will be based on the evidence which  is included in the record and, subject to paragraph (c)(2) of this  section, will complete the actions that will be taken on your request  for hearing. A copy of the decision will be mailed to all parties at  their last known address. We will tell you in the notice that the  administrative law judge will not hold a hearing unless a party to the  hearing requests that the hearing proceed. A request to proceed with the  hearing must be made in writing within 30 days after the date the notice  of the decision of the adjudication officer is mailed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Effect of a decision by an adjudication officer. A decision by  an adjudication officer which is fully favorable to you under this  section, and notification thereof, completes the administrative action  on your request for hearing and is binding on all parties to the hearing  and not subject to further review, unless--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You or another party requests that the hearing continue, as  provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Appeals Council decides to review the decision on its own  motion under the authority provided in Sec. 416.1469;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The decision is revised under the procedures explained in  Secs. 416.1487 through 416.1489; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In a case remanded by a Federal court, the Appeals Council  assumes jurisdiction under the procedures in Sec. 416.1484.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fee for a representative's services. The adjudication officer  may authorize a fee for your representative's services if the  adjudication officer makes a decision on your claim that is fully  favorable to you, and you are represented. The actions of, and any fee  authorization made by, the adjudication officer with respect to  representation will be made in accordance with the provisions of subpart  O of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Who may be an adjudication officer. The adjudication officer  described in this section may be an employee of the Social Security  Administration or a State agency that makes disability determinations  for us.
