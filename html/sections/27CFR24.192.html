Fruit syrup, sugar, wine,  wine spirits, and acid may be used in preparing a finishing dosage for  sparkling wine or artificially carbonated wine provided the dosage does  not exceed 10 percent by volume of the finished product. Where the  proprietor desires to use more than 10 percent by volume finishing  dosage, the proprietor shall file for a formula approval under Sec.  24.80. The fruit syrup, wine spirits and wine used will come from the  same kind of fruit as the wine from which the sparkling wine or  artificially carbonated wine is made.

Tax-free wine spirits may only  be used in the production of sparkling wine or artificially carbonated  wine   which is a natural wine. In the refermentation and finishing of a  sparkling wine, the acids and materials specifically authorized in Sec.  24.246 may be used.  (Sec. 201, Pub.
