In any proceeding in which the Assistant Secretary intends to deny the application or grant the application with the attachment of material conditions unknown to, or likely to be opposed by, the applicant, solely on the basis of the application and responses to the notice of application or notice of procedures, if applicable, without additional procedures, the Assistant Secretary shall advise the parties in writing generally of the issues of concern to the Assistant Secretary upon which the denial or material conditions would be based and provide them with an opportunity to request additional procedures pursuant to Secs. 590.310, 590.311, 590.312 and 590.313.</p>
