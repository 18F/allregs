                                Sec.  1054.240  How do I demonstrate that my emission family complies
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For purposes of certification, your emission family is considered in compliance with the emission standards in Sec.  1054.101(a) if all emission-data engines representing that family have test results showing deteriorated emission levels at or below these standards. This includes all test points over the course of the durability demonstration. Note that your FELs are considered to be the applicable emission standards with which you must comply if you participate in the ABT program in subpart H of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Your engine family is deemed not to comply if any emission-data engine representing that family has test results showing a deteriorated emission level for any pollutant that is above an applicable emission standard. This includes all test points over the course of the durability demonstration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determine a deterioration factor to compare emission levels from the emission-data engine with the applicable emission standards. Section 1054.245 specifies how to test engines to develop deterioration factors that represent the expected deterioration in emissions over your engines' full useful life. Calculate a multiplicative deterioration factor as described in Sec.  1054.245(b). If the deterioration factor is less than one, use one. Specify the deterioration factor to one more significant figure than the emission standard. You may use assigned deterioration factors that we establish for up to 10,000 nonhandheld engines from small-volume emission families in each model year, except that small-volume engine manufacturers may use assigned deterioration factors for any or all of their engine families.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Adjust the official emission results for each tested engine at the low-hour test point by multiplying the measured emissions by the deterioration factor, then rounding the adjusted figure to the same number of decimal places as the emission standard. Compare the rounded emission levels to the emission standard for each emission-data engine. In the case of HC+NOX standards, add the official emission results and apply the deterioration factor to the sum of the pollutants before rounding. However, if your deterioration factors are based on emission measurements that do not cover the engine's full useful life, apply deterioration factors to each pollutant and then add the results before rounding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The provisions of this paragraph (e) apply only for engine families with a useful life at or below 300 hours. To apply the deterioration factor to engines other than the original emission-data engine, they must be operated for the same number of hours before starting emission measurements that you used for the original emission-data engine, within one hour. For example, if the original emission-data engine operated for 8 hours before the low-hour emission test, operate the other test engines for 7 to 9 hours before starting emission measurements.</p>
