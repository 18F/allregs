Sec. 880.612a  Preference for occupancy by elderly families.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Election of preference for occupancy by elderly families--(1) Election by owners of eligible projects. (i) An owner of a project assisted under this part (including a partially assisted project) that was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families (an ``eligible project'') may, at any time, elect to give preference to elderly families in selecting tenants for assisted, vacant units in the project, subject to the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Election by owners of eligible projects. (i) An owner of a project assisted under this part (including a partially assisted project) that was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families (an ``eligible project'') may, at any time, elect to give preference to elderly families in selecting tenants for assisted, vacant units in the project, subject to the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An owner of a project assisted under this part (including a partially assisted project) that was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families (an ``eligible project'') may, at any time, elect to give preference to elderly families in selecting tenants for assisted, vacant units in the project, subject to the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of this section, a project eligible for the preference provided by this section, and for which the owner makes an election to give preference in occupancy to elderly families is referred to as an ``elderly project.'' ``Elderly families'' refers to families whose heads of household, their spouses or sole members are 62 years or older.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An owner who elects to provide a preference to elderly families in accordance with this section is required to notify families on the waiting list who are not elderly that the election has been made and how the election may affect them if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The percentage of disabled families currently residing in the project

who are neither elderly nor near-elderly (hereafter, collectively referred to as ``non-elderly disabled families'') is equal to or exceeds the minimum required percentage of units established for the elderly project in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and therefore non-elderly families on the waiting list (including non-elderly disabled families) may be passed over for covered section 8 units; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The project, after making the calculation set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, will have no units set aside for non-elderly disabled families.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> An owner who elects to give a preference for elderly families in accordance with this section shall not remove an applicant from the project's waiting list on the basis of having made the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> HUD approval of election not required. (i) An owner is not required to solicit or obtain the approval of HUD before exercising the election of preference for occupancy provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The owner, however, if challenged on the issue of eligibility of the project for the election provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be able to support the project's eligibility through the production of all relevant documentation in the possession of the owner that pertains to the original design of the project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An owner is not required to solicit or obtain the approval of HUD before exercising the election of preference for occupancy provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The owner, however, if challenged on the issue of eligibility of the project for the election provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be able to support the project's eligibility through the production of all relevant documentation in the possession of the owner that pertains to the original design of the project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Department reserves the right at any time to review and make determinations regarding the accuracy of the identification of the project as an elderly project. The Department can make such determinations as a result of ongoing monitoring activities, or the conduct of complaint investigations under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 through 3619), or compliance reviews and complaint investigations under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and other applicable statutes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Determining projects eligible for preference for occupancy by elderly families--(1) Evidence supporting project eligibility. Evidence that a project assisted under this part (or portion of a project) was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families, and is therefore eligible for the election of occupancy preference provided by this section, shall consist of at least one item from the sources (``primary'' sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, or at least two items from the sources (``secondary'' sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Evidence supporting project eligibility. Evidence that a project assisted under this part (or portion of a project) was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families, and is therefore eligible for the election of occupancy preference provided by this section, shall consist of at least one item from the sources (``primary'' sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, or at least two items from the sources (``secondary'' sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Primary sources. Identification of the project (or portion of a project) as serving elderly (seniors) families in at least one primary source such as: The application in response to the notice of funding availability; the terms of the notice of funding availability under which the application was solicited; the regulatory agreement; the loan commitment; the bid invitation; the owner's management plan, or any underwriting or financial document collected at or before loan closing; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Secondary sources. Two or more sources of evidence such as: lease records from the earliest two years of occupancy for which records are available showing that occupancy has been restricted primarily to households where the head, spouse or sole member is 62 years of age or older; evidence that services for elderly persons have been provided, such as services funded by the Older Americans Act, transportation to senior citizen centers, or programs coordinated with the Area Agency on Aging; project unit mix with more than fifty percent of efficiency and one-bedroom units [a secondary source particularly relevant to distinguishing elderly projects under the previous section 3(b) definition (in which disabled families were included in the definition of ``elderly families'') from non-elderly projects and which in combination with other factors (such as the number of accessible units) may be useful in distinguishing projects for seniors from those serving the broader definition of ``elderly families'' which includes disabled families]; or any other relevant type of historical data, unless clearly contradicted by other comparable evidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sources in conflict. If a primary source establishes a design contrary to that established by the primary source upon which the owner would base support that the project is an eligible project (as defined in this section), the owner cannot make the election of

preferences for elderly families as provided by this section based upon primary sources alone. In any case where primary sources do not provide clear evidence of original design of the project for occupancy primarily by elderly families, including those cases where primary sources conflict, secondary sources may be used to establish the use for which the project was originally designed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reservation of units in elderly projects for non-elderly disabled families. The owner of an elderly project is required to reserve, at a minimum, the number of units specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for occupancy by non-elderly disabled families.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Minimum number of units to be reserved for non-elderly disabled families. The number of units in an elderly project required to be reserved for occupancy by non-elderly disabled families, shall be, at a minimum, the lesser of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The number of units equivalent to the higher of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The percentage of units assisted under this part in the elderly project that were occupied by non-elderly disabled families on October 28, 1992; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The percentage of units assisted under this part in the elderly project that were occupied by non-elderly disabled families upon January 1, 1992; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 10 percent of the number of units assisted under this part in the eligible project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Option to reserve greater number of units for non-elderly disabled families. The owner, at the owner's option, and at any time, may reserve a greater number of units for non-elderly disabled families than that provided for in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The option to provide a greater number of units to non-elderly disabled families will not obligate the owner to always provide that greater number to non-elderly disabled families. The number of units required to be provided to non-elderly disabled families at any time in an elderly project is that number determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Secondary preferences. An owner of an elderly project also may elect to establish secondary preferences in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Preference for near-elderly disabled families in units reserved for elderly families. If the owner of an elderly project determines, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, that there are an insufficient number of elderly families who have applied for occupancy to fill all the vacant units in the elderly project reserved for elderly families (that is, all units except those reserved for the non-elderly disabled families as provided in paragraph (c) of this section), the owner may give preference for occupancy of such units to disabled families who are near-elderly families.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Preference for near-elderly disabled families in units reserved for non-elderly disabled families. If the owner of an elderly project determines, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, that there are an insufficient number of non-elderly disabled families to fill all the vacant units in the elderly project reserved for non-elderly disabled families as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the owner may give preference for occupancy of these units to disabled families who are near-elderly families.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Availability of units to families without regard to preference. An owner shall make vacant units in an elderly project generally available to otherwise eligible families who apply for housing, without regard to the preferences and reservation of units provided in this section if either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The owner has adopted the secondary preferences and there are an insufficient number of families for whom elderly preference, reserve preference, and secondary preference has been given, to fill all the vacant units; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The owner has not adopted the secondary preferences and there are an insufficient number of families for whom elderly preference, and reserve preference has been given to fill all the vacant units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Determination of insufficient number of applicants qualifying for preference. To make a determination that there are an insufficient number of applicants who qualify for the preferences, including secondary preferences, provided by this section, the owner must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Conduct marketing in accordance with Sec. 880.601(a) to attract applicants

qualifying for the preferences and reservation of units set forth in this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Make a good faith effort to lease to applicants who qualify for the preferences provided in this section, including taking all feasible actions to fill vacancies by renting to such families.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Prohibition of evictions. An owner may not evict a tenant without good cause, or require that a tenant vacate a unit, in whole or in part because of any reservation or preference provided in this section, or because of any action taken by the Secretary pursuant to subtitle D (sections 651 through 661) of title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 13611 through 13620).
