To  effectuate a tax-free sale directly from the manufacturer, first or  second purchaser to an ultimate purchaser, the ultimate purchaser must,  in every case, satisfy the provisions of paragraphs (b)(3)(i), (ii) and  (iii) of this section. Persons not required to be registered under  section 4222(b) may purchase articles tax free by following the same  procedures that apply to them in the case of other tax-free sales.
