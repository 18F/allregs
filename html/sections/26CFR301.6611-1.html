                                Sec. 301.6611-1  Interest on overpayments.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Except as otherwise provided, interest shall be  allowed on any overpayment of any tax at the annual rate referred to in  the regulations under section 6621 from the date of overpayment of the  tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Date of overpayment. Except as provided in section 6401(a),  relating to assessment and collection after the expiration of the  applicable period of limitation, there can be no overpayment of tax  until the entire tax liability has been satisfied. Therefore, the dates  of overpayment of any tax are the date of payment of the first amount  which (when added to previous payments) is in excess of the tax  liability (including any interest, addition to the tax, or additional  amount) and the dates of payment of all amounts subsequently paid with  respect to such tax liability. For rules relating to the determination  of the date of payment in the case of an advance payment of tax, a  payment of estimated tax, and a credit for income tax withholding, see  paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The application of paragraph (b) may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Corporation X files an income tax return on March 15,  1955, for the calendar year 1954 disclosing a tax liability of $1,000  and elects to pay the tax in installments. Subsequent to payment of the  final installment, the correct tax liability is determined to be $900.</p><p class="depth0">Tax liability Assessed.......................................................   $1,000 Correct liability..............................................      900</p><p class="depth0">-------- Overassessment.................................................      100</p><p class="depth0">Record of payments</p><p class="depth0">Mar. 15, 1955..................................................     $500 June 15, 1955..................................................      500</p><p class="depth0">Since the correct liability in this case is $900, the payment of $500  made on March 15, 1955, and $400 of the payment made on June 15, 1955,  are applied in satisfaction of the tax liability. The balance of the  payment made on June 15, 1955 ($100) constitutes the amount of the  overpayment, and the date on which such payment was made would be the  date of the overpayment from which interest would be computed.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Corporation Y files an income tax return for the calendar  year 1954 on March 15, 1955, disclosing a tax liability of $50,000, and  elects to pay the tax in installments. On October 15, 1956, a deficiency  in the amount of $10,000 is assessed and is paid in equal amounts on  November 15 and November 26, 1956. On April 15, 1957, it is determined  that the correct tax liability of the taxpayer for 1954 is only $35,000.</p><p class="depth0">Tax liability Original assessment...........................................   $50,000 Deficiency assessment.........................................    10,000</p><p class="depth0">--------- Total assessed................................................    60,000 Correct liability.............................................    35,000</p><p class="depth0">--------- Overassessment................................................    25,000</p><p class="depth0">Record of payments</p><p class="depth0">Mar. 15, 1955.................................................   $25,000 June 15, 1955.................................................    25,000 Nov. 15, 1956.................................................     5,000 Nov. 26, 1956.................................................     5,000</p><p class="depth0">Since the correct liability in this case is $35,000, the entire payment  of $25,000 made on March 15, 1955, and $10,000 of the payment made on  June 15, 1955, are applied in satisfaction of the tax liability. The  balance of the payment made on June 15, 1955 ($15,000), plus the amounts  paid on November 15 ($5,000), and November 26, 1956 ($5,000), constitute  the amount of the overpayment. The dates of the overpayments from which  interest would be computed are as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Amount of</p><p class="depth0">Date                             overpayment ------------------------------------------------------------------------ June 15, 1955..............................................      $15,000 Nov. 15, 1956..............................................        5,000 Nov. 26, 1956..............................................        5,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------  The amount of any interest paid with respect to the deficiency of  $10,000 is also an overpayment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Advance payment of tax, payment of estimated tax, and credit for  income tax withholding. In the case of an advance payment of tax, a  payment of estimated income tax, or a credit for income tax withholding,  the provisions of section 6513 (except the provisions of subsection (c)  thereof), applicable in determining the date of payment of tax for  purposes of the period of limitations on credit or refund, shall apply  in determining the date of overpayment for purposes of computing  interest thereon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Refund of income tax caused by carryback. If any overpayment of  tax imposed by subtitle A of the Code results from the carryback of a  net operating loss, a net capital loss, an investment credit, or a work  incentive (WIN) credit, such overpayment, for purposes of this section,  shall be deemed not to have been made prior to the end of the taxable  year in which the loss or credit arises, or, with respect to any portion  of an investment credit carryback or a WIN credit carryback from a  taxable year attributable to a net operating loss carryback or a capital  loss carryback from a subsequent taxable year, such overpayment shall be  deemed not to have been made prior to the close of such subsequent  taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Refund of income tax caused by carryback of foreign taxes. For  purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, any overpayment of tax  resulting from a carryback of tax paid or accrued to foreign countries  or possessions of the United States shall be deemed not to have been  paid or accrued before the close of the taxable year under subtitle F of  the Code in which such taxes were in fact paid or accrued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Period for which interest allowable in case of refunds. If an  overpayment of tax is refunded, interest shall be allowed from the date  of the overpayment to a date determined by the district director or the  director of the regional service center, which shall be not more than 30  days prior to the date of the refund check. The acceptance of a refund  check shall not deprive the taxpayer of the right to make a claim for  any additional overpayment and interest thereon, provided the claim is  made within the applicable period of limitation. However, if a taxpayer  does not accept a refund check, no additional interest on the amount of  the overpayment included in such check shall be allowed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Period for which interest allowable in case of credits--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  General rule. If an overpayment of tax is credited, interest shall be  allowed from the date of overpayment to the due date (as determined  under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (h)) of the amount against  which such overpayment is credited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determination of due date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The term ``due  date'', as used in this section, means the last day fixed by law or  regulations for the payment of the tax (determined without regard to any  extension of time), and not the date on which the district director or  the director of the regional service center makes demand for the payment  of the tax. Therefore, the due date of a tax (other than an additional  assessment subject to the special rule provided by subdivision (iv) of  this subparagraph) is the date fixed for the payment of the tax or the  several installments thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Tax payable in installments--(a) In general. In the case of a  credit against a tax, where the taxpayer had properly elected to pay the  tax in installments, the due date is the date prescribed for the payment  of the installment against which the credit is applied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Delinquent installment. If the taxpayer is delinquent in payment  of an installment of tax and a notice and demand has been issued for the  payment of the delinquent installment and the remaining installments,  the due date of each remaining installment shall then be the date of  such notice and demand.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Tax or installment not yet due. If a taxpayer agrees to the  crediting of an overpayment against tax or an installment of tax and the  schedule of allowance is signed prior to the date on which such tax or  installment would otherwise become due, then the due date of such tax or  installment shall be the date on which such schedule is signed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Additional assessment satisfied by credit before January 1,  1958. In the case of a credit made before January 1, 1958, against an  additional assessment, the due date of the tax satisfied by the credit  is the date the additional assessment was made. For purposes of this  subdivision, the term ``additional assessment'' means a further  assessment of a tax of the same character previously paid in part, and  includes the assessment of a deficiency as defined in section 6211.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Interest. In the case of a credit against interest that accrues  for any period ending prior to January 1, 1983, the due date is the  earlier of the date of assessment of such interest or December 31, 1982.  In the case of a credit against interest that accrues for any period  beginning on or after December 31, 1982, such interest is due as it  economically accrues on a daily basis, rather than when it is assessed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Additional amount, addition to the tax, or assessable penalty.  In the case of a credit against an additional amount, addition to the  tax, or assessable penalty, the due date is the earlier of the date of  assessment or the date from which such amount would bear interest if not  satisfied by payment or credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Estimated income tax for succeeding year. If the taxpayer  elects to have all or part of the overpayment shown by his return  applied to his estimated tax for his succeeding taxable year, no  interest shall be allowed on such portion of the overpayment credited  and such amount shall be applied as a payment on account of the  estimated tax for such year or the installments thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Refund of overpayment. No interest shall be allowed on any  overpayment of tax imposed by subtitle A of the Code if such overpayment  is refunded--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the case of a return filed on or before the last date  prescribed for filing the return of such tax (determined without regard  to any extension of time for filing such return), within 45 days after  such last date, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> After December 17, 1966, in the case of a return filed after the  last day prescribed for filing the return, within 45 days after the date  on which the return is filed.  However, in the case of any overpayment of tax by an individual (other  than an estate or trust and other than a nonresident alien individual)  for a taxable year beginning in 1974, ``60 days'' shall be substituted  for ``45 days'' each place it appears in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Effective date. Paragraphs (h)(2)(v) and (h)(2)(vi) of this  section are effective for credits made on or after August 25, 1992.
