The rules for determining RVUs for anesthesia services are set forth in Sec. 414.46.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Radiology services. CMS bases the RVUs for all radiology services on the relative value scale developed under section 1834(b)(1)(A) of the Act, with appropriate modifications to ensure that the RVUs established for radiology services that are similar or related to other physician services are consistent with the RVUs established for those similar or related services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Practice expense RVUs. (1) Practice expense RVUs are computed for each service or class of service by applying average historical practice cost percentages to the estimated average allowed charge during the 1991 base period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Practice expense RVUs are computed for each service or class of service by applying average historical practice cost percentages to the estimated average allowed charge during the 1991 base period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The average practice expense percentage for a service or class of services is computed as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Multiply the average practice expense percentage for each specialty by the proportion of a particular service or class of service performed by that specialty.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Add the products for all specialties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For services furnished beginning calendar year (CY) 1994, for which 1994 practice expense RVUs exceed 1994 work RVUs and that are performed in office settings less than 75 percent of the time, the 1994, 1995, and 1996 practice expense RVUs are reduced by 25 percent of the amount by which they exceed the number of 1994 work RVUs. Practice expense RVUs are not reduced to less than 128 percent of 1994 work RVUs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For services furnished beginning January 1, 1998, practice expense RVUs for certain services are reduced to 110 percent of the work RVUs for those services.

For services furnished in 2000, the practice expense RVUs are based on 50 percent of the practice expense RVUs applicable to services furnished

in 1998 and 50 percent of the relative practice expense resources involved in furnishing the service. For services furnished in 2001, the practice expense RVUs are based on 25 percent of the practice expense RVUs applicable to services furnished in 1998 and 75 percent of the relative practice expense resources involved in furnishing the service. For services furnished in 2002 and subsequent years, the practice expense RVUs are based entirely on relative practice expense resources.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Usually there are two levels of practice expense RVUs that correspond to each code.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Facility practice expense RVUs.

Outpatient therapy services (including physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology services) and CORF services billed under the physician fee schedule are paid using the nonfacility practice expense RVUs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Only one practice expense RVU per code can be applied for each of the following services: services that have only technical component practice expense RVUs or only professional component practice expense RVUs; evaluation and management services, such as hospital or nursing facility visits, that are furnished exclusively in one setting; and major surgical services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)(i)</em> CMS establishes criteria for supplemental surveys regarding specialty practice expenses submitted to CMS that may be used in determining practice expense RVUs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> CMS establishes criteria for supplemental surveys regarding specialty practice expenses submitted to CMS that may be used in determining practice expense RVUs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any CMS-designated specialty group may submit a supplemental survey.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> CMS will consider for use in determining practice expense RVUs for the physician fee schedule survey data and related materials submitted to CMS by March 1, 2004 to determine CY 2005 practice expense RVUs and by March 1, 2005 to determine CY 2006 practice expense RVUs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Malpractice insurance RVUs.
