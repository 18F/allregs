The Lessor's failure to assert its right for adjustment within the time frame specified herein shall be a waiver of the Lessor's right to an adjustment under this paragraph. Failure to agree to any adjustment shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause. However, nothing in this clause excuses the lessor from proceeding with the change as directed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Absent such written change order, the Government is not liable to Lessor under this clause.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)
