                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any miner who believes the classification for pneumoconiosis reported to him or her by MSHA is in error may file a written request with NIOSH that his or her radiograph be reevaluated. If the classification was based on agreement between an A Reader and a B Reader, NIOSH will obtain one or more additional classifications by B Readers as necessary to obtain agreement in accord with Sec.  37.53, and MSHA must report the results to the miner together with notification from MSHA of any rights which may accrue to the miner in accordance with Sec.  37.7. If the reported classification was based on agreement between two (or more) B Readers, the reading will be accepted as conclusive and the miner must be so informed by MSHA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any operator who is directed by MSHA to transfer a miner to a less dusty atmosphere based on the most recent examination may file a written request with NIOSH to review its findings. The standards set forth in paragraph (a) of this section apply and the operator and miner will be notified by MSHA whether the miner is entitled to the option to transfer.
