Naturalized citizens will be required to furnish evidence of naturalization pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 2802.1-4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An application by a private corporation must be accompanied by two copies of its articles of incorporation, one of which must be certified by the proper official of the company under its corporate seal, or by the secretary of the State where organized. A corporation organized in a State other than Oregon must submit a certificate issued by the State of Oregon attesting that the corporation is authorized to transact business within that State. The requirements of this paragraph shall be deemed satisfied if the corporation, having once filed the required documents, makes specific reference to the date and case number of such previous applications, states what changes, if any, have been made since the prior filings, and includes a statement that the right of the company to do business in the State of Oregon has not lapsed or terminated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where the application is for a right-of-way on any portion of which the applicant proposes to construct a road, it must be accompanied by two copies of a map prepared on a scale of 4 inches or 8 inches to the mile. Showing the survey of the right-of-way so that it may be accurately located on the ground. The map should comply

with the following requirements, except as the authorized officer may waive in any particular instance all or any of such requirements:</p><p class="depth2">Courses and distances of the center line of the right-of-way should be given; the courses referred to the true meridian and the distance in feet and decimals thereof. The initial and terminal points of the survey must be accurately connected by course and distance to the nearest readily identifiable corner of the public land surveys, or, if there be no such corner within two miles, then connected to two permanent and prominent monuments or natural objects. All subdivisions of the public lands surveys, any part of which is within the limits of the survey, should be shown in their entirety, based upon the official subsisting plat with subdivisions, section, township, and range clearly marked. The width of the right-of-way should be given; and if not of uniform width, the locations and amount of change must be definitely shown. There shall also be a statement on the face of or appended to the map indicating the grade and usable width of the road to be constructed, the type of material which will be used for the surface, the type and extent of the drainage facilities, and the type of construction and estimated capacity of any bridges. The map should bear upon its face the statement of the person who made the survey, if any, and the certificate of the applicant; such statement and certificate should be as set out in Forms as approved by the Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where the application is for the use of an existing road, a map adequate to show the location thereof will be required, together with a statement of the specific nature and location of any proposed improvements to such road. A blank map suitable for most cases may be procured from the appropriate district forester.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Every application for a right-of-way must also be accompanied by a diagram indicating the roads and rights-of-way which form an integral part of the road system with which the requested right-of-way will connect, the portions of such road system which the applicant directly controls within the meaning of Sec. 2812.0-5(i), the portions thereof which the applicant indirectly controls within the meaning of Sec. 2812.0-5(j), and the portions thereof as to which the applicant has no control within the meaning of such sections. As to the portions over which the applicant has no control, he must furnish a statement showing for the two years preceding the date of the filing of the application, all periods of time that he had direct or indirect control thereof, and the date and nature of any changes in such control. The diagram shall also contain the name of the person whom the applicant believes directly controls any portion of such road system which the applicant does not directly control. Where a right-of-way for a railroad is involved, the applicant must indicate which portions of the right-of-way will be available for use as truck roads upon the removal of the rails and ties and the probable date of such removal. Blank diagram forms, suitable for most cases, may be obtained from the appropriate district forester.</p>
