                                Sec. 1070.17  Requests for expedited processing.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The CFPB shall process a request on an expedited basis whenever a requester demonstrates a compelling need for expedited processing in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph or in other cases that the CFPB deems appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form and content of a request for expedited processing. A request for expedited processing shall be made as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A request for expedited processing shall be made in writing or by electronic means and submitted as part of a request for records in accordance with section 1070.14(b). When a request for records includes a request for expedited processing, the request shall be labeled ``Expedited Processing Requested.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A request for expedited processing shall contain a statement that demonstrates a compelling need for the requester to obtain expedited processing of the requested records. A ``compelling need'' is defined as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Failure to obtain the requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual. The requester shall fully explain the circumstances warranting such an expected threat so that the CFPB may make a reasoned determination that a delay in obtaining the requested records could pose such a threat; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> With respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal government activity. A person ``primarily engaged in disseminating information'' does not include individuals who are engaged only incidentally in the dissemination of information. The standard of ``urgency to inform'' requires that the records requested pertain to a matter of current exigency to the American public and that delaying a response to a request for records would compromise a significant recognized interest to and throughout the American general public. The requester must adequately explain the matter or activity and why the records sought are necessary to be provided on an expedited basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The requester shall certify the written statement that purports to demonstrate a compelling need for expedited processing to be true and correct to the best of the requester's knowledge and belief. The certification must be in the form prescribed by 28 U.S.C. 1746: ``I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. Executed on [date].'' The requester shall mail or submit electronically a copy of such written certification to the Chief FOIA Officer as set forth in Sec. 1070.14(b) of this subpart. The CFPB may waive this certification requirement in appropriate circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determinations of requests for expedited processing. Within ten (10) calendar days of its receipt of a request for expedited processing, the CFPB shall decide whether to grant it and shall notify the requester of the determination in writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effect of granting requests for expedited processing. If the CFPB grants a request for expedited processing, then the CFPB shall give the expedited request priority over non-expedited requests and shall process the expedited request as soon as practicable. The CFPB may assign expedited requests to their own simple and complex processing tracks based upon the amount of work and/or time needed to process them. Within each such track, an expedited request shall be processed in the order of its receipt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Appeals of denials of requests for expedited processing. If the CFPB denies a request for expedited processing, then the requester shall have the right to submit an appeal of the denial determination in accordance with Sec. 1070.21 of this subpart. The CFPB shall communicate this appeal right as part of its written notification to the requester denying expedited processing. The requester shall label its appeal request ``Appeal for Expedited Processing.'' The CFPB shall act expeditiously upon an appeal of a denial of a request for expedited processing.</p>
