On January 11, 2012, NC DENR supplemented their December 12, 2007, submission with a commitment to address the requirements of CAA section 110(a)(2)(E)(ii) of the CAA which requires state compliance with section 128 of the CAA. EPA is conditionally approving North Carolina's submittal with respect to CAA section 110(a)(2)(E)(ii).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> North Carolina submitted a letter to EPA on July 10, 2012, with a commitment to address the State Implementation Plan deficiencies regarding requirements of Clean Air Act sections 110(a)(2)(C) and 110(a)(2)(J) as they both relate to Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) infrastructure requirements for the 1997 annual and 2006 24-hour fine particulate matter (PM2.5) national ambient air quality standards. EPA is conditionally approving North Carolina's commitment to address outstanding requirements promulgated in the New Source Review (NSR) PM2.5 Rule related to the PM2.5 standard for their PSD program and committing to providing the necessary SIP revision to address these NSR PM2.5 Rule requirements. If North Carolina fails to submit these revisions by October 16, 2013, the conditional approval will automatically become a disapproval on that date and EPA will issue a finding of disapproval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> North Carolina submitted a commitment letter to EPA on July 10, 2012, requesting conditional approval of outstanding requirements related to the NSR PM2.5 Rule. In this letter, North Carolina provided a schedule as to how it will address outstanding requirements related to the NSR PM2.5 Rule (including PM2.5 PSD Increment-SILs-SMC, as it relates to PM2.5 increments to meet the prong 3 requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)). EPA conditionally approved the NSR PM2.5 Rule submission for North Carolina on October 16, 2012, (77 FR 63234). If the North Carolina fails to submit these revisions by October 16, 2013, the conditional approval will automatically become a

disapproval on that date and EPA will issue a finding of disapproval.
