All milk received  pursuant to this paragraph shall be priced at the location of the plant  where it is first physically received;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Received by a handler described in Sec. 1000.9(c) in excess of  the quantity delivered to pool plants;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Diverted by a pool plant operator for the account of the handler  operating such plant to another pool plant. Milk so diverted shall be  priced at the location of the plant to which diverted; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Diverted by the operator of a pool plant or a handler described  in Sec. 1000.9(c) to a nonpool plant, subject to the following  conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Milk of a dairy farmer shall not be eligible for diversion  unless a delivery of at least 40,000 pounds or one day's milk  production, whichever is less, of such dairy farmer has been physically  received as producer milk at a pool plant and the dairy farmer has  continuously retained producer status since that time;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The total quantity of milk diverted during the month by a  cooperative association shall not exceed 50 percent of the total  quantity of producer milk that the cooperative association caused to be  received at pool plants and diverted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The operator of a pool plant that is not a cooperative  association may divert any milk that is not under the control of a  cooperative association that diverts milk during the month pursuant to  this paragraph. The total quantity of milk so diverted during the month  shall not exceed 50 percent of the total quantity of the producer milk  physically received at such plant (or such unit of plants in the case of  plants   that pool as a unit pursuant to Sec. 1126.7(e)) and diverted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any milk diverted in excess of the limits prescribed in  paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section shall not be producer milk. If  the diverting handler or cooperative association fails to designate the  dairy farmers' deliveries that will not be producer milk, no milk  diverted by the handler or cooperative association shall be producer  milk;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Diverted milk shall be priced at the location of the plant to  which diverted; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The delivery requirement in paragraph (d)(1) and the diversion  percentages in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section may be  increased or decreased by the market administrator if there is a finding  that such revision is necessary to assure orderly marketing and  efficient handling of milk in the marketing area. Before making such a  finding, the market administrator shall investigate the need for the  revision either on the market administrator's own initiative or at the  request of interested persons if the request is made in writing at least  15 days prior to the month for which the requested revision is desired  effective. If the investigation shows that a revision might be  appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice stating that  the revision is being considered and inviting written data, views, and  arguments. Any decision to revise the delivery day requirement or any  diversion percentage must be issued in writing at least one day before  the effective date.</p>
