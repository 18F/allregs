                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As a BAT or STT, you have the responsibility of trying to  complete successfully an alcohol test for each employee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If, during or shortly after the testing process, you become  aware of any event that will cause the test to be cancelled (see Sec.  40.267), you must try to correct the problem promptly, if practicable.  You may repeat the testing process as part of this effort.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If repeating the testing process is necessary, you must begin a  new test as soon as possible. You must use a new ATF, a new sequential  test number, and, if needed, a new ASD and/or a new EBT. It is  permissible to use additional technical capabilities of the EBT (e.g.,  manual operation) if you have been trained to do so in accordance with  Sec. 40.213(c) .</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If repeating the testing process is necessary, you are not  limited in the number of attempts to complete the test, provided that  the employee is making a good faith effort to comply with the testing  process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If another testing device is not available for the new test at  the testing site, you must immediately notify the DER and advise the DER  that the test could not be completed. As the DER who receives this  information, you must make all reasonable efforts to ensure that the  test is conducted at another testing site as soon as possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If, as an STT, BAT, employer or other service agent  administering the testing process, you become aware of a ``correctable  flaw'' (see Sec. 40.269) that has not already been corrected, you must  take all practicable action to correct the problem so that the test is  not cancelled.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the problem resulted from the omission of required  information, you must, as the person responsible for providing that  information, supply in writing the missing information and a signed  statement that it is true and accurate. For example, suppose you are a   BAT and you forgot to make a notation on the ``Remarks'' line of the ATF  that the employee did not sign the certification. You would, when the  problem is called to your attention, supply a signed statement that the  employee failed or refused to sign the certification after the result  was obtained, and that your signed statement is true and accurate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the problem is the use of a non-DOT form, you must, as the  person responsible for the use of the incorrect form, certify in writing  that the incorrect form contains all the information needed for a valid  DOT alcohol test. You must also provide a signed statement that the  incorrect form was used inadvertently or as the only means of conducting  a test, in circumstances beyond your control, and the steps you have  taken to prevent future use of non-DOT forms for DOT tests. You must  supply this information on the same business day on which you are  notified of the problem, transmitting it by fax or courier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you cannot correct the problem, you must cancel the test.</p>
