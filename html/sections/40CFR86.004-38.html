The manufacturer shall be required to demonstrate, subject to the approval of the Administrator, that such maintenance is reasonable and technologically necessary to assure the proper functioning of the emission control system. Such additional recommended maintenance shall be clearly differentiated, in a form approved by the Administrator, from that approved under Sec. 86.004-25(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Inspections of emission-related parts or systems with instructions to replace, repair, clean, or adjust the parts or systems if necessary, are not considered to be items of scheduled maintenance which insure the proper functioning of the emission control system.

the emissions defect and emissions performance warranty period. The explanation must clearly state that the useful life period specified on the label represents the average period of use up to retirement or rebuild for the engine family represented by the engine used in the vehicle. An explanation of how the actual useful lives of engines used in various applications are expected to differ from the average useful life may be included. The explanation(s) shall be in clear, non-technical language that is understandable to the ultimate purchaser.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If approved by the Administrator, the instructions provided to purchasers under paragraph (a) of this section shall indicate what adjustments or modifications, if any, are necessary to allow the vehicle to meet applicable emission standards at elevations above 4,000 feet, or at elevations of 4,000 feet or less.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The manufacturer shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the purchaser of each new motor engine subject to the standards prescribed in Sec. 86.004-10 or Sec. 86.004-11, as applicable, the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Instructions for all maintenance needed after the end of the useful life of the engine for critical emissions-related components as provided in Sec. 86.004-25(b), including recommended practices for diagnosis, cleaning, adjustment, repair, and replacement of the component (or a statement that such component is maintenance free for the life of the engine) and instructions for accessing and responding to any emissions-related diagnostic codes that may be stored in on-board monitoring systems;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A copy of the engine rebuild provisions contained in Sec. 86.004-40.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For each new diesel-fueled engine subject to the standards prescribed in Sec. 86.007-11, as applicable, the manufacturer shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the ultimate purchaser a statement that ``This engine must be operated only with ultra low-sulfur diesel fuel (meeting EPA specifications for highway diesel fuel, including a 15 ppm sulfur cap).''
