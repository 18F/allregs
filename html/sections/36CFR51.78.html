                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Concession contracts will provide for payment to the government  of a franchise fee or other monetary consideration as determined by the  Director upon consideration of the probable value to the concessioner of  the privileges granted by the contract involved. This probable value  will be based upon a reasonable opportunity for net profit in relation  to capital invested and the obligations of the contract. Consideration  of revenue to the United States shall be subordinate to the objectives  of protecting and preserving park areas and of providing necessary and  appropriate visitor services at reasonable rates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The franchise fee contained in a concession contract with a term  of 5 years or less may not be adjusted during the term of the contract.  Concession contracts with a term of more than 5 years will contain a  provision that provides for adjustment of the contract's established  franchise fee at the request of the concessioner or the Director. An  adjustment will occur if the concessioner and the Director mutually  determine that extraordinary, unanticipated changes occurred after the  effective date of the contract that have affected or will significantly  affect the probable value of the privileges granted by the contract. The  concession contract will provide for arbitration if the Director and a  concessioner cannot agree upon an appropriate adjustment to the  franchise fee that reflects the extraordinary, unanticipated changes  determined by the concessioner and the Director.</p>
