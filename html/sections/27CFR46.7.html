(For provisions relating to hand-carried documents, see Sec. 70.304 of this chapter.) The claim shall set forth each ground upon which the claim is made in sufficient detail to apprise the appropriate TTB officer of the exact basis therefor. Allegations pertaining to the bearing of the ultimate burden relate to additional conditions which must be established for a claim to be allowed and are not in themselves legal grounds for allowance of a claim. There shall also be attached to the form and made a part of the claim the supporting data required by Sec. 46.8. All evidence relied upon in support of such

claim shall be clearly set forth and submitted with the claim.
