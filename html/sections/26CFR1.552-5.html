If the certificate has not been  issued at the time the return of the United States shareholder is filed,  the shareholder shall compute the tax on his return by treating the bank  as a foreign personal holding company. If a certificate is issued after  the return is filed, the United States shareholder may file a claim for  refund or an amended return, and shall attach thereto a copy of the  certification.</p>
