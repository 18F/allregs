                                Sec. 776.71  Requirement to remain in good standing with licensing
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Requirement to remain in good standing with state licensing authority: (1) Each officer of the Navy appointed as a member of the Judge Advocate General's Corps, each officer of the Marine Corps designated a judge advocate, and each civil service and contracted civilian attorney who practices law under the cognizance and supervision of the JAG shall maintain a status considered ``in good standing'' at all times with the licensing authority admitting the individual to the practice of law before the highest court of at least one State, Territory, Commonwealth, or the District of Columbia.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The JAG, the Director, JA Division, HQMC, or any other supervisory attorney may require any covered USG attorney over whom they exercise authority to establish that the attorney continues to be in good standing with his or her licensing authority. Representatives of the JAG or of the Director, JA Division, HQMC, may also inquire directly of any such covered USG attorney's licensing authority to establish whether he or she continues to be in good standing and has no disciplinary action pending.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Each covered USG attorney shall immediately report to the JAG if any jurisdiction in which the covered USG attorney is or has been a member in good standing commences disciplinary investigation or action against him or her or if the covered USG attorney is disciplined, suspended, or disbarred from the practice of law in any jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Each covered non-USG attorney representing an accused in any court-martial or administrative separation proceeding shall be a member in good standing with, and authorized to practice law by, the bar of a Federal court or of the bar of the highest court of a State, or a lawyer otherwise authorized by a recognized licensing authority to practice law and found by the military judge to be qualified to represent the accused.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> The licensing authority granting the certification or privilege to practice law within the jurisdiction generally defines the phrase ``in good standing.'' At a minimum it means that the individual is subject to the jurisdiction's disciplinary review process; has not been suspended or disbarred from the practice of law within the jurisdiction; is up-to-date in the payment

of all required fees; has met applicable continuing legal education requirements which the jurisdiction has imposed (or the cognizant authority has waived those requirements in the case of the individual); and has met such other requirements as the cognizant authority has set to remain eligible to practice law. So long as these conditions are met, a covered USG attorney may be considered ``inactive'' as to the practice of law within a particular jurisdiction and still be considered ``in good standing'' for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The licensing authority granting the certification or privilege to practice law within the jurisdiction generally defines the phrase ``in good standing.'' At a minimum it means that the individual is subject to the jurisdiction's disciplinary review process; has not been suspended or disbarred from the practice of law within the jurisdiction; is up-to-date in the payment

of all required fees; has met applicable continuing legal education requirements which the jurisdiction has imposed (or the cognizant authority has waived those requirements in the case of the individual); and has met such other requirements as the cognizant authority has set to remain eligible to practice law. So long as these conditions are met, a covered USG attorney may be considered ``inactive'' as to the practice of law within a particular jurisdiction and still be considered ``in good standing'' for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rule for Courts-Martial 502(d)(3)(A) requires that any civilian defense counsel representing an accused in a court-martial be a member of the bar of a Federal court or of the bar of the highest court of a State. This civilian defense counsel qualification only has meaning if the attorney is a member ``in good standing,'' see U.S. v. Waggoner, 22 M.J. 692 (AFCMR 1986), and is then authorized to practice law within that jurisdiction. It is appropriate for the military judge, in each and every case, to ensure that a civilian defense counsel is qualified to represent the accused.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Failure of a judge advocate to comply with the requirements of this Rule may result in professional disciplinary action as provided for in this instruction, loss of certification under Articles 26 and/or 27(b), UCMJ, adverse entries in military service records, and administrative separation under Secretary of the Navy Instruction 1920.6 (series) based on the officer's failure to maintain professional qualifications. In the case of civil service and contracted civilian attorneys practicing under the JAG's cognizance and supervision, failure to maintain good standing or otherwise to comply with the requirements of this Rule may result in adverse administrative action under applicable personnel regulations, including termination of employment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A covered USG attorney need only remain in good standing in one jurisdiction. If admitted to the practice of law in more than one jurisdiction, however, and any jurisdiction commences disciplinary action against or disciplines, suspends or disbars the covered USG attorney from the practice of law, the covered USG attorney must so advise the JAG.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Certification by the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces that a covered attorney is in good standing with that court will not satisfy the requirement of this section, since such status is normally dependent on Article 27 UCMJ certification alone.
