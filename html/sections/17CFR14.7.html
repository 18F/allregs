The Commission, with due regard to the public interest, and without preliminary hearing, may by order temporarily suspend from appearing or practicing before it any person who, on or after the effective date of this rule has been by name:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Permanently enjoined by reason of his misconduct by any court of competent jurisdiction (i) whether by consent, default, upon summary judgment or after trial, in any action brought by the Commission based upon violations of any provision of the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended, or of the rules and regulations adopted thereunder, or (ii) after trial or upon summary judgment in any action brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission based upon any violation of the federal securities laws (15 U.S.C. 77a to 80b-20) or of rules and regulations adopted thereunder;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Found by any court of competent jurisdiction (whether by consent, default, upon summary judgment or after trial) in any action brought by the Commission to which he is a party, or found by the Commission (whether by consent, default, upon summary disposition or after hearing) in any administrative proceeding in which the Commission is a complainant and to which he is a party, to have committed, caused, or aided and abetted a violation of any provision of the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended, or of the rules and regulations promulgated under any of those statutes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Found upon summary judgment or after trial by any court of competent jurisdiction in any action brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to which he is a party, or found by the Securities and Exchange

Commission, upon summary disposition or after hearing, in any administrative proceeding in which the Securities and Exchange Commission is a complainant and to which he is a party, to have committed, caused, or aided or abetted a violation of any provision of the federal securities laws (15 U.S.C. 77a to 80b-20) or of the rules and regulations adopted thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Petition to lift suspension. Any person temporarily suspended from appearing and practicing before the Commission in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section may, within 30 days after service upon him of temporary suspension, petition the Commission to lift the temporary suspension. If no petition has been received by the Commission within 30 days after service of the order by mail the suspension shall become permanent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Consideration of petition. Within 30 days after the filing of the petition described in paragraph (b) of this section the Commission shall either lift the temporary suspension or set the matter down for hearing or both. After opportunity for hearing, the Commission may censure the petitioner or may disqualify the petitioner from appearing or practicing before the Commission for a period of time or permanently or may determine that no action is appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Hearing. A showing that the petitioner has been enjoined or has been found to have committed, caused or aided or abetted violations as described in paragraph (a) of this section, without more, may be a basis for censure or disqualification; that showing having been made, the burden shall then be on the petitioner to show why he should not be censured or disqualified. A petitioner will not be heard to contest any findings against him or admissions made by him in the judicial or administrative proceedings upon which the proposed censure or disqualification is based. A petitioner who has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section without admitting the facts set forth in the complaint shall nevertheless be presumed for all purposes under this section to have been enjoined by reason of the misconduct alleged in the complaint.</p>
