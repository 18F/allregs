                            <p class="depth0">The objective of a discharge review is ot examine the propriety and  equity of the applicant's discharge and to effect changes, if necessary.  The standards of the review and the underlying factors which aid in  determining whether the   standards are met shall be consistent with historical criteria for  determining honorable service. No factors shall be established that  require automatic change or denial of a change in a discharge. Neither  the NDRB nor the Secretary of the Navy shall be bound by any methodology  of weighting of the factors in reaching a determination. In each case,  the NDRB shall give full, fair, and impartial consideration to all  applicable factors before reaching a decision. An applicant may not  receive a less favorable discharge than that issued at the time of  separation. This does not preclude correction of clerical errors.</p>
