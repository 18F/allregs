                                Sec. 644.115  Revestment of title by stipulation.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">When fee title or an interest in property has been acquired by the United States by declaration of taking in a condemnation proceeding and it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to wholly or partially exclude said property or interests therein, or to acquire a lesser estate, such exclusion or diminution in the estate can be accomplished by stipulation with the former owner under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved October 21, 1942 (40 U.S.C. 258f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Required approval. All stipulations involving a revestment of title must be forwarded to DAEN-REA-C for approval with a full statement of the

facts, related data and recommendations. Approval of the revestment action must be obtained from the appropriate using agency. Such stipulations will not be filed in the condemnation proceedings by the United States Attorney until the specific approval of the Chief of Engineers is obtained and the matter coordinated by the Chief of Engineers with the Department of Justice. It should be stressed in negotiations that final approval of the stipulation is under the judrisdiction of the Attorney General, based on the recommendation of the Chief of Engineers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reduction of price. A stipulation for revestment should provide for a deduction from the agreed price or from the ultimate award of an amount equal to the difference between the value of the property originally taken and the value of said property after the proposed exclusion of a part thereof or acquisition of a lesser interest therein, i.e., the stipulation should be an over-all settlement of the case whenever possible. If it is impossible to reach an amicable agreement for complete settlement for the Government's acquisition of the tract, an agreement as to the area and estate, leaving final determination as to compensation with the court, may be submitted with facts showing that the proposed action is in the best interest of the Government. The stipulation should also include a release concerning any benefits under section 304, Pub. L. 91-646 (84 Stat. 1894), because of the revestment, particularly when no agreement is reached concerning compensation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Required information. A sample stipulation for revestment is contained in Figure 5-8 in ER 405-1-12 which may be adapted to fit the particular project and tract involved. In this connection, the following requirements should be observed:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The stipulation will not provide for any change in the amount of the deposit unless the stipulation provides for an overall settlement of the case or the entire tract is to be excluded from the acquisition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The areas in which the Government has acquired an interest and those in which an interest will be retained after the revestment will be fully described.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The estates to be retained by the Government after the revestment will be accurately described; where the owner reserves mineral or other interests or use, appropriate restriction of exploration and subordination to the paramount right of the Government to use the property for the required purpose will be included.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The stipulation should include, as part of the consideration:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Consent by the former owner to the Government's acquisition of the revised area and the estates therein in the event the stipulation is approved.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Withdrawal of any answer contesting the Government's right to acquire the property and any interrogatories theretofore filed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A waiver of any and all claims by the former owner, his heirs and assigns, against the United States, the State, County and political subdivisions thereof for loss of access to the land (where applicable).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The stipulation will include, as an exhibit, maps delineating the fee area in red, the easement area in blue, and the area to be revested in yellow.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The letter of transmittal in connection with any revestment in Civil Works projects should include information as to whether the area in which title is to be revested has a potential for recreational use without regard to the currently established public access areas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Application. The foregoing procedure applies only to instances where a declaration of taking has been filed. Where only a complaint has been filed, the necessary revisions may be made by securing a satisfactory Offer to Sell and deeds to the United States, or by amending the complaint and filing a declaration of taking containing the revised descriptions or estates.</p>
