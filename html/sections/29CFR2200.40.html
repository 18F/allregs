                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> How to make. A request for an order shall be made by motion. Motions shall be in writing or, unless the Judge directs otherwise, may be made orally during a hearing on the record and shall be included in the transcript. In exigent circumstances in cases pending before Judges, a motion may be made telephonically if it is reduced to writing and filed as soon as possible but no later than 3 working days following the time the motion was made. A motion shall state with particularity the grounds on which it is based and shall set forth the relief or order sought. A motion shall not be included in another document, such as a brief or a petition for discretionary review, but shall be made in a separate document. Prior to filing a motion, the moving party shall confer or make reasonable efforts to confer with the other parties and shall state in the motion if any other party opposes or does not oppose the motion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When to make. A motion filed in lieu of an answer pursuant to Sec. 2200.34(b) shall be filed no later than 20 days after the service of the complaint. Any other motion shall be made as soon as the grounds therefor are known.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Responses. Any party or intervenor upon whom a motion is served shall have 10 days from service of the motion to file a response. A procedural motion may be ruled upon prior to the expiration of the time for response; a party adversely affected by the ruling may within 5 days of service of the ruling seek reconsideration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Postponement not automatic upon filing of motion. The filing of a motion, including a motion for a postponement, does not automatically postpone a hearing. See Sec. 2200.62 with respect to motions for postponement.
