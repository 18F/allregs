The Department's failure to implement ordered relief shall be subject to judicial enforcement, as specified in 29 CFR 1614.503(g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, when the Department requests reconsideration and the case involves removal, separation, or suspension continuing beyond the date of the request for reconsideration, and when the decision orders retroactive restoration, the Department shall comply with the decision to the extent of the temporary or conditional restoration of the employee to duty status in the position specified by the EEOC, pending the outcome of the Department's request for reconsideration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Service under the temporary or conditional restoration provisions of paragraph (b) of this section shall be credited toward the completion of a probationary or trial period, eligibility for a within-grade increase, or the completion of the service requirement for career tenure, if the EEOC upholds its decision after reconsideration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the Department requests reconsideration, the Department may delay the payment of any amounts ordered to be paid to the Complainant until after the request for reconsideration is resolved. If the Department delays payment of any amount pending the outcome of the request to reconsider and the resolution of the request requires the Department to make the payment, then the Department shall pay interest from the date of the original appellate decision until payment is made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Department shall notify the EEOC and the employee in writing at the same time the Department requests reconsideration that the relief the Department provides is temporary or conditional and, if applicable, that the Department will delay the payment of any amounts owed but will pay interest as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Failure of the Department to provide notification will result in the dismissal of the Department's request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When no request for reconsideration is filed or when a request for reconsideration is denied, the Department shall provide the relief ordered and there is no further right to delay implementation of the ordered relief. The relief shall be provided in full not later than 60 days after receipt of the final decision, unless otherwise ordered in the decision.</p>
