Cooperative  research and development agreements do not include procurement contracts  or cooperative agreements as those terms are used in sections 6303,  6304, and 6305 of title 31, United States Code.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In no event will the National Institute of Standards and  Technology enter into a cooperative research and development agreement  with a recipient of awards under the Program which provides for the  payment of Program funds from the award recipient to the National  Institute of Standards and Technology.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> From time to time, ATP may conduct public workshops and  undertake other educational activities to foster the collaboration of  funding Recipients with other funding resources for purposes of further  development and commercialization of ATP-related technologies.
