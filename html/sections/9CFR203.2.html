                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In recent months, the Department has received information, confirmed by investigation, that a number of packers subject to the Packers and Stockyards Act have made gifts of meat to Government employees responsible for conducting service activities of the Department. Such gifts have the implications of fraud, even if not made specifically for the purpose of influencing these employees in the performance of their duties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It is a violation of the Meat Inspection Act for any person, firm, or corporation to give to any employee of the Department performing duties under such act anything of value with intent to influence such employee in the discharge of his duties, or for such employee to receive from any person, firm, or corporation engaged in interstate or foreign commerce any gift given with any intent or purpose whatsoever (21 U.S.C. 90). Under the Federal meat grading regulations, the giving or attempting to give by a packer of anything of value to any employee of the Department authorized to perform any function under such regulations is a basis for the withdrawal of Federal meat grading service (7 CFR 53.13). The receiving by an employee of the Department of any gift from any person for whom grading, inspection, or other service work is performed is specifically prohibited by Departmental regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon the basis of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, it is the view of the Department that it is an unfair and deceptive practice in violation of section 202(a) of the Packers and Stockyards Act (7 U.S.C. 192(a)) for any person subject to the provisions of Title II of said Act to give or offer to give meat, money, or anything of value to any Government employee who performs inspection, grading, reporting, or regulatory duties directly relating to the purchase or sale of livestock or the preparation or distribution of meats, meat food products, livestock products in unmanufactured form, poultry or poultry products.
