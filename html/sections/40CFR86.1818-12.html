Each manufacturer's fleet of combined passenger automobiles and light trucks must comply with N2O and CH4 standards using either the provisions of paragraph (f)(1), (2), or (3) of this section. Except with prior EPA approval, a manufacturer may not use the provisions of both paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section in a model year. For example, a manufacturer may not use the provisions of paragraph (f)(1) of this section for their passenger automobile fleet and the provisions of paragraph (f)(2) for their light truck fleet in the same model year. The manufacturer may use the provisions of both paragraphs (f)(1) and (3) of this section in a model year. For example, a manufacturer may meet the N2O standard in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section and an alternative CH4 standard determined under paragraph (f)(3) of this section. Vehicles certified using the N2O data submittal waiver provisions of Sec. 86.1829(b)(1)(iii)(G) are not required to be tested for N2O under the in-use testing programs required by Sec. 86.1845 and Sec. 86.1846.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Standards applicable to each test group. (i) Exhaust emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) shall not exceed 0.010 grams per mile at full useful life, as measured according to the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) described in subpart B of this part.

Manufacturers may elect to not meet the emission standards in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Manufacturers making this election shall include N2O and CH4 emissions in the determination of their fleet average carbon-related exhaust emissions, as calculated in 40 CFR part 600, subpart F. Manufacturers using this option must include both N2O and CH4 full useful life values in the fleet average calculations for passenger automobiles and light trucks. Use of this option will account for N2O and CH4 emissions within the carbon-related exhaust emission value determined for each model type according to the provisions of 40 CFR part 600. This option requires the determination of full useful life emission values for both the Federal Test Procedure and the Highway Fuel Economy Test. Manufacturers selecting this option are not required to demonstrate compliance with the standards in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Optional use of alternative N2O and/or CH4 standards. Manufacturers may select an alternative standard applicable to a test group, for either N2O or CH4, or both. For example, a manufacturer may choose to meet the N2O standard in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section and an alternative CH4 standard in lieu of the standard in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section. The alternative standard for each pollutant must be greater than the applicable exhaust emission standard specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Alternative N2O and CH4 standards apply to emissions measured according to the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) described in

Subpart B of this part for the full useful life, and become the applicable certification and in-use emission standard(s) for the test group. Manufacturers using an alternative standard for N2O and/or CH4 must calculate emission debits according to the provisions of paragraph (f)(4) of this section for each test group/alternative standard combination. Debits must be included in the calculation of total credits or debits generated in a model year as required under Sec. 86.1865-12(k)(5). For flexible fuel vehicles (or other vehicles certified for multiple fuels) you must meet these alternative standards when tested on any applicable test fuel type.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> CO2- equivalent debits.

Manufacturers meeting the criteria in this paragraph (g) may request that the Administrator establish alternative fleet average CO2 standards that would apply instead of the standards in paragraph (c) of this section. The provisions of this paragraph (g) are applicable only to the 2017 and later model years. A manufacturer that has sought and received EPA approval for alternative standards for the 2017 model year may, at their option, choose to comply with those standards in the 2015 and 2016 model years in lieu of requesting a conditional exemption under Sec. 86.1801(k).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Eligibility for alternative standards. Eligibility as determined in this paragraph (g) shall be based on the total sales of combined passenger automobiles and light trucks. The terms ``sales'' and ``sold'' as used in this paragraph (g) shall mean vehicles produced for U.S. sale, where ``U.S.'' means the states and territories of the United States. For the purpose of determining eligibility the sales of related companies shall be aggregated according to the provisions of Sec. 86.1838-01(b)(3), or, if a manufacturer has been granted operational independence status under Sec. 86.1838(d), eligibility shall be based on vehicle production of that manufacturer. To be eligible for alternative standards established under this paragraph (g), the manufacturer's average sales for the three most recent consecutive model years must remain below 5,000. If a manufacturer's average sales for the three most recent consecutive model years exceeds 4999, the manufacturer will no longer be eligible for exemption and must meet applicable emission standards starting with the model year according to the provisions in this paragraph (g)(1).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a manufacturer's average sales for three consecutive model years exceeds 4999, and if the increase in sales is the result of corporate acquisitions, mergers, or purchase by another manufacturer, the manufacturer shall comply with the emission standards described in paragraph (c) of this section, as applicable, beginning with the first model year after the last year of the three consecutive model years.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a manufacturer's average sales for three consecutive model years exceeds 4999 and is less than 50,000, and if the increase in sales is solely the result of the manufacturer's expansion in vehicle production (not the result of corporate acquisitions, mergers, or purchase by another manufacturer), the manufacturer shall comply with the emission standards described in paragraph (c), of this section, as applicable, beginning with the second model year after the last year of the three consecutive model years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requirements for new entrants into the U.S. market. New entrants are those manufacturers without a prior record of automobile sales in the United States and without prior certification to (or exemption from, under Sec. 86.1801-12(k)) greenhouse gas emission standards in Sec. 86.1818-12. In addition to the eligibility requirements stated in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, new entrants must meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In addition to the information required under paragraph (g)(4) of this section, new entrants must provide documentation that shows a clear intent by the company to actually enter the U.S. market in the years for which alternative standards are requested. Demonstrating such intent could include providing documentation that shows the establishment of a U.S. dealer network, documentation of work underway to meet other U.S. requirements (e.g., safety standards), or other information that reasonably establishes intent to the satisfaction of the Administrator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sales of vehicles in the U.S. by new entrants must remain below 5,000 vehicles for the first three model years in the U.S. market, and in subsequent years the average sales for any three consecutive years must remain below 5,000 vehicles. Vehicles sold in violation of these limits within the first five model years will be considered not covered by the certificate of conformity and the manufacturer will be subject to penalties on an individual-vehicle basis for sale of vehicles not covered by a certificate. In addition, violation of these limits will result in loss of eligibility for alternative standards until such point as the manufacturer demonstrates two consecutive model years of sales below 5,000 automobiles. After the first five model years, the eligibility provisions in paragraph (g)(1) of this section apply, where violating the sales thresholds is no longer a violation of the condition on the certificate, but is instead grounds for losing eligibility for alternative standards.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A manufacturer with sales in the most recent model year of less than 5,000 automobiles, but where prior model year sales were not less than 5,000 automobiles, is eligible to request alternative standards under this paragraph (g). However, such a manufacturer will be considered a new entrant and subject to the provisions regarding new entrants in this paragraph (g), except that the requirement to demonstrate an intent to enter the U.S. market in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section shall not apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> How to request alternative fleet average standards. Eligible manufacturers may petition for alternative standards for up to five consecutive model years if sufficient information is available on which to base such standards.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To request alternative standards starting with the 2017 model year, eligible manufacturers must submit a completed application no later than July 30, 2013.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To request alternative standards starting with a model year after 2017, eligible manufacturers must submit a completed request no later than 36 months prior to the start of the first model year to which the alternative standards would apply.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The request must contain all the information required in paragraph (g)(4) of this section, and must be signed by a chief officer of the company.
