                            <p class="depth0">Supervisors may designate portions or all of a National Forest as free-use areas where such action is compatible with land management plans and shall give public notice of their action. Within such free-use areas, any dead timber or any green timber previously marked or designated by forest officers may be cut and removed for personal use for domestic purposes. Cutting and removal of timber in free-use areas shall be in accordance with such rules as may be prescribed by the district ranger to prevent fires, minimize damage to uncut trees and other resources, and to avoid confusion among users.
