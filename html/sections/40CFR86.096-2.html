The definitions of Sec. 86.094-2 continue to apply to 1996 and later model year vehicles.</p><p class="depth0">Certification Short Test means the test, for gasoline-fueled Otto-cycle light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, performed in accordance with the procedures contained in 40 CFR part 86 subpart O.</p><p class="depth0">Diurnal breathing losses means diurnal emissions.</p><p class="depth0">Diurnal emissions means evaporative emissions resulting from the daily cycling of ambient temperatures.</p><p class="depth0">Hot soak emissions means evaporative emissions after termination of engine operation.</p><p class="depth0">Hot-soak losses means hot soak emissions.</p><p class="depth0">Resting losses means evaporative emissions that may occur continuously, that are not diurnal emissions, hot soak emissions, running losses, or spitback emissions.</p><p class="depth0">Running losses means evaporative emissions that occur during vehicle operation.</p><p class="depth0">Spitback emissions means evaporative emissions resulting from the loss of liquid fuel that is emitted from a vehicle during a fueling operation.</p><p class="depth0">Useful life means:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> For light-duty vehicles, and for light light-duty trucks not subject to the Tier 0 standards of Sec. 86.094-9(a), intermediate useful life and/or full useful life. Intermediate useful life is a period of use of 5 years or 50,000 miles, whichever occurs first. Full useful life is a period of use of 10 years or 100,000 miles, whichever occurs first, except as otherwise noted in Sec. 86.094-9.

The useful life of evaporative emission control

systems on the portion of these vehicles subject to the evaporative emission test requirements of Sec. 86.130-96 is also defined as a period of 11 years or 120,000 miles, whichever occurs first.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> For an Otto-cycle heavy-duty engine family, a period of use of 8 years or 110,000 miles, whichever occurs first, except for the portion of evaporative emission control systems subject to the evaporative emission test requirements of Sec. 86.1230-96, for which the applicable period of use is 10 years or 110,000 miles, whichever occurs first.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> For a diesel heavy-duty engine family:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> For light heavy-duty diesel engines, period of use of 8 years or 110,000 miles, whichever occurs first.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> For medium heavy-duty diesel engines, a period of use of 8 years or 185,000 miles, whichever occurs first.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> For heavy heavy-duty diesel engines, a period of use of 8 years or 290,000 miles, whichever occurs first, except as provided in paragraph (4)(iv) of this definition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iv)</em> For heavy heavy-duty diesel engines used in urban buses, for the particulate standard, a period of use of 10 years or 290,000 miles, whichever occurs first.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(5)</em> As an option for both light-duty trucks under certain conditions and heavy-duty engine families, an alternative useful life period assigned by the Administrator under the provisions of Sec. 86.094-21(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(6)</em> The useful-life period for purposes of the emissions defect warranty and emissions performance warranty shall be a period of 5 years/50,000 miles, whichever occurs first, for light-duty trucks, Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines and light heavy-duty diesel engines. For all other heavy-duty diesel engines the aforementioned period is 5 years/100,000 miles, whichever occurs first. However, in no case may this period be less than the manufacturer's basic mechanical warranty period for the engine family.
