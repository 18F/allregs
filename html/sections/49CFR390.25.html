                            <p class="depth0">The FMCSA Field Administrator may extend the 30-day time period of the exemption contained in Sec. 390.23(a)(1), but not the 5-day time period contained in Sec. 390.23(a)(2) or the 24-hour period contained in Sec. 390.23(a)(3). Any motor carrier or driver seeking to extend the 30-day limit shall obtain approval from the FMCSA Field Administrator in the region in which the motor carrier's principal place of business is located before the expiration of the 30-day period. The motor carrier or driver shall give full details of the additional relief requested. The FMCSA Field Administrator shall determine if such relief is necessary taking into account both the severity of the ongoing emergency and the nature of the relief services to be provided by the carrier or driver. If the FMCSA Field Administrator approves an extension of the exemption, he or she shall establish a new time limit and place on the motor carrier or driver any other restrictions deemed necessary.
