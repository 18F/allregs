                                Sec. 1.121-5  Suspension of 5-year period for certain members of
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Under section 121(d)(9), a taxpayer who is serving  (or whose spouse is serving) on qualified official extended duty as a  member of the uniformed services or Foreign Service of the United States  may elect to suspend the running of the 5-year period of ownership and  use during such service but for not more than 10 years. The election  does not suspend the running of the 5-year period for any period during  which the running of the 5-year period with respect to any other  property of the taxpayer is suspended by an election under section  121(d)(9).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Manner of making election. The taxpayer makes the election under  section 121(d)(9) and this section by filing a return for the taxable  year of the sale or exchange of the taxpayer's principal residence that  does not include the gain in the taxpayer's gross income.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Application of election to closed years. A taxpayer who would  otherwise qualify under Sec. Sec. 1.121-1 through 1.121-4 to exclude  gain from a sale or exchange of a principal residence on or after May 7,  1997, may elect to apply section 121(d)(9) and this section for any  years for which a claim for refund is barred by operation of any law or  rule of law by filing an amended return before November 11, 2004.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Example. The provisions of this section are illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth2">Example. B purchases a house in Virginia in 2003 that he uses as his  principal residence for 3 years. For 8 years, from 2006 through 2014, B  serves on qualified official extended duty as a member of the Foreign  Service of the United States in Brazil. In 2015 B sells the house. B did  not use the house as his principal residence for 2 of the 5 years  preceding the sale. Under section 121(d)(9)and this section, however, B  may elect to suspend the running of the 5-year period of ownership and  use during his 8-year period of service with the Foreign Service in  Brazil. If   B makes the election, the 8-year period is not counted in determining  whether B used the house for 2 of the 5 years preceding the sale.  Therefore, B may exclude the gain from the sale of the house under  section 121.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effective date. This section is applicable for sales and  exchanges on or after May 7, 1997.  [T.D. 9152, 69 FR 50306, Aug. 16, 2004]</p>
