                            <p class="depth0">Voucher forms, appropriate to the circumstances, will be used in making payment of the settlement. Reference should be made on the voucher to the lease and supplemental agreement. The cost of restoration work performed directly by the Government, or by contract, or compensation in any settlement agreement in lieu of restoration, will be paid from funds available for the payment of rental. The limitations of section 322 of the Economy Act of 1932, as amended (40 U.S.C. 278a and b), on the expenditure of funds for the alteration, improvement, or repair of leased premises to 25 percent of rent for the first year, are not applicable to costs of performing restoration work pursuant to obligations of the lease nor for payments of settlements in lieu thereof (20 Comp. Gen. 105).</p>
