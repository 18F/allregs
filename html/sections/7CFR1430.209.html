                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A dairy operation entering into a MILC must, based on  instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator, provide adequate proof  of the dairy operation's eligible production during the months of each  fiscal year designated in the MILC. The dairy operation must also  provide proof that the eligible production was commercially marketed  during the months beginning October 1, 2007, and ending September 30,  2012. Evidence of milk production claimed for payment shall be provided  to CCC with supporting documentation under paragraph (b) of this  section. All information provided is subject to verification, spot check  and audit by FSA. Further verification information may be obtained from  the dairy operation's milk handler or marketing cooperative if deemed  necessary by CCC to verify provided information. Refusal to allow a  representative of CCC or any other agency of the Department of  Agriculture to verify any information provided will result in a  determination of ineligibility for benefits under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligible dairy operations marketing milk during the period  specified in the MILC shall provide any available supporting documents  from all producers in the dairy operation to assist CCC in verifying  that the dairy operation produced and marketed milk commercially from  the designated starting month and thereafter. Examples of supporting  documentation include, but are not limited to: milk marketing payment  stubs, tank records, milk handler records, daily milk marketings, copies  of any payments received as compensation from other sources, or any  other documents available to confirm the production and production  history of the dairy operation. Producers may also be required to allow  CCC to examine the herd of cattle as production evidence. If supporting  documentation requested is not presented to CCC or FSA, the request for  MILC benefits will be disapproved.
