                                Sec. 310.527  Drug products containing active ingredients offered loss prevention.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Amino acids, aminobenzoic acid, ascorbic acid, benzoic acid,  biotin and all other B-vitamins, dexpanthenol, estradiol and other  topical hormones, jojoba oil, lanolin, nucleic acids, polysorbate 20,  polysorbate 60, sulfanilamide, sulfur 1 percent on carbon in a fraction  of paraffinic hydrocarbons, tetracaine hydrochloride, urea, and wheat  germ oil have been marketed as ingredients in OTC drug products for   external use as hair growers or for hair loss prevention. There is a  lack of adequate data to establish general recognition of the safety and  effectiveness of these or any other ingredients intended for OTC  external use as a hair grower or for hair loss prevention. Based on  evidence currently available, all labeling claims for OTC hair grower  and hair loss prevention drug products for external use are either  false, misleading, or unsupported by scientific data. Therefore, any OTC  drug product for external use containing an ingredient offered for use  as a hair grower or for hair loss prevention cannot be considered  generally recognized as safe and effective for its intended use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any OTC drug product that is labeled, represented, or promoted  for external use as a hair grower or for hair loss prevention is  regarded as a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the  Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), for which an approved  new drug application under section 505 of the act and part 314 of this  chapter is required for marketing. In the absence of an approved new  drug application, such product is also misbranded under section 502 of  the act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Clinical investigations designed to obtain evidence that any  drug product labeled, represented, or promoted for OTC external use as a  hair grower or for hair loss prevention is safe and effective for the  purpose intended must comply with the requirements and procedures  governing the use of investigational new drugs set forth in part 312 of  this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> After January 8, 1990, any such OTC drug product initially  introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate  commerce that is not in compliance with this section is subject to  regulatory action.
