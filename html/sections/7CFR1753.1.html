                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The standard RUS Telecommunications Loan Documents contain provisions regarding procurement of materials and equipment and construction of telecommunications facilities by telecommunications borrowers. This part implements certain of the provisions by setting forth requirements and procedures. Borrowers shall follow these requirements and procedures whenever using loan funds to purchase materials and equipment or perform construction, unless they have received the Administrator's written approval to do otherwise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The typical procedure followed in constructing a project financed by an RUS loan begins with the prospective borrower obtaining the necessary preloan engineering and developing a complete loan application, including an LD (See 7 CFR part 1737). If a loan

is approved and all prerequisites to advance of funds are satisfied, the borrower may proceed with the purchase and installation of materials and equipment and the construction of telephone facilities pursuant to this part 1753. Subpart A describes</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> RUS's general requirements with respect to steps to be taken after the loan is approved and before construction begins (See Sec. 1753.3),</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> RUS requirements with respect to methods of construction (See Sec. Sec. 1753.5 and 1753.6),</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> RUS requirements regarding sealed competitive bidding and negotiated bidding of construction contracts (See Sec. Sec. 1753.6 and 1753.9),</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> RUS standards for materials, equipment, and construction financed with loan funds (See Sec. 1753.7), and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> RUS requirements for subcontracts and contract amendments covering construction financed with loan funds (See Sec. Sec. 1753.10 and 1753.12).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each borrower is responsible for the construction of its facilities and for the procurement of materials and equipment that are best suited to its needs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If contracts, P&S;, or other methods of procurement are subject to RUS approval pursuant to the provisions of the loan contract, as implemented by this part, RUS will review the documents or proposals submitted and notify the borrower in writing of approval or disapproval. RUS may withhold approval if, in RUS's judgment:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The P&S; or contract will not accomplish loan purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provisions of the P&S; or contract will add unnecessary expense to the project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The proposal, method of procurement, or P&S; do not conform to RUS engineering criteria or construction standards, or if they present unacceptable loan security risks to RUS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The P&S; or contract have been modified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The requirements and procedures covering procurement of architectural and engineering services are described in subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Single copies of RUS forms cited in this part are available from Administrative Services Division, Rural Utilities Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250-1500.
