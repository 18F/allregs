All parking fees shall be set at a rate which shall be  equivalent to one-half of the appropriate fair rental value (i.e.,  monthly, weekly, daily, hourly) for the use of equivalent commercial  space in the vicinity of the medical facility, subject to the terms and  conditions stated in paragraph (a) of this section. Fair rental value  shall include an allowance for the costs of management of the parking  facilities. The Secretary will determine the fair market rental value  through use of generally accepted appraisal techniques. If the appraisal  establishes that there is no comparable commercial rate because of the  absence of commercial parking facilities within a two-mile radius of the  medical facility, then the rate established shall be not less than the  lowest rate charged for parking at the VA medical facility with the  lowest established parking fees. Rates established shall be reviewed  biannually by the Secretary to reflect any increase or decrease in value  as determined by appraisal updating.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No parking fees shall be established or collected for parking  facilities used by or for vehicles of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Volunteer workers in connection with such workers performing  services for the benefit of veterans receiving care at the medical  facility;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A veteran or an eligible person in connection with such veteran  or eligible person receiving examination or treatment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An individual transporting a veteran or eligible person  seeking examination or treatment; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Federal Government employees using Government owned or leased  or private vehicles for official business.
