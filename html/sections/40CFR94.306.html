                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In the application for certification a manufacturer must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Declare its intent to include specific engine families in the averaging, banking, and/or trading programs. Separate declarations are required for each pollutant (THC+NOX and PM).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Declare FELs for each engine family participating in certification averaging, banking, and/or trading.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The FELs must be to the same number of significant digits as the emission standard.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In no case may the FEL exceed the upper limit prescribed in Sec. 94.304(m).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Conduct and submit detailed calculations of projected emission credits (positive or negative) based on quarterly production projections for each participating family and for each pollutant, using the applicable equation in Sec. 94.305 and the applicable values of the terms in the equation for the specific family.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the engine family is projected to have negative emission credits, state specifically the source (manufacturer/engine family) of the credits necessary to offset the credit deficit according to quarterly projected production.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the engine family is projected to generate credits, state specifically where the quarterly projected credits will be applied (manufacturer/engine family or reserved).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Submit a statement that the engines for which certification is requested will not, to the best of the manufacturer's belief, cause the manufacturer to have a negative credit balance when all credits are calculated for all the manufacturer's engine families participating in the averaging, banking, and trading program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Based on this information, each manufacturer's certification application must demonstrate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That at the end of model year production, each engine family has a net emissions credit balance equal to or greater than zero for any pollutant and program for which participation in certification under averaging, banking, and/or trading is being sought. The equation in section Sec. 94.305 shall be used in this calculation for each engine family.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That the manufacturer will obtain sufficient credits to be used to comply with the emission standard for any engine family with an FEL that exceeds the applicable emission standard, or where credits will be applied if the FEL is less than the emission standard. In cases where credits are being obtained, for each engine family involved the manufacturer must identify specifically the source of the credits being used (manufacturer/engine family). All such reports shall include all credits involved in certification averaging, banking, or trading.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That in cases where credits are being generated/supplied, the use of such credits is specifically designated (manufacturer/engine family or reserved). All such reports shall include all credits involved in certification averaging, banking, or trading.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Manufacturers must monitor projected versus actual production throughout the model year to ensure that compliance with emission standards is achieved at the end of the model year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> At the end of the model year, the manufacturer must provide the end-of-year reports required under Sec. 94.309.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Projected credits based on the information supplied in the certification application may be used to obtain a certificate of conformity. However, any such projected credits must be validated based on review of the end of model year reports and may be revoked at a later time based on follow-up audits or any other verification measure deemed appropriate by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Compliance for engine families using averaging, banking, or trading will be determined at the end of the model year. Manufacturers that have certified engine families with credit balances for THC+NOX and/or PM that do not equal or exceed zero shall be in violation of the conditions of the certificate of conformity for such engine families. The certificate of conformity may be voided ab initio for those engine families.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Other conditions of certification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All certificates issued are conditional upon compliance by the manufacturer with the provisions of this subpart both during and after the calendar year of production.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Failure to comply with all provisions of this subpart will be considered to be a failure to satisfy the conditions upon which the certificate was issued, and the certificate may be deemed void ab initio.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The manufacturer bears the burden of establishing to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the conditions upon which the certificate was issued were satisfied or waived.</p>
