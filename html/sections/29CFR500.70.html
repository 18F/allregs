                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The Act provides protections for migrant and seasonal  agricultural workers irrespective of whether   they are employed by a farm labor contractor, an agricultural employer  or an agricultural association, or, in the case where there is joint  responsibility, by more than one of these persons. The Act's provisions  include standards relating to vehicle safety, housing safety and health,  disclosure of wages, hours and other conditions of employment, and  recordkeeping. When any person not otherwise exempt from the Act  recruits, solicits, hires, employs, furnishes or transports workers,  that person is required to comply with the applicable protective  provisions of the Act. In addition, any person not specifically exempt  from coverage of the Act (irrespective of whether that person is an  agricultural employer, an agricultural association or farm labor  contractor) who owns or controls a facility or real property which is  used as housing for any migrant agricultural workers must ensure that  the facility or real property complies with all substantive Federal and  State safety and health standards made applicable to that type of  housing. (See Sec. 500.132)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Wage related protections. Joint employment under the Fair Labor  Standards Act, which establishes responsibility for the maintenance of  payroll records, payment of wages and posting of notices under that law,  is joint employment under MSPA for establishing responsibility for the  maintenance of records, payment of wages and the posting of required  posters under MSPA. In such joint employment situations the  responsibility for assuring these MSPA protections may be carried out by  one of the joint employers. While under a joint employment relationship  all joint employers are equally responsible for assuring that the  appropriate protections are provided, the creation of such a joint  employment relationship does not also require unnecessary duplication of  effort as, for example, in relation to the posting of posters (see  Sec. Sec. 500.75(e) and 500.76(e)) or the provision of an itemized  written statement of the worker's pay (see Sec. 500.80(d)). Failure to  provide protections coming within the joint employment relationship,  however, will result in all joint employers being responsible for that  failure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Transportation related protections. Responsibility for  compliance with the motor vehicle safety and insurance provisions of  section 401 of the Act and Sec. Sec. 500.100 through 500.128 of these  regulations is imposed upon the person or persons using or causing to be  used, any vehicle for transportation of migrant or seasonal agricultural  workers. As stated in these regulations, the transportation safety  provisions do not include certain car pooling arrangements.  Additionally, these regulations do not impose responsibility on an  agricultural employer or agricultural association for a farm labor  contractor's failure to adhere to the safety provisions provided in  these regulations when the farm labor contractor is providing the  vehicles and directing their use. However, when an agricultural employer  or agricultural association specifically directs or requests a farm  labor contractor to use the contractor's vehicle to carry out a task for  the agricultural employer or agricultural association, such direction  constitutes causing the vehicle to be used and the agricultural employer  or agricultural association is jointly responsible with the farm labor  contractor for assuring that the vehicle meets the insurance, and safety  and health provisions of these regulations. In all cases a person using  a farm labor contractor is required to take reasonable steps to  determine that the vehicle used by the farm labor contractor is  authorized to be used for transportation as prescribed in section 402 of  the Act and Sec. 500.71 of these regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Housing related protections. Responsibility for compliance with  the housing safety and health provisions of section 203 of the Act and  Sec. Sec. 500.130 through 500.135 of these regulations is imposed upon  the person (or persons) who owns or controls a facility or real property  used as housing for migrant agricultural workers. Any agricultural  employer or agricultural association which has a farm labor contractor  operate housing which it owns or controls is responsible, as well as the  farm labor contractor, for insuring compliance with the housing safety  and health provisions of these regulations. When the owner or operator  of the housing is not an agricultural employer, agricultural   association or farm labor contractor, the owner is responsible for that  housing meeting the safety and health provisions under the Act and these  regulations. This is subject to the exclusion stated in Sec. 500.131 of  these regulations which provides that the housing safety and health  requirements do not apply to any person who, in the ordinary course of  that person's business, regularly provides housing on a commercial basis  to the general public and who provides housing to any migrant  agricultural worker of the same character and on the same or comparable  terms and conditions as provided to the general public.</p>
