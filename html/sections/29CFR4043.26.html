                                Sec. 4043.26  Inability to pay benefits when due.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Reportable event. A reportable event occurs when a plan is currently unable or projected to be unable to pay benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Current inability. A plan is currently unable to pay benefits if it fails to provide any participant or beneficiary the full benefits to which the person is entitled under the terms of the plan, at the time the benefit is due and in the form in which it is due. A

plan shall not be treated as being currently unable to pay benefits if its failure to pay is caused solely by the need to verify the person's eligibility for benefits; the inability to locate the person; or any other administrative delay if the delay is for less than the shorter of two months or two full benefit payment periods.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Projected inability. A plan is projected to be unable to pay benefits when, as of the last day of any quarter of a plan year, the plan's ``liquid assets'' are less than two times the amount of the ``disbursements from the plan'' for such quarter. Liquid assets and disbursements from the plan have the same meaning as under section 302(e)(5)(E) of ERISA and section 412(m)(5)(E) of the Code.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Initial information required. In addition to the information in Sec. 4043.3(b), the notice shall include--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The date of any current inability and the amount of benefit payments not made;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The next date on which the plan is expected to be unable to pay benefits, the amount of the projected shortfall, and the number of plan participants and beneficiaries expected to be affected by the inability to pay benefits;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For a projected inability described in paragraph (a)(2), the amount of the plan's liquid assets at the end of the quarter, and the amount of its disbursements for the quarter; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The name, address, and phone number of the trustee of the plan (and of any custodian).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Waivers. Notice is waived unless the reportable event occurs during a plan year for which the plan is described in section 302(d)(6)(A) of ERISA or section 412(l)(6)(A) of the Code.</p>
