Color additive mixtures for fish  feed use made with phaffia yeast may contain only those diluents that  are suitable and are listed in this subpart as safe for use in color  additive mixtures for coloring foods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Specifications. Phaffia yeast shall conform to the following  specifications and shall be free from impurities other than those named  to the extent that such impurities may be avoided by good manufacturing  practice:  Physical state, solid. Lead, not more than 5 parts per million. Arsenic, not more than 2 parts per million. Mercury, not more than 1 part per million. Heavy metals (as Pb), not more than 10 parts per million. Astaxanthin, not less than 0.4 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Uses and restrictions.
