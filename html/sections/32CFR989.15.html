                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The FONSI (40 CFR 1508.13) briefly describes why an action would  not have a significant effect on the environment and thus will not be  the subject of an EIS. The FONSI must summarize the EA or, preferably,  have it attached and incorporated by reference, and must note any other  environmental documents related to the action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the EA is not incorporated by reference, the FONSI must  include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Name of the action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Brief description of the action (including alternatives  considered and the chosen alternative).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Brief discussion of anticipated environmental effects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Conclusions leading to the FONSI.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> All mitigation actions that will be adopted with implementation  of the proposal (see Sec. 989.22).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Keep FONSIs as brief as possible. Only rarely should FONSIs  exceed two typewritten pages. Stand-alone FONSIs without an attached EA  may be longer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For actions of regional or local interest, disseminate the FONSI  according to Sec. 989.24. The MAJCOM and NGB are responsible for release  of FONSIs to regional offices of Federal agencies, the state single  point of contact (SPOC), and state agencies concurrent with local  release by the installations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The EPF must make the EA and unsigned FONSI available to the  affected public and provide the EA and unsigned FONSI to organizations  and individuals requesting them and to whomever the proponent or the EPF  has reason to believe is interested in the action, unless disclosure is  precluded for security classification reasons. Draft EAs and unsigned  draft FONSIs will be clearly identified as drafts and distributed via  cover letter which will explain their purpose and need. The EPF provides  a copy of the documents without cost to organizations and individuals  requesting them. The FONSI transmittal date (date of letter of  transmittal) to the state SPOC or other equivalent agency is the  official notification date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Before the FONSI is signed and the action is implemented, the  EPF should allow sufficient time to receive comments from the public.  The time period will reflect the magnitude of the proposed action and  its potential for controversy. The greater the magnitude of the proposed  action or its potential for controversy, the longer the time that must  be allowed for public review. Mandatory review periods for certain  defined actions are contained in Sec. 989.15(e)(2). These are not all  inclusive but merely specific examples. In every case where an EA and  FONSI are prepared, the proponent and EPF must determine how much time  will be allowed for public review. In all cases, other than classified  actions, a public review period should be the norm unless clearly  unnecessary due to the lack of potential controversy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2))</em>:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When the proposed action is, or is closely similar to, one that  usually requires preparation of an EIS (see Sec. 989.16).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If it is an unusual case, a new kind of action, or a precedent- setting case in terms of its potential environmental impacts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the proposed action would be located in a floodplain or  wetland.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the action is mitigated to insignificance in the FONSI, in  lieu of an EIS (Sec. 989.22(c)).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If the proposed action is a change to airspace use or  designation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> If the proposed action would have a disproportionately high and  adverse environmental effect on minority populations and low-income  populations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> As a general rule, the same organizational level that prepares  the EA also reviews and recommends the FONSI for approval by the EPC.  MAJCOMs may decide the level of EA   approval and FONSI signature, except as provided in Sec. 989.14(g), (h),  (i), and (j).</p>
