Each method of ordering transportation and transportation services may require a different kind of prepayment audit.</p><p class="depth2">Your agency's prepayment audit program must consider all of the methods that you use to order and pay for transportation services. With each method of ordering transportation services, your agency should ensure that each TSP bill or employee travel voucher contains enough information for the prepayment audit to determine which contract or rate tender is used and that the type and quantity of any additional services are clearly delineated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For transportation payments made through cost reimbursable contracts, the agency must include a statement in the contract that the contractor shall submit to the address identified for prepayment audit, transportation documents which show that the United States will assume freight charges that were paid by the contractor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cost reimbursable contractors shall only submit for audit bills of lading with freight shipment charges exceeding $100.00. Bills under $100.00 shall be retained on-site by the contractor and made available for on-site audits.
