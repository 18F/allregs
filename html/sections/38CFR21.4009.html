The Committee on School Liability will consider all evidence and testimony presented at the hearing.

If an overpayment has been recovered from the educational institution and the veteran, reservist, or eligible person subsequently repays the amount in whole or in part, the amount repaid will be reimbursed to the educational institution.

The 60-day time limit may be extended to 90 days at the discretion of the chairperson of the Committee on School Liability. The appeal must be in writing setting forth fully the alleged errors of fact and law. If an appeal is not received within the 60-day time limit, the Committee decision is final.

An appeal will be forwarded to Central Office where it will be considered by the School Liability Appeals Board.

Review by the School Liability Appeals Board is limited to the issues raised by the educational institution and shall be on the record and not de novo in character.
