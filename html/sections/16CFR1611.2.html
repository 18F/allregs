The vinyl plastic film covered by Commercial Standard 192-53, as promulgated by the Secretary of Commerce was vinyl plastic film 10 mils and less in thickness (see Sec. 1.3 of the voluntary standard). After CS 191-53 and CS 192-53 were made mandatory by section 4 of the act, the Federal Trade Commission clarified the scope of the standards in rules and regulations now found at Sec. Sec. 1611.31(i) and 1611.33(b) (formerly 16 CFR 302.1(a)(9) and 302.3(b)).---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
