Such management includes efforts to preserve and  enhance the environmental amenities that are the source of the  recreational value associated with the project and to allow such other  new and innovative uses of the projects that are not detrimental  thereto.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Seaplane operations at water resource development projects  administered by the Chief of Engineers may involve hazards including,  but not limited to, conflicting recreational activities, floating  debris, and underwater hazards, which may be accentuated by the normal  fluctutations of water levels.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Seaplane operations may be prohibited or restricted at such  water resource development projects, or portions thereof, for a variety  of management reasons. Prohibiting or restricting seaplane operations in  certain portions within a project in no way implies that safety hazards  to seaplane operations or to other recreation users may not exist in  other portions of such project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The operation of a seaplane at Corps projects is at the risk of  the plane's owner, operator, and passenger(s). The responsibility to  ascertain whether seaplane operations are permitted, prohibited or  restricted at such projects, and portions thereof, is incumbent upon the  person(s) contemplating the use of, or using, such waters.</p>
