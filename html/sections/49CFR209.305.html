Nothing in this section precludes the Chief Counsel from presenting at a subsequent hearing under Sec. 209.321 any evidence of the charges set forth in the notice that the Chief Counsel acquires after service thereof on the respondent. The Chief Counsel, however, shall serve a copy of any such evidence on the respondent at or before the prehearing conference required under Sec. 209.319. Failure to furnish such evidence to respondent at or before the prehearing conference bars its introduction at the hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Chief Counsel shall provide a copy of the notice of proposed disqualification to the railroad that employs the respondent.</p>
