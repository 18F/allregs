                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. The rules of section 737 and Sec. Sec. 1.737-1,  1.737-2, and 1.737-3 must be applied in a manner consistent with the  purpose of section 737. Accordingly, if a principal purpose of a  transaction is to achieve a tax result that is inconsistent with the  purpose of section 737, the Commissioner can recast the transaction for  federal tax purposes as appropriate to achieve tax results that are  consistent with the purpose of section 737. Whether a tax result is  inconsistent with the purpose of section 737 must be determined based on  all the facts and circumstances. See Sec. 1.704-4(f) for an anti-abuse  rule and examples in the context of section 704(c)(1)(B). The anti-abuse  rule and examples under section 704(c)(1)(B) and Sec. 1.704-4(f) are  relevant to section 737 and Sec. Sec. 1.737-1, 1.737-2, and 1.737-3 to  the extent that the net precontribution gain for purposes of section 737  is determined by reference to section 704(c)(1)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this  section. The examples set forth below do not delineate the boundaries of  either permissible or impermissible types of transactions. Further, the  addition of any facts or circumstances that are not specifically set  forth in an example (or the deletion of any facts or circumstances) may  alter the outcome of the transaction described in the example. Unless  otherwise specified, partnership income equals partnership expenses  (other than depreciation deductions for contributed property) for each  year of the partnership, the fair market value of partnership property  does not change, all distributions by the partnership are subject to  section 737, and all partners are unrelated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  On January 1, 1995, A, B, and C form partnership ABC as equal partners.  A contributes Property A1, nondepreciable real property with a fair  market value of $10,000 and an adjusted tax basis of $1,000. B  contributes Property B, nondepreciable real property with a fair market  value of $10,000 and an adjusted tax basis of $10,000. C contributes  $10,000 cash.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On January 1, 1999, pursuant to a plan a principal purpose of  which is to avoid gain under section 737, A transfers to the partnership  Property A2, nondepreciable real property with a fair market value and  adjusted tax basis of $9,000. A treats the transfer as a contribution to  the partnership pursuant to section 721 and increases the adjusted tax  basis of A's partnership interest from $1,000 to $10,000. On January 1,  1999, the partnership agreement is amended and all other necessary steps  are taken so that substantially all of the economic risks and benefits  of Property A2 are retained by A. On February 1, 1999, Property B is  distributed to A in a current distribution. If the contribution of  Property A2 is treated as a contribution to the partnership for purposes  of section 737, there is no excess distribution because the fair market  value of distributed Property B ($10,000) does not exceed the adjusted  tax basis of A's interest in the partnership ($10,000), and therefore  section 737 does not apply. A's adjusted tax basis in distributed  Property B is $10,000 under section 732(a)(1) and the adjusted tax basis  of A's partnership interest is reduced to zero under section 733.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> On March 1, 2000, A receives Property A2 from the partnership  in complete liquidation of A's interest in the partnership. A recognizes  no gain on the distribution of Property A2 because the property was  previously contributed property. See Sec. 1.737-2(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Although A has treated the transfer of Property A2 as a  contribution to the partnership that increased the adjusted tax basis of  A's interest in the partnership, it would be inconsistent with the  purpose of section 737 to recognize the transfer as a contribution to  the partnership. Section 737 requires recognition of gain when the value  of distributed property exceeds the distributee partner's adjusted tax  basis in the partnership interest. Section 737 assumes that any  contribution or other transaction that affects a partner's adjusted tax  basis in the partnership interest is a contribution or transaction in  substance and is not engaged in with a principal purpose of avoiding  recognition of gain under section 737. Because the transfer of Property  A2 to the partnership was not a contribution in substance and was made  with a principal purpose of avoiding recognition   of gain under section 737, the Commissioner can disregard the  contribution of Property A2 for this purpose. As a result, A recognizes  gain of $9,000 under section 737 on the receipt of Property B, an amount  equal to the lesser of the excess distribution of $9,000 ($10,000 fair  market value of distributed Property B less the $1,000 adjusted tax  basis of A's partnership interest, determined without regard to the  transitory contribution of Property A2) or A's net precontribution gain  of $9,000 on Property A1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  On January 1, 1995, A and B form general partnership AB as equal  partners. A contributes Property A, nondepreciable real property with a  fair market value of $10,000 and an adjusted tax basis of $1,000. B  contributes Property B, nondepreciable real property with a fair market  value and adjusted tax basis of $10,000. The partnership also borrows  $10,000 on a recourse basis and purchases Property C. The $10,000  liability is allocated equally between A and B under section 752,  thereby increasing the adjusted tax basis in A's partnership interest to  $6,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On December 31, 1998, the partners agree that A is to receive  Property B in a current distribution. If A were to receive Property B at  that time, A would recognize $4,000 of gain under section 737, an amount  equal to the lesser of the excess distribution of $4,000 ($10,000 fair  market value of Property B less $6,000 adjusted tax basis in A's  partnership interest) or A's net precontribution gain of $9,000 ($10,000  fair market value of Property A less $1,000 adjusted tax basis of  Property A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> With a principal purpose of avoiding such gain, A and B agree  that A will be solely liable for the repayment of the $10,000  partnership liability and take the steps necessary so that the entire  amount of the liability is allocated to A under section 752. The  adjusted tax basis in A's partnership interest is thereby increased from  $6,000 to $11,000 to reflect A's share of the $5,000 of liability  previously allocated to B. As a result of this increase in A's adjusted  tax basis, there is no excess distribution because the fair market value  of distributed Property B ($10,000) is less than the adjusted tax basis  of A's partnership interest. Recognizing A's increased adjusted tax  basis as a result of the shift in liabilities is consistent with the  purpose of section 737 and this section. Section 737 requires  recognition of gain only when the value of the distributed property  exceeds the distributee partner's adjusted tax basis in the partnership  interest. The $10,000 recourse liability is a bona fide liability of the  partnership that was undertaken for a substantial business purpose and  A's and B's agreement that A will assume responsibility for repayment of  that debt has substance. Therefore, the increase in A's adjusted tax  basis in A's interest in the partnership due to the shift in partnership  liabilities under section 752 is respected, and A recognizes no gain  under section 737.
