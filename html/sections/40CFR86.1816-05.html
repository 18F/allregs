                                Sec. 86.1816-05  Emission standards for complete heavy-duty vehicles.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This section applies to 2005 and later model year complete heavy- duty vehicles (2003 model year for manufacturers choosing Otto-cycle HDE  option 1 in Sec. 86.005-1(c)(1), or 2004 model year for manufacturers  choosing Otto-cycle HDE option 2 in Sec. 86.005-1(c)(2)) fueled by  gasoline, methanol, natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas fuels except  as noted. This section does not apply to Medium-duty Passenger Vehicles,  which are covered under Sec. 86.1811. This section also applies to 2000  and later model year complete heavy duty vehicles participating in the  early banking provisions of the averaging, trading and banking program  as specified in Sec. 86.1817-05(n). Multi-fueled vehicles shall comply  with all requirements established for each consumed fuel. For methanol  fueled vehicles, references in this section to hydrocarbons or total  hydrocarbons shall mean total hydrocarbon equivalents and references to  non-methane hydrocarbons shall mean non-methane hydrocarbon equivalents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Exhaust emission standards. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Exhaust emissions from 2005 and  later model year complete heavy-duty vehicles at and above 8,500 pounds  Gross Vehicle Weight Rating but equal to or less than 10,000 Gross  Vehicle Weight Rating pounds shall not exceed the following standards at  full useful life:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Non-methane organic gas. 0.280 grams per mile; this requirement  may be satisfied by measurement of non-methane hydrocarbons or total  hydrocarbons, at the manufacturer's option.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Carbon monoxide. 7.3 grams per mile.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Oxides of nitrogen. 0.9 grams per mile.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exhaust emissions from 2005 and later model year complete heavy- duty vehicles above 10,000 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight Rating but less  than 14,000 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight Rating shall not exceed the  following standards at full useful life:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Non-methane organic gas. 0.330 grams per mile; this requirement  may be satisfied by measurement of non-methane hydrocarbons or total  hydrocarbons, at the manufacturer's option.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Carbon monoxide. 8.1 grams per mile.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Oxides of nitrogen. 1.0 grams per mile.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)-(c)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Evaporative emissions. Evaporative hydrocarbon emissions from  gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled, and  methanol-fueled complete heavy-duty vehicles shall not exceed the  following standards. The standards apply equally to certification and  in-use vehicles. The spitback standard also applies to newly assembled  vehicles.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Gasoline, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, and methanol  fuel. For the full three-diurnal test sequence, diurnal plus hot soak  measurements: 3.0 grams per test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Gasoline and methanol fuel only. For the supplemental two- diurnal test sequence, diurnal plus hot soak measurements: 3.5 grams per  test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Gasoline and methanol fuel only. Running loss test: 0.05 grams  per mile.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Gasoline and methanol fuel only. Fuel dispensing spitback test:  1.0 grams per test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Refueling emissions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Standards. Refueling emissions from  Otto-cycle complete heavy-duty vehicles equal to or less than 10,000  pounds Gross Vehicle Weight Rating shall be phased in, in accordance  with the schedule in Table S01-5 in Sec. 86.1810-01 not to exceed the  following emission standards:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled vehicles: 0.20 grams  hydrocarbon per gallon (0.053 gram per liter) of fuel dispensed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles: 0.15 grams  hydrocarbon per gallon (0.04 gram per liter) of fuel dispensed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Phase-in. Complete heavy-duty vehicles subject to refueling  standards must comply with the phase-in requirements found in Table S01- 5 in Sec. 86.1810-01, and must be grouped with HLDTs and MDPVs to  determine phase-in compliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Alternate timing. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For manufacturers choosing Otto-cycle HDE  option 3 under Sec. 86.005-1(c)(3), the refueling emissions standards  are optional for 2004 model year complete heavy-duty vehicles.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For manufacturers choosing Otto-cycle HDE option 3 under  Sec. 86.005-1(c)(3), the manufacturer may exempt 2005 model year HDE  test groups whose model year begins before July 31, 2004. Only 2005  model year HDE test groups whose model year begins on or after July 31,  2004 shall be considered (together with all 2005 model year HLDTs and  MDPVs) for purposes of calculating the sales percentage for phase-in as  outlined in Sec. 86.1810-01(k).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For complete heavy-duty vehicles which have total fuel tank  capacity of greater than 35 gallons, or which do not share a common fuel  system with a light-duty truck or medium-duty passenger vehicle  configuration, the refueling emissions standards are optional for the  2004 and 2005 model years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Exceptions. The provisions of this Sec. 86.1816-05(e) do not  apply to incomplete heavy-duty vehicles optionally certified to complete  heavy duty vehicle standards under the provisions of Sec. 86.1801- 01(c)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Idle exhaust emission standards, complete heavy-duty vehicles.  Exhaust emissions of carbon monoxide from 2005 and later model year  gasoline, methanol, natural gas-and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled  complete heavy-duty vehicles shall not exceed 0.50 percent of exhaust  gas flow at curb idle for a useful life of 11 years or 120,000 miles,  whichever occurs first. This does not apply for vehicles certified to  the requirements of Sec. 86.1806-05</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Alternate test groups. Manufacturers may request to group  complete heavy-duty vehicles into the same test group as vehicles  subject to more stringent standards, so long as those complete heavy- duty vehicles meet the most stringent standards applicable to any  vehicle within that test group, as provided at Sec. 86.1827-(a)(5) and  (d)(4).
