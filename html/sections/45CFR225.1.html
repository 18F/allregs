He is paid a regular wage or salary in relation to the value of services rendered and time spent on the job.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The term Volunteer describes a person who contributes his personal service to the community through the agency's human services program. He is not a replacement or substitute for paid staff but adds new dimensions to agency services, and symbolizes the community's concern for the agency's clientele.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Partially paid volunteers means volunteers who are compensated for expenses incurred in the giving of services. Such payment does not reflect the value of the services rendered, or the amount of time given to the agency.
