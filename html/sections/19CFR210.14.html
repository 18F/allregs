                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Postinstitution amendments generally. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After an investigation  has been instituted, the complaint or notice of investigation may be  amended only by leave of the Commission for good cause shown and upon  such conditions as are necessary to avoid prejudicing the public  interest and the rights of the parties to the investigation. A motion  for amendment must be made to the presiding administrative law judge. A  motion to amend the complaint and notice of investigation to name an  additional respondent after institution shall be served on the proposed  respondent. If the proposed amendment of the complaint would require  amending the notice of investigation, the presiding administrative law  judge may grant the motion only by filing with the Commission an initial  determination. All other dispositions of such motions shall be by order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If disposition of the issues in an investigation on the merits  will be facilitated, or for other good cause shown, the presiding  administrative law judge may allow appropriate amendments to pleadings  other than complaints upon such conditions as are necessary to avoid  prejudicing the public interest and the rights of the parties to the  investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Postinstitution amendments to conform to evidence. When issues  not raised by the pleadings or notice of investigation, but reasonably  within the scope of the pleadings and notice, are considered during the  taking of evidence by express or implied consent of the parties, they  shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the  pleadings and notice. Such amendments of the pleadings and notice as may  be necessary to make them conform to the evidence and to raise such  issues shall be allowed at any time, and shall be effective with respect  to all parties who have expressly or impliedly consented.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Supplemental submissions. The administrative law judge may, upon  reasonable notice and on such terms as are just, permit service of a  supplemental submission setting forth transactions, occurrences, or  events that have taken place since the date of the submission sought to  be supplemented and that are relevant to any of the issues involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Counterclaims. At any time after institution of the  investigation, but not later than ten business days before the  commencement of the evidentiary hearing, a respondent may file a  counterclaim at the Commission in accordance with section 337(c) of the  Tariff Act of 1930. Counterclaims shall be filed in a separate document.  A respondent who files such a counterclaim shall immediately file a  notice of removal with a United States district court in which venue for  any of the   counterclaims raised by the respondent would exist under 28 U.S.C. 1391.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Respondent submissions on the public interest. When the  Commission has ordered the administrative law judge to take evidence  with respect to the public interest under Sec. 210.50(b)(1),  respondents must submit a statement concerning the public interest,  including any response to the issues raised by the complainant pursuant  to Sec. 210.8(b) and (c)(2), at the same time that their response to  the complaint is due. This submission must be no longer than five pages,  inclusive of attachments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Consolidation of investigations. The Commission may consolidate  two or more investigations. If the investigations are currently before  the same presiding administrative law judge, he or she may consolidate  the investigations. The investigation number in the caption of the  consolidated investigation will include the investigation numbers of the  investigations being consolidated. The investigation number in which the  matter will be proceeding (the lead investigation) will be the first  investigation number named in the consolidated caption.
