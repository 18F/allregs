In forming a negotiated rulemaking  committee, HUD shall appoint as committee members representatives of the  Federal Government and representatives of diverse tribes and program  recipients.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Initiation of rulemaking. HUD shall initiate a negotiated  rulemaking not later than 90 days after the enactment of any act to  reauthorize or significantly amend NAHASDA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Work groups. Negotiated rulemaking committees may form  workgroups made up of committee members and other interested parties to  meet during committee sessions and between sessions to develop specific  rulemaking proposals for committee consideration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Further review. Negotiated rulemaking committees shall provide  recommended rules to HUD. Once rules are proposed by HUD, they shall be  published for comment in the Federal Register. Any comments will be  further reviewed by the committee and HUD before HUD determines if the  rule or rules will be adopted.  [77 FR 71521, Dec. 3, 2012]</p>
