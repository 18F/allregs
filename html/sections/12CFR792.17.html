                            <p class="depth0">If NCUA does not comply with the time limits under Sec. 792.15, or as extended under Sec. 792.16, you do not have to pay search fees; requesters qualifying for free search fees will not have to pay duplication fees. You also can file suit against NCUA because you will be deemed to have exhausted your administrative remedies if NCUA fails to comply with the time limit provisions of this subpart. If NCUA can show that exceptional circumstances exist and that it is exercising due diligence in responding to your request, the court may retain jurisdiction and allow NCUA to complete its review of the records. In determining whether exceptional circumstances exist, the court may consider your refusal to modify the scope of your request or arrange an alternative time frame for processing after being given the opportunity to do so by NCUA, when it notifies you of the existence of unusual circumstances as set forth in Sec. 792.16.
