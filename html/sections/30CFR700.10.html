                            <p class="depth0">The collection of information, and recordkeeping requirements,  contained in 30 CFR 700.11(d), 700.12(b) and 700.13 has approved by the  Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and  assigned clearance number 1029-0094. The information collected in Sec.  700.11(d) is used by OSMRE and States to establish standards for  determining when a mine site is no longer a surface coal mining and  reclamation operation and thereby when regulatory jurisdiction may end.  The information collection under Sec. 700.12(b) is used by OSMRE to  consider need, costs, and benefits of a proposed regulatory change in  order to grant or deny a petition that has been submitted. Information  collected in Sec. 700.13 identifies the person and nature of a  citizen's suit, so that OSMRE or a state can respond appropriately.  [53 FR 44363, Nov. 2, 1988]</p>
