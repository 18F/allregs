                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You may ask us to apply the provisions of this section for  CO2 emission reductions resulting from powertrain  technologies that were not in common use with heavy-duty vehicles before  model year 2010 that are not reflected in the specified test procedure.  We will apply these provisions only for technologies that will result in  a measurable, demonstrable, and verifiable real-world CO2  reduction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The provisions of this section may be applied as either an  improvement factor (used to adjust emission results) or as a separate  credit, consistent with good engineering judgment. We recommend that you  base your credit/adjustment on A to B testing of pairs of engines/ vehicles differing only with respect to the technology in question.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Calculate improvement factors as the ratio of in-use emissions  with the technology divided by the in-use emissions without the  technology. Adjust the emission results by multiplying by the  improvement factor. Use the improvement-factor approach where good  engineering judgment indicates that the actual benefit will be  proportional to emissions measured over the test procedures specified in  this part. For example, the benefits from technologies that reduce  engine operation would generally be proportional to the engine's  emission rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Calculate separate credits based on the difference between the  in-use emission rate (g/ton-mile) with the technology and the in-use  emission rate without the technology. Multiply this difference by the  number of engines, standard payload, and useful life. We may also allow  you to calculate the credits based on g/hp-hr emission rates. Use the  separate-credit approach where good engineering judgment indicates that  the actual benefit will not be proportional to emissions measured over  the test procedures specified in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> We may require you to discount or otherwise adjust your  improvement factor or credit to account for uncertainty or other  relevant factors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Send your request to the Designated Compliance Officer. Include  a detailed description of the technology and a recommended test plan.  Also state whether you recommend applying these provisions using the  improvement-factor method or the separate-credit method. We recommend  that you do not begin collecting test data (for submission to EPA)  before contacting us. For technologies for which the vehicle  manufacturer could also claim credits (such as transmissions in certain  circumstances), we may require you to include a letter from the vehicle  manufacturer stating that it will not seek credits for the same  technology.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(3)</em>. However, we will generally not  seek public comment on credits/adjustments based on A to B engine  dynamometer testing, chassis testing, or in-use testing.</p>
