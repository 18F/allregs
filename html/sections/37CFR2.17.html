                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority to practice in trademark cases. Only an individual qualified to practice under Sec.  11.14 of this chapter may represent an applicant, registrant, or party to a proceeding before the Office in a trademark case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> Recognition of practitioner as representative. To be recognized as a representative in a trademark case, a practitioner qualified under Sec.  11.14 of this chapter may:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Recognition of practitioner as representative. To be recognized as a representative in a trademark case, a practitioner qualified under Sec.  11.14 of this chapter may:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> File a power of attorney that meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sign a document on behalf of an applicant, registrant, or party to a proceeding who is not already represented by a practitioner qualified under Sec.  11.14 of this chapter from a different firm; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Appear in person on behalf of an applicant, registrant, or party to a proceeding who is not already represented by a practitioner qualified under Sec.  11.14 of this chapter from a different firm.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Signature as certificate of authorization to represent. When a practitioner qualified under Sec.  11.14 of this chapter appears in person or signs a document pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, his or her personal appearance or signature shall constitute a representation to the Office that he or she is authorized to represent the person or entity on whose behalf he or she acts. The Office may require further proof of authority to act in a representative capacity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requirements for power of attorney. A power of attorney must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Designate by name at least one practitioner meeting the requirements of Sec.  11.14 of this chapter; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be signed by the individual applicant, registrant, or party to a proceeding pending before the Office, or by someone with legal authority to bind the applicant, registrant, or party (e.g., a corporate officer or general partner of a partnership). In the case of joint applicants or joint registrants, all must sign. Once the applicant, registrant, or party has designated a practitioner(s) qualified to practice under Sec.  11.14 of this chapter, that practitioner may sign an associate power of attorney appointing another qualified practitioner(s) as an additional person(s) authorized to represent the applicant, registrant, or party. If the applicant, registrant, or party revokes the original power of attorney (Sec.  2.19(a)), the revocation discharges any associate power signed by the practitioner whose power has been revoked. If the practitioner who signed an associate power withdraws (Sec.  2.19(b)), the withdrawal discharges any associate power signed by the withdrawing practitioner upon acceptance of the request for withdrawal by the Office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Power of attorney relating to multiple applications or registrations. (1) The owner of an application or registration may appoint a practitioner(s) qualified to practice under Sec.  11.14 of this chapter to represent the owner for all existing applications or registrations that have the identical owner name and attorney through TEAS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The owner of an application or registration may appoint a practitioner(s) qualified to practice under Sec.  11.14 of this chapter to represent the owner for all existing applications or registrations that have the identical owner name and attorney through TEAS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner of an application or registration may file a power of attorney that relates to more than one trademark application or registration, or to all existing and future applications and registrations of that owner, on paper. A person relying on such a power of attorney must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Include a copy of the previously filed power of attorney; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Refer to the power of attorney, specifying the filing date of the previously filed power of attorney; the application serial number (if known), registration number, or inter partes proceeding number for which the original power of attorney was filed; and the name of the person who signed the power of attorney; or, if the application serial number is not known, submit a copy of the application or a copy of the mark, and specify the filing date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Canadian attorneys and agents. (1) A Canadian patent agent who is registered and in good standing as a patent agent under Sec.  11.6(c) may represent parties located in Canada before the Office in trademark matters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A Canadian patent agent who is registered and in good standing as a patent agent under Sec.  11.6(c) may represent parties located in Canada before the Office in trademark matters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A Canadian attorney or agent who is registered or in good standing with the Canadian Intellectual Property Office, but not registered as a patent agent under Sec.  11.6(c), may represent parties located in Canada if he or she

has been authorized to do so by the Director of the Office of Enrollment and Discipline, pursuant to Sec.  11.14(f) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Non-lawyers. A non-lawyer may not act as a representative except in the limited circumstances set forth in Sec.  11.14(b) of this chapter. Before any non-lawyer who meets the requirements of Sec.  11.14(b) of this chapter may take action of any kind with respect to an application, registration or proceeding, a written authorization must be filed, signed by the applicant, registrant, or party to the proceeding, or by someone with legal authority to bind the applicant, registrant, or party (e.g., a corporate officer or general partner of a partnership).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Duration of power of attorney. (1) For purposes of recognition as a representative, the Office considers a power of attorney filed while an application is pending to end when the mark registers, when ownership changes, or when the application is abandoned.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of recognition as a representative, the Office considers a power of attorney filed while an application is pending to end when the mark registers, when ownership changes, or when the application is abandoned.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Office considers a power of attorney filed after registration to end when the mark is cancelled or expired, or when ownership changes. If the power was filed in connection with an affidavit under section 8, 12(c), 15 or 71 of the Trademark Act, renewal application under section 9 of the Act, or request for amendment or correction under section 7 of the Act, the power is deemed to end upon acceptance or final rejection of the filing.
