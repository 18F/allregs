                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> (A) and (B) make it unlawful for any  person to ``offer for sale'' any pesticide if it is unregistered, or if  claims made for it as part of its distribution or sale differ  substantially from any claim made for it as part of the statement  required in connection with its registration under FIFRA section 3. EPA  interprets these provisions as extending to advertisements in any  advertising medium to which pesticide users or the general public have  access.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> EPA regards it as unlawful for any person who distributes,  sells, offers for sale, holds for sale, ships, delivers for shipment, or  receives and (having so received) delivers or offers to deliver any  pesticide, to place or sponsor advertisements which recommend or suggest  the purchase or use of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any pesticide for a use authorized under a FIFRA section 5  experimental use permit (EUP).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any pesticide for a use authorized under a FIFRA section 18  emergency exemption, except for advertisements that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Are placed in media which address primarily persons in the  geographical area to which the exemption applies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> State the name and address of one or more retail dealers who  stock the pesticide.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Contain a prominent notice of the limitations on use under the  section 18 emergency exemption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any pesticide for any use authorized only by a FIFRA section  24(c) special local need registration, unless the advertisement contains  a prominent notice of the limitations on use under the section 24(c)  registrations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any unregistered pesticide for any use unless the advertisement  is one permitted by paragraph (b) (2) or (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A registered pesticide product for an unregistered use, unless  the advertisement is one permitted by paragraph (b) (2) or (3) of this  section. However, as a matter of policy, the Agency will not regard as  unlawful the advertisement of uses permitted by FIFRA section 2(ee)  provided the product is not an antimicrobial pesticide targeted against  human pathogens (see 51 FR 19174; May 28, 1986).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, a ``prominent  notice of the limitations on use'' is one which sets forth the  limitations on use in a manner reasonably likely to be understood by  persons to whom the advertisement is addressed. For printed advertising,  this criterion will be met by a legend in 6-point or larger type.  Subpart C [Reserved]</p>
