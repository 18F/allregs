                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Coverage. The requirements of this subpart apply to private  education loans as defined in Sec. 226.46(b)(5). A creditor may, at its  option, comply with the requirements of this subpart for an extension of  credit subject to Secs. 226.17 and 226.18 that is extended to a consumer  for expenses incurred after graduation from a law, medical, dental,  veterinary, or other graduate school and related to relocation, study  for a bar or other examination, participation in an internship or  residency program, or similar purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Relation to other subparts in this part. Except as otherwise  specifically provided, the requirements and limitations of this subpart  are in addition to and not in lieu of those contained in other subparts  of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this subpart, the following  definitions apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Covered educational institution means:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An educational institution that meets the definition of an  institution of higher education, as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this  section, without regard to the institution's accreditation status; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Includes an agent, officer, or employee of the institution of  higher education. An agent means an institution-affiliated organization  as defined by section 151 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C.  1019) or an officer or employee of an institution-affiliated  organization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Institution of higher education has the same meaning as in  sections 101 and 102 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C.  1001-1002) and the implementing regulations published by the U.S.  Department of Education.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Postsecondary educational expenses means any of the expenses  that are listed as part of the cost of attendance, as defined under  section 472 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087ll), of a  student at a covered educational institution. These expenses include  tuition and fees, books, supplies, miscellaneous personal expenses, room  and board, and an allowance for any loan fee, origination fee, or  insurance premium charged to a student or parent for a loan incurred to  cover the cost of the student's attendance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Preferred lender arrangement has the same meaning as in section  151 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1019).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Private education loan means an extension of credit that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is not made, insured, or guaranteed under title IV of the Higher  Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is extended to a consumer expressly, in whole or in part, for  postsecondary educational expenses, regardless of whether the loan is  provided by the educational institution that the student attends;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Does not include open-end credit any loan that is secured by  real property or a dwelling; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Does not include an extension of credit in which the covered  educational institution is the creditor if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The term of the extension of credit is 90 days or less; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> an interest rate will not be applied to the credit balance and  the term of the extension of credit is one year or less, even if the  credit is payable in more than four installments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Form of disclosures--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Clear and conspicuous. The disclosures  required by this subpart shall be made clearly and conspicuously.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transaction disclosures. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The disclosures required under  Secs. 226.47(b) and (c) shall be made in writing, in a form that the  consumer may keep. The disclosures shall be grouped together, shall be  segregated from everything else, and shall not contain any information  not directly related to the disclosures required under Secs. 226.47(b)  and (c), which include the disclosures required under Sec. 226.18.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The disclosures may include an acknowledgement of receipt, the  date of the transaction, and the consumer's name, address, and account  number. The following disclosures may be made together with or  separately from other required disclosures: the creditor's identity  under Sec. 226.18(a), insurance or debt cancellation under  Sec. 226.18(n), and certain security interest charges under  Sec. 226.18(o).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The term ``finance charge'' and corresponding amount, when  required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.18(d), and the interest rate  required to be disclosed under Secs. 226.47(b)(1)(i) and (c)(1), shall  be more conspicuous than any other disclosure, except the creditor's  identity under Sec. 228.18(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Electronic disclosures. The disclosures required under  Secs. 226.47(b) and (c) may be provided to the consumer in electronic  form, subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other  applicable provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and  National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq.). The  disclosures required by Sec. 226.47(a) may be provided to the consumer  in electronic form on or with an application or solicitation that is  accessed by the consumer in electronic form without regard to the  consumer consent or other provisions of the E-Sign Act. The form  required to be received under Sec. 226.48(e) may be accepted   by the creditor in electronic form as provided for in that section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Timing of disclosures--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Application or solicitation  disclosures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The disclosures required by Sec. 226.47(a) shall be provided on  or with any application or solicitation. For purposes of this subpart,  the term solicitation means an offer of credit that does not require the  consumer to complete an application. A ``firm offer of credit'' as  defined in section 603(l) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C.  1681a(l)) is a solicitation for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The creditor may, at its option, disclose orally the  information in Sec. 226.47(a) in a telephone application or  solicitation. Alternatively, if the creditor does not disclose orally  the information in Sec. 226.47(a), the creditor must provide the  disclosures or place them in the mail no later than three business days  after the consumer has applied for the credit, except that, if the  creditor either denies the consumer's application or provides or places  in the mail the disclosures in Sec. 226.47(b) no later than three  business days after the consumer requests the credit, the creditor need  not also provide the Sec. 226.47(a) disclosures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1)(i), for a loan that the  consumer may use for multiple purposes including, but not limited to,  postsecondary educational expenses, the creditor need not provide the  disclosures required by Sec. 226.47(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Approval disclosures. The creditor shall provide the disclosures  required by Sec. 226.47(b) before consummation on or with any notice of  approval provided to the consumer. If the creditor mails notice of  approval, the disclosures must be mailed with the notice. If the  creditor communicates notice of approval by telephone, the creditor must  mail the disclosures within three business days of providing the notice  of approval. If the creditor communicates notice of approval  electronically, the creditor may provide the disclosures in electronic  form in accordance with Sec. 226.46(d)(3); otherwise the creditor must  mail the disclosures within three business days of communicating the  notice of approval. If the creditor communicates approval in person, the  creditor must provide the disclosures to the consumer at that time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Final disclosures. The disclosures required by Sec. 226.47(c)  shall be provided after the consumer accepts the loan in accordance with  Sec. 226.48(c)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Receipt of mailed disclosures. If the disclosures under  paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2) or (d)(3), are mailed to the consumer, the  consumer is considered to have received them three business days after  they are mailed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Basis of disclosures and use of estimates--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Legal obligation.  Disclosures shall reflect the terms of the legal obligation between the  parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Estimates. If any information necessary for an accurate  disclosure is unknown to the creditor, the creditor shall make the  disclosure based on the best information reasonably available at the  time the disclosure is provided, and shall state clearly that the  disclosure is an estimate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Multiple creditors; multiple consumers. If a transaction  involves more than one creditor, only one set of disclosures shall be  given and the creditors shall agree among themselves which creditor will  comply with the requirements that this part imposes on any or all of  them. If there is more than one consumer, the disclosures may be made to  any consumer who is primarily liable on the obligation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Effect of subsequent events--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Approval disclosures. If a  disclosure under Sec. 226.47(b) becomes inaccurate because of an event  that occurs after the creditor delivers the required disclosures, the  inaccuracy is not a violation of Regulation Z (12 CFR part 226),  although new disclosures may be required under Sec. 226.48(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Final disclosures. If a disclosure under Sec. 226.47(c) becomes  inaccurate because of an event that occurs after the creditor delivers  the required disclosures, the inaccuracy is not a violation of  Regulation Z (12 CFR part 226).</p>
