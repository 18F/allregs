                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope of reporting requirements. (1) A United States person who receives a request to take any action which has the effect of furthering or supporting a restrictive trade practice or boycott fostered or imposed by a foreign country against a country friendly to the United States or against any United States person must report such request to the Department of Commerce in accordance with the requirements of this section. Such a request may be either written or oral and may include a request to furnish information or enter into or implement an agreement. It may also include a solicitation, directive, legend or instruction that asks for information or that asks that a United States person take or refrain from taking a particular action. Such a request shall be reported regardless of whether the action requested is prohibited or permissible under this part, except as otherwise provided by this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A United States person who receives a request to take any action which has the effect of furthering or supporting a restrictive trade practice or boycott fostered or imposed by a foreign country against a country friendly to the United States or against any United States person must report such request to the Department of Commerce in accordance with the requirements of this section. Such a request may be either written or oral and may include a request to furnish information or enter into or implement an agreement. It may also include a solicitation, directive, legend or instruction that asks for information or that asks that a United States person take or refrain from taking a particular action. Such a request shall be reported regardless of whether the action requested is prohibited or permissible under this part, except as otherwise provided by this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of this section, a request received by a United States person is reportable if he knows or has reason to know that the purpose of the request is to enforce, implement, or otherwise further, support, or secure compliance with an unsanctioned foreign boycott or restrictive trade practice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A request received by a United States person located in the United States is reportable if it is received in connection with a transaction or activity in the interstate or foreign commerce of the United States, as determined under Sec. 760.1(d)(1) through (5) and (18) of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A request received by a United States person located outside the United States (that is, a foreign subsidiary, partnership, affiliate, branch, office, or other permanent foreign establishment which is controlled in fact by any domestic concern, as determined under Sec. 760.1(c) of this part) is reportable if it is received in connection with a transaction or activity in the interstate or foreign commerce of the United States, as determined under Sec. 760.1(d)(6) through (17) and (19) of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A request such as a boycott questionnaire, unrelated to a particular transaction or activity, received by any United States person is reportable when such person has or anticipates a business relationship with or in a boycotting country involving the sale, purchase or transfer of goods or services (including information) in the interstate or foreign commerce of the United States, as determined under Sec. 760.1(d) of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> These reporting requirements apply to all United States persons. They apply whether the United States person receiving the request is an exporter, bank or other financial institution, insurer, freight forwarder, manufacturer, or any other United States person subject to this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The acquisition of information about a boycotting country's boycott requirements through the receipt or review of books, pamphlets, legal texts, exporters' guidebooks and other similar publications does not constitute receipt of a reportable request for purposes of this section. In addition, a United States person who receives an unsolicited invitation to bid, or similar proposal, containing a boycott request has not received a reportable request for purposes of this section where he does not respond to the invitation to bid or other proposal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Because of the use of certain terms for boycott and non-boycott purposes; because of Congressional mandates to provide clear and precise guidelines in areas of inherent uncertainty; and because of the Department's commitment to minimize paperwork and reduce the cost of reporting where it will not impair the Department's ability to continue to monitor foreign boycotts, the following specific requests are not reportable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A request to refrain from shipping goods on a carrier which flies the flag of a particular country or which is owned, chartered, leased or operated by a particular country or by nationals or residents of a particular country, or a request to certify to that effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A request to ship goods via a prescribed route, or a request to refrain from shipping goods via a proscribed route, or a request to certify to either effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A request to supply an affirmative statement or certification regarding the country of origin of goods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A request to supply an affirmative statement or certification regarding the name of the supplier or manufacturer of the goods shipped or the name of the provider of services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A request to comply with the laws of another country except where the request expressly requires compliance with that country's boycott laws.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> A request to an individual to supply information about himself or a member of his family for immigration, passport, visa, or employment purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> A request to supply an affirmative statement or certification indicating the destination of exports or confirming or otherwise indicating that such cargo will be unloaded or discharged at a particular destination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> A request to supply a certificate by the owner, master, charterer, or any employee thereof, that a vessel, aircraft, truck or any other mode of transportation is eligible, otherwise eligible, permitted, or allowed to enter, or not restricted from entering, a particular port, country, or group of countries pursuant to the laws, rules, or regulations of that port, country, or group of countries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> A request to supply a certificate from an insurance company stating that the insurance company has a duly authorized agent or representative within a boycotting country and/or the name and address of such agent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> A request to comply with a term or condition of a transaction that provides that the vendor bear the risk of loss and indemnify the purchaser if the vendor's goods are denied entry into a country for any reason (``risk of loss clause'') if such clause was in use by the purchaser prior to January 18, 1978.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> No United States person may engage in any transaction or take any other action, either independently or through any other person, with intent to evade the provisions of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> From time to time the Department will survey domestic concerns for purposes of determining the worldwide scope of boycott requests received by their controlled foreign subsidiaries and affiliates with respect to their activities outside United States commerce. This pertains to requests which would be reportable under this section but for the fact that the activities to which the requests relate are outside United States commerce. The information requested will include the number and nature of non-reportable boycott requests received, the action(s) requested, the actions(s) taken in response and the countries in which the requests originate. The results of such surveys, including the names of those surveyed, will be made public.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Manner of reporting. (1) Each reportable request must be reported. However, if more than one document (such as an invitation to bid, purchase order, or letter of credit) containing the same boycott request is received as part of the same transaction, only the first such request need be reported. Individual shipments against the same purchase order or letter of credit are to be treated as part of the same transaction. Each different boycott request associated with a given transaction must be reported, regardless of how or when the request is received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each reportable request must be reported. However, if more than one document (such as an invitation to bid, purchase order, or letter of credit) containing the same boycott request is received as part of the same transaction, only the first such request need be reported. Individual shipments against the same purchase order or letter of credit are to be treated as part of the same transaction. Each different boycott request associated with a given transaction must be reported, regardless of how or when the request is received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each United States person actually receiving a reportable request must report that request. However, such person may designate someone

else to report on his behalf. For example, a United States company, if authorized, may report on behalf of its controlled foreign subsidiary or affiliates; a freight forwarder, if authorized, may report on behalf of the exporter; and a bank, if authorized, may report on behalf of the beneficiary of a letter of credit. If a person designated to report a request received by another receives an identical request directed to him in connection with the same transaction, he may file one report on behalf of himself and the other person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Where a person is designated to report on behalf of another, the person receiving the request remains liable for any failure to report or for any representations made on his behalf. Further, anyone reporting on behalf of another is not relieved of his own responsibility for reporting any boycott request which he receives, even if it is an identical request in connection with the same transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Reports must be submitted in duplicate to: Report Processing Staff, Office of Antiboycott Compliance, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 6098, Washington, D.C. 20230. Each submission must be made in accordance with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Where the person receiving the request is a United States person located in the United States, each report of requests must be postmarked by the last day of the month following the calendar quarter in which the request was received (e.g., April 30 for the quarter consisting of January, February, and March).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Where the person receiving the request is a United States person located outside the United States, each report of requests must be postmarked by the last day of the second month following the calendar quarter in which the request was received (e.g., May 31 for the quarter consisting of January, February, and March).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> At the reporting person's option, reports may be submitted on either a single transaction form (Form BIS-621P, Report of Restrictive Trade Practice or Boycott Request Single Transaction (revised 10-89)) or on a multiple transaction form (Form BIS-6051P, Report of Request for Restrictive Trade Practice or Boycott Multiple Transactions (revised 10-89)). Use of the multiple transaction form permits the reporting person to provide on one form all required information relating to as many as 75 reportable requests received within any single reporting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Reports, whether submitted on the single transaction form or on the multiple transaction form, must contain entries for every applicable item on the form, including whether the reporting person intends to take or has taken the action requested. If the reporting person has not decided what action he will take by the time the report is required to be filed, he must later report the action he decides to take within 10 business days after deciding. In addition, anyone filing a report on behalf of another must so indicate and identify that other person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Each report of a boycott request must be accompanied by two copies of the relevant page(s) of any document(s) in which the request appears. Reports may also be accompanied by any additional information relating to the request as the reporting person desires to provide concerning his response to the request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Records containing information relating to a reportable boycott request, including a copy of any document(s) in which the request appears, must be maintained by the recipient for a five-year period after receipt of the request. The Department may require that these materials be submitted to it or that it have access to them at any time within that period. (See part 762 of the EAR for additional recordkeeping requirements.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Disclosure of information. (1) Reports of requests received on or after October 7, 1976, as well as any accompanying documents filed with the reports, have been and will continue to be made available for public inspection and copying, except for certain proprietary information. With respect to reports of requests received on or after August 1, 1978, if the person making the report certifies that a United States person to whom the report relates would be placed at a competitive disadvantage because of the disclosure of information regarding the quantity, description, or value of any articles,

materials, and supplies, including related technical data and other information, whether contained in a report or in any accompanying document(s), such information will not be publicly disclosed except upon failure by the reporting entity to edit the public inspection copy of the accompanying document(s) as provided by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, unless the Secretary of Commerce determines that the disclosure would not place the United States person involved at a competitive disadvantage or that it would be contrary to the national interest to withhold the information. In the event the Secretary of Commerce considers making such a determination concerning competitive disadvantage, appropriate notice and an opportunity for comment will be given before any such proprietary information is publicly disclosed. In no event will requests of reporting persons to withhold any information contained in the report other than that specified in this paragraph be honored.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Reports of requests received on or after October 7, 1976, as well as any accompanying documents filed with the reports, have been and will continue to be made available for public inspection and copying, except for certain proprietary information.

In no event will requests of reporting persons to withhold any information contained in the report other than that specified in this paragraph be honored.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Because a copy of any document(s) accompanying the report will be made available for public inspection and copying, one copy must be submitted intact and another copy must be edited by the reporting entity to delete the same information which it certified in the report would place a United States person at a competitive disadvantage if disclosed. In addition, the reporting entity may delete from this copy information that is considered confidential and that is not required to be contained in the report (e.g., information related to foreign consignee). This copy should be conspicuously marked with the legend ``Public Inspection Copy.'' With respect to documents accompanying reports received by the Department on or after July 1, 1979, the public inspection copy will be made available as submitted whether or not it has been appropriately edited by the reporting entity as provided by this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reports and accompanying documents which are available to the public for inspection and copying are located in the BIS Freedom of Information Records Inspection Facility, Room 4525, Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230. Requests to inspect such documents should be addressed to that facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The Secretary of Commerce will periodically transmit summaries of the information contained in the reports to the Secretary of State for such action as the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, may deem appropriate for carrying out the policies in section 8(b)(2) of the Export Administration Act of 1979.</p><p class="depth0">Examples</p><p class="depth0">The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining what is reportable. They are illustrative, not comprehensive.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A, a U.S. manufacturer, is shipping goods to boycotting country Y and is asked by Y to certify that it is not blacklisted by Y's boycott office.</p><p class="depth0">The request to A is reportable, because it is a request to A to comply with Y's boycott requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A, a U.S. manufacturing company, receives an order for tractors from boycotting country Y. Y's order specifies that the tires on the tractors be made by B, another U.S. company. A believes Y has specified B as the tire supplier because otherwise A would have used tires made by C, a blacklisted company, and Y will not take shipment of tractors containing tires made by blacklisted companies.</p><p class="depth0">A must report Y's request for tires made by B, because A has reason to know that B was chosen for boycott reasons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Same as (ii), except A knows that Y's request has nothing to do with the boycott but simply reflects Y's preference for tires made by B.</p><p class="depth0">Y's request is not reportable, because it is unrelated to Y's boycott.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Same as (ii), except A neither knows nor has reason to know why Y has chosen B.</p><p class="depth0">Y's request is not reportable, because A neither knows nor has reason to know that Y's request is based on Y's boycott.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, is a resident of boycotting country Y. A is a general contractor. After being supplied by A with a list of competent subcontractors, A's customer instructs A to use subcontractor C on the project. A believes that C was chosen because, among other things, the other listed subcontractors are blacklisted.</p><p class="depth0">The instruction to A by its customer that C be used on the project is reportable, because it is a request to comply with Y's boycott requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, is located in non-boycotting country P. A receives an order for washing

machines from boycotting country Y. Y instructs A that a negative certificate of origin must accompany the shipment. The washing machines are made wholly in P, without U.S. components.</p><p class="depth0">Y's instruction to A regarding the negative certificate of origin is not reportable, because the transaction to which it relates is not in U.S. commerce.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Same as (vi), except that A obtains components from the United States for the purpose of filling the order from Y. Y's instruction to A regarding the negative certificate of origin is reportable, because the transaction to which it relates is in U.S. commerce.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> A, a U.S. construction company, receives in the mail an unsolicited invitation to bid on a construction project in boycotting country Y. The invitation to bid requires those who respond to certify that they do not have any plants or branch offices in boycotted country X. A does not respond.</p><p class="depth0">A's receipt of the unsolicited invitation to bid is not reportable, because the request does not relate to any present or anticipated business of A with or in Y.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Same as (viii), except that A receives a boycott questionnaire from a central boycott office. A does not do business in any of the boycotting countries involved, and does not anticipate doing any business in those countries. A does not respond.</p><p class="depth0">A's receipt of the boycott questionnaire is not reportable, because it does not relate to any present or anticipated business by A with or in a boycotting country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> A, a U.S. manufacturer, is seeking markets in which to expand its exports. A sends a representative to boycotting country Y to explore Y's potential as a market for A's products. A's representative discusses its products but does not enter into any contracts on that trip. A does, however, hope that sales will materialize in the future. Subsequently, A receives a boycott questionnaire from Y.</p><p class="depth0">A's receipt of the boycott questionnaire is reportable, because the request relates to A's anticipated business with or in a boycotting country. For purposes of determining whether a report is required, it makes no difference whether A responds to the questionnaire, and it makes no difference that actual sales contracts are not in existence or do not materialize.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Same as (x), except that A's representative enters into a contract to sell A's products to a buyer in boycotting country Y. Subsequently, A receives a boycott questionnaire from Y.</p><p class="depth0">A's receipt of the boycott questionnaire is reportable, because it relates to A's present business with or in a boycotting country. For purposes of determining whether a report is required, it makes no difference whether A responds to the questionnaire.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> A, a U.S. freight forwarder, purchases an exporter's guidebook which includes the import requirements of boycotting country Y. The guidebook contains descriptions of actions which U.S. exporters must take in order to make delivery of goods to Y.</p><p class="depth0">A's acquisition of the guidebook is not reportable, because he has not received a request from anyone.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> A, a U.S. freight forwarder, is arranging for the shipment of goods to boycotting country Y at the request of B, a U.S. exporter. B asks A to assume responsibility to assure that the documentation accompanying the shipment is in compliance with Y's import requirements. A examines an exporters' guidebook, determines that Y's import regulations require a certification that the insurer of the goods is not blacklisted and asks U.S. insurer C for such a certification.</p><p class="depth0">B's request to A is reportable by A, because it constitutes a request to comply with Y's boycott as of the time A takes action to comply with Y's boycott requirements in response to the request. A's request to C is reportable by C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiv)</em> A, a U.S. freight forwarder, is arranging for the shipment of U.S. goods to boycotting country Y. The manufacturer supplies A with all the necessary documentation to accompany the shipment. Among the documents supplied by the manufacturer is his certificate that he himself is not blacklisted. A transmits the documentation supplied by the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth0">A's action in merely transmitting documents received from the manufacturer is not reportable, because A has received no request to comply with Y's boycott.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xv)</em> Same as (xiv), except that A is asked by U.S. exporter B to assume the responsibility to assure that the necessary documentation accompanies the shipment whatever that documentation might be. B forwards to A a letter of credit which requires that a negative certificate of origin accompany the bill of lading. A supplies a positive certificate of origin.</p><p class="depth0">Both A and B must report receipt of the letter of credit, because it contains a request to both of them to comply with Y's boycott.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xvi)</em> Same as (xiv), except that the manufacturer fails to supply a required negative certificate of origin, and A is subsequently asked by a consular official of Y to see to it that the certificate is supplied. A supplies a positive certificate of origin.</p><p class="depth0">The consular official's request to A is reportable by A, because A was asked to comply with Y's boycott requirements by supplying the negative certificate of origin.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xvii)</em> A, a U.S. manufacturer, is shipping goods to boycotting country Y. Arrangements have been made for freight forwarder B to handle the shipment and secure all necessary shipping certifications. B notes that

the letter of credit requires that the manufacturer supply a negative certificate of origin and B asks A to do so. A supplies a positive certificate of origin.</p><p class="depth0">B's request to A is reportable by A, because A is asked to comply with Y's boycott requirements by providing the negative certificate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xviii)</em> A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, is a resident of boycotting country Y. A is engaged in oil exploration and drilling operations in Y. In placing orders for drilling equipment to be shipped from the United States, A, in compliance with Y's laws, selects only those suppliers who are not blacklisted.</p><p class="depth0">A's action in choosing non-blacklisted suppliers is not reportable, because A has not received a request to comply with Y's boycott in making these selections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xix)</em> A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, is seeking permission to do business in boycotting country Y. Before being granted such permission, A is asked to sign an agreement to comply with Y's boycott laws.</p><p class="depth0">The request to A is reportable, because it is a request that expressly requires compliance with Y's boycott law and is received in connection with A's anticipated business in Y.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xx)</em> A, a U.S. bank, is asked by a firm in boycotting country Y to confirm a letter of credit in favor of B, a U.S. company. The letter of credit calls for a certificate from B that the goods to be supplied are not produced by a firm blacklisted by Y. A informs B of the letter of credit, including its certification condition, and sends B a copy.</p><p class="depth0">B must report the certification request contained in the letter of credit, and A must report the request to confirm the letter of credit containing the boycott condition, because both are being asked to comply with Y's boycott.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xxi)</em> Same as (xx), except that the letter of credit calls for a certificate from the beneficiary that the goods will not be shipped on a vessel that will call at a port in boycotted country X before making delivery in Y.</p><p class="depth0">The request is not reportable, because it is a request of a type deemed by this section to be in common use for non-boycott purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xxii)</em> A, a U.S. company, receives a letter of credit from boycotting country Y stating that on no condition may a bank blacklisted by Y be permitted to negotiate the credit.</p><p class="depth0">A's receipt of the letter of credit is reportable, because it contains a request to A to comply with Y's boycott requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xxiii)</em> A, a U.S. bank, receives a demand draft from B, a U.S. company, in connection with B's shipment of goods to boycotting country Y. The draft contains a directive that it is valid in all countries except boycotted country X.</p><p class="depth0">A's receipt of the demand draft is reportable, because it contains a request to A to comply with Y's boycott requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xxiv)</em> A, a U.S. exporter, receives an order from boycotting country Y. On the order is a legend that A's goods, invoices, and packaging must not bear a six-pointed star or other symbol of boycotted country X.</p><p class="depth0">A's receipt of the order is reportable, because it contains a request to comply with Y's boycott requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xxv)</em> Same as (xxiv), except the order contains a statement that goods exported must not represent part of war reparations to boycotted country X.</p><p class="depth0">A's receipt of the order is reportable, because it contains a request to A to comply with Y's boycott requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xxvi)</em> A, a U.S. contractor, is negotiating with boycotting country Y to build a school in Y. During the course of the negotiations, Y suggests that one of the terms of the construction contract be that A agree not to import materials produced in boycotted country X. It is A's company policy not to agree to such a contractual clause, and A suggests that instead it agree that all of the necessary materials will be obtained from U.S. suppliers. Y agrees to A's suggestion and a contract is executed.</p><p class="depth0">A has received a reportable request, but, for purposes of reporting, the request is deemed to be received when the contract is executed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xxvii)</em> Same as (xxvi), except Y does not accept A's suggested alternative clause and negotiations break off.</p><p class="depth0">A's receipt of Y's request is reportable. For purposes of reporting, it makes no difference that A was not successful in the negotiations. The request is deemed to be received at the time the negotiations break off.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xxviii)</em> A, a U.S. insurance company, is insuring the shipment of drilling equipment to boycotting country Y. The transaction is being financed by a letter of credit which requires that A certify that it is not blacklisted by Y. Freight forwarder B asks A to supply the certification in order to satisfy the requirements of the letter of credit.</p><p class="depth0">The request to A is reportable by A, because it is a request to comply with Y's boycott requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xxix)</em> A, a U.S. manufacturer, is engaged from time-to-time in supplying drilling rigs to company B in boycotting country Y. B insists that its suppliers sign contracts which provide that, even after title passes from the supplier to B, the supplier will bear the risk of loss and indemnify B if goods which the supplier has furnished are denied entry into Y for whatever reason. A knows or has reason to know that this contractual provision is required by B because of Y's boycott, and that B has been using the provision since 1977. A receives an order from B which contains such a clause.</p><p class="depth0">B's request is not reportable by A, because the request is deemed to be not reportable by these regulations if the provision was in use by B prior to January 18, 1978.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xxx)</em> Same as (xxix), except that A does not know when B began using the provision.</p><p class="depth0">Unless A receives information from B that B introduced the term prior to January 18, 1978, A must report receipt of the request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xxxi)</em> A, a U.S. citizen, is a shipping clerk for B, a U.S. manufacturing company. In the course of his employment, A receives an order for goods from boycotting country Y.

Supplement No. 1 to Part 760--Interpretations</p><p class="depth0">It has come to the Department's attention that some U.S. persons are being or may be asked to comply with new boycotting country requirements with respect to shipping and insurance certifications and certificates of origin. It has also come to the Department's attention that some U.S. persons are being or may be asked to agree to new contractual provisions in connection with certain foreign government or foreign government agency contracts. In order to maximize its guidance with respect to section 8 of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. app. 2407) and part 760 of the EAR, the Department hereby sets forth its views on these certifications and contractual clauses. \1\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ The Department originally issued this interpretation pursuant to the Export Administration Amendments Act of 1979 (Public Law 95-52) and the regulations on restrictive trade practices and boycotts (15 CFR part 369) published on January 25, 1978 (43 FR 3508) and contained in the 15 CFR edition revised as of January 1, 1979.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">I. Certifications</p><p class="depth0">Sec. 760.2(d) of this part prohibits a U.S. person from furnishing or knowingly agreeing to furnish:</p><p class="depth0">``Information concerning his or any other person's past, present or proposed business relationships:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> With or in a boycotted country;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> With any business concern organized under the laws of a boycotted country;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> With any national or resident of a boycotted country; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> With any other person who is known or believed to be restricted from having any business relationship with or in a boycotting country.''</p><p class="depth0">This prohibition, like all others under part 760, applies only with respect to a U.S. person's activities in the interstate or foreign

commerce of the United States and only when such activities are undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott. (Sec. 760.2(d)(5) of this part.)</p><p class="depth0">This prohibition does not apply to the furnishing of normal business information in a commercial context. (Sec. 760.2(d)(3) of this part). Normal business information furnished in a commercial context does not cease to be such simply because the party soliciting the information may be a boycotting country or a national or resident thereof. If the information is of a type which is generally sought for a legitimate business purpose (such as determining financial fitness, technical competence, or professional experience), the information may be furnished even if the information could be used, or without the knowledge of the person supplying the information is intended to be used, for boycott purposes. (Sec. 760.2(d)(4) of this part).</p><p class="depth0">The new certification requirements and the Department's interpretation of the applicability of part 760 thereto are as follows:</p><p class="depth0">A. Certificate of origin. A certificate of origin is to be issued by the supplier or exporting company and authenticated by the exporting country, attesting that the goods exported to the boycotting country are of purely indigenous origin, and stating the name of the factory or the manufacturing company. To the extent that the goods as described on the certificate of origin are not solely and exclusively products of their country of origin indicated thereon, a declaration must be appended to the certificate of origin giving the name of the supplier/manufacturer and declaring:</p><p class="depth0">``The undersigned, ------------, does hereby declare on behalf of the above-named supplier/manufacturer, that certain parts or components of the goods described in the attached certificate of origin are the products of such country or countries, other than the country named therein as specifically indicated hereunder:</p><p class="depth0">Country of Origin and Percentage of Value of Parts or Components</p><p class="depth0">Relative to Total Shipment

See Sec. 760.3(c) of this part and examples (i) and (ii) thereunder.</p><p class="depth0">B. Shipping certificate. A certificate must be appended to the bill of lading stating: (1) Name of vessel; (2) Nationality of vessel; and (3) Owner of vessel, and declaring:</p><p class="depth0">``The undersigned does hereby declare on behalf of the owner, master, or agent of the above-named vessel that said vessel is not registered in the boycotted country or owned by nationals or residents of the boycotted country and will not call at or pass through any boycotted country port enroute to its boycotting country destination.</p><p class="depth0">``The undersigned further declares that said vessel is otherwise eligible to enter into the ports of the boycotting country in conformity with its laws and regulations.</p><p class="depth0">Sworn to before me, this -------- day of ----------, 20----. Notary Seal.''</p><p class="depth0">Interpretation</p><p class="depth0">It is the Department's position that furnishing a certificate, such as the one set out above, stating: (1) The name of the vessel, (2) The nationality of the vessel, and (3) The owner of the vessel and further declaring that the vessel: (a) Is not registered in a boycotted country, (b) Is not owned by nationals or residents of a boycotted country, and (c) Will not call at or pass through a boycotted country port enroute to its destination in a boycotting country falls within the exception contained in Sec. 760.3(c) for compliance with the import and shipping document requirements of a boycotting country. See Sec. 760.3(c) and examples (vii), (viii), and (ix) thereunder.</p><p class="depth0">It is also the Department's position that the owner, charterer, or master of a vessel may certify that the vessel is ``eligible'' or ``otherwise eligible'' to enter into the ports of a boycotting country in conformity with its laws and regulations. Furnishing such a statement pertaining to one's own eligibility offends no prohibition under this part 760. See Sec. 760.2(f), example (xiv).</p><p class="depth0">On the other hand, where a boycott is in force, a declaration that a vessel is ``eligible'' or ``otherwise eligible'' to enter the ports of the boycotting country necessarily conveys the information that the vessel is not blacklisted or otherwise restricted from having a business relationship with the boycotting country. See Sec. 760.3(c) examples (vi), (xi), and (xii). Where a person other than the vessel's owner, charterer, or master furnishes such a statement, that is tantamount to his furnishing a statement that he is not doing business with a blacklisted person or is doing business only with non-blacklisted persons. Therefore, it is the Department's position that furnishing such a certification (which does not reflect customary international commercial practice) by anyone other than the owner, charterer, or master of a vessel would fall within the prohibition set

forth in Sec. 760.2(d) unless it is clear from all the facts and circumstances that the certification is not required for a boycott reason. See Sec. 760.2(d)(3) and (4). See also part A., ``Permissible Furnishing of Information,'' of Supplement No. 5 to this part.</p><p class="depth0">C. Insurance certificate. A certificate must be appended to the insurance policy stating: (1) Name of insurance company; (2) Address of its principal office; and (3) Country of its incorporation, and declaring:</p><p class="depth0">``The undersigned, ----------------, does hereby certify on behalf of the above-named insurance company that the said company has a duly qualified and appointed agent or representative in the boycotting country whose name and address appear below:</p><p class="depth0">Name of agent/representative and address in the boycotting country.</p><p class="depth0">Sworn to before me this -------- day of ------------, 20----. Notary Seal.''</p><p class="depth0">Interpretation</p><p class="depth0">It is the Department's position that furnishing the name of the insurance company falls within the exception contained in Sec. 760.3(c) for compliance with the import and shipping document requirements of a boycotting country. See Sec. 760.3(c)(1)(v) and examples (v) and (x) thereunder. In addition, it is the Department's position that furnishing a certificate, such as the one set out above, stating the address of the insurance company's principal office and its country of incorporation offends no prohibition under this part 760 unless the U.S. person furnishing the certificate knows or has reason to know that the information is sought for the purpose of determining that the insurance company is neither headquartered nor incorporated in a boycotted country. See Sec. 760.2(d)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">It is also the Department's position that the insurer, himself, may certify that he has a duly qualified and appointed agent or representative in the boycotting country and may furnish the name and address of his agent or representative. Furnishing such a statement pertaining to one's own status offends no prohibition under this part 760. See Sec. 760.2(f), example (xiv).</p><p class="depth0">On the other hand, where a boycott is in force, a declaration that an insurer ``has a duly qualified and appointed agent or representative'' in the boycotting country necessarily conveys the information that the insurer is not blacklisted or otherwise restricted from having a business relationship with the boycotting country. See Sec. 760.3(c), example (v). Therefore, it is the Department's position that furnishing such a certification by anyone other than the insurer would fall within the prohibition set forth in Sec. 760.2(d) unless it is clear from all the facts and circumstances that the certification is not required for a boycott reason. See Sec. 760.2(d)(3) and (4).</p><p class="depth0">II. Contractual Clauses</p><p class="depth0">The new contractual requirements and the Department's interpretation of the applicability of part 760 thereto are as follows:</p><p class="depth0">A. Contractual clause regarding import laws of boycotting country. ``In connection with the performance of this contract the Contractor/Supplier acknowledges that the import and customs laws and regulations of the boycotting country shall apply to the furnishing and shipment of any products or components thereof to the boycotting country. The Contractor/Supplier specifically acknowledges that the aforementioned import and customs laws and regulations of the boycotting country prohibit, among other things, the importation into the boycotting country of products or components thereof: (1) Originating in the boycotted country; (2) Manufactured, produced, or furnished by companies organized under the laws of the boycotted country; and (3) Manufactured, produced, or furnished by nationals or residents of the boycotted country.''</p><p class="depth0">Interpretation</p><p class="depth0">It is the Department's position that an agreement, such as the one set out in the first sentence above, that the import and customs requirements of a boycotting country shall apply to the performance of a contract does not, in and of itself, offend any prohibition under this part 760. See Sec. 760.2(a)(5) and example (iii) under ``Examples of Agreements To Refuse To Do Business.'' It is also the Department's position that an agreement to comply generally with the import and customs requirements of a boycotting country does not, in and of itself, offend any prohibition under this part 760. See Sec. 760.2(a)(5) and examples (iv) and (v) under ``Examples of Agreements To Refuse To Do Business.'' In addition, it is the Department's position that an agreement, such as the one set out in the second sentence above, to comply with the boycotting country's import and customs requirements prohibiting the importation of products or components: (1) Originating in the boycotted country; (2) Manufactured, produced, or furnished by companies organized under the laws of the boycotted country; or (3) Manufactured, produced, or furnished by nationals or residents of the boycotted country falls within the exception contained in Sec. 760.3(a) for compliance with the import requirements of a boycotting country. See Sec. 760.3(a) and example (ii) thereunder.</p><p class="depth0">The Department notes that a United States person may not furnish a negative certification regarding the origin of goods or their components even though the certification is furnished in response to the import and shipping document requirements of the

boycotting country. See Sec. 760.3(c) and examples (i) and (ii) thereunder, and Sec. 760.3(a) and example (ii) thereunder.</p><p class="depth0">B. Contractual clause regarding unilateral and specific selection. ``The Government of the boycotting country (or the First Party), in its exclusive power, reserves its right to make the final unilateral and specific selection of any proposed carriers, insurers, suppliers of services to be performed within the boycotting country, or of specific goods to be furnished in accordance with the terms and conditions of this contract.''</p><p class="depth0">Interpretation</p><p class="depth0">It is the Department's position that an agreement, such as the one set out above, falls within the exception contained in Sec. 760.3(d) of this part for compliance with unilateral selections. However, the Department notes that whether a U.S. person may subsequently comply or agree to comply with any particular selection depends upon whether that selection meets all the requirements contained in Sec. 760.3(d) of this part for compliance with unilateral selections. For example, the particular selection must be unilateral and specific, particular goods must be specifically identifiable as to their source or origin at the time of their entry into the boycotting country, and all other requirements contained in Sec. 760.3(d) of this part must be observed.

Supplement No. 2 to Part 760--Interpretation</p><p class="depth0">The Department hereby sets forth its views on whether the furnishing of certain shipping and insurance certificates in compliance with boycotting country requirements violates the provisions of section 8 of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. app. 2407) and part 760 of the EAR, \1\ as follows:---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ The Department originally issued this interpretation on April 21, 1978 (43 FR 16969) pursuant to the Export Administration Amendments Act of 1977 (Public Law 95-52) and the regulations on restrictive trade practices and boycotts (15 CFR part 369) published on January 25, 1978 (43 FR 3508) and contained in the 15 CFR edition revised as of January 1, 1979.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> ``The owner, charterer or master of a vessel may certify that the vessel is `eligible' or `otherwise eligible' to enter into the ports of a boycotting country in conformity with its laws and regulations;''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> ``The insurer, himself, may certify that he has a duly qualified and appointed agent or representative in the boycotting country and may furnish the name and address of his agent or representative.''</p><p class="depth0">Furnishing such certifications by anyone other than:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The owner, charterer or master of a vessel, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The insurer would fall within the prohibition set forth in Sec. 760.2(d) of this part, ``unless it is clear from all the facts and circumstances that these certifications are not required for a boycott reason.'' See Sec. 760.2(d) (3) and (4) of this part.</p><p class="depth0">The Department has received from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia a clarification that the shipping and insurance certifications are required by Saudi Arabia in order to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Demonstrate that there are no applicable restrictions under Saudi laws or regulations pertaining to maritime matters such as the age of the ship, the condition of the ship, and similar matters that would bar entry of the vessel into Saudi ports; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Facilitate dealings with insurers by Saudi Arabian importers whose ability to secure expeditious payments in the event of damage to insured goods may be adversely affected by the absence of a qualified agent or representative of the insurer in Saudi Arabia. In the Department's judgment, this clarification constitutes sufficient facts and circumstances to demonstrate that the certifications are not required by Saudi Arabia for boycott reasons.</p><p class="depth0">On the basis of this clarification, it is the Department's position that any United States person may furnish such shipping and insurance certificates required by Saudi Arabia without violating Sec. 760.2(d) of this part. Moreover, under these circumstances, receipts of requests for such shipping and insurance certificates from Saudi Arabia are not reportable.</p><p class="depth0">It is still the Department's position that furnishing such a certificate pertaining to one's own eligibility offends no prohibition under part 760. See Sec. 760.2(f) of this part, example (xiv). However, absent facts and circumstances clearly indicating that the certifications are required for ordinary commercial reasons as demonstrated by the Saudi clarification, furnishing certifications about the eligibility or blacklist status of any other person would fall within the prohibition set forth in Sec. 760.2(d) of this part, and receipts of requests for such certifications are reportable.</p><p class="depth0">It also remains the Department's position that where a United States person asks an insurer or carrier of the exporter's goods to self-certify, such request offends no prohibition under this part. However, where a United States person asks anyone other than an insurer or carrier of the exporter's goods to self-certify, such requests will be considered by the Department as evidence of the requesting person's refusal to do business with those persons who cannot or will not

furnish such a self-certification. For example, if an exporter-beneficiary of a letter of credit asks his component suppliers to self-certify, such a request will be considered as evidence of his refusal to do business with those component suppliers who cannot or will not furnish such a self-certification.</p><p class="depth0">The Department wishes to emphasize that notwithstanding the fact that self-certifications are permissible, it will closely scrutinize the activities of all United States persons who provide such self-certifications, including insurers and carriers, to determine that such persons have not taken any prohibited actions or entered into any prohibited agreements in order to be able to furnish such certifications.
[61 FR 12862, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 65 FR 34949, June 1, 2000]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Supplement No. 3 to Part 760--Interpretation</p><p class="depth0">Pursuant to Article 2, Annex II of the Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel, Egypt's participation in the Arab economic boycott of Israel was formally terminated on January 25, 1980. On the basis of this action, it is the Department's position that certain requests for information, action or agreement which were considered boycott-related by implication now cannot be presumed boycott-related and thus would not be prohibited or reportable under the Regulations. For example, a request that an exporter certify that the vessel on which it is shipping its goods is eligible to enter Arab Republic of Egypt ports has been considered a boycott-related request that the exporter could not comply with because Egypt has a boycott in force against Israel (see 43 FR 16969, April 21, 1978 or the 15 CFR edition revised as of January 1, 1979). Such a request after January 25, 1980 would not be presumed boycott-related because the underlying boycott requirement/basis for the certification has been eliminated. Similarly, a U.S. company would not be prohibited from complying with a request received from Egyptian government officials to furnish the place of birth of employees the company is seeking to take to Egypt, because there is no underlying boycott law or policy that would give rise to a presumption that the request was boycott-related.</p><p class="depth0">U.S. persons are reminded that requests that are on their face boycott-related or that are for action obviously in furtherance or support of an unsanctioned foreign boycott are subject to the Regulations, irrespective of the country or origin. For example, requests containing references to ``blacklisted companies'', ``Israel boycott list'', ``non-Israeli goods'' or other phrases or words indicating boycott purpose would be subject to the appropriate provisions of the Department's antiboycott regulations.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Supplement No. 4 to Part 760--Interpretation</p><p class="depth0">The question has arisen how the definition of U.S. commerce in the antiboycott regulations (15 CFR part 760) applies to a shipment of foreign-made goods when U.S.-origin spare parts are included in the shipment. Specifically, if the shipment of foreign goods falls outside the definition of U.S. commerce, will the inclusion of U.S.-origin spare parts bring the entire transaction into U.S. commerce?</p><p class="depth0">Section 760.1(d)(12) provides the general guidelines for determining when U.S.-origin goods shipped from a controlled in fact foreign subsidiary are outside U.S. commerce. The two key tests of that provision are that the goods were ``(i) * * * acquired without reference to a specific order from or transaction with a person outside the United States; and (ii) * * * further manufactured, incorporated into, refined into, or reprocessed into another product.'' Because the application of these two tests to spare parts does not conclusively answer the U.S. commerce question, the Department is presenting this clarification.</p><p class="depth0">In the cases brought to the Department's attention, an order for foreign-origin goods was placed with a controlled in fact foreign subsidiary of a United States company. The foreign goods contained components manufactured in the United States and in other countries, and the order included a request for extras of the U.S. manufactured components (spare parts) to allow the customer to repair the item. Both the foreign manufactured product and the U.S. spare parts were to be shipped from the general inventory of the foreign subsidiary. Since the spare parts, if shipped by themselves, would be in U.S. commerce as that term is defined in the Regulations, the question was whether including them with the foreign manufactured item would bring the entire shipment into U.S. commerce. The Department has decided that it will not and presents the following specific guidance.</p><p class="depth0">As used above, the term ``spare parts'' refers to parts of the quantities and types normally and customarily ordered with a product and kept on hand in the event they are needed to assure prompt repair of the product. Parts, components or accessories that improve or change the basic operations or design characteristics, for example, as to accuracy, capability or productivity, are not spare parts under this definition.</p><p class="depth0">Inclusion of U.S.-origin spare parts in a shipment of products which is otherwise outside U.S. commerce will not bring the transaction into U.S. commerce if the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> The parts included in the shipment are acquired from the United States by the controlled in fact foreign subsidiary without reference to a specific order from or transaction with a person outside the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(II)</em> The parts are identical to the corresponding United States-origin parts which have been manufactured, incorporated into or reprocessed into the completed product;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(III)</em> The parts are of the quantity and type normally and customarily ordered with the completed product and kept on hand by the firm or industry of which the firm is a part to assure prompt repair of the product; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(IV)</em> The parts are covered by the same order as the completed product and are shipped with or at the same time as the original product.</p><p class="depth0">The Department emphasizes that unless each of the above conditions is met, the inclusion of United States-origin spare parts in an order for a foreign-manufactured or assembled product will bring the entire transaction into the interstate or foreign commerce of the United States for purposes of part 760.

Permissible Furnishing of Information</p><p class="depth0">The information outlined below may be furnished in response to boycott-related requests from boycotting countries or others. This information is, in the view of the Department, not prohibited by the Regulations. Thus, a person does not have to qualify under any of the exceptions to be able to make the following statements. Such statements can be made, however, only by the person indicated and under the circumstances described. These statements should not be used as a point of departure or analogy for determining the permissibility of other types of statements. The Department's view that these statements are not contrary to the prohibitions contained in antiboycott provisions of the Regulations is limited to the specific statement in the specific context indicated.</p><p class="depth0">1. A U.S. person may always provide its own name, address, place of incorporation (``nationality''), and nature of business.</p><p class="depth0">2. A U.S. person may state that it is not on a blacklist, or restricted from doing business in a boycotting country. A company may not make that statement about its subsidiaries or affiliates--only about itself. A U.S. person may not say that there is no reason for it to be blacklisted. To make that statement would provide directly or by implication information that may not be provided. A U.S. person may inquire about the reasons it is blacklisted if it learns that it is on a blacklist (see Sec. 760.2(d) of this part example (xv)).</p><p class="depth0">3. A U.S. person may describe in detail its past dealings with boycotting countries; may state in which boycotting countries its trademarks are registered; and may specify in which boycotting countries it is registered or qualified to do business. In general, a U.S. person is free to furnish any information it wishes about the nature and extent of its commercial dealings with boycotting countries.</p><p class="depth0">4. A U.S. person may state that many U.S. firms or individuals have similar names and that it believes that it may be confused with a similarly named entity. A U.S. person may not state that it does or does not have an affiliation or relationship with such similarly named entity.</p><p class="depth0">5. A U.S. person may state that the information requested is a matter of public record in the United States. However, the person may not direct the inquirer to the location of that information, nor may the U.S. person provide or cause to be provided such information.
B. Availability of the Compliance With Local Law Exception To Establish</p><p class="depth0">a Foreign Branch</p><p class="depth0">Section 760.3(g), the Compliance With Local Law exception, permits U.S. persons, who are bona fide residents of a boycotting country, to take certain limited, but otherwise prohibited, actions, if they are required to do so in order to comply with local law.</p><p class="depth0">Among these actions is the furnishing of non-discriminatory information. Examples (iv) through (vi) under ``Examples of Bona Fide Residency'' indicate that a company seeking to become a bona fide resident within a boycotting country may take advantage of the exception for the limited purpose of furnishing information required by local law to obtain resident status. Exactly when and how this exception is available has been the subject of a number of inquiries. It is the Department's view that the following conditions must be met for a non-resident company to be permitted to furnish otherwise prohibited information for the limited purpose of seeking to become a bona fide resident:</p><p class="depth0">1. The company must have a legitimate business reason for seeking to establish a branch or other resident operation in the boycotting country. (Removal from the blacklist does not constitute such a reason.)</p><p class="depth0">2. The local operation it seeks to establish must be similar or comparable in nature and operation to ones the company operates in other parts of the world, unless local law or custom dictates a significantly different form.</p><p class="depth0">3. The person who visits the boycotting country to furnish the information must be the official whose responsibility ordinarily

includes the creation and registration of foreign operations (i.e., the chairman of the board cannot be flown in to answer boycott questions unless the chairman of the board is the corporate official who ordinarily goes into a country to handle foreign registrations).</p><p class="depth0">4. The information provided must be that which is ordinarily known to the person establishing the foreign branch. Obviously, at the time of establishment, the foreign branch will have no information of its own knowledge. Rather, the information should be that which the responsible person has of his own knowledge, or that he would have with him as incidental and necessary to the registration and establishment process. As a general rule, such information would not include such things as copies of agreements with boycotted country concerns or detailed information about the person's dealings with blacklisted concerns.</p><p class="depth0">5. It is not necessary that documents prepared in compliance with this exception be drafted or executed within the boycotting country.

Supplement No. 6 to Part 760--Interpretation</p><p class="depth0">The antiboycott regulations prohibit knowing agreements to comply with certain prohibited requests and requirements of boycotting countries, regardless of how these terms are stated. Similarly, the reporting rules require that a boycott related ``solicitation, directive, legend or instruction that asks for information or that asks that a United States person take or refrain from taking a particular action'' be reported. Questions have frequently arisen about how particular requirements in the form of directive or instructions are viewed under the antiboycott regulations, and we believe that it will add clarity to the regulations to provide a written interpretation of how three of these terms are treated under the law. The terms in question appear frequently in letters of credit, but may also be found on purchase orders or other shipping or sale documents. They have been brought to the attention of the Department by numerous persons. The terms are, or are similar to, the following: (1) Goods of boycotted country origin are prohibited; (2) No six-pointed stars may be used on the goods, packing or cases; (3) Neither goods nor packing shall bear any symbols prohibited in the boycotting country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Goods of boycotted country origin prohibited. This term is very common in letters of credit from Kuwait and may also appear from time-to-time in invitations to bid, contracts, or other trade documents. It imposes a condition or requirement compliance with which is prohibited, but permitted by an exception under the Regulations (see Sec. 760.2(a) and Sec. 760.3(a)). It is reportable by those parties to the letter of credit or other transaction that are required to take or refrain from taking some boycott related action by the request. Thus the bank must report the request because it is a term or condition of the letter of credit that it is handling, and the exporter-beneficiary must report the request because the exporter determines the origin of the goods. The freight forwarder does not have to report this request because the forwarder has no role or obligation in selecting the goods. However, the freight forwarder would have to report a request to furnish a certificate that the goods do not originate in or contain components from a boycotted country. See Sec. 760.5, examples (xii)-(xvii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> No six-pointed stars may be used on the goods, packing or cases. This term appears from time-to-time on documents from a variety of countries. The Department has taken the position that the six-pointed star is a religious symbol. See Sec. 760.2(b), example (viii) of this part. Agreeing to this term is prohibited by the Regulations and not excepted because it constitutes an agreement to furnish information about the religion of a U.S. person. See Sec. 760.2(c) of this part. If a person proceeds with a transaction in which this is a condition at any stage of the transaction, that person has agreed to the condition in violation of the Regulations. It is not enough to ignore the condition. Exception must affirmatively be taken to this term or it must be stricken from the documents of the transaction. It is reportable by all parties to the transaction that are restricted by it. For example, unlike the situation described in (a) above, the freight forwarder would have to report this request because his role in the transaction would involve preparation of the packing and cases. The bank and exporter would both have to report, of course, if it were a term in a letter of credit. Each party would be obligated affirmatively to seek an amendment or deletion of the term.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Neither goods nor packaging shall bear any symbols prohibited in the boycotting country. This term appears from time-to-time in letters of credit and shipping documents from Saudi Arabia. In our view, it is neither prohibited, nor reportable because it is not boycott-related. There is a wide range of symbols that are prohibited in Saudi Arabia for a variety of reasons, many having to do with that nation's cultural and religious beliefs. On this basis, we do not interpret the

term to be boycott related. See Sec. 760.2(a)(5) and Sec. 760.5(a)(5)(v) of this part.

Supplement No. 7 to Part 760--Interpretation</p><p class="depth0">Prohibited Refusal To Do Business</p><p class="depth0">When a boycotting country rejects for boycott-related reasons a shipment of goods sold by a United States person, the United States person selling the goods may return them to its inventory or may re-ship them to other markets (the United States person may not return them to the original supplier and demand restitution). The U.S. person may then make a non-boycott based selection of another supplier and provide the goods necessary to meet its obligations to the boycotting customer in that particular transaction without violating Sec. 760.2(a) of this part. If the United States person receives another order from the same boycotting country for similar goods, the Department has determined that a boycott-based refusal by a United States person to ship goods from the supplier whose goods were previously rejected would constitute a prohibited refusal to do business under Sec. 760.2(a) of this part. The Department will presume that filling such an order with alternative goods is evidence of the person's refusal to deal with the original supplier.</p><p class="depth0">The Department recognizes the limitations this places on future transactions with a boycotting country once a shipment of goods has been rejected. Because of this, the Department wishes to point out that, when faced with a boycotting country's refusal to permit entry of the particular goods, a United States person may state its obligation to abide by the requirements of United States law and indicate its readiness to comply with the unilateral and specific selection of goods by the boycotting country in accordance with Sec. 760.3(d). That section provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p><p class="depth0">``A United States person may comply or agree to comply in the normal course of business with the unilateral and specific selection by a boycotting country * * * of * * * specific goods, * * * provided that * * * with respect to goods, the items, in the normal course of business, are identifiable as to their source or origin at the time of their entry into the boycotting country by (a) uniqueness of design or appearance or (b) trademark, trade name, or other identification normally on the items themselves, including their packaging.''</p><p class="depth0">The United States person may also provide certain services in advance of the unilateral selection by the boycotting country, such as the compilation of lists of qualified suppliers, so long as such services are customary to the type of business the United States person is engaged in, and the services rendered are completely non-exclusionary in character (i.e., the list of qualified suppliers would have to include the supplier whose goods had previously been rejected by the boycotting country, if they were fully qualified). See Sec. 760.2(a)(6) of this part for a discussion of the requirements for the provision of these services.</p><p class="depth0">The Department wishes to emphasize that the unilateral selection exception in Sec. 760.3(d) of this part will be construed narrowly, and that all its requirements and conditions must be met, including the following:
--Discretion for the selection must be exercised by a boycotting country; or by a national or resident of a boycotting country;--The selection must be stated in the affirmative specifying a particular supplier of goods;--While a permissible selection may be boycott based, if the United States person knows or has reason to know that the purpose of the selection is to effect discrimination against any United States person on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin, the person may not comply under any circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">The Department cautions United States persons confronted with the problem or concern over the boycott-based rejection of goods shipped to a boycotting country that the adoption of devices such as ``risk of loss'' clauses, or conditions that make the supplier financially liable if his or her goods are rejected by the boycotting country for boycott reasons are presumed by the Department to be evasion of the statute and regulations, and as such are prohibited by Sec. 760.4 of this part, unless adopted prior to January 18, 1978. See Sec. 760.4(d) of this part.

Supplement No. 8 to Part 760--Interpretation</p><p class="depth0">Definition of Interstate or Foreign Commerce of the United States</p><p class="depth0">When United States persons (as defined by the antiboycott regulations) located within the United States purchase or sell goods or services located outside the United States, they have engaged in an activity within the foreign commerce of the United States. Although the goods or services may never physically come within the geographic boundaries of the several states or territories of the United States, legal ownership or title is transferred from a foreign nation to the United States person who is located in the United States. In the case of a purchase, subsequent resale would also be within United States commerce.</p><p class="depth0">It is the Department's view that the terms ``sale'' and ``purchase'' as used in the regulations are not limited to those circumstances where the goods or services are physically transferred to the person who acquires title. The EAR define the activities that serve as the transactional basis for U.S. commerce as those involving the ``sale, purchase, or transfer'' of goods or services. In the Department's view, as used in the antiboycott regulations, ``transfer'' contemplates physical movement of the goods or services between the several states or territories and a foreign country, while ``sale'' and ``purchase'' relate to the movement of ownership or title.</p><p class="depth0">This interpretation applies only to those circumstances in which the person located within the United States buys or sells goods or services for its own account. Where the United States person is engaged in the brokerage of foreign goods, i.e., bringing foreign buyers and sellers together and assisting in the transfer of the goods, the sale or purchase itself would not ordinarily be considered to be within U.S. commerce. The brokerage service, however, would be a service provided from the United States to the parties and thus an activity within U.S. commerce and subject to the antiboycott laws. See Sec. 760.1(d)(3).</p><p class="depth0">The Department cautions that United States persons who alter their normal pattern of dealing to eliminate the passage of ownership of the goods or services to or from the several states or territories of the United States in order to avoid the application of the antiboycott regulations would be in violation of Sec. 760.4 of this part.
[61 FR 12862, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 65 FR 34950, June 1, 2000]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Supplement No. 9 to Part 760--Interpretation</p><p class="depth0">Activities Exclusively Within a Boycotting Country--Furnishing</p><p class="depth0">Information</p><p class="depth0">Sec. 760.3(h) of this part provides that a United States person who is a bona fide resident of a boycotting country may comply with the laws of that country with respect to his or her activities exclusively within the boycotting country. Among the types of conduct permitted by this exception is ``furnishing information within the host country'' Sec. 760.3(h)(1)(v) of this part. For purposes of the discussion which follows, the Department is assuming that the person in question is a bona fide resident of the boycotting country as defined in Sec. 760.3(g), and that the information to be provided is required by the laws or regulations of the boycotting country, as also defined in Sec. 760.3(g) of this part. The only issue this interpretation addresses is under what circumstances the provision of information is ``an activity exclusively within the boycotting country.''</p><p class="depth0">The activity of ``furnishing information'' consists of two parts, the acquisition of the information and its subsequent transmittal. Under the terms of this exception, the information may not be acquired outside the country for the purpose of responding to the requirement for information imposed by the boycotting country. Thus, if an American company which is a bona fide resident of a boycotting country is required to provide information about its dealings with other U.S. firms, the company may not ask its parent corporation in the United States for that information, or make any other inquiry outside the boundaries of the boycotting country. The information must be provided to the boycotting country authorities based on information or knowledge available to the company and its personnel located within the boycotting country at the time the inquiry is received. See Sec. 760.3, (h) of this part, examples (iii), (iv), and (v). Much of the information in the company's possession (transaction and corporate records) may have actually originated outside the boycotting country, and much of the information known to the employees may have been acquired outside the boycotting country. This will not cause the information to fall outside the coverage of this exception, if the information was sent to the boycotting country or acquired by the individuals in normal commercial context prior to and unrelated to a boycott inquiry or purpose. It should be noted that if prohibited information (about business relations with a boycotted country, for example) has been forwarded to the affiliate in the boycotting country in anticipation of a possible boycott inquiry from the boycotting country government, the Department will not regard this as information within the knowledge of the bona fide resident under the terms of the exception. However, if the bona fide resident possesses the information prior to receipt of a boycott-related inquiry and obtained it in a normal commercial context, the information can be provided pursuant to this exception notwithstanding the fact that, at some point, the information came into the boycotting country from the outside.</p><p class="depth0">The second part of the analysis of ``furnishing information'' deals with the limitation on the transmittal of the information. It can only be provided within the boundaries of the boycotting country. The bona fide resident may only provide the information to the party that the boycotting country law requires (directly or through an agent or representative within the country) so long as that party is located within the boycotting country. This application of the exception is somewhat easier, since it is relatively simple to determine if the information is to be given to somebody within the country.</p><p class="depth0">Note that in discussing what constitutes furnishing information ``exclusively within'' the boycotting country, the Department does not address the nature of the transaction or activity that the information relates to. It is the Department's position that the nature of the transaction, including the inception or completion of the transaction, is not material in analyzing the availability of this exception.</p><p class="depth0">For example, if a shipment of goods imported into a boycotting country is held up at the time of entry, and information from the bona fide resident within that country is legally required to free those goods, the fact that the information may relate to a transaction that began outside the boycotting country is not material. The availability of the exception will be judged based on the activity of the bona fide resident within the country. If the resident provides that information of his or her own knowledge, and provides it to appropriate parties located exclusively within the country, the exception permits the information to be furnished.</p><p class="depth0">Factual variations may raise questions about the application of this exception and the effect of this interpretation. In an effort to anticipate some of these, the Department has set forth below a number of questions and answers. They are incorporated as a part of this interpretation.</p><p class="depth0">1. Q. Under this exception, can a company which is a U.S. person and a bona fide resident of the boycotting country provide information to the local boycott office?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes, if local law requires the company to provide this information to the boycott office and all the other requirements are met.</p><p class="depth0">2. Q. If the company knows that the local boycott office will forward the information to the Central Boycott Office, may it still provide the information to the local boycott office?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes, if it is required by local law to furnish the information to the local boycott office and all the other requirements are met. The company has no control over what happens to the information after it is provided to the proper authorities. (There is obvious potential for evasion here, and the Department will examine such occurrences closely.)</p><p class="depth0">3. Q. Can a U.S. person who is a bona fide resident of Syria furnish information to the Central Boycott Office in Damascus?</p><p class="depth0">A. No, unless the law in Syria specifically requires information to be provided to the Central Boycott Office the exception will not apply. Syria has a local boycott office responsible for enforcing the boycott in that country.</p><p class="depth0">4. Q. If a company which is a U.S. person and a bona fide resident of the boycotting country has an import shipment held up in customs of the boycotting country, and is required to provide information about the shipment to get it out of customs, may the company do so?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes, assuming all other requirements are met. The act of furnishing the information is the activity taking place exclusively within the boycotting country. The fact that the information is provided corollary to a transaction that originates or terminates outside the boycotting country is not material.</p><p class="depth0">5. Q. If the U.S. person and bona fide resident of the boycotting country is shipping goods out of the boycotting country, and is required to certify to customs officials of the country at the time of export that the goods are not of Israeli origin, may he do so even though the certification relates to an export transaction?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes, assuming all other requirements are met. See number 4 above.

Supplement No. 10 to Part 760--Interpretation</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The words ``Persian Gulf'' cannot appear on the document.</p><p class="depth0">This term is common in letters of credit from Kuwait and may be found in letters of credit from Bahrain. Although more commonly appearing in letters of credit, the term may also appear in other trade documents.</p><p class="depth0">It is the Department's view that this term reflects a historical dispute between the Arabs and the Iranians over geographic place names which in no way relates to existing economic boycotts. Thus, the term is neither prohibited nor reportable under the Regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Certify that goods are of U.S.A. origin and contain no foreign parts.</p><p class="depth0">This term appears periodically on documents from a number of Arab countries. It is the Department's position that the statement is a positive certification of origin and, as such, falls within the exception contained in Sec. 760.3(c) of this part for compliance with the import and shipping document requirements of a boycotting country. Even though a negative phrase is contained within the positive clause, the phrase is a non-exclusionary, non-blacklisting statement. In the Department's view, the additional phrase does not affect the permissible status of the positive certificate, nor does it make the request reportable Sec. 760.5(a)(5)(iii) of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Legalization of documents by any Arab consulate except Egyptian Consulate permitted.</p><p class="depth0">This term appears from time to time in letters of credit but also may appear in various other trade documents requiring legalization and thus is not prohibited, and a request to comply with the statement is not

reportable. Because a number of Arab states do not have formal diplomatic relations with Egypt, they do not recognize Egyptian embassy actions. The absence of diplomatic relations is the reason for the requirement. In the Department's view this does not constitute an unsanctioned foreign boycott or embargo against Egypt under the terms of the Export Administration Act. Thus the term is not prohibited, and a request to comply with the statement is not reportable.

Based on review of numerous situations, the Department has developed certain criteria that it applies in determining if an invitation to bid or other proposal received by a U.S. person is in fact unsolicited.</p><p class="depth0">The invitation is not unsolicited if, during a commercially reasonable period of time preceding the issuance of the invitation, a representative of the U.S. person contacted the company or agency involved for the purpose of promoting business on behalf of the company.</p><p class="depth0">The invitation is not unsolicited if the U.S. person has advertised the product or line of products that are the subject of the invitation in periodicals or publications that ordinarily circulate to the country issuing the invitation during a commercially reasonable period of time preceding the issuance of the invitation.</p><p class="depth0">The invitation is not unsolicited if the U.S. person has sold the same or similar products to the company or agency issuing the invitation within a commercially reasonable period of time before the issuance of the current invitation.</p><p class="depth0">The invitation is not unsolicited if the U.S. person has participated in a trade mission to or trade fair in the country issuing the invitation within a commercially reasonable period of time before the issuance of the invitation.</p><p class="depth0">Under Sec. 760.5(a)(4) of this part, the invitation is regarded as not reportable if the U.S. person receiving it does not respond. The Department has determined that a simple acknowledgment of the invitation does not constitute a response for purposes of this rule. However, an acknowledgment that requests inclusion for future invitations will be considered a response, and a report is required.</p><p class="depth0">Where the person in receipt of an invitation containing a boycott term or condition is undecided about a response by the time a report would be required to be filed under the regulations, it is the Department's view that the person must file a report as called for in the Regulations. The person filing the report may indicate at the time of filing that he has not made a decision on the boycott request but must file a supplemental report as called for in the regulations at the time a decision is made (Sec. 760.5(b)(6)).

The requirement provides that nationals of Saudi Arabia seeking to register in Saudi Arabia as commercial agents or representatives of foreign concerns must furnish certain boycott-related information about the foreign concern prior to obtaining approval of the registration.</p><p class="depth0">The requirement has been imposed by the Ministry of Commerce of Saudi Arabia, which is the government agency responsible for regulation of commercial agents and foreign commercial registrations. The Ministry requires the agent or representative to state the following:</p><p class="depth0">``Declaration: I, the undersigned, hereby declare, in my capacity as (blank) that (name and address of foreign principal) is not presently on the blacklist of the Office for the Boycott of Israel and that it and all its branches, if any, are bound by the decisions

Signed (name of commercial agent/representative/distributor).''</p><p class="depth0">It is the Department's view that under the circumstances specifically outlined in this interpretation relating to the nature of the requirement, a U.S. person will not be held responsible for a violation of this part when such statements are provided by its commercial agent or representative, even when such statements are made with the full knowledge of the U.S. person.</p><p class="depth0">Nature of the requirement. For a boycott-related commercial registration requirement to fall within the coverage of this interpretation it must have the following characteristics:</p><p class="depth0">1. The requirement for information imposed by the boycotting country applies to a national or other subject of the boycotting country qualified under the local laws of that country to function as a commercial representative within that country;</p><p class="depth0">2. The registration requirement relates to the registration of the commercial agent's or representative's authority to sell or distribute goods within the boycotting country acquired from the foreign concern;</p><p class="depth0">3. The requirement is a routine part of the registration process and is not applied selectively based on boycott-related criteria;</p><p class="depth0">4. The requirement applies only to a commercial agent or representative in the boycotting country and does not apply to the foreign concern itself; and</p><p class="depth0">5. The requirement is imposed by the agency of the boycotting country responsible for regulating commercial agencies.</p><p class="depth0">The U.S. person whose agent is complying with the registration requirement continues to be subject to all the terms of the Regulations, and may not provide any prohibited information to the agent for purposes of the agent's compliance with the requirement.</p><p class="depth0">In addition, the authority granted to the commercial agent or representative by the U.S. person must be consistent with standard commercial practices and not involve any grants of authority beyond those incidental to the commercial sales and distributorship responsibilities of the agent.</p><p class="depth0">Because the requirement does not apply to the U.S. person, no reporting obligation under Sec. 760.5 of this part would arise.</p><p class="depth0">This interpretation, like all others issued by the Department discussing applications of the antiboycott provisions of the Export Administration Regulations, should be read narrowly. Circumstances that differ in any material way from those discussed in this notice will be considered under the applicable provisions of the Regulations. Persons are particularly advised not to seek to apply this interpretation to circumstances in which U.S. principals seek to use agents to deal with boycott-related or potential blacklisting situations.

Supplement No. 13 to Part 760--Interpretation</p><p class="depth0">Summary</p><p class="depth0">This interpretation considers boycott-based contractual language dealing with the selection of suppliers and subcontractors. While this language borrows terms from the ``unilateral and specific selection'' exception contained in Sec. 760.3(d), it fails to meet the requirements of that exception. Compliance with the requirements of the language constitutes a violation of the regulatory prohibition of boycott-based refusals to do business.</p><p class="depth0">Regulatory Background</p><p class="depth0">Section 760.2(a) of this part prohibits U.S. persons from refusing or knowingly agreeing to refuse to do business with other persons when such refusal is pursuant to an agreement with, requirement of, or request of a boycotting country. That prohibition does not extend to the performance of management, procurement or other pre-award services, however, notwithstanding knowledge that the ultimate selection may be boycott-based. To be permissible such services: (1) Must be customary for the firm or industry involved and (2) must not exclude others from the transaction or involve other actions based on the boycott. See Sec. 760.2(a)(6) of this part, ``Refusals to Do Business'', and example (xiii).</p><p class="depth0">A specific exception is also made in the Regulations for compliance (and agreements to comply) with a unilateral and specific selection of suppliers or subcontractors by a boycotting country buyer. See Sec. 760.3(d) of this part. In Supplement No. 1 to part 760, the following form of contractual language was said to fall within that exception for compliance with unilateral and specific selection:</p><p class="depth0">``The Government of the boycotting country (or the First Party), in its exclusive power, reserves its right to make the final unilateral and specific selection of any proposed carriers, insurers, suppliers of services to be performed within the boycotting country, or of specific goods to be furnished in accordance with the terms and conditions of this contract.''</p><p class="depth0">The Department noted that the actual steps necessary to comply with any selection made under this agreement would also have to meet the requirements of Sec. 760.3(d) to

claim the benefit of that exception. In other words, the discretion in selecting would have to be exercised exclusively by the boycotting country customer and the selection would have to be stated in the affirmative, naming a particular supplier. See Sec. 760.3(d) (4) and (5) of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Analysis of Additional Contractual Language</p><p class="depth0">The Office of Antiboycott Compliance has learned of the introduction of a contractual clause into tender documents issued by boycotting country governments. This clause is, in many respects, similar to that dealt with in Supplement No. 1 to part 760, but several critical differences exist.</p><p class="depth0">The clause states:</p><p class="depth0">Boycott of [Name of Boycotted Country]</p><p class="depth0">In connection with the performance of this Agreement, Contractor acknowledges that the import and customs laws and regulations of boycotting country apply to the furnishing and shipment of any products or components thereof to boycotting country. The Contractor specifically acknowledges that the aforementioned import and customs laws and regulations of boycotting country prohibit, among other things, the importation into boycotting country of products or components thereof: (A) Originating in boycotted country; (B) Manufactured, produced and furnish by companies organized under the laws of boycotted country; and (C) Manufactured, produced or furnished by Nationals or Residents of boycotted country.</p><p class="depth0">The Government, in its exclusive power, reserves its right to make the final unilateral and specific selection of any proposed Carriers, Insurers, Suppliers of Services to be performed within boycotting country or of specific goods to be furnished in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Contract.</p><p class="depth0">To assist the Government in exercising its right under the preceding paragraph, Contractor further agrees to provide a complete list of names and addresses of all his Sub-Contractors, Suppliers, Vendors and Consultants and any other suppliers of the service for the project.</p><p class="depth0">The title of this clause makes clear that its provisions are intended to be boycott-related. The first paragraph acknowledges the applicability of certain boycott-related requirements of the boycotting country's laws in language reviewed in part 760, Supplement No. 1, Part II.B. and found to constitute a permissible agreement under the exception contained in Sec. 760.3(a) of this part for compliance with the import requirements of a boycotting country. The second and third paragraphs together deal with the procedure for selecting subcontractors and suppliers of services and goods and, in the context of the clause as a whole, must be regarded as motivated by boycott considerations and intended to enable the boycotting country government to make boycott-based selections, including the elimination of blacklisted subcontractors and suppliers.</p><p class="depth0">The question is whether the incorporation into these paragraphs of some language from the ``unilateral and specific selection'' clause approved in Supplement No. 1 to part 760 suffices to take the language outside Sec. 760.2(a) of this part's prohibition on boycott-based agreements to refuse to do business. While the first sentence of this clause is consistent with the language discussed in Supplement No. 1 to part 760, the second sentence significantly alters the effect of this clause. The effect is to draw the contractor into the decision-making process, thereby destroying the unilateral character of the selection by the buyer. By agreeing to submit the names of the suppliers it plans to use, the contractor is agreeing to give the boycotting country buyer, who has retained the right of final selection, the ability to reject, for boycott-related reasons, any supplier the contractor has already chosen. Because the requirement appears in the contractual provision dealing with the boycott, the buyer's rejection of any supplier whose name is given to the buyer pursuant to this provision would be presumed to be boycott-based. By signing the contract, and thereby agreeing to comply with all of its provisions, the contractor must either accept the buyer's rejection of any supplier, which is presumed to be boycott-based because of the context of this provision, or breach the contract.</p><p class="depth0">In these circumstances, the contractor's method of choosing its subcontractors and suppliers, in anticipation of the buyer's boycott-based review, cannot be considered a permissible pre-award service because of the presumed intrusion of boycott-based criteria into the selection process. Thus, assuming all other jurisdictional requirements necessary to establish a violation of part 760 are met, the signing of the contract by the contractor constitutes a violation of Sec. 760.2(a) of this part because he is agreeing to refuse to do business for boycott reasons.</p><p class="depth0">The apparent attempt to bring this language within the exception for compliance with unilateral and specific selections is ineffective. The language does not place the discretion to choose suppliers in the hands of the boycotting country buyer but divides this discretion between the buyer and his principal contractor. Knowing that the buyer will not accept a boycotted company as supplier or subcontractor, the contractor is asked to use his discretion in selecting a single supplier or subcontractor for each element of the contract. The boycotting country buyer exercises discretion only through accepting or rejecting the selected supplier or contractor as its boycott policies require.

In these circumstances it cannot be said that the buyer is exercising right of unilateral and specific selection which meets the criteria of Sec. 760.3(d). For this reason, agreement to the contractual language discussed here would constitute an agreement to refuse to do business with any person rejected by the buyer and would violate Sec. 760.2(a) of this part.
[61 FR 12862, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 65 FR 34950, June 1, 2000]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Supplement No. 14 to Part 760--Interpretation</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Contractual clause concerning import, customs and boycott laws of a boycotting country. The following language has appeared in tender documents issued by a boycotting country:</p><p class="depth0">``Supplier declares his knowledge of the fact that the import, Customs and boycott laws, rules and regulations of [name of boycotting country] apply in importing to [name of boycotting country].''</p><p class="depth0">``Supplier declares his knowledge of the fact that under these laws, rules and regulations, it is prohibited to import into [name of the boycotting country] any products or parts thereof that originated in [name of boycotted country]; were manufactured, produced or imported by companies formed under the laws of [name of boycotted country]; or were manufactured, produced or imported by nationals or residents of [name of boycotted country].''</p><p class="depth0">Agreeing to the above contractual language is a prohibited agreement to refuse to do business, under Sec. 760.2(a) of this part. The first paragraph requires broad acknowledgment of the application of the boycotting country's boycott laws, rules and regulations. Unless this language is qualified to apply only to boycott restrictions with which U.S. persons may comply, agreement to it is prohibited. See Sec. 760.2(a) of this part, examples (v) and (vi) under ``Agreements to Refuse to Do Business.''</p><p class="depth0">The second paragraph does not limit the scope of the boycott restrictions referenced in the first paragraph. It states that the boycott laws include restrictions on goods originating in the boycotted country; manufactured, produced or supplied by companies organized under the laws of the boycotted country; or manufactured, produced or supplied by nationals or residents of the boycotted country. Each of these restrictions is within the exception for compliance with the import requirements of the boycotting country (Sec. 760.3(a) of this part). However, the second paragraph's list of restrictions is not exclusive. Since the boycott laws generally include more than what is listed and permissible under the antiboycott law, U.S. persons may not agree to the quoted clause. For example, a country's boycott laws may prohibit imports of goods manufactured by blacklisted firms. Except as provided by Sec. 760.3(g) of this part, agreement to and compliance with this boycott restriction would be prohibited under the antiboycott law.</p><p class="depth0">The above contractual language is distinguished from the contract clause determined to be permissible in supplement 1, Part II, A, by its acknowledgment that the boycott requirements of the boycotting country apply. Although the first sentence of the Supplement 1 clause does not exclude the possible application of boycott laws, it refers only to the import and customs laws of the boycotting country without mentioning the boycott laws as well. As discussed fully in Supplement No. 1 to part 760, compliance with or agreement to the clause quoted there is, therefore, permissible.</p><p class="depth0">The contract clause quoted above, as well as the clause dealt with in Supplement No. 1 to part 760, part II, A, is reportable under Sec. 760.5(a)(1) of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Letter of credit terms removing blacklist certificate requirement if specified vessels used. The following terms frequently appear on letters of credit covering shipment to Iraq:</p><p class="depth0">``Shipment to be effected by Iraqi State Enterprise for Maritime Transport Vessels or by United Arab Shipping Company (SAB) vessels, if available.''</p><p class="depth0">``If shipment is effected by any of the above company's [sic] vessels, black list certificate or evidence to that effect is not required.''</p><p class="depth0">These terms are not reportable and compliance with them is permissible.</p><p class="depth0">The first sentence, a directive to use Iraqi State Enterprise for Maritime Transport or United Arab Shipping vessels, is neither reportable nor prohibited because it is not considered by the Department to be boycott-related. The apparent reason for the directive is Iraq's preference to have cargo shipped on its own vessels (or, as in the case of United Arab Shipping, on vessels owned by a company in part established and owned by the Iraqi government). Such ``cargo preference'' requirements, calling for the use of an importing or exporting country's own ships, are common throughout the world and are imposed for non-boycott reasons. (See Sec. 760.2(a) of this part, example (vii) AGREEMENTS TO REFUSE TO DO BUSINESS.)</p><p class="depth0">In contrast, if the letter of credit contains a list of vessels or carriers that appears to constitute a boycott-related whitelist, a directive to select a vessel from that list would be both reportable and prohibited. When such a directive appears in conjunction with a term removing the blacklist certificate requirement if these vessels are used, the Department will presume that beneficiaries, banks and any other U.S. person receiving the letter of credit know that there is a boycott-related purpose for the directive.</p><p class="depth0">The second sentence of the letter of credit language quoted above does not, by itself, call for a blacklist certificate and is not therefore, reportable. If a term elsewhere on the letter of credit imposes a blacklist certificate requirement, then that other term would be reportable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Information not related to a particular transaction in U.S. commerce. Under Sec. 760.2 (c), (d) and (e), of this part U.S. persons are prohibited, with respect to their activities in U.S. commerce, from furnishing certain information. It is the Department's position that the required nexus with U.S. commerce is established when the furnishing of information itself occurs in U.S. commerce. Even when the furnishing of information is not itself in U.S. commerce, however, the necessary relationship to U.S. commerce will be established if the furnishing of information relates to particular transactions in U.S. commerce or to anticipated transactions in U.S. commerce. See, e.g. Sec. 760.2(d), examples (vii), (ix) and (xii) of this part.</p><p class="depth0">The simplest situation occurs where a U.S. person located in the United States furnishes information to a boycotting country. The transfer of information from the United States to a foreign country is itself an activity in U.S. commerce. See Sec. 760.1(d)(1)(iv) of this part. In some circumstances, the furnishing of information by a U.S. person located outside the United States may also be an activity in U.S. commerce. For example, the controlled foreign subsidiary of a domestic concern might furnish to a boycotting country information the subsidiary obtained from the U.S.-located parent for that purpose. The subsidiary's furnishing would, in these circumstances, constitute an activity in U.S. commerce. See Sec. 760.1(d)(8) of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Where the furnishing of information is not itself in U.S. commerce, the U.S. commerce requirement may be satisfied by the fact that the furnishing is related to an activity in U.S. foreign or domestic commerce. For example, if a shipment of goods by a controlled-in-fact foreign subsidiary of a U.S. company to a boycotting country gives rise to an inquiry from the boycotting country concerning the subsidiary's relationship with another firm, the Department regards any responsive furnishing of information by the subsidiary as related to the shipment giving rise to the inquiry. If the shipment is in U.S. foreign or domestic commerce, as defined by the regulations, then the Department regards the furnishing to be related to an activity in U.S. commerce and subject to the antiboycott regulations, whether or not the furnishing itself is in U.S. commerce.</p><p class="depth0">In some circumstances, the Department may regard a furnishing of information as related to a broader category of present and prospective transactions. For example, if a controlled-in-fact foreign subsidiary of a U.S. company is requested to furnish information about its commercial dealings and it appears that failure to respond will result in its blacklisting, any responsive furnishing of information will be regarded by the Department as relating to all of the subsidiary's present and anticipated business activities with the inquiring boycotting country. Accordingly, if any of these present or anticipated business activities are in U.S. commerce, the Department will regard the furnishing as related to an activity in U.S. commerce and subject to the antiboycott regulations.</p><p class="depth0">In deciding whether anticipated business activities will be in U.S. commerce, the Department will consider all of the surrounding circumstances. Particular attention will be given to the history of the U.S. person's business activities with the boycotting country and others, the nature of any activities occurring after a furnishing of information occurs and any relevant economic or commercial factors which may affect these activities.</p><p class="depth0">For example, if a U.S. person has no activities with the boycotting country at present but all of its other international activities are in U.S. commerce, as defined by the Regulations, then the Department is likely to regard any furnishing of information by that person for the purpose of securing entry into the boycotting country's market as relating to anticipated activities in U.S. commerce and subject to the antiboycott regulations. Similarly, if subsequent to the furnishing of information to the boycotting country for the purpose of securing entry into its markets, the U.S. person engages in transactions with that country which are in U.S. commerce, the Department is likely to regard the furnishing as related to an activity in U.S. commerce and subject to the antiboycott regulations.
[61 FR 12862, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 65 FR 34950, June 1, 2000]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Supplement No. 15 to Part 760--Interpretation</p><p class="depth0">Section 760.2 (c), (d), and (e) of this part prohibits United States persons from furnishing certain types of information with intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott against a country friendly to the United States. The Department has been asked whether prohibited information may be transmitted--that is, passed to others by a United States person who has not directly or indirectly authored the information--without such transmission constituting a furnishing of information in violation of Sec. 760.2 (c), (d), and (e) of this part. Throughout this interpretation, ``transmission'' is defined as the passing on

by one person of information initially authored by another. The Department believes that there is no distinction in the EAR between transmitting (as defined above) and furnishing prohibited information under the EAR and that the transmission of prohibited information with the requisite boycott intent is a furnishing of information violative of the EAR. At the same time, however, the circumstances relating to the transmitting party's involvement will be carefully considered in determining whether that party intended to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott.</p><p class="depth0">The EAR does not deal specifically with the relationship between transmitting and furnishing. However, the restrictions in the EAR on responses to boycott-related conditions, both by direct and indirect actions and whether by primary parties or intermediaries, indicate that U.S. persons who simply transmit prohibited information are to be treated the same under the EAR as those who both author and furnish prohibited information. This has been the Department's position in enforcement actions it has brought.</p><p class="depth0">The few references in the EAR to the transmission of information by third parties are consistent with this position. Two examples, both relating to the prohibition against the furnishing of information about U.S. persons' race, religion, sex, or national origin (Sec. 760.2(c) of this part), deal explicitly with transmitting information. These examples (Sec. 760.2(c) of this part, example (v), and Sec. 760.3(f) of this part, example (vi)) show that, in certain cases, when furnishing certain information is permissible, either because it is not within a prohibition or is excepted from a prohibition, transmitting it is also permissible. These examples concern information that may be furnished by individuals about themselves or their families. The examples show that employers may transmit to a boycotting country visa applications or forms containing information about an employee's race, religion, sex, or national origin if that employee is the source of the information and authorizes its transmission. In other words, within the limits of ministerial action set forth in these examples, employees' actions in transmitting information are protected by the exception available to the employee. The distinction between permissible and prohibited behavior rests not on the definitional distinction between furnishing and transmitting, but on the excepted nature of the information furnished by the employee. The information originating from the employee does not lose its excepted character because it is transmitted by the employer.</p><p class="depth0">The Department's position regarding the furnishing and transmission of certificates of one's own blacklist status rests on a similar basis and does not support the contention that third parties may transmit prohibited information authored by another. Such self-certifications do not violate any prohibitions in the EAR (see Supplement Nos. 1(I)(B), 2, and 5(A)(2); Sec. 760.2(f), example (xiv)). It is the Department's position that it is not prohibited for U.S. persons to transmit such self-certifications completed by others. Once again, because furnishing the self-certification is not prohibited, third parties who transmit the self-certifications offend no prohibition. On the other hand, if a third party authored information about another's blacklist status, the act of transmitting that information would be prohibited.</p><p class="depth0">A third example in the EAR (Sec. 760.5, example (xiv) of this part), which also concerns a permissible transmission of boycott-related information, does not support the theory that one may transmit prohibited information authored by another. This example deals with the reporting requirements in Sec. 760.5 of this part--not the prohibitions--and merely illustrates that a person who receives and transmits a self-certification has not received a reportable request.</p><p class="depth0">It is also the Department's position that a U.S. person violates the prohibitions against furnishing information by transmitting prohibited information even if that person has received no reportable request in the transaction. For example, where documents accompanying a letter of credit contain prohibited information, a negotiating bank that transmits the documents, with the requisite boycott intent, to an issuing bank has not received a reportable request, but has furnished prohibited information.</p><p class="depth0">While the Department does not regard the suggested distinction between transmitting and furnishing information as meaningful, the facts relating to the third party's involvement may be important in determining whether that party furnished information with the required intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott. For example, if it is a standard business practice for one participant in a transaction to obtain and pass on, without examination, documents prepared by another party, it might be difficult to maintain that the first participant intended to comply with a boycott by passing on information contained in the unexamined documents. Resolution of such intent questions, however, depends upon an analysis of the individual facts and circumstances of the transaction and the Department will continue to engage in such analysis on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth0">This interpretation, like all others issued by the Department discussing applications of the antiboycott provisions of the EAR, should be read narrowly. Circumstances that differ in any material way from those discussed in this interpretation will be considered under the applicable provisions of the Regulations.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Supplement No. 16 to Part 760--Interpretation</p><p class="depth0">Pursuant to Articles 5, 7, and 26 of the Treaty of Peace between the State of Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and implementing legislation enacted by Jordan, Jordan's participation in the Arab economic boycott of Israel was formally terminated on August 16, 1995.</p><p class="depth0">On the basis of this action, it is the Department's position that certain requests for information, action or agreement from Jordan which were considered boycott-related by implication now cannot be presumed boycott-related and thus would not be prohibited or reportable under the regulations. For example, a request that an exporter certify that the vessel on which it is shipping its goods is eligible to enter Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan ports has been considered a boycott-related request that the exporter could not comply with because Jordan has had a boycott in force against Israel. Such a request from Jordan after August 16, 1995 would not be presumed boycott-related because the underlying boycott requirement/basis for the certification has been eliminated. Similarly, a U.S. company would not be prohibited from complying with a request received from Jordanian government officials to furnish the place of birth of employees the company is seeking to take to Jordan because there is no underlying boycott law or policy that would give rise to a presumption that the request was boycott-related.</p><p class="depth0">U.S. persons are reminded that requests that are on their face boycott-related or that are for action obviously in furtherance or support of an unsanctioned foreign boycott are subject to the regulations, irrespective of the country of origin. For example, requests containing references to ``blacklisted companies'', ``Israel boycott list'', ``non-Israeli goods'' or other phrases or words indicating boycott purpose would be subject to the appropriate provisions of the Department's antiboycott regulations.</p>
