                                Sec.  250.1302  What if I have a competitive reservoir on a lease?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Regional Supervisor may require you to conduct development and production operations in a competitive reservoir under either a joint Development and Production Plan, submitted to BOEM or a unitization agreement. A competitive reservoir has one or more producing or producible well completions on each of two or more leases, or portions of leases, with different lease operating interests. For purposes of this paragraph, a producible well completion is a well which is capable of production and which is shut in at the

well head or at the surface but not necessarily connected to production facilities and from which the operator plans future production.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You may request that the Regional Supervisor make a preliminary determination whether a reservoir is competitive. When you receive the preliminary determination, you have 30 days (or longer if the Regional Supervisor allows additional time) to concur or to submit an objection with supporting evidence if you do not concur. The Regional Supervisor will make a final determination and notify you and the other lessees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you conduct drilling or production operations in a reservoir determined competitive by the Regional Supervisor, you and the other affected lessees must submit for approval a joint plan of operations. You must submit the joint plan within 90 days after the Regional Supervisor makes a final determination that the reservoir is competitive. The joint plan must provide for the development and/or production of the reservoir. You may submit supplemental plans for the Regional Supervisor's approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If you and the other affected lessees cannot reach an agreement on a joint Development and Production Plan, submitted to BOEM within the approved period of time, each lessee must submit a separate plan to the Regional Supervisor. The Regional Supervisor will hold a hearing to resolve differences in the separate plans. If the differences in the separate plans are not resolved at the hearing and the Regional Supervisor determines that unitization is necessary under Sec.  250.1301(b), BSEE will initiate unitization under Sec.  250.1304.</p>
