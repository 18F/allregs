                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The provisions of this section apply for calculating exhaust  emission credits. You may generate exhaust emission credits only if you  are a certifying engine manufacturer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For each participating family, calculate positive or negative  emission credits relative to the otherwise applicable emission standard.  Calculate positive emission credits for a family that has an FEL below  the standard. Calculate negative emission credits for a family that has  an FEL above the standard. Sum your positive and negative credits for  the model year before rounding. Round the sum of emission credits to the  nearest kilogram (kg) using consistent units throughout the following  equation:  Emission credits (kg) = (STD - FEL) x (Volume) x (Power) x (UL) x (LF) x  (10-3)  Where:  STD = the emission standard, in g/kW-hr. FEL = the family emission limit for the family, in g/kW-hr. Volume = the number of engines eligible to participate in the averaging,</p><p class="depth2">banking, and trading program within the given family during</p><p class="depth2">the model year, as described in Sec.  1054.701(i). Power = the maximum modal power of the emission-data engine as</p><p class="depth2">calculated from the applicable test procedure described in</p><p class="depth2">subpart F of this part, in kilowatts. UL = the useful life for the given family, in hours. LF = load factor. Use 0.47 for nonhandheld engines and 0.85 for handheld</p><p class="depth2">engines. We may specify a different load factor if we approve</p><p class="depth2">the use of special test procedures for a family under 40 CFR</p><p class="depth2">1065.10(c)(2), consistent with good engineering judgment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p>
