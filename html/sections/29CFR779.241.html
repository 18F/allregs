                            <p class="depth0">The statutory definition of the term ``sale'' or ``sell'' is quoted  in Sec. 779.15. As long as the employee in any way participates in the  sale of the goods he will be considered to be ``selling'' the goods,  whether he physically handles them or not. Thus, if the employee  performs any work that, in a practical sense is an essential part of  consummating the ``sale'' of the particular goods, he will be considered  to be ``selling'' the goods. ``Selling'' goods, under section 3(s) has  reference only to goods which ``have been moved in or produced for  commerce by any person,'' as discussed in Sec. Sec. 779.242 and  779.243.</p>
