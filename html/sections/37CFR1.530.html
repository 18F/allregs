                                Sec.  1.530  Statement by patent owner in ex parte reexamination; inventorship change in ex parte or inter partes reexamination.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in Sec.  1.510(e), no statement or other response by the patent owner in an ex parte reexamination proceeding shall be filed prior to the determinations made in accordance with Sec.  1.515 or Sec.  1.520. If a premature statement or other response is filed by the patent owner, it will not be acknowledged or considered in making the determination, and it will be returned or discarded (at the Office's option).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The order for ex parte reexamination will set a period of not less than two months from the date of the order within which the patent owner may file a statement on the new question of patentability, including any proposed amendments the patent owner wishes to make.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any statement filed by the patent owner shall clearly point out why the subject matter as claimed is not anticipated or rendered obvious by the prior art patents or printed publications, either alone or in any reasonable combinations. Where the reexamination request was filed by a third party requester, any statement filed by the patent owner must be served upon the ex parte reexamination requester in accordance with Sec.  1.248.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Making amendments in a reexamination proceeding. A proposed amendment in an ex parte or an inter partes reexamination proceeding is made by filing a paper directing that proposed specified changes be made to the patent specification, including the claims, or to the drawings. An amendment paper directing that proposed specified changes be made in a reexamination proceeding may be submitted as an accompaniment to a request filed by the patent owner in accordance with Sec.  1.510(e), as part of a patent owner statement in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, or, where permitted, during the prosecution of the reexamination proceeding pursuant to Sec.  1.550(a) or Sec.  1.937.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Specification other than the claims. Changes to the specification, other than to the claims, must be made by submission of the entire text of an added or rewritten paragraph including markings pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, except that an entire paragraph may be deleted by a statement deleting the paragraph, without presentation of the text of the paragraph. The precise point in the specification must be identified where any added or rewritten paragraph is located. This paragraph applies whether the amendment is submitted on paper or compact disc (see Sec. Sec.  1.96 and 1.825).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Claims. An amendment paper must include the entire text of each patent claim which is being proposed to be changed by such amendment paper and of each new claim being proposed to be added by such amendment paper. For any claim changed by the amendment paper, a parenthetical expression ``amended,'' ``twice amended,'' etc., should follow the claim number. Each patent claim proposed to be changed and each proposed added claim must

include markings pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, except that a patent claim or proposed added claim should be canceled by a statement canceling the claim, without presentation of the text of the claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Drawings. Any change to the patent drawings must be submitted as a sketch on a separate paper showing the proposed changes in red for approval by the examiner. Upon approval of the changes by the examiner, only new sheets of drawings including the changes and in compliance with Sec.  1.84 must be filed. Amended figures must be identified as ``Amended,'' and any added figure must be identified as ``New.'' In the event a figure is canceled, the figure must be surrounded by brackets and identified as ``Canceled.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The formal requirements for papers making up the reexamination proceeding other than those set forth in this section are set out in Sec.  1.52.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Status of claims and support for claim changes. Whenever there is an amendment to the claims pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, there must also be supplied, on pages separate from the pages containing the changes, the status (i.e., pending or canceled), as of the date of the amendment, of all patent claims and of all added claims, and an explanation of the support in the disclosure of the patent for the changes to the claims made by the amendment paper.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Changes shown by markings. Any changes relative to the patent being reexamined which are made to the specification, including the claims, must include the following markings:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The matter to be omitted by the reexamination proceeding must be enclosed in brackets; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The matter to be added by the reexamination proceeding must be underlined.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Numbering of patent claims preserved. Patent claims may not be renumbered. The numbering of any claims added in the reexamination proceeding must follow the number of the highest numbered patent claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Amendment of disclosure may be required. The disclosure must be amended, when required by the Office, to correct inaccuracies of description and definition, and to secure substantial correspondence between the claims, the remainder of the specification, and the drawings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Amendments made relative to patent. All amendments must be made relative to the patent specification, including the claims, and drawings, which are in effect as of the date of filing the request for reexamination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> No enlargement of claim scope. No amendment may enlarge the scope of the claims of the patent or introduce new matter. No amendment may be proposed for entry in an expired patent. Moreover, no amendment, other than the cancellation of claims, will be incorporated into the patent by a certificate issued after the expiration of the patent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Amendments not effective until certificate. Although the Office actions will treat proposed amendments as though they have been entered, the proposed amendments will not be effective until the reexamination certificate is issued and published.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Correction of inventorship in an ex parte or inter partes reexamination proceeding.  (1) When it appears in a patent being reexamined that the correct inventor or inventors were not named, the Director may, on petition of all the parties set forth in Sec.  1.324(b)(1) and (b)(2), including the assignees, and satisfactory proof of the facts and payment of the fee set forth in Sec.  1.20(b), or on order of a court before which such matter is called in question, include in the reexamination certificate to be issued under Sec.  1.570 or Sec.  1.997 an amendment naming only the actual inventor or inventors. The petition must be submitted as part of the reexamination proceeding and must satisfy the requirements of Sec.  1.324.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When it appears in a patent being reexamined that the correct inventor or inventors were not named, the Director may, on petition of all the parties set forth in Sec.  1.324(b)(1) and (b)(2), including the assignees, and satisfactory proof of the facts and payment of the fee set forth in Sec.  1.20(b), or on order of a court before which such matter is called in question, include in the reexamination certificate to be issued under Sec.  1.570 or Sec.  1.997 an amendment naming only the actual inventor or inventors. The petition must be submitted as part of the reexamination proceeding and must satisfy the requirements of Sec.  1.324.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (l)(1) of this section, if a petition to correct inventorship satisfying the requirements of Sec.  1.324 is filed in a reexamination proceeding, and the reexamination proceeding is concluded other than by a reexamination certificate under Sec.  1.570 or Sec.  1.997, a certificate of correction indicating the change of

inventorship stated in the petition will be issued upon request by the patentee.
