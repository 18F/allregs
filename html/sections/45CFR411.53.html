The care provider facility must maintain  copies of its agreements or documentation showing attempts to enter into  such agreements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Care provider facilities must have written policies and  procedures to include outside agencies in the care provider facility's  sexual abuse and sexual harassment prevention and intervention  protocols, if such resources are available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Care provider facilities must make available to UC information  about local organizations that can assist UCs who are victims of sexual  abuse and sexual harassment, including mailing addresses and telephone  numbers (including toll-free hotline numbers where available). If no  such local organizations exist, the care provider facility must make  available the same information about national organizations. The care  provider facility must enable reasonable communication between UCs and  these organizations and agencies in a confidential manner and inform  UCs, prior to giving them access, of the extent to which such  communications will be confidential.</p>
