                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Participation by subcontractors, suppliers, and vendors. In  order to broaden the defense industrial base, to the maximum extent  practicable--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Multiyear contracting shall be used in such a manner as to seek,  retain, and promote the use under such contracts of companies that are  subcontractors, suppliers, and vendors; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Upon accrual of any payment or other benefit under such a  multiyear contract to any subcontractor, supplier, or vendor company  participating in such contract, such payment or benefit shall be  delivered to such company in the most expeditious manner practicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Protection of existing authority. To the extent practicable,  multiyear contracting shall not be carried out in a manner to preclude  or curtail the existing ability of the Department or agency to provide  for termination of a prime contract, the performance of which is  deficient with respect to cost, quality, or schedule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cancellation or termination for insufficient funding. In the  event funds are not made available for the continuation of a multiyear  contract awarded using the procedures in this section, the contract  shall be canceled or terminated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Contracts awarded under the multiyear procedure shall be firm- fixed-price, fixed-price with economic price adjustment, or fixed-price  incentive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Recurring costs in cancellation ceiling. The inclusion of  recurring costs in cancellation ceilings is an exception to normal  contract financing arrangements and requires approval by the agency  head.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Annual and multiyear proposals. Obtaining both annual and  multiyear offers provides reduced lead time for making an annual award  in the event that the multiyear award is not in the Government's  interest. Obtaining both also provides a basis for the computation of  savings and other benefits. However, the preparation and evaluation of  dual offers may increase administrative costs and workload for both  offerors and the Government, especially for large or complex  acquisitions. The head of a contracting activity may authorize the use  of a solicitation requesting only multiyear prices, provided it is found  that such a solicitation is in the Government's interest, and that dual  proposals are not necessary to meet the objectives in 17.105-2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Level unit prices. Multiyear contract procedures provide for the  amortization of certain costs over the entire contract quantity  resulting in identical (level) unit prices (except when the economic  price adjustment terms apply) for all items or services under the  multiyear contract. If level unit pricing is not in the Government's  interest, the head of a contracting activity may approve the use of  variable unit prices, provided that for competitive proposals there is a  valid method of evaluation.</p>
