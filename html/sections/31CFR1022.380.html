                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Registration requirement--(1) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, relating to agents, and except for sellers of prepaid access as defined in Sec. 1010.100(ff)(7) of this chapter to the extent that they are not already agents, each money services business (whether or not licensed as a money services business by any State) must register with FinCEN. Each provider of prepaid access must identify each prepaid program for which it is the provider of prepaid access. Each money services business must, as part of its registration, maintain a list of its agents as required by 31 U.S.C. 5330 and this section. This section does not apply to the United States Postal Service, to agencies of the United States, of any State, or of any political subdivision of a State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general.

This section does not apply to the United States Postal Service, to agencies of the United States, of any State, or of any political subdivision of a State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Foreign-located money services business. Each foreign-located person doing business, whether or not on a regular basis or as an organized or licensed business concern, in the United States as a money services business shall designate the name and address of a person who resides in the United States and is authorized, and has agreed, to be an agent to accept service of legal process with respect to compliance with this chapter, and shall identify the address of the location within the United States for records pertaining to paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Agents. A person that is a money services business solely because that person serves as an agent of another money services business, see Sec. 1010.100(ff) of this chapter, is not required to register under this section, but a money services business that engages in activities described in Sec. 1010.100(ff) of this chapter both on its own behalf and as an agent for others must register under this section. For example, a supermarket corporation that acts as an agent for an issuer of money orders and performs no other services of a nature and value that would cause the corporation to be a money services business, is not required to register; the answer would be the same if the supermarket corporation served as an agent both of a money order issuer and of a money transmitter. However, registration would be required if the supermarket corporation, in addition to acting as an agent of an issuer of money orders, cashed checks or exchanged currencies (other than as an agent for another business) in an amount greater than $1,000 in currency or monetary or other instruments for any person on any day, in one or more transactions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Agency status. The determination whether a person is an agent depends on all the facts and circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Registration procedures--(1) In general. (i) A money services business must be registered by filing such form as FinCEN may specify with the Enterprise Computing Center in Detroit of the Internal Revenue Service (or such other location as the form may specify). The information required by 31

U.S.C. 5330(b) and any other information required by the form must be reported in the manner and to the extent required by the form.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. (i) A money services business must be registered by filing such form as FinCEN may specify with the Enterprise Computing Center in Detroit of the Internal Revenue Service (or such other location as the form may specify). The information required by 31

U.S.C. 5330(b) and any other information required by the form must be reported in the manner and to the extent required by the form.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A money services business must be registered by filing such form as FinCEN may specify with the Enterprise Computing Center in Detroit of the Internal Revenue Service (or such other location as the form may specify). The information required by 31

U.S.C. 5330(b) and any other information required by the form must be reported in the manner and to the extent required by the form.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A branch office of a money services business is not required to file its own registration form. A money services business must, however, report information about its branch locations or offices as provided by the instructions to the registration form.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A money services business must retain a copy of any registration form filed under this section and any registration number that may be assigned to the business at a location in the United States and for the period specified in Sec. 1010.430(d) of this Chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Registration period. A money services business must be registered for the initial registration period and each renewal period. The initial registration period is the two-calendar-year period beginning with the calendar year in which the money services business is first required to be registered. However, the initial registration period for a money services business required to register by December 31, 2001 (see paragraph (b)(3) of this section) is the two-calendar year period beginning 2002. Each two-calendar-year period following the initial registration period is a renewal period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Due date. The registration form for the initial registration period must be filed on or before the end of the 180-day period beginning on the day following the date the business is established. The registration form for a renewal period must be filed on or before the last day of the calendar year preceding the renewal period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Events requiring re-registration. If a money services business registered as such under the laws of any State experiences a change in ownership or control that requires the business to be re-registered under State law, the money services business must also be re-registered under this section. In addition, if there is a transfer of more than 10 percent of the voting power or equity interests of a money services business (other than a money services business that must report such transfer to the Securities and Exchange Commission), the money services business must be re-registered under this section. Finally, if a money services business experiences a more than 50-per cent increase in the number of its agents during any registration period, the money services business must be re-registered under this section. The registration form must be filed not later than 180 days after such change in ownership, transfer of voting power or equity interests, or increase in agents. The calendar year in which the change, transfer, or increase occurs is treated as the first year of a new two-year registration period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Persons required to file the registration form. Under 31 U.S.C. 5330(a), any person who owns or controls a money services business is responsible for registering the business; however, only one registration form is required to be filed for each registration period. A person is treated as owning or controlling a money services business for purposes of filing the registration form only to the extent provided by the form. If more than one person owns or controls a money services business, the owning or controlling persons may enter into an agreement designating one of them to register the business. The failure of the designated person to register the money services business does not, however, relieve any of the other persons who own or control the business of liability for the failure to register the business. See paragraph (e) of this section, relating to consequences of the failure to comply with 31 U.S.C. 5330 or this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> List of agents--(1) In general. A money services business must prepare and maintain a list of its agents. The initial list of agents must be prepared by January 1, 2002, and must be revised each January 1, for the immediately preceding 12 month period; for money services businesses established after December 31, 2001, the initial agent list must be prepared by the due date of the initial registration form and must be revised each January 1 for the immediately preceding 12-month period. The list is not filed with the registration form but must be maintained at the location in the United States reported on the registration form under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Upon request, a money services business must make its list of agents available to FinCEN and

any other appropriate law enforcement agency (including, without limitation, the examination function of the Internal Revenue Service in its capacity as delegee of Bank Secrecy Act examination authority). Requests for information made pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be coordinated through FinCEN in the manner and to the extent determined by FinCEN. The original list of agents and any revised list must be retained for the period specified in Sec. 1010.430(d) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general.

Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, a money services business must include the following information with respect to each agent on the list (including any revised list) of its agents--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, a money services business must include the following information with respect to each agent on the list (including any revised list) of its agents--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The name of the agent, including any trade names or doing-business-as names;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The address of the agent, including street address, city, state, and ZIP code;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The telephone number of the agent;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The type of service or services (money orders, traveler's checks, check sales, check cashing, currency exchange, and money transmitting) the agent provides;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> A listing of the months in the 12 months immediately preceding the date of the most recent agent list in which the gross transaction amount of the agent with respect to financial products or services issued by the money services business maintaining the agent list exceeded $100,000. For this purpose, the money services gross transaction amount is the agent's gross amount (excluding fees and commissions) received from transactions of one or more businesses described in Sec. 1010.100(ff) of this chapter;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> The name and address of any depository institution at which the agent maintains a transaction account (as defined in 12 U.S.C. 461(b)(1)(C)) for all or part of the funds received in or for the financial products or services issued by the money services business maintaining the list, whether in the agent's or the business principal's name;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> The year in which the agent first became an agent of the money services business; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> The number of branches or subagents the agent has.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Special rules. Information about agent volume must be current within 45 days of the due date of the agent list. The information described by paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(G) and (d)(2)(i)(H) of this section is not required to be included in an agent list with respect to any person that is an agent of the money services business maintaining the list before the first day of the month beginning after February 16, 2000 so long as the information described by paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(G) and (d)(2)(i)(H) of this section is made available upon the request of FinCEN and any other appropriate law enforcement agency (including, without limitation, the examination function of the Internal Revenue Service in its capacity as delegee of Bank Secrecy Act examination authority).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Consequences of failing to comply with 31 U.S.C. 5330 or the regulations thereunder. It is unlawful to do business without complying with 31 U.S.C. 5330 and this section. A failure to comply with the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 5330 or this section includes the filing of false or materially incomplete information in connection with the registration of a money services business. Any person who fails to comply with any requirement of 31 U.S.C. 5330 or this section shall be liable for a civil penalty of $5,000 for each violation. Each day a violation of 31 U.S.C. 5330 or this section continues constitutes a separate violation. In addition, under 31 U.S.C. 5320, the Secretary of the Treasury may bring a civil action to enjoin the violation. See 18 U.S.C. 1960 for a criminal penalty for failure to comply with the registration requirements of 31 U.S.C. 5330 or this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Applicability date. This section is applicable as of September 20, 1999. Registration of money services businesses under this section will not be required prior to December 31, 2001.
