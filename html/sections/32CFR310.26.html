                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Types of exemptions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There are three types of exemptions  permitted by the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An access exemption that exempts records compiled in reasonable  anticipation of a civil action or proceeding from the access provisions  of the Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> General exemptions that authorize the exemption of a system of  records from all but certain specifically identified provisions of the  Act (see appendix D).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Specific exemptions that allow a system of records to be  exempted only from certain designated provisions of the Act (see  appendix D).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Nothing in the Act permits exemption of any system of records  from all provisions of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Establishing exemptions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The access exemption is self- executing. It does not require an implementing rule to be effective.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Neither a general nor a specific exemption is established  automatically for any system of records. The Heads of the DoD Components  maintaining the system of records must make a determination whether the  system is one for which an exemption properly may be claimed and then  propose and establish an exemption rule for the system. No system of  records within the Department of Defense shall be considered exempted  until the Head of the Component has approved the exemption and an  exemption rule has been published as a final rule in the Federal  Register (See Sec. 310.30(e).)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Only the Head of the DoD Component or an authorized designee may  claim an exemption for a system of records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A system of records is considered exempt only from those  provision of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) that are identified  specifically in the Component exemption rule for the system and that are  authorized by the Privacy Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> To establish an exemption rule, see Sec. 310.31.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Blanket exemption for classified material. (1) Component rules  shall include a blanket exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of the  Privacy Act from the access provisions (5 U.S.C. 552a(d)) and the  notification of access procedures (5 U.S.C. 522a(e)(4)(H)) of the Act  for all classified material in any systems of records maintained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Do not claim specifically an exemption under section 552a(k)(1)  of the Privacy Act for any system of records. The blanket exemption  affords protection to all classified material in all system of records  maintained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Provisions from which exemptions may be claimed. The Head of a  DoD Component may claim an exemption from any provision of the Act from  which an exemption is allowed (see appendix D).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Use of exemptions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use exemptions only for the specific  purposes set forth in the exemption rules (see paragraph (b) of  Sec. 310.31).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use exemptions only when they are in the best interest of the  Government and limit them to the specific portions of the records  requiring protection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Do not use an exemption to deny an individual access to any  record to which he or she would have access under 32 CFR part 286.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Exempt records in non-exempt systems. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Exempt records  temporarily in the custody of another Component are considered the  property of the originating Component. Access to these records is  controlled by the system notices and rules of the originating Component.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exempt records that have been incorporated into a nonexempt  system of records are still exempt but only to the extent to which the  provisions of the Act for which an exemption has been claimed are  identified and an exemption claimed for the system of records from which  the record is obtained and only when the purposes underlying the  exemption for the record are still valid and necessary to protect the  contents of the record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a record is accidentally misfiled into a system of records,  the system notice and rules for the system in which it should actually  be filed shall govern.</p>
