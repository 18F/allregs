                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Commissioner of Indian Affairs (herein termed  ``Commissioner'') will engage in consultations with various tribes and  other water users on the Indian Reservations listed in Article II (D) of  said Supreme Court Decree, similar to those engaged in by the Regional  Director with regard to Contractors as provided in Sec. 417.2 of this  part. After consideration of all comments and suggestions advanced by  said tribes and other water users on said Indian Reservations concerning  water conservation measures and operating practices in the diversion,  delivery, distribution and use of Colorado River water, the Commissioner  shall, within the limits prescribed in said decree, make a determination  as to the estimated amount of water to be diverted for use on each  Indian Reservation covered by the above decree. Said determination shall  be made prior to the beginning of each calendar year. That determination  shall be based upon, but not necessarily limited to, such factors as:  The area to be irrigated, climatic conditions, location, land  classifications, the kinds of crops raised, cropping practices, the type  of irrigation system in use, the condition of water carriage and  distribution facilities, record of water orders, and rejections of  ordered water, general operating practices, the operating efficiencies  and methods of irrigation of the tribes and water users on each  reservation, the amount and rate of return flows to the river, municipal  water requirements, and other uses on the reservation. The Commissioner  of Indian Affairs shall deliver to the Regional Director written notice  of the amount of water to be diverted for use upon each Indian  Reservation for each year 60 days prior to the beginning of each  calendar year and the basis for said determination. The determination of  the Commissioner shall be final and conclusive unless within 30 days of  the date of receipt of such notice the Regional Director submits his  written comments and objections to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs  and requests further consultation. If after such further consultation,  timely taken, the Commissioner does not modify his determination and so  advises the Regional Director in writing or if modifications are made by  the Commissioner but the Regional Director still does not agree  therewith, the Regional Director may, within 30 days after receipt of  the Commissioner's response, appeal to the Secretary of the Interior for  a decision on the matter. During the pendency of such appeal and until  disposition thereof by the Secretary, water deliveries will be made to  the extent legally and physically available according to the  Commissioner's determination or according to the Commissioner's  determination for the preceding calendar year, whichever is less.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Modifications of said determinations due to changed conditions,  emergency or hardship may be made by the Commissioner, subject, however,  to the right of the Regional Director to appeal to the Secretary, as  provided in the case of an initial determination by the Commissioner.  During the pendency of such an appeal, water deliveries will be made on  the basis of the initial determination.</p>
