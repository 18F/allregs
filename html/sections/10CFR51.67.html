The statement shall include, among the alternatives under consideration, denial of a license or construction authorization by the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Under applicable provisions of law, the Department of Energy may be required to supplement its final environmental impact statement if it makes a substantial change in its proposed action that is relevant to environmental concerns or determines that there are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts. The Department shall submit any supplement to its final environmental impact statement to the Commission. (See Sec. 60.22 or Sec. 63.22 of this chapter as to the required time and manner of submission.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Whenever the Department of Energy submits a final environmental impact statement, or a final supplement to an environmental impact statement, to the Commission pursuant to this section, it shall also inform the Commission of the status of any civil action for judicial review initiated pursuant to section 119 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.
