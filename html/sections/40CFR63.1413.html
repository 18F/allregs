                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. For each emission point, the owner or operator shall  meet three stages of compliance, with exceptions specified in this  subpart. First, the owner or operator shall conduct a performance test  or design evaluation to demonstrate the performance of the control  device or control technology being used. Second, the owner or operator  shall meet the requirements for demonstrating initial compliance (e.g.,  a demonstration that the required percent reduction is achieved). Third,  the owner or operator shall meet the requirements for demonstrating  continuous compliance through some form of monitoring (e.g., continuous  monitoring of operating parameters).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Large control devices and small control devices. A large control  device is a   control device that controls emission points with total emissions of 10  tons of organic HAP per year or more before control. A small control  device is a control device that controls emission points with total  emissions less than 10 tons of organic HAP per year before control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Large control devices. Owners or operators are required to  conduct a performance test for a large control device. The establishment  of parameter monitoring levels shall be based on data obtained during  the required performance test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Small control devices. Owners or operators are required to  conduct a design evaluation for a small control device. An owner or  operator may choose to conduct a performance test for a small control  device and such a performance test shall follow the procedures specified  in this section, as appropriate. Whenever a small control device becomes  a large control device, the owner or operator shall conduct a  performance test following the procedures specified in this section, as  appropriate. Notification that such a performance test is required, the  site-specific test plan, and the results of the performance test shall  be provided to the Administrator as specified in Sec.  63.1417. Except  as provided in Sec.  63.1415(a)(2), the parameter monitoring levels for  small control devices shall be set based on the design evaluation  required by paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Further, when setting the  parameter monitoring level(s) based on the design evaluation, the owner  or operator shall submit the information specified in Sec.   63.1417(d)(7) for review and approval as part of the Precompliance  Report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>, (e)(4), (g), and (h), with the  exceptions specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Representative  conditions exclude periods of startup and shutdown unless specified by  the Administrator or an applicable subpart. The owner or operator may  not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. The owner  or operator must record the process information that is necessary to  document operating conditions during the test and include in such record  an explanation to support that such conditions represent normal  operation. Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to  the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the  conditions of performance tests. Data shall be reduced in accordance  with the EPA approved methods specified in this subpart or, if other  test methods are used, the data and methods shall be validated according  to the protocol in Method 301 of Appendix A of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Additional control devices not requiring performance tests.

Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, the owner  or operator shall operate control devices such that the daily average,  batch cycle daily average, or block average of monitored parameters,  established as specified in this paragraph, remains above the minimum  level or below the maximum level, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Establishment of parameter monitoring levels based on  performance tests--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Emission points other than batch process vents.  During initial compliance testing, the appropriate parameter shall be  continuously monitored during the required 1-hour test runs. The  monitoring level(s) shall then be established as the average of the  maximum (or minimum) point values from the three test runs. The average  of the maximum values shall be used when establishing a maximum level,  and the average of the minimum values shall be used when establishing a  minimum level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Aggregate batch vent streams. For aggregate batch vent streams  the monitoring level shall be established in accordance with paragraph  (a)(4)(i)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)(1)</em>  or (2) of this section. For batch process vents complying with the  percent reduction standards specified in Sec.  63.1406 or Sec.  63.1407,  parameter monitoring levels shall be established by the design  evaluation, or during the performance test so that the specified percent  reduction from Sec.  63.1406 or Sec.  63.1407, as appropriate, is met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If more than one batch emission episode or more than one portion  of a batch emission episode has been selected to be controlled, a single  level for the batch cycle shall be calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> During initial compliance testing, the appropriate parameter  shall be monitored continuously and recorded once every 15 minutes at  all times   when batch emission episodes, or portions thereof, selected to be  controlled are vented to the control device.
