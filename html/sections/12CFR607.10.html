Such credits or charges shall be applied to the next applicable assessment payment due during the current or subsequent fiscal year. Where such adjustments are made, the FCA shall provide the institution with a statement of adjustment at least 15 days prior to the date when the institution's next assessment payment is due. Adjustments in assessments shall be

made in principal amount only. Overdue amounts under Sec. 607.7 are not underpayments for assessment adjustment purposes.</p>
