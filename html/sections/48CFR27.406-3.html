                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The clause at 52.227-21, Technical Data Declaration, Revision,  and Withholding of Payment--Major Systems, implements 41 U.S.C. 2302(e).  When using the clause at 52.227-21, the section of the contract  specifying data delivery requirements (see 27.406-1(b)) shall expressly  identify those line items of technical data to which the clause applies.  Upon delivery of the technical data, the contracting officer shall  review the technical data and the contractor's declaration relating to  it to assure that the data are complete, accurate, and comply with  contract requirements. If the data are not complete, accurate, or  compliant, the contracting officer should request the contractor to  correct the deficiencies, and may withhold payment. Final payment shall  not be made under the contract until it has been determined that the  delivery requirements of those line items of data to which the clause  applies have been satisfactorily met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In a contract for, or in support of, a major system awarded by a  civilian agency other than NASA or the U.S. Coast Guard, the following  applies:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The contracting officer shall require the delivery of any  technical data relating to the major system or supplies for the major  system, that are to be developed exclusively with Federal funds if the  delivery of the technical data is needed to ensure the competitive  acquisition of supplies or services that will be required in substantial  quantities in the future. The clause at 52.227-22, Major System--Minimum  Rights, is used in addition to the clause at 52.227-14, Rights in Data-- General, and other required clauses, to ensure that the Government  acquires at least those rights required by Pub. L. 98-577 in technical  data developed exclusively with Federal funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Technical data, relating to a major system or supplies for a  major system, procured or to be procured by the Government and also  relating to the design, development, or manufacture of products or  processes offered or to be offered for sale to the public (except for  such data as may be necessary for the Government to operate or maintain  the product, or use the process if obtained by the Government as an  element of performance under the contract), shall not be required to be  provided to the Government from persons who have developed such products  or processes as a condition for the procurement of such products or  processes by the Government.
