Reimbursement shall be contingent upon the work  ultimately being approved in accordance with the requirements of  paragraph (a) of Sec. 668.215.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To qualify for emergency relief, the damaged or destroyed road  or trail shall be designated as a Federal road.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Replacement highway facilities are appropriate when it is not  practical and economically feasible to repair or restore a damaged  element to its preexisting condition. Emergency relief is limited to the  cost of a new facility constructed to current design standards of  comparable capacity and character to the destroyed facility. With  respect to a bridge, a comparable facility is one which meets current  geometric and construction standards for the type and volume of traffic  it will carry during its design life.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Emergency relief funds may participate to the extent of eligible  repair costs when proposed projects contain betterments or other work  not eligible for emergency funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Work may include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Repair to, or reconstruction of, seriously damaged highway  elements for a distance which would be within normal highway right-of- way limits, including necessary clearance of debris and other deposits  in drainage courses, where such work would not be classed as heavy  maintenance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Restoration of stream channels when the work is necessary for  the satisfactory operation of the Federal road. The applicant must have  responsibility and authority for maintenance and proper operation of  stream channels restored.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Betterments where clearly economically justified to prevent  future recurring damage. Economic justification acceptable to the DFDE  must weigh the cost of such betterments against the risk of eligible  recurring damage and the cost of future repair.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Actual PE and CE costs on approved projects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Emergency repairs.
