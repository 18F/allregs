                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Rates--(1)(i) Tier 1 tax. The Tier 1 employee representative tax rate equals the sum of the tax rates in effect under sections 3101(a) and 3111(a), relating to the employee and the employer tax for old-age, survivors, and disability insurance, and sections 3101(b) and 3111(b), relating to the employee and the employer tax for hospital insurance. The Tier 1 employee representative tax rate is applied to compensation up to the contribution base described in section 3231(e)(2)(B)(i). The contribution base is determined under section 230 of the Social Security Act, and is identical to the old-age, survivors, and disability insurance wage base and the hospital insurance wage base, respectively, under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> Tier 1 tax.

The following rule applies to an individual who renders service both as an employee representative and as an employee. The employee representative tax is imposed on compensation received as an employee representative under the rules described in Sec. 31.3211-2. The employee tax is imposed on compensation received as an employee under the rules described in Sec. 31.3201-2.

The amount of employee representative compensation subject to the section 3101(a) and the section 3111(a) rate is $15,500 ($55,500-$40,000). The entire $20,000 is subject to the sections 3101(b) and 3111(b) rates since the combined compensation is less than $130,200, the applicable contribution base for 1992. The amount of the employee representative compensation subject to the section 3211(a)(2) rate is $1,400 ($41,400-$40,000).
