                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notice requirement--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. At least 60 days and no more  than 90 days before the proposed termination date, the plan  administrator must issue a notice of intent to terminate to each person  (other than the PBGC) that is an affected party as of the proposed  termination date. In the case of a beneficiary of a deceased participant  or an alternate payee, the plan administrator must issue a notice of  intent to terminate promptly to any person that becomes an affected  party after the proposed termination date and on or before the  distribution date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Early issuance of NOIT. The PBGC may consider a notice of intent  to terminate to be timely under paragraph (a)(1) of this section if the  notice was early by a de minimis number of days and the PBGC finds that  the early issuance was the result of administrative error.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contents of notice. The PBGC's standard termination forms and  instructions package includes a model   notice of intent to terminate. The notice of intent to terminate must  include--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identifying information. The name and PN of the plan, the name  and EIN of each contributing sponsor, and the name, address, and  telephone number of the person who may be contacted by an affected party  with questions concerning the plan's termination;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Intent to terminate plan. A statement that the plan  administrator intends to terminate the plan in a standard termination as  of a specified proposed termination date and will notify the affected  party if the proposed termination date is changed to a later date or if  the termination does not occur;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sufficiency requirement. A statement that, in order to terminate  in a standard termination, plan assets must be sufficient to provide all  plan benefits under the plan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Cessation of accruals. A statement (as applicable) that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Benefit accruals will cease as of the termination date, but will  continue if the plan does not terminate;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A plan amendment has been adopted under which benefit accruals  will cease, in accordance with section 204(h) of ERISA, as of the  proposed termination date or a specified date before the proposed  termination date, whether or not the plan is terminated; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Benefit accruals ceased, in accordance with section 204(h) of  ERISA, as of a specified date before the notice of intent to terminate  was issued;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Annuity information. If required under Sec. 4041.27, the annuity  information described therein;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Benefit information. A statement that each affected party  entitled to plan benefits will receive a written notification regarding  his or her plan benefits;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Summary plan description. A statement as to how an affected  party entitled to receive the latest updated summary plan description  under section 104(b) of ERISA can obtain it.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Continuation of monthly benefits. For persons who are, as of the  proposed termination date, in pay status, a statement (as applicable)--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That their monthly (or other periodic) benefit amounts will not  be affected by the plan's termination; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Explaining how their monthly (or other periodic) benefit  amounts will be affected under plan provisions); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Extinguishment of guarantee. A statement that after plan assets  have been distributed in full satisfaction of all plan benefits under  the plan with respect to a participant or a beneficiary of a deceased  participant, either by the purchase of irrevocable commitments (annuity  contracts) or by an alternative form of distribution provided for under  the plan, the PBGC no longer guarantees that participant's or  beneficiary's plan benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Spin-off/termination transactions. In the case of a transaction  in which a single defined benefit plan is split into two or more plans  and there is a reversion of residual assets to an employer upon the  termination of one or more but fewer than all of the resulting plans (a  ``spin-off/termination transaction''), the plan administrator must,  within the time period specified in paragraph (a) of this section,  provide a notice describing the transaction to all participants,  beneficiaries of deceased participants, and alternate payees in the  original plan who are, as of the proposed termination date, covered by  an ongoing plan.</p>
