                            <p class="depth0">This section describes test procedures that you use to determine  whether vehicles meet the emission standards of this part. See Sec.   1051.235 to determine when testing is required for certification. See  subpart D of this part for the production-line testing requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Snowmobiles. For snowmobiles, use the equipment and procedures  for spark-ignition engines in 40 CFR part 1065 to determine whether your  snowmobiles meet the duty-cycle emission standards in Sec.  1051.103.  Measure the emissions of all the pollutants we regulate in Sec.   1051.103. Measure CO2, N2O, and CH4 as  described in Sec.  1051.235. Use the duty cycle specified in Sec.   1051.505.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of appendix I to 40 CFR part 86. For all other  motorcycles, use the driving schedule in paragraph (a) of Appendix I to  part 86. With respect to vehicle-speed governors, test motorcycles and  ATVs in their ungoverned configuration, unless we approve in advance  testing in a governed configuration. We will only approve testing in a  governed configuration if you can show that the governor is permanently  installed on all production vehicles and is unlikely to be removed in  use. With respect to engine-speed governors, test motorcycles and ATVs  in their governed configuration. Run the test engine, with all emission- control systems operating, long enough to stabilize emission levels; you  may consider emission levels stable without measurement if you  accumulate 12 hours of operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Permeation testing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use the equipment and procedures  specified in Sec.  1051.515 to measure fuel tank permeation emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prior to permeation testing of fuel hose, the hose must be  preconditioned by filling the hose with the fuel specified in paragraph  (d)(3) of this section, sealing the openings, and soaking the hose for 4  weeks at 23 5 [deg]C. To measure fuel-line  permeation emissions, use the equipment and procedures specified in SAE  J30 as described in 40 CFR 1060.810. The measurements must be performed  at 23 2 [deg]C using the fuel specified in  paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Fuels. Use the fuels meeting the following specifications:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Exhaust. Use the fuels and lubricants specified in 40 CFR part  1065, subpart H, for all the exhaust testing we require in this part.  For service accumulation, use the test fuel or any commercially  available fuel that is representative of the fuel that in-use engines  will use. The following provisions apply for using specific fuel types:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For gasoline-fueled engines, use the grade of gasoline specified  for general testing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For diesel-fueled engines, use either low-sulfur diesel fuel or  ultra low-sulfur diesel fuel meeting the specifications in 40 CFR  1065.703. If you use sulfur-sensitive technology as defined in 40 CFR  1039.801 and you measure emissions using ultra low-sulfur diesel fuel,   you must add a permanent label near the fuel inlet with the following  statement: ``ULTRA LOW SULFUR FUEL ONLY''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fuel Tank Permeation. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For the preconditioning soak described  in Sec.  1051.515(a)(1) and fuel slosh durability test described in  Sec.  1051.515(d)(3), use the fuel specified in Table 1 of 40 CFR  1065.710 blended with 10 percent ethanol by volume. As an alternative,  you may use Fuel CE10, which is Fuel C as specified in ASTM D 471-98  (see 40 CFR 1060.810) blended with 10 percent ethanol by volume.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For the permeation measurement test in Sec.  1051.515(b), use  the fuel specified in Table 1 of 40 CFR 1065.710. As an alternative, you  may use the fuel specified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fuel Hose Permeation. Use the fuel specified in Table 1 of 40  CFR 1065.710 blended with 10 percent ethanol by volume for permeation  testing of fuel lines. As an alternative, you may use Fuel CE10, which  is Fuel C as specified in ASTM D 471-98 (see 40 CFR 1060.810) blended  with 10 percent ethanol by volume.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Engine stabilization. Instead of the provisions of 40 CFR  1065.405, you may consider emission levels stable without measurement  after 12 hours of engine operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Special procedures for engine testing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may use special  or alternate procedures, as described in Sec.  1065.10 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> We may reject data you generate using alternate procedures if  later testing with the procedures in part 1065 of this chapter shows  contradictory emission data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You may test engines using a test speed based on the point of  maximum power if that represents in-use operation better than testing  based on maximum test speed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Special procedures for vehicle testing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may use special  or alternate procedures, as described in paragraph (f)(3) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> We may reject data you generate using alternate procedures if  later testing with the otherwise specified procedures shows  contradictory emission data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The test procedures specified for vehicle testing are  intended to produce emission measurements equivalent to those that would  result from measuring emissions during in-use operation using the same  vehicle configuration. If good engineering judgment indicates that use  of the procedures in this part for a vehicle would result in  measurements that are not representative of in-use operation of that  vehicle, you must notify us. If we determine that using these procedures  would result in measurements that are significantly unrepresentative and  that changes to the procedures will result in more representative  measurements that do not decrease the stringency of emission standards  or other requirements, we will specify changes to the procedures. In  your notification to us, you should recommend specific changes you think  are necessary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You may ask to use emission data collected using other test  procedures, such as those of the California Air Resources Board or the  International Organization for Standardization. We will allow this only  if you show us that these data are equivalent to data collected using  our test procedures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You may ask to use alternate procedures that produce  measurements equivalent to those obtained using the specified  procedures. In this case, send us a written request showing that your  alternate procedures are equivalent to the test procedures of this part.  If you prove to us that the procedures are equivalent, we will allow you  to use them. You may not use alternate procedures until we approve them.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> You may ask to use special test procedures if your vehicle  cannot be tested using the specified test procedures (for example, it is  incapable of operating on the specified transient cycle). In this case,  send us a written request showing that you cannot satisfactorily test  your engines using the test procedures of this part. We will allow you  to use special test procedures if we determine that they would produce  emission measurements that are representative of those that would result  from measuring emissions during in-use operation. You may not use   special procedures until we approve them.
