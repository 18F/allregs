                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> To be eligible for the manufactured home loan benefit a veteran must have loan guaranty entitlement for manufactured home purposes available for use. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 36.4205(e), the Secretary may exclude the amount of guaranty entitlement used for any guaranteed manufactured home loan provided:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The property which served as security for the loan has been disposed of by the veteran, or has been destroyed by fire or other natural hazard; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> The loan has been repaid in full or the Secretary has been released from liability as to the loan, or if the Secretary has suffered a loss on said loan, such loss has been paid in full; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The loan has been repaid in full or the Secretary has been released from liability as to the loan, or if the Secretary has suffered a loss on said loan, such loss has been paid in full; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A veteran-transferee has agreed to assume the outstanding balance on the loan and consented to the use of his or her entitlement to the extent the entitlement of the veteran-transferor had been used originally, and the veteran-transferee otherwise meets the requirements of 38 U.S.C. chapter 37.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In a case in which the veteran still owns a property purchased with a VA-guaranteed loan, the Secretary may, one time only, restore entitlement if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The loan has been repaid in full, or, if the Secretary has suffered a loss on the loan, the loss has been paid in full; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Secretary has been released from liability as to the loan and, if the Secretary has suffered a loss on the loan, the loss has been paid in full.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The Secretary may, in any case involving circumstances deemed appropriate, waive either or both of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2)(i) of this section.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3702, 3712)

The Secretary may, in any case involving circumstances deemed appropriate, waive either or both of the requirements set forth in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A veteran may use his or her remaining home loan guaranty entitlement for any purpose authorized by 38 U.S.C. 3710, 3711, or 3712 except that a veteran who has purchased a manufactured home unit may not purchase a second manufactured home unit until the unit which secured the first loan has been disposed of by the veteran or has been destroyed by fire or other natural hazard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The available entitlement of a veteran will be determined by the Secretary as of the date of receipt of an application for guaranty of a manufactured home loan or loan report. Such date of receipt shall be the date the application or loan report is date stamped into the Department of Veterans Affairs. Eligibility derived from the most recent period of service (1) shall cancel any unused entitlement derived from any earlier period of service, and (2) shall be reduced by the amount by which entitlement from service during any earlier period has been used to obtain a direct, guaranteed, or insured loan:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On property which the veteran owns at the time of application; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> As to which the Secretary has incurred actual liability or loss, unless in the event of loss or the incurrence and payment of such liability by the Secretary the resulting indebtedness of the veteran to the United States has been paid in full.
Provided, That if the Secretary issues or has issued a certificate of commitment covering the loan described in the application for guaranty or in the loan report, the amount and percentage of guaranty contemplated by the certificate of commitment shall not be subject to reduction if the loan has been or is closed on a date which is not later than the expiration date of the certificate of commitment, notwithstanding that the Secretary in the meantime and prior to the issuance of the evidence of guaranty shall have incurred actual liability or loss on a direct, guaranteed, or insured loan previously obtained by the borrower. For the purposes of this paragraph, the Secretary will be deemed to have incurred actual loss on a guaranteed or insured loan if the Secretary has paid a guaranty or insurance claim thereon and the veteran's resultant indebtedness to the Government has not been paid in full, and to have incurred actual liability on a guaranteed or insured loan if the Secretary is in receipt of a claim on the guaranty or insurance or is in receipt of a notice of default. In the case of a direct loan, the Secretary will be deemed to have incurred an actual loss if the loan is in default.
