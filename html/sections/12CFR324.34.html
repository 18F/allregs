                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Exposure amount--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Single OTC derivative contract. Except as  modified by paragraph (b) of this section, the exposure amount for a  single OTC derivative contract that is not subject to a qualifying  master netting agreement is equal to the sum of the FDIC-supervised  institution's current credit exposure and potential future credit  exposure (PFE) on the OTC derivative contract.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Current credit exposure. The current credit exposure for a  single OTC derivative contract is the greater of the mark-to-fair value  of the OTC derivative contract or zero.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> PFE. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The PFE for a single OTC derivative contract,  including an OTC derivative contract with a negative mark-to-fair value,  is calculated by multiplying the notional principal amount of the OTC  derivative contract by the appropriate conversion factor in Table 1 to  Sec. 324.34.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For purposes of calculating either the PFE under this paragraph  (a) or the gross PFE under paragraph (a)(2) of this section for exchange  rate contracts and other similar contracts in which the notional  principal amount is equivalent to the cash flows, notional principal  amount is the net receipts to each party falling due on each value date  in each currency.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> For an OTC derivative contract that does not fall within one of  the specified categories in Table 1 to Sec. 324.34, the PFE must be  calculated using the appropriate ``other'' conversion factor.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> An FDIC-supervised institution must use an OTC derivative  contract's effective notional principal amount (that is, the apparent or  stated notional principal amount multiplied by any multiplier in the OTC  derivative contract) rather than the apparent or stated notional  principal amount in calculating PFE.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The PFE of the protection provider of a credit derivative is  capped at the net present value of the amount of unpaid premiums.</p><p class="depth5">Table 1 to Sec. 324.34--Conversion Factor Matrix for Derivative Contracts \1\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth5">Credit    Credit (non-</p><p class="depth5">Foreign   (investment  investment-               Precious</p><p class="depth5">Remaining maturity \2\                         Interest    exchange      grade        grade       Equity      metals       Other</p><p class="depth5">rate      rate and    reference    reference                 (except</p><p class="depth5">gold      asset) \3\     asset)                   gold) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- One year or less..................................................        0.00        0.01         0.05         0.10        0.06        0.07        0.10 Greater than one year and less than or equal to five years........       0.005        0.05         0.05         0.10        0.08        0.07        0.12 Greater than five years...........................................       0.015       0.075         0.05         0.10        0.10        0.08        0.15 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ For a derivative contract with multiple exchanges of principal, the conversion factor is multiplied by the number of remaining payments in the</p><p class="depth5">derivative contract. \2\ For an OTC derivative contract that is structured such that on specified dates any outstanding exposure is settled and the terms are reset so that</p><p class="depth5">the fair value of the contract is zero, the remaining maturity equals the time until the next reset date. For an interest rate derivative contract</p><p class="depth5">with a remaining maturity of greater than one year that meets these criteria, the minimum conversion factor is 0.005. \3\ An FDIC-supervised institution must use the column labeled ``Credit (investment-grade reference asset)'' for a credit derivative whose reference</p><p class="depth5">asset is an outstanding unsecured long-term debt security without credit enhancement that is investment grade. An FDIC-supervised institution must use</p><p class="depth5">the column labeled ``Credit (non-investment-grade reference asset)'' for all other credit derivatives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Multiple OTC derivative contracts subject to a qualifying master  netting agreement. Except as modified by paragraph (b) of this section,  the exposure   amount for multiple OTC derivative contracts subject to a qualifying  master netting agreement is equal to the sum of the net current credit  exposure and the adjusted sum of the PFE amounts for all OTC derivative  contracts subject to the qualifying master netting agreement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Net current credit exposure. The net current credit exposure is  the greater of the net sum of all positive and negative mark-to-fair  values of the individual OTC derivative contracts subject to the  qualifying master netting agreement or zero.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Adjusted sum of the PFE amounts. The adjusted sum of the PFE  amounts, Anet, is calculated as Anet = (0.4 x Agross) + (0.6 x NGR x  Agross), where:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Agross equals the gross PFE (that is, the sum of the PFE amounts  as determined under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section for each  individual derivative contract subject to the qualifying master netting  agreement); and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Net-to-gross Ratio (NGR) equals the ratio of the net current  credit exposure to the gross current credit exposure. In calculating the  NGR, the gross current credit exposure equals the sum of the positive  current credit exposures (as determined under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of  this section) of all individual derivative contracts subject to the  qualifying master netting agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Recognition of credit risk mitigation of collateralized OTC  derivative contracts. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An FDIC-supervised institution may recognize  the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures  an OTC derivative contract or multiple OTC derivative contracts subject  to a qualifying master netting agreement (netting set) by using the  simple approach in Sec. 324.37(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Counterparty credit risk for OTC credit derivatives--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Protection purchasers. An FDIC-supervised institution that purchases an  OTC credit derivative that is recognized under Sec. 324.36 as a credit  risk mitigant for an exposure that is not a covered position under  subpart F is not required to compute a separate counterparty credit risk  capital requirement under Sec. 324.32 provided that the FDIC-supervised  institution does so consistently for all such credit derivatives. The  FDIC-supervised institution must either include all or exclude all such  credit derivatives that are subject to a qualifying master netting  agreement from any measure used to determine counterparty credit risk  exposure to all relevant counterparties for risk-based capital purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Protection providers. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An FDIC-supervised institution that is  the protection provider under an OTC credit derivative must treat the  OTC credit derivative as an exposure to the underlying reference asset.  The FDIC-supervised institution is not required to compute a  counterparty credit risk capital requirement for the OTC credit  derivative under Sec. 324.32, provided that this treatment is applied  consistently for all such OTC credit derivatives. The FDIC-supervised  institution must either include all or exclude all such OTC credit  derivatives that are subject to a qualifying master netting agreement  from any measure used to determine counterparty credit risk exposure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The provisions of this paragraph (c)(2) apply to all relevant  counterparties for risk-based capital purposes unless the FDIC- supervised institution is treating the OTC credit derivative as a  covered position under subpart F, in which case the FDIC-supervised  institution must compute a supplemental counterparty credit risk capital  requirement under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Counterparty credit risk for OTC equity derivatives. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An  FDIC-supervised institution must treat an OTC equity derivative contract  as an equity exposure and compute a risk-weighted asset   amount for the OTC equity derivative contract under Sec. Sec. 324.51  through 324.53 (unless the FDIC-supervised institution is treating the  contract as a covered position under subpart F of this part).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In addition, the FDIC-supervised institution must also calculate  a risk-based capital requirement for the counterparty credit risk of an  OTC equity derivative contract under this section if the FDIC-supervised  institution is treating the contract as a covered position under subpart  F of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the FDIC-supervised institution risk weights the contract  under the Simple Risk-Weight Approach (SRWA) in Sec. 324.52, the FDIC- supervised institution may choose not to hold risk-based capital against  the counterparty credit risk of the OTC equity derivative contract, as  long as it does so for all such contracts. Where the OTC equity  derivative contracts are subject to a qualified master netting  agreement, an FDIC-supervised institution using the SRWA must either  include all or exclude all of the contracts from any measure used to  determine counterparty credit risk exposure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Clearing member FDIC-supervised institution's exposure amount. A  clearing member FDIC-supervised institution's exposure amount for an OTC  derivative contract or netting set of OTC derivative contracts where the  FDIC-supervised institution is either acting as a financial intermediary  and enters into an offsetting transaction with a QCCP or where the FDIC- supervised institution provides a guarantee to the QCCP on the  performance of the client equals the exposure amount calculated  according to paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section multiplied by the  scaling factor 0.71. If the FDIC-supervised institution determines that  a longer period is appropriate, the FDIC-supervised institution must use  a larger scaling factor to adjust for a longer holding period as  follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR10SE13.014   where H equals the holding period greater than five days. Additionally,  the FDIC may require the FDIC-supervised institution to set a longer  holding period if the FDIC determines that a longer period is  appropriate due to the nature, structure, or characteristics of the  transaction or is commensurate with the risks associated with the  transaction.
