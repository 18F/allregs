                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Yes, the following are three options for establishing that an  equivalent level of safety exists:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In the first option, the margin of safety provided by various  alternatives is compared to that obtained for a code complying building  with complete sprinkler protection. The margin of safety is the  difference between the available safe egress time and the required safe  egress time. Available safe egress time is the time available for  evacuation of occupants to an area of safety prior to the onset of  untenable conditions in occupied areas or the egress pathways. The  required safe egress time is the time required by occupants to move from  their positions at the start of the fire to areas of safety. Available  safe egress times would be developed based on analysis of a number of  assumed reasonable worst case fire scenarios including assessment of a  code complying fully sprinklered building. Additional analysis would be  used to determine the expected required safe egress times for the  various scenarios. If the margin of safety plus an appropriate safety  factor is greater for an alternative than for the fully sprinklered  building, then the alternative should provide an equivalent level of  safety.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A second alternative is applicable for typical office and  residential scenarios. In these situations, complete sprinkler  protection can be expected to prevent flashover in the room of fire  origin, limit fire size to no more than 1 megawatt (950 Btu/sec), and  prevent flames from leaving the room of origin. The times required for  each of these conditions to occur in the area of interest must be  determined. The shortest of these three times would become the   time available for escape. The difference between the minimum time  available for escape and the time required for evacuation of building  occupants would be the target margin of safety. Various alternative  protection strategies would have to be evaluated to determine their  impact on the times at which hazardous conditions developed in the  spaces of interest and the times required for egress. If a combination  of fire protection systems provides a margin of safety equal to or  greater than the target margin of safety, then the combination could be  judged to provide an equivalent level of safety.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> As a third option, other technical analysis procedures, as  approved by the responsible agency head, can be used to show  equivalency.</p>
