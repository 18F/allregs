When a CBP employee is so assigned to render service in connection with the entry or delivery of merchandise only, the private interest shall be charged only for the authorized travel and subsistence expenses incurred by such employee from the time he leaves his official station until he returns thereto except that no collection need be made if the total amount chargeable against one importer for one day amounts to less than 50 cents (see Sec. 101.4(b) of this chapter). Where the amount chargeable is 50 cents or more, but less than $1, a minimum charge of $1 shall be made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When a CBP employee is assigned under authority of section 447, Tariff Act of 1930, to make entry of a vessel at a place other than a port of entry or to supervise the unlading of cargo, the private interest shall be charged the full compensation and authorized travel and subsistence expenses of such employee from the time he leaves his official station until he returns thereto.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> When a CBP employee is assigned on any vessel or vehicle, under authority of section 456, Tariff Act of 1930, while proceeding from one port to another, the master or owner of such vessel or vehicle shall be charged the full compensation and authorized travel and subsistence expenses of such employee from the time he leaves his official station until he returns thereto, or, in lieu of such expenses, the master or owner may furnish such employee the accommodations usually supplied to passengers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> When a CBP employee is assigned under authority of section 562, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, to supervise the manipulation of merchandise at a place other than a bonded warehouse, the compensation and expenses of such employee shall be reimbursed to the Government by the party in interest. A Customs officer so assigned is not acting as a customs warehouse officer, since the services have no connection with a customs bonded warehouse.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> When a CBP employee is assigned to supervise the destruction of merchandise pursuant to section 557(c), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, at a place where a CBP employee is not regularly assigned, the full compensation

The rate per hour equal to 137 percent of the hourly rate of regular pay is computed as follows:

established basic workweek shall be the amount actually payable to the employee for such services under the Federal Employees Pay Act of 1945, as amended (5 U.S.C. 5542(a), 5546), or the Customs overtime laws (19 U.S.C. 267, 1451), or both, as the case may be. When such services are performed by an intermittent when-actually-employed employee, the charge for such services shall be computed at a rate per hour equal to 108 percent of the hourly rate of the regular pay of such employee to provide for reimbursement of the Government's contribution under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, as amended (25 U.S.C. 3101, et seq.), and employee uniform allowance. The time charged shall include any time within the regular working hours of the employee required for travel between the duty assignment and the place where the employee is regularly employed excluding lunch periods, charged in multiples of 1 hour, any fractional part of an hour to be charged as 1 hour when the services are performed during the regularly scheduled tour of duty of the officer or between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. on weekdays when the officer has no regularly scheduled tour of duty. In no case shall the charge be less than $1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The necessary transportation expenses and any authorized per diem expenses of a CBP employee assigned to perform reimbursable services at a location at which he is not regularly assigned shall be reimbursed by the responsible party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When a CBP employee is regularly assigned to duty at more than one location, the charge for his compensation and transportation expenses in going from one location to another shall be equitably apportioned among the parties concerned. However, no charge shall be made for transportation expenses when a CBP employee is reporting to as a first assignment, or leaving from as a last assignment, a place where he is regularly assigned to duty.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Upon a failure to pay such charges when due, or to comply with the applicable laws and regulations, the port director shall report the facts to the Accounting Services--Accounts Receivable, which shall take appropriate action to collect the charges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The reimbursable charge for customs overtime compensation shall be computed in accordance with Sec. 24.16.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Medicare Compensation Costs. In addition to other expenses and compensation chargeable to parties-in-interest as set forth in this section, such persons shall also be required to reimburse Customs in the amount of 1.35 percent of the reimbursable compensation expenses incurred.
