The MSPB will  charge an annual rate of interest that is equal to the average  investment rate for the Treasury tax and loan accounts on September 30  of each year, rounded to the nearest whole per centum. This rate, which  represents the current value of funds to the United States Treasury, may  be revised quarterly by the Secretary of the Treasury and is published  by the Secretary of the Treasury annually or quarterly in the Federal  Register and the Treasury Financial Manual Bulletins.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The rate of interest initially assessed will remain fixed for  the duration of the indebtedness, except that if a debtor defaults on a  repayment agreement interest may be set at the Treasury rate in effect  on the date a new agreement is executed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The MSPB shall charge debtors for administrative costs incurred  in handling overdue debts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Interest will not be charged on administrative costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The MSPB shall assess a penalty charge, not to exceed 6 percent  per year on debts which have been delinquent for more than 90 days. This  change shall accrue from the date that the debt became delinquent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Chairman or his designee may waive in whole or in part the  collection of interest and administrative and penalty charges if  determined that collection would be against equity or not in the best  interests of the United States. The MSPB shall waive the collection of  interest on the debt or any part of the debt which is paid within 30  days after the date on which interest began to accrue.</p>
