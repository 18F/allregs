                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A claim is a written demand by one of the contracting parties, asking for one or more of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Payment of a specific sum of money under the contract;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Adjustment or interpretation of contract terms; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any other claim relating to the contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> However, an undisputed voucher, invoice, or other routing request for payment is not a claim under the CDA. A voucher, invoice, or routing request for payment may be converted into a CDA claim if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is disputed as to liability or amount; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is not acted upon in a reasonable time and written notice of the claim is given to the awarding official by the senior official designated in the contract.</p>
