                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(4)</em> of this section, within 60 days after achieving the maximum  production rate at which the affected facility will be operated, but not  later than 180 days after initial startup of such facility, or at such  other times specified by this part, and at such other times as may be  required by the Administrator under section 114 of the Act, the owner or  operator of such facility shall conduct performance test(s) and furnish  the Administrator a written report of the results of such performance  test(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a force majeure is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred  for which the affected owner or operator intends to assert a claim of  force majeure, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator, in  writing as soon as practicable following the date the owner or operator  first knew, or through due diligence should have known that the event  may cause or caused a delay in testing beyond the regulatory deadline,  but the notification must occur before the performance test deadline  unless the initial force majeure or a subsequent force majeure event  delays the notice, and in such cases, the notification shall occur as  soon as practicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator shall provide to the Administrator a  written description of the force majeure event and a rationale for  attributing the delay in testing beyond the regulatory deadline to the  force majeure; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize  the delay; and identify a date by which the owner or operator proposes  to conduct the performance test. The performance test shall be conducted  as soon as practicable after the force majeure occurs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The decision as to whether or not to grant an extension to the  performance test deadline is solely within the discretion of the  Administrator. The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in  writing of approval or disapproval of the request for an extension as  soon as practicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Until an extension of the performance test deadline has been  approved by the Administrator under paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of  this section, the owner or operator of the affected facility remains  strictly subject to the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Performance tests shall be conducted and data reduced in  accordance with the test methods and procedures contained in each  applicable subpart unless the Administrator (1) specifies or approves,  in specific cases, the use of a reference method with minor changes in  methodology, (2) approves the use of an equivalent method, (3) approves  the use of an alternative method the results of which he has determined  to be adequate for indicating whether a specific source is in  compliance, (4) waives the requirement for performance tests because the  owner or operator of a source has demonstrated by other means to the  Administrator's satisfaction that the affected facility is in compliance  with the standard, or (5) approves shorter sampling times and smaller  sample volumes when necessitated by process variables or other   factors. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to abrogate the  Administrator's authority to require testing under section 114 of the  Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Performance tests shall be conducted under such conditions as  the Administrator shall specify to the plant operator based on  representative performance of the affected facility. The owner or  operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may  be necessary to determine the conditions of the performance tests.  Operations during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction shall  not constitute representative conditions for the purpose of a  performance test nor shall emissions in excess of the level of the  applicable emission limit during periods of startup, shutdown, and  malfunction be considered a violation of the applicable emission limit  unless otherwise specified in the applicable standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The owner or operator of an affected facility shall provide the  Administrator at least 30 days prior notice of any performance test,  except as specified under other subparts, to afford the Administrator  the opportunity to have an observer present. If after 30 days notice for  an initially scheduled performance test, there is a delay (due to  operational problems, etc.) in conducting the scheduled performance  test, the owner or operator of an affected facility shall notify the  Administrator (or delegated State or local agency) as soon as possible  of any delay in the original test date, either by providing at least 7  days prior notice of the rescheduled date of the performance test, or by  arranging a rescheduled date with the Administrator (or delegated State  or local agency) by mutual agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The owner or operator of an affected facility shall provide, or  cause to be provided, performance testing facilities as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sampling ports adequate for test methods applicable to such  facility. This includes (i) constructing the air pollution control  system such that volumetric flow rates and pollutant emission rates can  be accurately determined by applicable test methods and procedures and  (ii) providing a stack or duct free of cyclonic flow during performance  tests, as demonstrated by applicable test methods and procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Safe sampling platform(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Safe access to sampling platform(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Utilities for sampling and testing equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Unless otherwise specified in the applicable subpart, each  performance test shall consist of three separate runs using the  applicable test method. Each run shall be conducted for the time and  under the conditions specified in the applicable standard. For the  purpose of determining compliance with an applicable standard, the  arithmetic means of results of the three runs shall apply. In the event  that a sample is accidentally lost or conditions occur in which one of  the three runs must be discontinued because of forced shutdown, failure  of an irreplaceable portion of the sample train, extreme meteorological  conditions, or other circumstances, beyond the owner or operator's  control, compliance may, upon the Administrator's approval, be  determined using the arithmetic mean of the results of the two other  runs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The performance testing shall include a test method performance  audit (PA) during the performance test. The PAs consist of blind audit  samples supplied by an accredited audit sample provider and analyzed  during the performance test in order to provide a measure of test data  bias. Gaseous audit samples are designed to audit the performance of the  sampling system as well as the analytical system and must be collected  by the sampling system during the compliance test just as the compliance  samples are collected. If a liquid or solid audit sample is designed to  audit the sampling system, it must also be collected by the sampling  system during the compliance test. If multiple sampling systems or  sampling trains are used during the compliance test for any of the test  methods, the tester is only required to use one of the sampling systems  per method to collect the audit sample. The audit sample must be  analyzed by the same analyst using the same analytical reagents and  analytical system and at the same time as the compliance samples.  Retests are required when there is a failure to produce acceptable  results   for an audit sample. However, if the audit results do not affect the  compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility, the  compliance authority may waive the reanalysis requirement, further  audits, or retests and accept the results of the compliance test.  Acceptance of the test results shall constitute a waiver of the  reanalysis requirement, further audits, or retests. The compliance  authority may also use the audit sample failure and the compliance test  results as evidence to determine the compliance or noncompliance status  of the affected facility. A blind audit sample is a sample whose value  is known only to the sample provider and is not revealed to the tested  facility until after they report the measured value of the audit sample.  For pollutants that exist in the gas phase at ambient temperature, the  audit sample shall consist of an appropriate concentration of the  pollutant in air or nitrogen that can be introduced into the sampling  system of the test method at or near the same entry point as a sample  from the emission source. If no gas phase audit samples are available,  an acceptable alternative is a sample of the pollutant in the same  matrix that would be produced when the sample is recovered from the  sampling system as required by the test method. For samples that exist  only in a liquid or solid form at ambient temperature, the audit sample  shall consist of an appropriate concentration of the pollutant in the  same matrix that would be produced when the sample is recovered from the  sampling system as required by the test method. An accredited audit  sample provider (AASP) is an organization that has been accredited to  prepare audit samples by an independent, third party accrediting body.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The source owner, operator, or representative of the tested  facility shall obtain an audit sample, if commercially available, from  an AASP for each test method used for regulatory compliance purposes. No  audit samples are required for the following test methods: Methods 3A  and 3C of appendix A-3 of part 60, Methods 6C, 7E, 9, and 10 of appendix  A-4 of part 60, Methods 18 and 19 of appendix A-6 of part 60, Methods  20, 22, and 25A of appendix A-7 of part 60, Methods 30A and 30B of  appendix A-8 of part 60, and Methods 303, 318, 320, and 321 of appendix  A of part 63 of this chapter. If multiple sources at a single facility  are tested during a compliance test event, only one audit sample is  required for each method used during a compliance test. The compliance  authority responsible for the compliance test may waive the requirement  to include an audit sample if they believe that an audit sample is not  necessary. ``Commercially available'' means that two or more independent  AASPs have blind audit samples available for purchase. If the source  owner, operator, or representative cannot find an audit sample for a  specific method, the owner, operator, or representative shall consult  the EPA Web site at the following URL, www.epa.gov/ttn/emc, to confirm  whether there is a source that can supply an audit sample for that  method. If the EPA Web site does not list an available audit sample at  least 60 days prior to the beginning of the compliance test, the source  owner, operator, or representative shall not be required to include an  audit sample as part of the quality assurance program for the compliance  test. When ordering an audit sample, the source owner, operator, or  representative shall give the sample provider an estimate for the  concentration of each pollutant that is emitted by the source or the  estimated concentration of each pollutant based on the permitted level  and the name, address, and phone number of the compliance authority. The  source owner, operator, or representative shall report the results for  the audit sample along with a summary of the emission test results for  the audited pollutant to the compliance authority and shall report the  results of the audit sample to the AASP. The source owner, operator, or  representative shall make both reports at the same time and in the same  manner or shall report to the compliance authority first and then report  to the AASP. If the method being audited is a method that allows the  samples to be analyzed in the field and the tester plans to analyze the  samples in the field, the tester may analyze the audit samples prior to  collecting the emission samples provided a representative of the  compliance authority is present   at the testing site. The tester may request and the compliance authority  may grant a waiver to the requirement that a representative of the  compliance authority must be present at the testing site during the  field analysis of an audit sample. The source owner, operator, or  representative may report the results of the audit sample to the  compliance authority and report the results of the audit sample to the  AASP prior to collecting any emission samples. The test protocol and  final test report shall document whether an audit sample was ordered and  utilized and the pass/fail results as applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An AASP shall have and shall prepare, analyze, and report the  true value of audit samples in accordance with a written technical  criteria document that describes how audit samples will be prepared and  distributed in a manner that will ensure the integrity of the audit  sample program. An acceptable technical criteria document shall contain  standard operating procedures for all of the following operations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Preparing the sample;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Confirming the true concentration of the sample;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Defining the acceptance limits for the results from a well  qualified tester. This procedure must use well established statistical  methods to analyze historical results from well qualified testers. The  acceptance limits shall be set so that there is 95 percent confidence  that 90 percent of well qualified labs will produce future results that  are within the acceptance limit range.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Providing the opportunity for the compliance authority to  comment on the selected concentration level for an audit sample;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Distributing the sample to the user in a manner that guarantees  that the true value of the sample is unknown to the user;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Recording the measured concentration reported by the user and  determining if the measured value is within acceptable limits;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The AASP shall report the results from each audit sample in a  timely manner to the compliance authority and then to the source owner,  operator, or representative. The AASP shall make both reports at the  same time and in the same manner or shall report to the compliance  authority first and then report to the source owner, operator, or  representative. The results shall include the name of the facility  tested, the date on which the compliance test was conducted, the name of  the company performing the sample collection, the name of the company  that analyzed the compliance samples including the audit sample, the  measured result for the audit sample, and whether the testing company  passed or failed the audit. The AASP shall report the true value of the  audit sample to the compliance authority. The AASP may report the true  value to the source owner, operator, or representative if the AASP's  operating plan ensures that no laboratory will receive the same audit  sample twice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Evaluating the acceptance limits of samples at least once  every two years to determine in cooperation with the voluntary consensus  standard body if they should be changed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Maintaining a database, accessible to the compliance  authorities, of results from the audit that shall include the name of  the facility tested, the date on which the compliance test was  conducted, the name of the company performing the sample collection, the  name of the company that analyzed the compliance samples including the  audit sample, the measured result for the audit sample, the true value  of the audit sample, the acceptance range for the measured value, and  whether the testing company passed or failed the audit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The accrediting body shall have a written technical criteria  document that describes how it will ensure that the AASP is operating in  accordance with the AASP technical criteria document that describes how  audit samples are to be prepared and distributed. This document shall  contain standard operating procedures for all of the following  operations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Checking audit samples to confirm their true value as reported  by the AASP;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Performing technical systems audits of the AASP's facilities  and operating procedures at least once every two years;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Providing standards for use by the voluntary consensus  standard body to approve the accrediting body that will accredit the  audit sample providers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em>of this section, the technical criteria documents are not acceptable  and the proposed audit sample program is not capable of producing audit  samples of sufficient quality to be used in a compliance test. All  acceptable technical criteria documents shall be posted on the EPA Web  site at the following URL, http://www.epa.gov/ttn/emc.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Unless otherwise specified in the applicable subpart, each test  location must be verified to be free of cyclonic flow and evaluated for  the existence of emission gas stratification and the required number of  sampling traverse points. If other procedures are not specified in the  applicable subpart to the regulations, use the appropriate procedures in  Method 1 to check for cyclonic flow and Method 7E to evaluate emission  gas stratification and selection of sampling points.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Whenever the use of multiple calibration gases is required by a  test method, performance specification, or quality assurance procedure  in a part 60 standard or appendix, Method 205 of 40 CFR part 51,  appendix M of this chapter, ``Verification of Gas Dilution Systems for  Field Instrument Calibrations,'' may be used.
