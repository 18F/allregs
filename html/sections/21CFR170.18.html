required for the combined additives to accomplish the physical or technical effect for which such combined additives are intended and that the higher tolerance will be safe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where residues from two or more additives in the same class are present in or on a food and there are available methods that permit quantitative determination of each residue, the quantity of combined residues that are within the tolerance may be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determine the quantity of each residue present.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Divide the quantity of each residue by the tolerance that would apply if it occurred alone, and multiply by 100 to determine the percentage of the permitted amount of residue present.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Add the percentages so obtained for all residues present.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The sum of the percentage shall not exceed 100 percent.</p>
