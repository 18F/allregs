The narrative description must include, but is not limited to, identification of the loan's collateral after expiration of the concession contract; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Assumes amortization of any intangible assets assigned or encumbered as a result of the transaction over the remaining term of the concession contract unless the proforma contains a narrative description as to why such extended amortization period is consistent with an opportunity for reasonable profit over the remaining term of the concession contract.</p>
