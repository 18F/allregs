                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each electric borrower shall include the provisions in this paragraph in its agreements with contractors, engineers, and architects, said agreements that are wholly or partially financed by RUS loans or guarantees. The borrower should replace ``Contractor'' with ``Engineer'' or ``Architect'' as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2">1. The Contractor shall take out and maintain throughout the period of this Agreement insurance of the following minimum types and amounts:</p><p class="depth2">a. Worker's compensation and employer's liability insurance, as required by law, covering all their employees who perform any of the obligations of the contractor, engineer, and architect under the contract. If any employer or employee is not subject to workers' compensation laws of the governing State, then insurance shall be obtained voluntarily to extend to the employer and employee coverage to the same extent as though the employer or employee were subject to the workers' compensation laws.</p><p class="depth2">b. Public liability insurance covering all operations under the contract shall have limits for bodily injury or death of not less than $1 million each occurrence, limits for property damage of not less than $1 million each occurrence, and $1 million aggregate for accidents during the policy period. A single limit of $1 million of bodily injury and property damage is acceptable. This required insurance may be in a policy or policies of insurance, primary and excess including the umbrella or catastrophe form.</p><p class="depth2">c. Automobile liability insurance on all motor vehicles used in connection with the contract, whether owned, non-owned, or hired, shall have limits for bodily injury or death of not less than $1 million per person and $1 million each occurrence, and property damage limits of $1 million for each occurrence. This required insurance may be in a policy or policies of insurance, primary and excess including the umbrella or catastrophe form.</p><p class="depth2">2. The Owner shall have the right at any time to require public liability insurance and property damage liability insurance greater than those required in paragraphs (a)(1)(b) and (a)(1)(c) of this section. In any such event, the additional premium or premiums payable solely as the result of such additional insurance shall be added to the Contract price.</p><p class="depth2">3. The Owner shall be named as Additional Insured on all policies of insurance required in (a)(1)(b) and (a)(1)(c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2">4. The policies of insurance shall be in such form and issued by such insurer as shall be satisfactory to the Owner. The Contractor shall furnish the Owner a certificate evidencing compliance with the foregoing requirements that shall provide not less than 30 days prior written notice to the Owner of any cancellation or material change in the insurance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Electric borrowers shall also ensure that all architects and engineers working under contract with the borrower have insurance coverage for Errors and Omissions (Professional Liability Insurance) in an amount at least as large as the amount of the architectural or engineering services contract but not less than $500,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The borrower may increase the limits of insurance if desired.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The minimum requirement of $1 million of public liability insurance does not apply to contractors performing maintenance work, janitorial-type services, meter reading services, rights-of-way mowing, and jobs of a similar nature. However, borrowers shall ensure that the contractor performing the work has public liability coverage at a level determined to be appropriate by the borrower.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If requested by RUS, the borrower shall provide RUS with a certificate from the contractor, engineer, or architect evidencing compliance with the requirements of this section.</p>
