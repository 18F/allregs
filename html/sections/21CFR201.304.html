                                Sec. 201.304  Tannic acid and barium enema preparations.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> It has become a widespread practice for tannic acid to be added  to barium enemas to improve X-ray pictures. Tannic acid is capable of  causing diminished liver function and severe liver necrosis when  absorbed in sufficient amounts. The medical literature reports a number  of deaths associated with the addition of tannic acid to barium enemas.  There is a lack of scientific evidence to establish the conditions, if  any, under which tannic acid   is safe and effective for use in enemas. Tannic acid for rectal use to  enhance X-ray visualization is regarded as a new drug within the meaning  of section 201(p) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In view of the hazards involved when tannic acid is used in  barium enemas, any shipments of tannic acid labeled to come within the  exemptions under 502(f) of the Act containing such phrases as:  ``Caution: For manufacturing, processing, or repackaging,'' ``For  prescription compounding,'' or ``Diagnostic reagent--For professional  use only'' will be regarded by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs as  misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f) of the Federal Food,  Drug, and Cosmetic Act unless the label and the labeling bear  conspicuously a warning to the effect: ``Warning-- Not for use in  enemas.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any tannic acid intended for use by man and found within the  jurisdiction of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act labeled  contrary to this section after 60 days from the date of its publication  in the Federal Register may be made the subject of regulatory  proceedings.</p>
