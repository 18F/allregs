                            <p class="depth0">The Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) was established by section 29 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. Consisting of a maximum of 15 members, it reviews and reports on safety studies and applications for construction permits and facility operating licenses; advises the Commission with regard to hazards of proposed or existing reactor facilities and the adequacy of proposed reactor safety standards; upon request of the Department of Energy (DOE), reviews and advises with regard to the hazards of DOE nuclear activities and facilities; reviews any generic issues or other matters referred to it by the Commission for advice. The Committee, on its own initiative, may conduct reviews of specific generic matters or nuclear facility safety-related items. The ACRS conducts studies of reactor safety research and submits reports thereon to the U.S. Congress and the NRC as appropriate.</p>
