                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The policies and procedures of this subpart apply to Housing Assistance Payments under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 on behalf of Eligible Families in Eligible Projects (see definitions in Sec. 886.102).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The primary goal of the Section 8 Loan Management Set-Aside Program is to reduce claims on the Department's insurance fund by aiding those FHA-insured or Secretary-Held projects with immediately or potentially serious financial difficulties. A first priority should be given to projects with presently serious financial problems, which are likely to result in a claim on the insurance fund in the near future. To the extent resources remain available, assistance also may be provided to projects with potentially serious financial problems which, on the basis of financial and/or management analysis, appear to have a high probability of producing a claim on the insurance fund within approximately the next five years.
