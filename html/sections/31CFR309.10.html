However, the Secretary of the Treasury expressly reserves the right  on any occasion to accept non-competitive tenders entered in accordance  with specific offerings, to reject any or all tenders or parts of  tenders, and to award less than the amount applied for; and any action  he may take in any such respect or respects shall be final.</p>
