If the vessel has  single skin construction, the underwater portion of the tank need not be  examined unless deemed necessary by the Officer in Charge, Marine  Inspection. If an external examination of the tank is not possible  because of insulation, the owner shall ensure that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The amount of insulation deemed necessary by the marine  inspector is removed during each cargo tank internal inspection to allow  spot external examination of the tanks and insulation; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The thickness of the tanks is gauged by a nondestructive means  accepted by the marine inspector without the removal of insulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If required by the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection the  owner shall conduct nondestructive testing of each tank designated by  the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection in accordance with Sec.   151.04-7.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection considers a  hydrostatic test necessary to determine the condition of the tanks, the  owner shall perform the test at a pressure of 1\1/2\ times the tank's--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Maximum allowable pressure, as determined by the safety relief  valve setting; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Design pressure, when cargo tanks operate at maximum allowable  pressures reduced below the design pressure in order to satisfy special  mechanical stress relief requirements.</p><p class="depth3">Note: See the ASME Code, Section VIII, Appendix 3 for information on  design pressure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Quick closing valves shall be tested by operating the emergency  shutoff system from each operating point at the time of each vessel's  inspection for certification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Excess flow valves shall be inspected at the time of inspection  for certification. The Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, shall  satisfy himself that the valve is in working condition by visual  inspection, and if this is impossible, by one of the following means:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Removing the valve and bench testing ashore; the valve shall  close at or below its rated closing flow.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> By any other means acceptable to the Officer in Charge, Marine  Inspection, which will demonstrate that the valve is operable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Pressure vacuum relief valves shall be examined to determine  that the operating mechanism is free and capable of activation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Safety relief valves shall be tested by bench testing or other  suitable means. The valves shall relieve and reseat within the design  tolerances of the set pressure, or it shall be removed and reset prior  to being returned to service. This test shall be conducted at the time  of the inspection for certification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Cargo hose stored on board the vessel which is used in  transferring cargoes listed in Table 151.05 shall be inspected every 2  years. This inspection shall consist of a visual examination and a  hydrostatic test of 1\1/2\ times the maximum pressure to which the hose  will be subjected in service. The date of the most recent inspection and  the test pressure shall be stenciled or otherwise marked on the hose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Cargo piping shall be inspected and tested at the same time as  the cargo tanks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> If the tank is a pressure vessel type cargo tank with an  internal inspection interval of 10 years, and is 30 years old or older,  determined from the date it was built, the owner shall conduct  nondestructive testing of each   tank in accordance with Sec.  151.04-7, during each internal inspection.
