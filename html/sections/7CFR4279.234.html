                            <p class="depth0">Instead of the provisions found in Sec. 4279.131, the provisions of  this section apply to loans guaranteed under this subpart. For all  applications for guarantee, the lender must prepare a credit evaluation.  An acceptable credit evaluation must:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Use credit documentation procedures and an underwriting process  that are consistent with generally accepted commercial lending  practices, and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Include an analysis of the credit factors associated with each  guarantee application, including consideration of each of the following  five elements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Credit worthiness. Those financial qualities that generally make  the borrower more likely to meet its obligations as demonstrated by its  credit history.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cash flow. A borrower's ability to produce sufficient cash to  repay the loan as agreed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Capital. The financial resources that the borrower currently has  and those it is likely to have when payments are due. The borrower must  be adequately capitalized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Collateral. The assets pledged by the borrower in support of the  loan, including processing technology owned by the borrower and  excluding assets acquired with other Federal funds. Collateral must have  documented value sufficient to protect the interest of the lender and  the Agency, and the discounted collateral value must be at least equal  to the loan amount. Lenders will discount collateral consistent with  sound loan-to-value policy. The Agency may consider the value of  qualified intellectual property, as defined in Sec. 4279.2, arrived at  in accordance with GAAP standards. The value of the intellectual  property may not exceed 30 percent of the total value of all collateral.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If there is an established market for the intellectual property,  the value of the intellectual property will be valued according to the  lender's standard discounting practice for intellectual property for  determining adequacy of collateral.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If there is no established market for the intellectual  property, the value of the intellectual property will be valued not  greater than 25 percent, as determined by the Agency, for determining  adequacy of collateral.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Conditions. The general business environment and status of the  borrower's industry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When determining the credit quality of the borrower, the lender  must include the following in its analysis:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The borrower shall demonstrate that it will be able to provide  equity in the project of not less than 20 percent of eligible project  costs at the time the loan is closed. For existing biorefineries, the  fair market value of project equity (including the guaranteed loan being  applied for) in real property and equipment and the value of qualified  intellectual property based on the audited financial statements in  accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles may be  substituted in whole or in part to meet the equity requirement. However,  the appraisal completed to establish the fair market value of the real  property and equipment must not be more than 1 year old. The Agency may  require the lender to provide a more recent appraisal in order to  reflect current market conditions. The appraisal used to establish fair  market value of the real property and equipment must conform to the  requirements of Sec. 4279.244. Otherwise, equity must be in the form of  cash and cannot include other direct Federal funding (i.e., loans and  grants).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The credit analysis must also include spreadsheets of the  balance sheets and income statements of the borrower for the 3 previous  years (for existing businesses), pro forma balance sheets at startup,  and projected yearend balance sheets and income statements for a period  of not less than 3 years of stabilized operation, with appropriate  ratios and comparisons with industrial standards (such as Dun &  Bradstreet or Robert Morris Associates) to the extent industrial  standards are available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All data must be shown in total dollars and also in common size  form, obtained by expressing all balance   sheet items as a percentage of assets and all income and expense items  as a percentage of sales.    Sec. Sec. 4279.235-4279.236  [Reserved]</p>
