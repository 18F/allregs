                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To the extent actions are not protected from disclosure by existing law applicable to the agency's operation, FDA will involve the public in preparing and implementing its NEPA procedures and will provide public notice of NEPA-related hearings, public meetings, and the availability of environmental documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Many FDA actions involving investigations, review, and approval of applications, and premarket notifications for human drugs, animal drugs, biologic products, and devices are protected from disclosure under the Trade Secret Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905, and 301(j) of the act. These actions are also protected from disclosure under FDA's regulations including part 20, Sec. Sec. 312.130(a), 314.430(b), 514.11(b), 514.12(a), 601.50(a), 601.51(a), 807.95(b), 812.38(a), and 814.9(b) of this chapter. Even the existence of applications for human drugs, animal drugs, biologic products, and devices is protected from disclosure under these regulations. Therefore, unless the existence of applications for human drugs, animal drugs, biologic products, or premarket notification for devices has been made publicly available, the release of the environmental document before approval of human drugs, animal drugs, biologic products, and devices is inconsistent with statutory requirements imposed on FDA. Appropriate environmental documents, comments, and responses will be included in the administrative record to the extent allowed by applicable laws.</p>
