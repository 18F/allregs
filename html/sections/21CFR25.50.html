Even the existence of applications for human drugs, animal  drugs, biologic products, and devices is protected from disclosure under  these regulations. Therefore, unless the existence of applications for  human drugs, animal drugs, biologic products, or premarket notification  for devices has been made publicly available, the release of the  environmental document before approval of human drugs, animal drugs,  biologic products, and devices is inconsistent with statutory  requirements imposed on FDA. Appropriate environmental documents,  comments, and responses will be included in the administrative record to  the extent allowed by applicable laws.</p>
