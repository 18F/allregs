                                Sec. 327.6  Collecting personal information.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Collect directly from the individual. To the greatest extent practicable, collect personal information directly from the individual to whom it pertains if the information may be used in making any determination about the rights, privileges, or benefits of the individual under any Federal program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Collecting personal information from third parties. It may not be practical to collect personal information directly from an individual in all cases. Some examples of this are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Verification of information through third party sources for security or employment suitability determinations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Seeking third party opinions such as supervisory comments as to job knowledge, duty performance, or other opinion-type evaluations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When obtaining the needed information directly from the individual is exceptionally difficult or may result in unreasonable costs; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Contacting a third party at the request of the individual to furnish certain information such as exact periods of employment, termination dates,

copies of records, or similar information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Collecting social security numbers (SSNs). (1) It is unlawful for DeCA to deny an individual any right, benefit, or privilege provided by law because an individual refuses to provide his or her SSN. Executive Order 9397 authorizes solicitation and use of SSNs as numerical identifiers for individuals in most Federal record systems, however, it does not provide mandatory authority for soliciting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When an individual is requested to provide their SSN, they must be told:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> the uses that will be made of the SSN;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The statute, regulation or rule authorizing the solicitation of the SSN; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Whether providingthe SSN is voluntary or mandatory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Once the SSN has been furnished for the purpose of establishing a record, the notification in paragraph (c)(2) of this section is not required if the individual is only requested to furnish or verify the SSNs for identification purposes in connection with the normal use of his or her records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Privacy act statements. When a DeCA individual is requested to furnish personal information about himself or herself for inclusion in a system of records, a Privacy Act Statement is required regardless of the medium used to collect the information, e.g., forms, personal interviews, telephonic interviews. The statement allows the individual to make a decision whether to provide the information requested. The statement will be concise, curent, and easily understood and must state whether providing the information is voluntary or mandatory. if furnishing the data is mandatory, a Federal statute, Executive Order, regulation or other lawful order must be cited. If the personal information solicited is not to be incorporated into a DeCA system of records, a PA statement is not required. This information obtained without the PA statement will not be incorporated into any DeCA systems of records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The DeCA Privacy Act Statement will include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The specific Federal statute or Executive Order that authorized collection of the requested information;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The principal purpose or purposes for which the information is to be used;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The routine uses that will be made of the information;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Whether providing the information is voluntary or mandatory; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The effects on the individual if he or she chooses not to provide the requested information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Forms. When DeCA uses forms to collect personal information, placement of the Privacy Act advisory statement should be in the following order of preference:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Below the title of the form and positioned so the individual will be advised of the requested information,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Within the body of the form with a notation of its location below the title of the form,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> On the reverse of the form with a notation of its location below the title of the form,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Attached to the form as a tear-off sheet, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Issued as a separate supplement to the form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Forms issued by non-DoD Activities. Ensure that the statement prepared by the originating agency on their forms is adequate for the purpose for which DeCA will use the form. If the statement is inadequate, DeCA will prepare a new statement before using the form. Forms issued by other agencies not subject to the Privacy Act but its use requires DeCA to collect personal data, a Privacy Act Statement will be added.</p>
