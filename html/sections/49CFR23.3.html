                            <p class="depth0">Administrator means the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).</p><p class="depth0">Affiliation has the same meaning the term has in the Small Business Administration (SBA) regulations, 13 CFR part 121, except that the provisions of SBA regulations concerning affiliation in the context of joint ventures (13 CFR Sec. 121.103(f)) do not apply to this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Except as otherwise provided in 13 CFR part 121, concerns are affiliates of

each other when, either directly or indirectly:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> One concern controls or has the power to control the other; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> A third party or parties controls or has the power to control both; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> An identity of interest between or among parties exists such that affiliation may be found.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> In determining whether affiliation exists, it is necessary to consider all appropriate factors, including common ownership, common management, and contractual relationships. Affiliates must be considered together in determining whether a concern meets small business size criteria and the statutory cap on the participation of firms in the ACDBE program.</p><p class="depth0">Airport Concession Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (ACDBE) means a concession that is a for-profit small business concern--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> That is at least 51 percent owned by one or more individuals who are both socially and economically disadvantaged or, in the case of a corporation, in which 51 percent of the stock is owned by one or more such individuals; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Whose management and daily business operations are controlled by one or more of the socially and economically disadvantaged individuals who own it.</p><p class="depth0">Alaska Native Corporation (ANC) means any Regional Corporation, Village Corporation, Urban Corporation, or Group Corporation organized under the laws of the State of Alaska in accordance with the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.)</p><p class="depth0">Car dealership means an establishment primarily engaged in the retail sale of new and/or used automobiles. Car dealerships frequently maintain repair departments and carry stocks of replacement parts, tires, batteries, and automotive accessories. Such establishments also frequently sell pickup trucks and vans at retail. In the standard industrial classification system, car dealerships are categorized in NAICS code 441110.</p><p class="depth0">Concession means one or more of the types of for-profit businesses listed in paragraph (1) or (2) of this definition:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> A business, located on an airport subject to this part, that is engaged in the sale of consumer goods or services to the public under an agreement with the recipient, another concessionaire, or the owner or lessee of a terminal, if other than the recipient.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> A business conducting one or more of the following covered activities, even if it does not maintain an office, store, or other business location on an airport subject to this part, as long as the activities take place on the airport: Management contracts and subcontracts, a web-based or other electronic business in a terminal or which passengers can access at the terminal, an advertising business that provides advertising displays or messages to the public on the airport, or a business that provides goods and services to concessionaires.</p><p class="depth2">Example to paragraph (2): A supplier of goods or a management contractor maintains its office or primary place of business off the airport. However the supplier provides goods to a retail establishment in the airport; or the management contractor operates the parking facility on the airport. These businesses are considered concessions for purposes of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of this subpart, a business is not considered to be ``located on the airport'' solely because it picks up and/or delivers customers under a permit, license, or other agreement. For example, providers of taxi, limousine, car rental, or hotel services are not considered to be located on the airport just because they send shuttles onto airport grounds to pick up passengers or drop them off. A business is considered to be ``located on the airport,'' however, if it has an on-airport facility. Such facilities include in the case of a taxi operator, a dispatcher; in the case of a limousine, a booth selling tickets to the public; in the case of a car rental company, a counter at which its services are sold to the public or a ready return facility; and in the case of a hotel operator, a hotel located anywhere on airport property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Any business meeting the definition of concession is covered by this subpart, regardless of the name given to the agreement with the recipient, concessionaire, or airport terminal owner or lessee.

operated under various types of agreements, including but not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Leases.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Subleases.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> Permits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iv)</em> Contracts or subcontracts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(v)</em> Other instruments or arrangements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(5)</em> The conduct of an aeronautical activity is not considered a concession for purposes of this subpart. Aeronautical activities include scheduled and non-scheduled air carriers, air taxis, air charters, and air couriers, in their normal passenger or freight carrying capacities; fixed base operators; flight schools; recreational service providers (e.g., sky-diving, parachute-jumping, flying guides); and air tour services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(6)</em> Other examples of entities that do not meet the definition of a concession include flight kitchens and in-flight caterers servicing air carriers, government agencies, industrial plants, farm leases, individuals leasing hangar space, custodial and security contracts, telephone and electric service to the airport facility, holding companies, and skycap services under contract with an air carrier or airport.</p><p class="depth0">Concessionaire means a firm that owns and controls a concession or a portion of a concession.</p><p class="depth0">Department (DOT) means the U.S. Department of Transportation, including the Office of the Secretary and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).</p><p class="depth0">Direct ownership arrangement means a joint venture, partnership, sublease, licensee, franchise, or other arrangement in which a firm owns and controls a concession.</p><p class="depth0">Good faith efforts means efforts to achieve an ACDBE goal or other requirement of this part that, by their scope, intensity, and appropriateness to the objective, can reasonably be expected to meet the program requirement.</p><p class="depth0">Immediate family member means father, mother, husband, wife, son, daughter, brother, sister, grandmother, grandfather, grandson, granddaughter, mother-in-law, father-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, or registered domestic partner.</p><p class="depth0">Indian tribe means any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community of Indians, including any ANC, which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians, or is recognized as such by the State in which the tribe, band, nation, group, or community resides.

Joint venture entities are not certified as ACDBEs.</p><p class="depth0">Large hub primary airport means a commercial service airport that has a number of passenger boardings equal to at least one percent of all passenger boardings in the United States.</p><p class="depth0">Management contract or subcontract means an agreement with a recipient or another management contractor under which a firm directs or operates one or more business activities, the assets of which are owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by the recipient. The managing agent generally receives, as compensation, a flat fee or a percentage of the gross receipts or profit from the business activity. For purposes of this subpart, the business activity operated or directed by the managing agent must be other than an aeronautical activity, be located at an airport subject to this subpart, and be engaged in the sale of consumer goods or provision of services to the public.</p><p class="depth0">Material amendment means a significant change to the basic rights or obligations of the parties to a concession agreement.
