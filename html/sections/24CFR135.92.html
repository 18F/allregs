III. Examples of Procurement Procedures That Provide for Preference for</p><p class="depth0">Section 3 Business Concerns</p><p class="depth0">This Section III provides specific procedures that may be followed by recipients and contractors (collectively, referred to as the ``contracting party'') for implementing the section 3 contracting preference for each of

the competitive procurement methods authorized in 24 CFR 85.36(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Small Purchase Procedures. For section 3 covered contracts aggregating no more than $25,000, the methods set forth in this paragraph (1) or the more formal procedures set forth in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this Section III may be utilized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Solicitation. (A) Quotations may be solicited by telephone, letter or other informal procedure provided that the manner of solicitation provides for participation by a reasonable number of competitive sources. At the time of solicitation, the parties must be informed of:--the section 3 covered contract to be awarded with sufficient specificity;--the time within which quotations must be submitted; and--the information that must be submitted with each quotation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(A)</em> Quotations may be solicited by telephone, letter or other informal procedure provided that the manner of solicitation provides for participation by a reasonable number of competitive sources. At the time of solicitation, the parties must be informed of:--the section 3 covered contract to be awarded with sufficient specificity;--the time within which quotations must be submitted; and--the information that must be submitted with each quotation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(B)</em> If the method described in paragraph (i)(A) is utilized, there must be an attempt to obtain quotations from a minimum of three qualified sources in order to promote competition. Fewer than three quotations are acceptable when the contracting party has attempted, but has been unable, to obtain a sufficient number of competitive quotations. In unusual circumstances, the contracting party may accept the sole quotation received in response to a solicitation provided the price is reasonable. In all cases, the contracting party shall document the circumstances when it has been unable to obtain at least three quotations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Award. (A) Where the section 3 covered contract is to be awarded based upon the lowest price, the contract shall be awarded to the qualified section 3 business concern with the lowest responsive quotation, if it is reasonable and no more than 10 percent higher than the quotation of the lowest responsive quotation from any qualified source. If no responsive quotation by a qualified section 3 business concern is within 10 percent of the lowest responsive quotation from any qualified source, the award shall be made to the source with the lowest quotation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(A)</em> Where the section 3 covered contract is to be awarded based upon the lowest price, the contract shall be awarded to the qualified section 3 business concern with the lowest responsive quotation, if it is reasonable and no more than 10 percent higher than the quotation of the lowest responsive quotation from any qualified source. If no responsive quotation by a qualified section 3 business concern is within 10 percent of the lowest responsive quotation from any qualified source, the award shall be made to the source with the lowest quotation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(B)</em> Where the section 3 covered contract is to be awarded based on factors other than price, a request for quotations shall be issued by developing the particulars of the solicitation, including a rating system for the assignment of points to evaluate the merits of each quotation. The solicitation shall identify all factors to be considered, including price or cost. The rating system shall provide for a range of 15 to 25 percent of the total number of available rating points to be set aside for the provision of preference for section 3 business concerns. The purchase order shall be awarded to the responsible firm whose quotation is the most advantageous, considering price and all other factors specified in the rating system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Procurement by sealed bids (Invitations for Bids). Preference in the award of section 3 covered contracts that are awarded under a sealed bid (IFB) process may be provided as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Bids shall be solicited from all businesses (section 3 business concerns, and non-section 3 business concerns). An award shall be made to the qualified section 3 business concern with the highest priority ranking and with the lowest responsive bid if that bid--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(A)</em> is within the maximum total contract price established in the contracting party's budget for the specific project for which bids are being taken, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(B)</em> is not more than ``X'' higher than the total bid price of the lowest responsive bid from any responsible bidder. ``X'' is determined as follows:

(i) For contracts and subcontracts awarded under the competitive proposals method of procurement (24 CFR 85.36(d)(3)), a Request for Proposals (RFP) shall identify all evaluation factors (and their relative importance) to be used to rate proposals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> For contracts and subcontracts awarded under the competitive proposals method of procurement (24 CFR 85.36(d)(3)), a Request for Proposals (RFP) shall identify all evaluation factors (and their relative importance) to be used to rate proposals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> One of the evaluation factors shall address both the preference for section 3 business concerns and the acceptability of the strategy for meeting the greatest extent feasible requirement (section 3 strategy), as disclosed in proposals submitted by all business concerns (section 3 and non-section 3 business concerns). This factor shall provide for a range of 15 to 25 percent of the total number of available points to be set aside for the evaluation of these two components.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> The component of this evaluation factor designed to address the preference for section 3 business concerns must establish a preference for these business concerns in the order of priority ranking as described in 24 CFR 135.36.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iv)</em> With respect to the second component (the acceptability of the section 3 strategy), the RFP shall require the disclosure of the contractor's section 3 strategy to comply with the section 3 training and employment preference, or contracting preference, or both, if applicable. A determination of the contractor's responsibility will include the submission of an acceptable section 3 strategy. The contract award shall be made to the responsible firm (either section 3 or non-section 3 business concern) whose proposal is determined most advantageous, considering price and all other factors specified in the RFP.</p>
