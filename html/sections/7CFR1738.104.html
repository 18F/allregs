                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Agency will make information available to prospective  applicants to allow a preliminary assessment of a proposed service  area's eligibility. At a minimum, the prospective applicant will be able  to determine:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether the proposed service area is located in a rural area;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether the proposed service area overlaps with any part of a  borrower's or grantee's service area; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether the proposed service area overlaps with any part of a  proposed service area in a pending application for a loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A preliminary assessment of service area eligibility does not  account for all eligibility factors, and the situation within a proposed  service area may   change between the preliminary assessment and application submission. A  preliminary assessment indicating that a proposed service area may be  eligible does not guarantee that the area will remain eligible at the  time of application.    Sec. Sec. 1738.105-1738.150  [Reserved]</p>
