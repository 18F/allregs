Note 8...............  105.................----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Notes: 1. The percent filling density for liquefied gases is hereby defined as the percent ratio of the mass of</p><p class="depth2">gas in the tank to the mass of water that the tank will hold. For determining the water capacity of the tank</p><p class="depth2">in kilograms, the mass of 1 L of water at 15.5 C in air is 1 kg. (the mass of one gallon of water at 60 F in</p><p class="depth2">air is 8.32828 pounds).2. The liquefied gas must be loaded so that the outage is at least two percent of the total capacity of the tank</p><p class="depth2">at the reference temperature of 46 C (115 F) for a noninsulated tank; 43 C (110 F) for a tank having a thermal</p><p class="depth2">protection system incorporating a metal jacket that provides an overall thermal conductance at 15.5 C (60 F)</p><p class="depth2">of no more than 10.22 kilojoules per hour per square meter per degree Celsius (0.5 Btu per hour/per square</p><p class="depth2">foot/per degree F) temperature differential; and 41 C (105 F) for an insulated tank having an insulation</p><p class="depth2">system incorporating a metal jacket that provides an overall thermal conductance at 15.5 C (60 F) of no more</p><p class="depth2">than 1.5333 kilojoules per hour per square meter per degree Celsius (0.075 Btu per hour/per square foot/per</p><p class="depth2">degree F) temperature differential.3. The requirements of Sec. 173.24b(a) apply.4. The gas pressure at 54.44 C (130 F.) in any non-insulated tank car may not exceed \7/10\ of the marked test</p><p class="depth2">pressure, except that a tank may be charged with helium to a pressure 10 percent in excess of the marked</p><p class="depth2">maximum gas pressure at 54.44 C (130 F.) of each tank.5. The liquid portion of the gas at -17.77 C (0 F.) must not completely fill the tank.6. The maximum permitted filling density is 125 percent. The quantity of chlorine loaded into a single unit-tank</p><p class="depth2">car may not be loaded in excess of the normal lading weights nor in excess of 81.65 Mg (90 tons).7. 89 percent maximum to 80.1 percent minimum at a test pressure of 6.2 Bar (90 psig).8. 59.6 percent maximum to 53.6 percent minimum at a test pressure of 7.2 Bar (105 psig).9. For a liquefied petroleum gas, the liquefied gas must be loaded so that the outage is at least one percent of</p><p class="depth2">the total capacity of the tank at the reference temperature of 46 C (115 F) for a noninsulated tank; 43 C (110</p><p class="depth2">F) for a tank having a thermal protection system incorporating a metal jacket that provides an overall thermal</p><p class="depth2">conductance at 15.5 C (60 F) of no more than 10.22 kilojoules per hour per square meter per degree Celsius</p><p class="depth2">(0.5 Btu per hour/per square foot/per degree F) temperature differential; and 41 C (105 F) for an insulated</p><p class="depth2">tank having an insulation system incorporating a metal jacket that provides an overall thermal conductance at</p><p class="depth2">15.5 C (60 F) of no more than 1.5333 kilojoules per hour per square meter per degree Celsius (0.075 Btu per</p><p class="depth2">hour/per square foot/per degree F) temperature differential.10. For liquefied petroleum gas and anhydrous ammonia, during the months of November through March (winter), the</p><p class="depth2">following reference temperatures may be used: 38 C (100 F) for a noninsulated tank; 32 C (90 F) for a tank</p><p class="depth2">having a thermal protection system incorporating a metal jacket that provides an overall thermal conductance</p><p class="depth2">at 15.5 C (60 F) of no more than 10.22 kilojoules per hour per square meter per degree Celsius (0.5 Btu per</p><p class="depth2">hour/per square foot/per degree F) temperature differential; and 29 C (85 F) for an insulated tank having an</p><p class="depth2">insulation system incorporating a metal jacket and insulation that provides an overall thermal conductance at</p><p class="depth2">15.5 C (60 F) of no more than 1.5333 kilojoules per hour per square meter per degree Celsius (0.075 Btu per</p><p class="depth2">hour/per square foot/per degree F) temperature differential. The winter reference temperatures may only be</p><p class="depth2">used for a tank car shipped directly to a consumer for unloading and not stored in transit. The offeror of the</p><p class="depth2">tank must inform each customer that the tank car was filled based on winter reference temperatures. The tank</p><p class="depth2">must be unloaded as soon as possible after March in order to retain the specified outage and to prevent a</p><p class="depth2">release of hazardous material which might occur due to the tank car becoming liquid full at higher</p><p class="depth2">temperatures.11. For materials poisonous by inhalation, the single unit tank car tanks authorized are only those cars</p><p class="depth2">approved by the Tank Car Committee for transportation of the specified material and built prior to March 16,</p><p class="depth2">2009.12. Except as provided by paragraph (d) of this section, for materials poisonous by inhalation, fusion-welded</p><p class="depth2">tank car tanks built on or after March 16, 2009 used for the transportation of the PIH materials noted, must</p><p class="depth2">meet the applicable authorized tank car specification and must be equipped with a head shield as prescribed in</p><p class="depth2">Sec. 179.16(c)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Alternative tank car tanks for materials poisonous by inhalation.
