                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Higher standards. Nothing in this subpart shall authorize non-compliance with any Federal or State law, regulation, or municipal ordinance establishing a higher standard. If more than one standard within this subpart applies to a single activity the higher standard shall be applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Apprentices.

Some sections in this subpart contain an exemption for the employment of student-learners. Such an exemption shall apply when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The student-learner is enrolled in a course of study and training in a cooperative vocational training program under a recognized State or local educational authority or in a course of study in a substantially similar program conducted by a private school and;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Such student-learner is employed under a written agreement which provides:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That the work of the student-learner in the ocupations declared particularly hazardous shall be incidental to his training;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That such work shall be intermittent and for short periods of time, and under the direct and close supervision of a qualified and experienced person;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That safety instructions shall be given by the school and correlated by the employer with on-the-job training; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> That a schedule of organized and progressive work processes to be performed on the job shall have been prepared.
Each such written agreement shall contain the name of student-learner, and shall be signed by the employer and the school coordinator or principal. Copies of each agreement shall be kept on file by both the school and the employer. This exemption for the employment of student-learners may be revoked in any individual situation where it is found that reasonable precautions have not been observed for the safety of minors employed thereunder. A high school graduate may be employed in an occupation in which he has completed training as provided in this paragraph as a student-learner, even though he is not yet 18 years of age.
