In the event there are any such pending claims to the knowledge of the Owner, PHA or HUD, the Owner will be

required to place sufficient amount in escrow, as determined by the PHA or HUD, to assure such payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Actual cost and rehabilitation loan certifications. The Owner must provide the PHA with a certification of the costs incurred for the rehabilitation and any temporary relocation as well as the interest rate and term of any rehabilitation loan. The Owner must certify that these are the actual costs, interest rate, and term.

An escrow fund determined by the PHA to be sufficient to assure completion for items of delayed completion must be required, as well as a written agreement between the PHA and the Owner, to be included as an exhibit to the Contract, specifying the schedule for completion. If the items are not completed within the agreed time period, the PHA may terminate the Contract or exercise other rights under the Contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If other deficiencies exist, the PHA must determine whether and to what extent the deficiencies are correctable, and whether the Contract Rents should be reduced. The Owner must be notified of the PHA's decision. If the corrections required by the PHA are possible, the PHA and the Owner must enter into an agreement for the correction of the deficiencies within a specified time. If the deficiencies are corrected within the agreed period of time, the PHA must accept the unit(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Otherwise, the unit(s) may not be accepted, and the Owner must be notified with a statement of the reasons for nonacceptance.
