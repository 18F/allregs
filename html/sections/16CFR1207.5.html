The tests shall be carried out on a slide assembled and installed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The block shall be soaked in pool water for at least 3 minutes and placed at the midpoint of the wet step with the centroid of load of the block on the longitudinal axis of the step. The block shall be loaded symmetrically on its upper bearing surface with a weight of 3002 pounds (136.1.9 kg). A controlled and measured force shall be applied at the tangential load ring of the block tangent to the horizontal and increased at a rate of no more than 20 pounds (88.96 newtons) per second. If the block does not move at the point that the tangential load is equal to 105 pounds (467.1 newtons), the tread surface passes this performance test. Other force-creating means that produce equal forces on the block (3002lbs, 1,334 newtons) may be substituted for weights if they result in substantially identical slip-resistance measurements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Fastener requirements. Ladder treads shall be attached to the ladder rails in such a manner that continued intended use or reasonably foreseeable abuse shall not cause any fastener to loosen, crack, or break. All attachment methods that are used to hold the ladder tread to the ladder rails shall be permanent and tamperproof. If fasteners are used for the tread-rail attachment, the number and placement of such fasteners shall not cause a failure of the tread under the ladder loading conditions specified in this paragraph (c)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Aboveground pool ladders. Above-ground pool slides equipped with swing-up ladders shall be designed so that the ladders may be fixed in the up position by a tamperproof lock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Ladder platforms. Swimming pool slides whose height above the surface upon which the slide is mounted is greater than 7.5 feet (2.29 meters) shall have a platform built into the ladder. This platform shall be located at least 6 feet (1.83 meters) above the deck and shall have minimum dimensions of 12 by 12 inches (30.48x30.48 cm.). The floor of the platform shall have a slip-resistant surface whose performance exceeds the requirements of the tests specified in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B) of this section. A minimum dimension of two times the riser height shall be maintained from the platform to the top of

the slide runway. Transitional handrails shall be provided when a platform is used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Static load performance test. Ladder treads or rungs shall be capable of supporting a 300-pound (1,334-newton) static load in the center without failure or permanent deformation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Handrails. Swimming pool slide ladders shall be equipped with handrails to aid the slider in safely making the transition to the runway. The handrails shall extend no more than 18 inches (45.72 cm) above the top of the slide runway platform (see figure D1).[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC03OC91.020</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Size.

Handrails and their fasteners shall withstand allowable shear, bending, and cyclical loading in intended use and reasonably foreseeable abuse. All fasteners for handrail connections shall be vibrationproof, selflocking, and tamperproof. Threaded fasteners shall be capable of withstanding a 1-foot-pound (1,356-newton meter) back-off torque.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Sockets performance test. If handrail sockets are used, the handrail end shall be permanently fixed in the socket so that it cannot be pulled out or bent at the socket by a moment of 233 foot-pounds (316 newton-meters) applied clockwise around point A in figure E. The socket shall not permanently deform under the maximum applied loads.

If the handrail is in a socket or attached to the side of the slide runway rail, the attachment methods must be capable of withstanding all shear and bending forces induced by a 172-foot-pound (233-newton-meter) moment counterclockwise around point A in figure F.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC03OC91.023</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Performance tests--(A) Strength for climbing and falls. (1) Attach a pull loop to point C of the upper handrail (figure E). Point C is the point where a perpendicular to the axis of the handrail passes through point A, the socket, or other attachment point. Attach a stranded steel cable or wire rope to point C. All cables and ropes shall have at least a 1,000-pound (4,448-newton) tensile capacity. Attach a 162-pound (73.5-kg) weight to this cable at least 4 feet (1.22 meters) below point C. Observe any permanent deformation or bending on the hand-rail at point A. If none exists, the handrail passes this performance test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Lift the weight one foot (30.48 cm) from its maximum static position and drop it. Observe any permanent deformation of the handrail or its attachments at point A. If each handrail will still support the 162-pound (73.5-kg) weight for a period of 15 minutes and has not been bent more than 45[deg] from its original direction, it passes this performance test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Transition handrail strength. Rotate the assembled slide into the horizontal position on its side on a loading dock or other platform. Move the slide into such a position that the entire

handrail assembly overhangs the platform and level the slide. Fasten the slide firmly in this position and attach a 115-pound (52.2-kg) weight to point D, as shown in figure F, and check for any visible permanent deformation of the handrail at point A. If none exists, the handrails pass this performance test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Lubrication. Swimming pool slides shall either be equipped with a method of lubrication (for example, water) or have a similar coefficient of friction so that the slider has a smooth, continuous slide. If water is used, the nozzles, piping, or hoses that deliver water to the runway shall be recessed or designed in such a fashion as not to interfere with a slider's progress down the slide or create tripping hazards on the slide.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Runways--(1) Curvature.

With water off and the slide dry, center the pallet at the top of the runway and release. Measure the distance from the felt pen marked line to the centerline of the runway. If within 41 percent of the width measured from the centerline along the entire path and if the pallet does not contact the runway rails, the slide is dynamically balanced and passes this performance test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Runway side rails. Swimming pool slide runways shall have permanent runway side rails of at least 2 inches (5.08 cm) and height to prevent lateral discharge of the slider off the slide under intended use and reasonably foreseeable abuse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Runway side-rail heights. Runway side-rail heights shall be designed as a function of the maximum slide-slope angle (as shown in figure H). Table 2 that follows shows side-rail height versus maximum slide-slope angle. If the maximum slide-slope angle is not shown in table 2, the next higher side-rail height must be used. Maximum slide-slope angles shall not exceed 75[deg]. (See figure H.)

The path angle shall be determined by measuring the angle between a tangent to the path of the center of gravity (line X) and the horizontal taken through the center of gravity (line Y). At least five consecutive runs with the same subject shall be made in order that an average may be computed. \2\ Angle of attack shall be taken as the angle between the slider's longitudinal axis (Z) and the tangent to the path of his center of gravity (X). The slider's longitudinal axis shall be located by the vertical line that passes through his center of gravity when he stands erect. The slider shall wear usual swimming attire. The angle-of-attack measurement shall be made after the

slider's feet have cleared the slide, the distance between the end of the slide and his feet being less than 8 inches (20.3 cm). The slider's descent must be headfirst, prone, belly-down, and with arms extended in front. Except when starting, the slider shall not augment the slide trip by forcibly reacting with the slide through the use of his hands, arms, feet and/or legs. The slider's starting reactions with the slide shall be only as strong as necessary to start him moving. If the average angle of attack measured and computed in the above manner is equal to or greater than +15[deg], the slide passes this performance test.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ Maximum measurement variation of 15 percent.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC03OC91.026</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Runway exit lips.
