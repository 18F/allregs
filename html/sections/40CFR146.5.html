                            <p class="depth0">Injection wells are classified as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Class I. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Wells used by generators of hazardous waste or  owners or operators of hazardous waste management facilities to inject  hazardous waste beneath the lowermost formation containing, within one  quarter (\1/4\) mile of the well bore, an underground source of drinking  water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other industrial and municipal disposal wells which inject  fluids beneath the lowermost formation containing, within one quarter  mile of the well bore, an underground source of drinking water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Radioactive waste disposal wells which inject fluids below the  lowermost formation containing an underground source of drinking water  within one quarter mile of the well bore.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Class II. Wells which inject fluids:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Which are brought to the surface in connection with conventional  oil or natural gas production and may be commingled with waste waters  from gas plants which are an integral part of production operations,  unless those waters are classified as a hazardous waste at the time of  injection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For enhanced recovery of oil or natural gas; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For storage of hydrocarbons which are liquid at standard  temperature and pressure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Class III. Wells which inject for extraction of minerals  including:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Mining of sulfur by the Frasch process;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In situ production of uranium or other metals. This category  includes only in-situ production from ore bodies which have not been  conventionally mined. Solution mining of conventional mines such as  stopes leaching is included in Class V.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Solution mining of salts or potash.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Class IV. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Wells used by generators of hazardous waste or of  radioactive waste, by owners or operators of hazardous waste management  facilities, or by owners or operators of radioactive waste disposal  sites to dispose of hazardous waste or radioactive waste into a  formation which within one quarter (\1/4\) mile of the well contains an  underground source of drinking water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Wells used by generators of hazardous waste or of radioactive  waste, by owners or operators of hazardous waste management facilities,  or by owners or operators of radioactive waste disposal sites to dispose  of hazardous waste or radioactive waste above a formation which within  one quarter (\1/4\) mile of the well contains an underground source of  drinking water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Wells used by generators of hazardous waste or owners or  operators of hazardous waste management facilities to dispose of  hazardous waste, which cannot be classified under Sec.  146.05(a)(1) or  Sec.  146.05(d) (1) and (2) (e.g., wells used to dispose of hazardous  wastes into or above a formation which contains an aquifer which has  been exempted pursuant to Sec.  146.04).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Class V. Injection wells not included in Class I, II, III, IV or  VI. Specific types of Class V injection wells are also described in 40  CFR 144.81. Class V wells include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Air conditioning return flow wells used to return to the supply  aquifer the water used for heating or cooling in a heat pump;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cesspools including multiple dwelling, community or regional  cesspools, or other devices that receive wastes which have an open  bottom and sometimes have perforated sides. The UIC requirements do not  apply to single family residential cesspools nor to non-residential  cesspools which receive solely sanitary wastes and have the capacity to  serve fewer than 20 persons a day.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cooling water return flow wells used to inject water previously  used for cooling;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Drainage wells used to drain surface fluid, primarily storm  runoff, into a subsurface formation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Dry wells used for the injection of wastes into a subsurface  formation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Recharge wells used to replenish the water in an aquifer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Salt water intrusion barrier wells used to inject water into a  fresh water aquifer to prevent the intrusion of salt water into the  fresh water;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Sand backfill and other backfill wells used to inject a mixture  of water and sand, mill tailings or other solids into mined out portions  of subsurface mines whether what is injected is a radioactive waste or  not.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Septic system wells used to inject the waste or effluent from a  multiple dwelling, business establishment, community or regional  business establishment septic tank. The UIC requirements do not apply to  single family residential septic system wells, nor to non-residential  septic system wells which are used solely for the disposal of sanitary  waste and have the capacity to serve fewer than 20 persons a day.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Subsidence control wells (not used for the purpose of oil or  natural   gas production) used to inject fluids into a non-oil or gas producing  zone to reduce or eliminate subsidence associated with the overdraft of  fresh water;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Radioactive waste disposal wells other than Class IV;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Injection wells associated with the recovery of geothermal  energy for heating, aquaculture and production of electric power.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Wells used for solution mining of conventional mines such as  stopes leaching;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Wells used to inject spent brine into the same formation from  which it was withdrawn after extraction of halogens or their salts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> Injection wells used in experimental technologies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> Injection wells used for in situ recovery of lignite, coal, tar  sands, and oil shale.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Class VI. Wells that are not experimental in nature that are  used for geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide beneath the lowermost  formation containing a USDW; or, wells used for geologic sequestration  of carbon dioxide that have been granted a waiver of the injection depth  requirements pursuant to requirements at Sec.  146.95; or, wells used  for geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide that have received an  expansion to the areal extent of an existing Class II enhanced oil  recovery or enhanced gas recovery aquifer exemption pursuant to  Sec. Sec.  146.4 and 144.7(d) of this chapter.
