                                Sec. 3864.1  Millsite patents: General.

Sec. 3864.1-1  Application for patent.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Land entered as a millsite must be shown to be nonmineral. Millsites are simply auxiliary to the working of mineral claims. R.S. 2337 (30 U.S.C. 42) provides for the patenting of millsites.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To avail themselves of this provision of law, parties holding the possessory right to a vein or lode claim, and to a piece of nonmineral land not contiguous thereto for mining or milling purposes, not exceeding the quantity allowed for such purpose by R.S. 2337, or prior laws, under which the land was appropriated, the proprietors of such vein or lode may file in the proper office their application for a patent, which application, together with the plat and field notes, may include, embrace, and describe, in addition to the vein or lode claim, such noncontiguous millsite, and after due proceedings as to notice, etc., a patent will be issued conveying the same as one claim. The owner of a patented lode may, by an independent application, secure a millsite, if good faith is manifest in its use or occupation in connection with the lode and no adverse claim exists.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Act of March 18, 1960 (74 Stat. 7; 43 U.S.C. 42(b)), amends R.S. 2337 to allow the holders of possessory right in a placer claim to hold nonmineral land for mining, milling, processing beneficiation, or other operations in connection with the placer claim. Applications for patent for such millsites are subject to the same requirements as to survey and notice as one applicable to placer mining claims. No one millsite may exceed five acres and payment will be $2.50 per acre or fraction thereof.


Sec. 3864.1-2  Millsites applied for in conjunction with a lode claim.</p><p class="depth2">Where the original survey includes a lode claim and also a millsite the lode claim should be described in the plat and field notes as ``Sur. No. 37, A,'' and the millsite as ``Sur. No. 37, B,'' or whatever may be its appropriate numerical designation; the course and distance from a corner of the millsite to a corner of the lode claim to be invariably given in such plat and field notes, and a copy of the plat and notice of application for patent must be conspicuously posted upon the millsite as well as upon the vein or lode claim for the statutory period of 60 days. In making the entry no separate receipt or certificate need be issued for the millsite, but the whole area of both lode and millsite will be embraced in one entry, the price being $5 for each acre and fractional part of an acre embraced by such lode and millsite claim.


Sec. 3864.1-3  Millsites for quartz mills or reduction works.</p><p class="depth2">In case the owner of a quartz mill or reduction works is not the owner or

claimant of a vein or lode claim the law permits him to make application therefor in the same manner prescribed for mining claims, and after due notice and proceedings, in the absence of a valid adverse filing, to enter and receive a patent for his millsite at the price named in the preceding section.


Sec. 3864.1-4  Proof of nonmineral character.</p><p class="depth2">In every case there must be satisfactory proof that the land claimed as a millsite is not mineral in character, which proof may, where the matter is unquestioned, consist of the statement of two or more persons capable, from acquaintance with the land to testify understandingly.


Sec. 3864.1-5  Fees.</p><p class="depth2">An applicant for a millsite patent must pay fees as described in Sec. 3860.1.
