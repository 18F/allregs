Preference will be  given to items in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section.

The application will be evaluated  to determine whether the subject Center has a track record of  administering a nationally coordinated, regional or state-wide operated  project.

The Agency will  evaluate the applicant's demonstrated expertise in providing technical  assistance in Rural areas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Economic development.

Applications exceeding these minimum commitment  levels will receive more points.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Delivery.

The  Center's potential for delivering effective cooperative development  assistance, the expected effects of that assistance, the sustainability  of cooperative organizations receiving the assistance, and the  transferability of the Center's cooperative development strategy and  focus to other States will also be assessed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Work Plan/Budget.

Support documentation  should include recognition of rural values that balance employment  opportunities with environmental stewardship and other positive rural  amenities. Centers that demonstrate strong support from potential  beneficiaries and formal evidence of the Center's intent to coordinate  with other developmental organizations will receive more points than  those not evidencing such support and formal intent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Future support.
