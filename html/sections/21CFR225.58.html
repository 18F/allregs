The results of assays performed by State feed control officials may be considered toward fulfillment of the periodic assay requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where the results of assays indicate that the medicated feed is not in accord with label specifications or is not within permissible assay limits as specified in this chapter, investigation and corrective action shall be implemented and an original or copy of the record of such action maintained on the premises.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Corrective action shall include provisions for discontinuing distribution where the medicated feed fails to meet the labeled drug potency. Distribution of subsequent production of the particular feed shall not begin until it has been determined that proper control procedures have been established.
