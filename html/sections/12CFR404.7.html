                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section applies to all business information, as  defined in Sec. 404.2. Such information shall only be disclosed pursuant  to a FOIA request in accordance with this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(4)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Pre-disclosure notice to the business submitter. Whenever Ex-Im  Bank receives a FOIA request seeking disclosure of business information,  Ex-Im Bank shall provide prompt written notice to the submitter of such  information. This notice shall include a description or a copy of the  records containing the business information. Such notice shall not be  required, however, if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ex-Im Bank determines that the records shall not be disclosed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The records have been published or otherwise made available to  the public; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> disclosure of the records is required by law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Opportunity to object to disclosure. The business submitter  shall have ten working days from and including the date of the  notification letter to provide Ex-Im Bank with a detailed statement of  any objection to disclosure of the records. A submitter located outside  the United States shall have twenty working days to object to  disclosure. Ex-Im Bank may extend the time for objection upon timely  request from the submitter and for good cause shown. A statement of  objection must specify all grounds under the FOIA for withholding the  information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notice to the requester. The Freedom of Information and Privacy  Office shall notify the requester in writing whenever a business  submitter is afforded the opportunity to object to disclosure of records  pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Disclosure of confidential business information. Ex-Im Bank  shall consider any objections raised by the business submitter prior to  making its disclosure decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Notice of intent to disclose. Whenever Ex-Im Bank determines to  disclose business information over the objection of a business  submitter, Ex-Im Bank shall notify the business submitter, in writing,  of such determination, the reasons for the decision, and the expected  disclosure date. This notification--which shall be provided at least ten  days prior to the planned disclosure date and which shall include a copy  or description of the records at issue--is intended to afford the  submitter the opportunity to seek judicial review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Notice to requester of disclosure date. If Ex-Im Bank determines  to disclose records over a business submitter's objection, then Ex-Im  Bank shall notify the requester of the expected disclosure date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Appeal. Whenever Ex-Im Bank determines to disclose, pursuant to  an administrative appeal, business information that initially was  withheld from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), Ex-Im Bank shall  notify the business submitter. Such notice shall be in writing and shall  be provided ten working days prior to the proposed disclosure date. It  shall include a copy or description of the records at issue and a  statement of Ex-Im Bank's reasons for disclosure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Notice of FOIA lawsuit. Ex-Im Bank shall promptly notify the  submitter whenever a requester brings suit against Ex-Im Bank seeking to  compel the release of business information covered by this section. Ex- Im Bank shall promptly notify the requester when a submitter brings suit  against Ex-Im seeking to restrict the release of business information  that is covered by this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Exception. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this  part, Ex-Im Bank may, upon request or on its own initiative, publicly  disclose the parties to transactions for which Ex-Im Bank approves  support, the amount of such   support, the identity of any participants involved, a general  description of the related U.S. exports, and the country to which such  exports are destined.</p>
