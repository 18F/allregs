                                Sec. 180.1011  Viable spores of the microorganism Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner; exemption from the requirement of a tolerance.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For the purposes of this section the microbial insecticide for  which exemption from the requirement of a tolerance is being established  shall have the following specifications:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The microorganism shall be an authentic strain of Bacillus  thuringiensis Berliner conforming to the morphological and biochemical  characteristics of Bacillus thuringiensis as described in Bergey's  Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, Eighth Edition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Spore preparations of Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner shall be  produced by pure culture fermentation procedures with adequate control  measures   during production to detect any changes from the characteristics of the  parent strain or contamination by other microorganisms.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each lot of spore preparation, prior to the addition of other  materials, shall be tested by subcutaneous injection of at least 1  million spores into each of five laboratory test mice weighing 17 grams  to 23 grams. Such test shall show no evidence of infection or injury in  the test animals when observed for 7 days following injection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Spore preparations shall be free of the Bacillus thuringiensis  [beta]-exotoxin when tested with the fly larvae toxicity test  (``Microbial Control of Insects and Mites,'' R.P.M. Bond et al., p. 280  ff., 1971). This specification can be satisfied either by determining  that each master seed lot brought into production is a Bacillus  thuringiensis strain which does not produce [beta]-exotoxin under  standard manufacturing conditions or by periodically determining that  [beta]-exotoxin synthesized during spore production is eliminated by the  subsequent spore-harvesting procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exemption from the requirement of a tolerance is established for  residues of the microbial insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner,  as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, in or on honey and  honeycomb and all other raw agricultural commodities when it is applied  either to growing crops, or when it is applied after harvest in  accordance with good agricultural practices.
