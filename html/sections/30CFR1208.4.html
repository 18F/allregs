                                Sec. 1208.4  Royalty oil sales to eligible refiners.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determination to take royalty oil in kind. The Secretary may  evaluate crude oil market conditions from time to time. The evaluation  will include, among other things, the availability of crude oil and the  crude oil requirements of the Federal Government, primarily those  requirements concerning matters of national interest and defense. The  Secretary will review these items and will determine whether eligible  refiners have access to adequate supplies of crude oil and whether such  oil is available to eligible refiners at equitable prices. Such  determinations may be made on a regional basis. The determination by the  Secretary shall be published in the Federal Register concurrent with or  included in the ``Notice of Availability of Royalty Oil'' required by  Sec. 1208.5.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Sale to eligible refiners. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon a determination by the  Secretary under paragraph (a) of this section that eligible refiners do  not have access to adequate supplies of crude oil at equitable prices,  the Secretary, at his or her discretion, may elect to take in kind some  or all of the royalty oil accruing to the United States from oil and gas  leases on Federal lands onshore and on the OCS. The Secretary may  authorize ONRR to offer royalty oil for sale to eligible refiners only  for use in their refineries and not for resale (other than under an  exchange agreement).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All sales of royalty oil from onshore leases will be priced at  the royalty value that would have been determined for that oil pursuant  to 30 CFR part 1206 had the royalties been paid in value rather than  taken in kind. All sales of royalty oil from OCS leases will be priced  at the fair market value of the oil including associated transportation  costs to the designated delivery point, if applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An eligible refiner must have a representative at a sale in  order to participate. The Secretary may, at his or her discretion,  establish purchase limitations and withhold any royalty oil from any  offering.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon a determination by the Secretary under paragraph (a) of  this section that eligible refiners do have access to adequate supplies  of crude oil at equitable prices, ONRR will not take royalties in kind  from oil and gas leases for exclusive sale to such refiners. Such  determinations may be made on a regional basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Interim sales. The ONRR generally will not conduct interim  sales. However, interim sales may be held at the discretion of the  Secretary if substantial addition royalty oil becomes available. The  potentially eligible refiners, individually or collectively, must submit  documentation demonstrating that adequate supplies of crude oil at  equitable prices are not available for purchase. Although sufficient  documentation must be submitted, it is not mandatory for each  potentially eligible refiner to participate in a submission of such  documentation to be determined eligible. The documentation must be  submitted to ONRR for a determination as to whether an interim sale is  needed.  [52 FR 41913, Oct. 30, 1987, as amended at 66 FR 28657, May 24, 2001]</p>
