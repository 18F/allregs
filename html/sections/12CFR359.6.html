For filing requirements, consult 12 CFR 303.244. In the  event that the consent of the institution's primary federal regulator is  required in addition to that of the FDIC, the requesting party shall  submit a copy of its letter to the FDIC to the institution's primary  federal regulator. In the case of national banks, such written requests  shall be submitted to the OCC. In the case of state member banks and  bank holding companies, such written requests shall be submitted to the  Federal Reserve district bank where the institution or holding company,  respectively, is located. In the case of savings associations and  savings association holding companies, such written requests shall be  submitted to the OTS regional office where the institution or holding  company, respectively, is located. In cases where only the prior consent  of the institution's primary federal regulator is required and that  agency is not the FDIC, a written request satisfying the requirements of  this section shall be submitted to the primary federal regulator as  described in this section.
