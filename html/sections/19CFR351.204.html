                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. Because the Act does not specify the precise period of time that the Secretary should examine in an antidumping or countervailing duty investigation, this section sets forth rules regarding the period of investigation (``POI''). In addition, this section includes rules regarding the selection of persons to be examined, the treatment of voluntary respondents that are not selected for individual examination, and the exclusion of persons that the Secretary ultimately finds are not dumping or are not receiving countervailable subsidies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Period of investigation--(1) Antidumping investigation. In an antidumping investigation, the Secretary normally will examine merchandise sold during the four most recently completed fiscal quarters (or, in an investigation involving merchandise imported from a nonmarket economy country, the two most recently completed fiscal quarters) as of the month preceding the month in which the petition was filed or in which the Secretary self-initiated an investigation. However, the Secretary may examine merchandise sold during any additional or alternate period that the Secretary concludes is appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Antidumping investigation. In an antidumping investigation, the Secretary normally will examine merchandise sold during the four most recently completed fiscal quarters (or, in an investigation involving merchandise imported from a nonmarket economy country, the two most recently completed fiscal quarters) as of the month preceding the month in which the petition was filed or in which the Secretary self-initiated an investigation. However, the Secretary may examine merchandise sold during any additional or alternate period that the Secretary concludes is appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Countervailing duty investigation. In a countervailing duty investigation, the Secretary normally will rely on information pertaining to the most recently completed fiscal year for the government and exporters or producers in question. If the exporters or producers have different fiscal years, the Secretary normally will rely on information pertaining to the most recently completed calendar year. If the investigation is conducted on an aggregate basis under section 777A(e)(2)(B) of the Act, the Secretary normally will rely on information pertaining to the most recently completed fiscal year for the government in question. However, the Secretary may rely on information for any additional or alternate period that the Secretary concludes is appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exporters and producers examined--(1) In general. In an investigation, the Secretary will attempt to determine an individual weighted-average dumping margin or individual countervailable subsidy rate for each known exporter or producer of the subject merchandise. However, the Secretary may decline to examine a particular exporter or producer if that exporter or producer and the petitioner agree.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. In an investigation, the Secretary will attempt to determine an individual weighted-average dumping margin or individual countervailable subsidy rate for each known exporter or producer of the subject merchandise. However, the Secretary may decline to examine a particular exporter or producer if that exporter or producer and the petitioner agree.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Limited investigation. Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Secretary may limit the investigation by using a method described in subsection (a), (c), or (e) of section 777A of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Voluntary respondents--(1) In general. If the Secretary limits the number

of exporters or producers to be individually examined under section 777A(c)(2) or section 777A(e)(2)(A) of the Act, the Secretary will examine voluntary respondents (exporters or producers, other than those initially selected for individual examination) in accordance with section 782(a) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. If the Secretary limits the number

of exporters or producers to be individually examined under section 777A(c)(2) or section 777A(e)(2)(A) of the Act, the Secretary will examine voluntary respondents (exporters or producers, other than those initially selected for individual examination) in accordance with section 782(a) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Acceptance of voluntary respondents. The Secretary will determine, as soon as practicable, whether to examine a voluntary respondent individually. A voluntary respondent accepted for individual examination under subparagraph (d)(1) of this section will be subject to the same requirements as an exporter or producer initially selected by the Secretary for individual examination under section 777A(c)(2) or section 777A(e)(2)(A) of the Act, including the requirements of section 782(a) of the Act and, where applicable, the use of the facts available under section 776 of the Act and Sec. 351.308.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exclusion of voluntary respondents' rates from all-others rate. In calculating an all-others rate under section 705(c)(5) or section 735(c)(5) of the Act, the Secretary will exclude weighted-average dumping margins or countervailable subsidy rates calculated for voluntary respondents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Requests for voluntary respondent treatment. An interested party seeking treatment as a voluntary respondent must so indicate by including as a title on the first page of the first submission, ``Request for Voluntary Respondent Treatment.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Exclusions--(1) In general. The Secretary will exclude from an affirmative final determination under section 705(a) or section 735(a) of the Act or an order under section 706(a) or section 736(a) of the Act, any exporter or producer for which the Secretary determines an individual weighted-average dumping margin or individual net countervailable subsidy rate of zero or de minimis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The Secretary will exclude from an affirmative final determination under section 705(a) or section 735(a) of the Act or an order under section 706(a) or section 736(a) of the Act, any exporter or producer for which the Secretary determines an individual weighted-average dumping margin or individual net countervailable subsidy rate of zero or de minimis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Preliminary determinations. In an affirmative preliminary determination under section 703(b) or section 733(b) of the Act, an exporter or producer for which the Secretary preliminarily determines an individual weighted-average dumping margin or individual net countervailable subsidy of zero or de minimis will not be excluded from the preliminary determination or the investigation. However, the exporter or producer will not be subject to provisional measures under section 703(d) or section 733(d) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exclusion of nonproducing exporter--(i) In general. In the case of an exporter that is not the producer of subject merchandise, the Secretary normally will limit an exclusion of the exporter to subject merchandise of those producers that supplied the exporter during the period of investigation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. In the case of an exporter that is not the producer of subject merchandise, the Secretary normally will limit an exclusion of the exporter to subject merchandise of those producers that supplied the exporter during the period of investigation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Example. During the period of investigation, Exporter A exports to the United States subject merchandise produced by Producer X. Based on an examination of Exporter A, the Secretary determines that the dumping margins with respect to these exports are de minimis, and the Secretary excludes Exporter A. Normally, the exclusion of Exporter A would be limited to subject merchandise produced by Producer X. If Exporter A began to export subject merchandise produced by Producer Y, this merchandise would be subject to the antidumping duty order, if any.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Countervailing duty investigations conducted on an aggregate basis and requests for exclusion from countervailing duty order. Where the Secretary conducts a countervailing duty investigation on an aggregate basis under section 777A(e)(2)(B) of the Act, the Secretary will consider and investigate requests for exclusion to the extent practicable. An exporter or producer that desires exclusion from an order must submit:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A certification by the exporter or producer that it received zero or de minimis net countervailable subsidies during the period of investigation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the exporter or producer received a countervailable subsidy, calculations demonstrating that the amount of net countervailable subsidies received was de minimis during the period of investigation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the exporter is not the producer of the subject merchandise, certifications from the suppliers and producers of the subject merchandise that those persons received zero or de minimis net countervailable subsidies during the period of the investigation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A certification from the government of the affected country that the government did not provide the exporter (or the exporter's supplier) or producer with more than de minimis net countervailable subsidies during the period of investigation.
