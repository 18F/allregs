However, when an  issue is raised whether the asserted writing ever existed; or whether  another writing, recording, or photograph produced at the hearing is the  original; or whether other evidence of contents correctly reflects the  contents, the issue is for the judge as trier of fact to determine as in  the case of other issues of fact.</p><p class="depth0">Applicability</p>
