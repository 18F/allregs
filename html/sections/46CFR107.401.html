                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, requires one or more of the certificates described in this subpart to be carried on self-propelled vessels of 500 gross tons or over engaged in international voyages. This subpart prescribes rules for the issuance of these certificates to mobile offshore drilling units.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> ``International voyage'' has the same meaning as stated in Regulation 2(d) of part A, chapter I in the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea, 1974. (SOLAS 74), which is: ``a voyage from a country to which the present Convention applies to a port outside such country, or conversely. The Coast Guard has interpreted this definition to include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A voyage from a country to which SOLAS 1974 applies, to a port outside that country or the reverse;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A voyage from any territory, including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, all possessions of the United States, and all lands held by the United States under a protectorate or mandate, whose international relations are the responsibility of a contracting SOLAS 74 government, or which is administered by the United Nations, to a port outside that territory or the reverse;
The Coast Guard has interpreted this definition to not include a ``Great Lakes voyage'' which means a voyage solely on the Great Lakes of North America and the St. Lawrence River west of a straight line drawn from Capedes Rosiers to West Point, Anticosti Island and, on the north side of Anticosti Island, the 63rd Meridian.
