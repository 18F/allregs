                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Specifications. The product is a two-component drug consisting  of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An implant containing 6.0 milligrams of norgestomet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An injectable solution (sesame oil) containing 3.0 milligrams of  norgestomet and 5.0 milligrams of estradiol valerate per 2 milliliters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Sponsor. See 050604 in Sec. 510.600(c) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Conditions of use--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Amount. One implant and 2 milliliters of  injection at time of implantation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Indications for use. For synchronization of estrus/ovulation in  cycling beef cattle and non-lactating dairy heifers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Limitations. Insert implant subcutaneously in the ear only; then  immediately inject solution intramuscularly only. Counting the day of  implantation as day 1, remove the implant on day 10. Collect all  implants as they are removed and burn them. While animals are restrained  for artificial insemination, avoid other treatments such as  vaccinations, dipping, pour-on grub and louse prevention, spraying, etc.  When inseminating without estrus detection, the entire treated group  should be started at 48 hours after the last implant has been removed  and should be completed within 6 hours. Where estrus detection is  preferred, insemination should be approximately 12 hours after first  detection of estrus. Those that do not conceive can be re-bred when they  return to estrus approximately 17 to 25 days after implant removal. Do  not use in cows producing milk for human consumption.
