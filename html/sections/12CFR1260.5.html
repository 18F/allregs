                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> No waiver of privilege. The release of information under this  part does not constitute a waiver by FHFA of any privilege, or of its  right to control, supervise or impose limitations on the subsequent use  and disclosure of any information concerning a Bank. To the extent that  any information provided to a Bank or the Office of Finance pursuant to  this part qualifies as non-public information under part 1214 of this  chapter, that information shall continue to qualify as such and shall  continue to be subject to the restrictions on disclosure set forth in  part 1214, provided that a Bank shall not be deemed to have violated any  provision of Sec. 1214.3 of this chapter by disclosing in its filings  with the SEC non-public information about another Bank that was obtained  pursuant to this part if the disclosure is limited to a recital of the  relevant factual content of the underlying information and the Bank has  provided the notice required by paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disclosures under the Federal securities laws. If a Bank  determines in good faith that it is required by any applicable provision  of the 1934 Act or of 17 CFR chapter II to disclose non-public  information relating to another Bank that it has received pursuant to  this part, it shall provide to FHFA and to the Bank to which the  information pertains prior written notice of such determination and of  the content and anticipated timing of the disclosure, which notice shall  be provided as far in advance of the anticipated disclosure as is  feasible under the circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Safeguarding of information. A Bank may use non-public  information distributed pursuant to this part only for the purposes  described in section 20A(a) of the Bank Act. Except as otherwise  provided in this part, neither the Office of Finance, nor any Bank, nor  any officer, director or employee thereof, may disclose or permit the  use or disclosure of any non-public information regarding another Bank  received pursuant to this part in any manner or for any purpose. Each  Bank and the Office of Finance shall implement policies and procedures  to prevent the improper disclosure of such information and to limit the  access of its personnel to such information, which policies and  procedures shall be no less stringent than those that apply to the  entity's own confidential and supervisory information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Information regarding the Office of Finance. A Bank president  that receives any information regarding the Office of Finance in his or  her capacity as a member of the board of directors of the Office of  Finance may share the information with the board of directors of the  Bank at which he or she is employed, as well as with the appropriate  officers and employees of the Bank, subject to the limitations of this  part.</p>
