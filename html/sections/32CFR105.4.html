                            <p class="depth0">It is DoD policy, in accordance with 32 CFR part 103, that:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This part and 32 CFR part 103 establish and implement the DoD SAPR program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The DoD goal is a culture free of sexual assault, through an environment of prevention, education and training, response capability (see Sec. 105.3), victim support, reporting procedures, and appropriate accountability that enhances the safety and well being of all persons covered by this part and 32 CFR part 103.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The SAPR Program shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Focus on the victim and on doing what is necessary and appropriate to support victim recovery, and also, if a Service member, to support that Service member to be fully mission capable and engaged.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Require that medical care and SAPR services are gender-responsive, culturally-competent, and recovery-oriented as defined in 32 CFR 103.3.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Not provide policy for legal processes within the responsibility of the Judge Advocates General (JAG) of the Military Departments provided in the UCMJ, the Manual for Courts-Martial, or for criminal investigative matters assigned to the IG, DoD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Command sexual assault awareness and prevention programs and DoD law enforcement (see Sec. 105.3) and criminal justice procedures that enable persons to be held appropriately accountable for their actions shall be supported by all commanders.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Standardized SAPR requirements, terminology, guidelines, protocols, and guidelines for training materials shall focus on awareness, prevention, and response at all levels, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> SARC and SAPR VA shall be used as standard terms as defined in and in accordance with 32 CFR part 103 throughout the Military Departments to facilitate communications and transparency regarding SAPR response capability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The SARC shall serve as the single point of contact for coordinating care to ensure that sexual assault victims receive appropriate and responsive care. All SARCs shall be authorized to perform VA duties in accordance with service regulations, and will be acting in the performance of those duties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> All SARCs shall have direct and unimpeded contact and access to the installation commander (see Sec. 105.3) for the purpose of this part and 32 CFR part 103.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an installation has multiple SARCs on the installation, a Lead SARC shall be designated by the Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For SARCs that operate within deployable commands that are not attached to an installation, they shall have access to the senior commander for the deployable command.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A 24 hour, 7 day per week sexual assault response capability for all locations, including deployed areas, shall be established for persons covered in this part. An immediate, trained sexual assault response capability shall be available for each report of sexual assault in all locations, including in deployed locations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> SARCs, SAPR VAs, and other responders (see Sec. 105.3) will assist sexual assault victims regardless of Service affiliation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Service member and adult military dependent victims of sexual assault shall receive timely access to comprehensive medical and psychological treatment, including emergency care treatment and services, as described in this part and 32 CFR part 103.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Sexual assault victims shall be given priority, and treated as emergency cases. Emergency care (see Sec. 105.3) shall consist of emergency medical care and the offer of a SAFE. The victim shall be advised that even if a SAFE is declined the victim shall be encouraged (but not mandated) to receive medical care, psychological care, and victim advocacy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> The prohibition of enlistment or commissioning of persons in the Military Services when the person has a qualifying conviction (see Sec. 105.3) for a crime of sexual assault or is required to be registered as a sex offender.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Improper disclosure of confidential communications under Restricted Reporting or improper release of medical information are prohibited and may result in disciplinary action pursuant to the UCMJ or other adverse personnel or administrative actions. Even proper release of Restricted Reporting information should be limited to those with an official need to know, or as authorized by law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Information regarding Unrestricted Reports should only be released to personnel with an official need to know, or as authorized by law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> The DoD will have two separate document retention schedules for records of Service members who report that they are victims of sexual assault, based on whether the Service member filed a Restricted or Unrestricted Report as defined in 32 CFR part 103. The record retention system for Restricted Reports shall protect the Service member's desire for confidentiality. Restricted Report cases direct that Department of Defense Forms (DD Form) 2910 and 2911 be retained for at least 5 years, but at the request of a member of the Armed Forces who files a Restricted Report on an incident of sexual assault, the DD Forms 2910 and 2911 filed in connection with the Restricted Report be retained for 50 years. Unrestricted Report cases direct that DD Forms 2910 and 2911 be retained for 50 years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Document Retention for Unrestricted Reports: The SARC will enter the Unrestricted Report DD Form 2910, ``Victim Reporting Preference Statement,'' in DSAID (see 32 CFR 103.3) or the DSAID-interface Military Service data system as an electronic record, where it will be retained for 50 years from the date the victim signed the DD Form 2910. DD Form 2910 is located at the DoD Forms Management Program Web site at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/infomgt/forms/index.htm. The DD Form 2911, ``DoD Sexual Assault Forensic Examination (SAFE) Report,'' shall be retained in accordance with this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Document Retention for Restricted Reports;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The SAFE Kit, which includes the DD Form 2911 or civilian forensic examination report, if available, will be retained for 5 years in a location designated by the Military Service concerned. The 5-year time frame will start from the date the victim signs the DD Form 2910.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The SARC will retain a hard copy of the Restricted Report DD Form 2910 for 5 years, consistent with DoD guidance for the storage of personally identifiable information (PII). The 5-year time frame for the DD Form 2910 will start from the date the victim signs the DD Form 2910. However, at the request of a member of the Armed Forces who files a Restricted Report on an incident of sexual assault, the DD Forms 2910 and 2911 filed in connection with

the Restricted Report be retained for 50 years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Any threat to the life or safety of a Military Service member shall be immediately reported to command and DoD law enforcement authorities (see Sec. 105.3) and a request to transfer the victim under these circumstances will be handled in accordance with established Service regulations. DoD recognizes that circumstances may also exist that warrant the transfer of a Service member who makes an Unrestricted Report of sexual assault but may not otherwise meet established criteria for effecting the immediate transfer of Service members. Those Service members may request a transfer pursuant to the procedures in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Service members who file an Unrestricted Report of sexual assault shall be informed by the SARC at the time of making the report, or as soon as practicable, of the option to request a temporary or permanent expedited transfer from their assigned command or installation, or to a different location within their assigned command or installation, in accordance with the procedures for commanders in Sec. 105.9 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> Service members who file Unrestricted and Restricted Reports of sexual assault shall be protected from reprisal, or threat of reprisal, for filing a report.</p>
