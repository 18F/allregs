                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Policy. Generally, the fees charged for requests for records pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552 shall cover the full allowable direct costs of searching for, reproducing, and reviewing records that are responsive to a request for information. Fees shall be assessed according to the schedule contained in paragraph (b) of this section and the category of requesters described in Sec.  1601.31 for services rendered by the CSB staff in responding to, and processing requests for, records under this part. Fees assessed will be paid by check or money order payable to the United States Treasury.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Types of charges. The types of charges that may be assessed in connection with the production of records in response to a FOIA request are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Searches.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Manual searches for records. For each quarter hour spent in searching for and/or reviewing a requested record, the fees will be: $4.00 for clerical personnel; $8.00 for professional personnel; and $11.00 for managerial personnel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Computer searches for records. Requesters will be charged at the actual direct costs of conducting a search using existing programming. These direct costs will include the cost of operating the central processing unit for that portion of operating time that is directly attributable to searching for records and the operator/programmer salary, i.e., basic pay plus 16 percent, apportionable to the search. A charge shall also be made for any substantial amounts of special supplies or materials used to contain, present, or make available the output of computers, based upon the prevailing levels of costs to the CSB for the type and amount of such supplies or materials that are used. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to entitle any person or entity, as of right, to any services in connection with computerized records, other than services to which such person or entity may be entitled under the provisions of this section or Sec.  1601.32. The CSB will not alter or develop programming to conduct a search.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Unproductive searches. The CSB will charge search fees even if no records are found which are responsive to the request or if the records found are exempt from disclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Duplication. Records will be reproduced at a rate of $0.25 per page. For copies prepared by computer, such as tapes or printouts, the requester shall be charged the actual cost, including operator time, of production of the tape or printout. For other methods of reproduction, the actual direct costs of reproducing the record(s) shall be charged.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Review. Only commercial-use requesters may be charged for time spent reviewing records to determine whether they are exempt from mandatory disclosure. Charges may be assessed only for initial review, i.e., the review undertaken the first time the CSB analyzes the applicability of a specific exemption to a particular record or portion of a record. Records or portions of records withheld in full under an exemption that is subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed again to determine the applicability of other exemptions not previously considered. The costs for such a subsequent review are properly assessable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Other services and materials. Where the CSB elects, as a matter of administrative discretion, to comply with a request for a special service or materials, such as certifying that records are true copies or sending records by special methods, the actual direct costs of providing the service or materials will be charged.</p>
