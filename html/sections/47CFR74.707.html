                                Sec.  74.707  Low power TV and TV translator station protection.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A low power TV or TV translator will be protected from  interference from other low power TV or TV translator stations, or TV  booster stations within the following predicted contours:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 62 dBu for stations on Channels 2 through 6;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 68 dBu for stations on Channels 7 through 13; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> 74 dBu for stations on Channels 14 through 69.   Existing licensees and permittees that did not furnish sufficient data  required to calculate the above contours by April 15, 1983 are assigned  protected contours having the following radii:  Up to 0.001 kW VHF/UHF--1 mile (1.6 km) from transmitter site Up to 0.01 kW VHF; up to 0.1 k/W UHF--2 miles (3.2 km) from transmitter  site Up to 0.1 kW VHF; up to 1 kW UHF--4 miles (6.4 km) from transmitter site   New applicants must submit the required information; they cannot rely on  this table.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The low power TV or TV translator station protected contour is  calculated from the authorized effective radiated power and antenna  height above average terrain, using Figure 9, 10, or 10b of Sec.  73.699  (F(50,50) charts) of Part 73 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An application to construct a new low power TV, TV  translator, or TV booster station or change the facilities of an  existing station will not be accepted if it specifies a site which is  within the protected contour of a co-channel or first adjacent channel  low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster station, except that a TV  booster station may be located within the protected contour of its co- channel primary station.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Due to the frequency spacing which exists between TV Channels 4  and 5, between Channels 6 and 7, and between Channels 13 and 14,  adjacent channel protection standards shall not be applicable to these  pairs of channels. (See Sec.  73.603(a) of Part 73 of this chapter.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A UHF low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster construction  permit application will not be accepted if it specifies a site within  the UHF low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster station's protected  contour and proposes operation on a channel that is 15 channels above  the channel in use by the low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster  station.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster construction  permit application field strength is calculated from the proposed  effective radiated power (ERP) and the antenna above average terrain  (HAAT) in pertinent directions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For co-channel protection, the field strength is calculated  using Figure 9a, 10a, or 10c of Sec.  73.699 (F(50,10) charts) of Part  73 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster applications that  do not specify the same channel as the low power TV, TV translator, or  TV booster station to be protected, the field strength is calculated  using Figure 9, 10, or 10b of Sec.  73.699 (F(50,50) charts) of Part 73  of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster station application  will not be accepted if the ratio in dB of its field strength to that of  the authorized low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster station at its  protected contour fails to meet the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> -45 dB for co-channel operations without offset carrier  frequency operation or -28 dB for offset carrier frequency operation. An  application requesting offset carrier frequency operation must include  the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A requested offset designation (zero, plus, or minus)  identifying the proposed direction of the 10 kHz offset from the  standard carrier frequencies of the requested channel. If the offset  designation is not different from that of the station being protected,  or if the station being protected is not maintaining its frequencies  within the tolerance specified in Sec.  74.761 for offset operation, the  -45 dB ratio must be used.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A description of the means by which the low power TV, TV  translator, or TV booster station's frequencies will be maintained  within the tolerances specified in Sec.  74.761 for offset operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 6 dB when the protected low power TV or TV translator station  operates on a VHF channel that is one channel above the requested  channel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> 12 dB when the protected low power TV or TV translator station  operates on a VHF channel that is one channel below the requested  channel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> 15 dB when the protected low power TV or TV translator station  operates on a UHF channel that is one channel above or below the  requested channel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> 6 dB when the protected low power TV or TV translator station  operates on a UHF channel that is fifteen channels below the requested  channel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> As an alternative to the preceding paragraphs of Sec.  74.707,  an applicant for a low power TV or TV translator station may make full  use of terrain shielding and Longley-Rice terrain dependent propagation  prediction methods to demonstrate that the proposed facility would not  be likely to cause interference to low power TV, TV translator and TV  booster stations. Guidance on using the Longley-Rice methodology is  provided in OET Bulletin No. 69 (but also see Sec.  74.793(d)).
