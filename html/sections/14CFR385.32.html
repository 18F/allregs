                            <p class="depth0">Unless, within the time provided by or pursuant to this regulation,  a petition for review is filed or the Department gives notice that it  will review on its own motion, staff action shall, without further  proceedings, be effective and become the action of the Department upon  the expiration of such period. A timely petition for review filed in  accordance with the provisions of this section, or notice given by the  Department of review on its own motion, shall stay the staff action  pending disposition by the Department, unless the Department determines  otherwise or unless the staff action provides otherwise in accordance  with subpart A of this part. However, in cases where the Department's  regulations provide that permissions or approvals are granted, or that  other legal effects result, within a stated period from the filing with  the Department of a prescribed document, unless the Department gives  notice to the contrary or takes other action within said period, such  notice given or action taken by a staff member under delegated authority  shall toll the running of such period. A timely petition for review of  staff action which is not stayed by its filing which is received after  or not acted upon before the effective date of the action shall be  entertained and disposed of on its merits as a petition for  reconsideration.
