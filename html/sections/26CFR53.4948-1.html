                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Tax on income of certain foreign organizations. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In lieu of  the tax imposed by section 4940 and the regulations thereunder, there is  hereby imposed for each taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969,  on the gross investment income (within the meaning of section 4940(c)(2)  and the regulations thereunder) derived from sources within the United  States (within the meaning of section 861 and the regulations  thereunder) by every foreign organization which is a private foundation  (within the meaning of section 509 and the regulations thereunder) and  exempt from taxation under section 501(a) for the taxable year a tax  equal to 4 percent of such income, except as provided in subparagraph  (3) of this paragraph. The tax (if any) will be reported on the form the  foundation is required to file under section 6033 and will be paid  annually for the taxable year, at the time prescribed for filing   such annual return (determined without regard to any extension of time  for filing). For purposes of this section, the term foreign organization  means any organization which is not described in section 170(o)(2)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> With respect to the deduction and withholding of tax imposed by  section 4948(a), see section 1443(b) and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Whenever there exists a tax treaty between the United States and  a foreign country, and a foreign private foundation subject to section  4948(a) is a resident of such country or is otherwise entitled to the  benefits of such treaty (whether or not such benefits are available to  all residents), if the treaty provides that any item or items (or all  items with respect to an organization exempt from income taxation) of  gross investment income (within the meaning of section 4940(c)(2)) shall  be exempt from income tax, such item or items shall not be taken into  account by such foundation in computing the tax to be imposed under  section 4948(a) for any taxable year for which the treaty is effective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Certain sections inapplicable. Section 507 (relating to  termination of private foundation status), section 508 (relating to  special rules with respect to section 501(c)(3) organizations), and  Chapter 42 (other than section 4948) of the Code shall not apply to any  foreign organization which from the date of its creation has received at  least 85 percent of its support (as defined in section 509(d), other  than section 509(d)(4)) from sources outside the United States. For  purposes of this paragraph, gifts, grants, contributions, or membership  fees directly or indirectly from a United States person (as defined in  section 7701(a)(30)) are from sources within the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Denial of exemption to foreign organizations engaged in  prohibited transactions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A foreign private foundation  described in section 4948(b) and paragraph (b) of this section shall not  be exempt from taxation under section 501(a) if it has engaged in a  prohibited transaction (within the meaning of subparagraph (2) of this  paragraph) after December 31, 1969.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Prohibited transactions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of this section, the  term ``prohibited transaction'' means any act or failure to act (other  than with respect to section 4942(e), relating to minimum investment  return) which would subject a foreign private foundation described in  paragraph (b) of this section, or a disqualified person (as defined in  section 4946) with respect thereto, to liability for a penalty under  section 6684 (relating to assessable penalties with respect to liability  for tax under Chapter 42) or a tax under section 507 (relating to  termination of private foundation status) if such foreign private  foundation were a domestic private foundation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Approval by an appropriate foreign government of grants by the  foreign private foundation to individuals is sufficient to satisfy the  requirements of section 4945(g) and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In determining whether a grantee of the foreign organization is  a private foundation which is not an operating foundation for purposes  of section 4942(g)(1)(A)(ii) or is an organization which is not  described in section 509(a) (1), (2), or (3) for purposes of section  4945 (d)(4) and (h), a determination made by such foreign organization  will be accepted if such determination is made in good faith after a  reasonable effort to identify the status of its grantee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, in order  for an act or failure to act (without regard to section 4942(e)) to be  treated as a prohibited transaction under section 4948(c)(2) by reason  of the application of section 6684(1), there must have been a prior act  or failure to act (without regard to section 4942(e)), which:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a))</em> if the foreign private foundation had been  a domestic private foundation, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> of  this subdivision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Taxable years affected. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in subdivision  (ii) of this subparagraph, a foreign private foundation described in  paragraph (b) of this section shall be denied exemption from taxation  under section 501(a) by reason of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph for  all taxable years beginning with the taxable year during which it is  notified by the Commissioner that it has engaged in a prohibited  transaction. The Commissioner shall publish such notice in the Federal  Register on the day on which he so notifies such foreign private  foundation. In the case of an act or failure to act (without regard to  section 4942(e)) which would result in a penalty under section 6684(1)  if the foreign private foundation were a domestic private foundation,  before giving notice under this subdivision the Commissioner shall warn  such foreign private foundation that such act or failure to act may be  treated as a prohibited transaction. However, such act or failure to act  will not be treated as a prohibited transaction if it is corrected  (within the meaning of Chapter 42 and the regulations thereunder) within  90 days after the making of such warning.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(a)</em> Any foreign private foundation described in paragraph (b) of  this section which is denied exemption from taxation under section  501(a) by reason of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may, with respect  to the second taxable year following the taxable year in which notice is  given under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph (or any taxable year  subsequent to such second taxable year), file a request for exemption  from taxation under section 501(a) on Form 1023. In addition to the  information generally required of an organization requesting exemption  as an organization described in section 501(a), a request under this  subdivision must contain or have attached to it a written declaration,  made under the penalties of perjury, by a principal officer of such  organization authorized to make such declaration, that the organization  will not knowingly again engage in a prohibited transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If the Commissioner is satisfied that such organization will not  knowingly again engage in a prohibited transaction and that the  organization has satisfied all other requirements under section 501, the  organization will be so notified in writing. In such case the  organization shall not, with respect to taxable years beginning with the  taxable year with respect to which a request under this subdivision is  filed, be denied exemption from taxation under section 501(a) by reason  of any prohibited transaction which was engaged in before the date on  which notice was given under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.  Section 4948(c) provides that an organization denied exemption under  such section will not be exempt from taxation under section 501(a) for  the taxable year in which notice of loss of exemption is given and at  least one immediately subsequent taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Disallowance of certain charitable deductions. No gift, bequest,  legacy, devise, or transfer shall be allowed as a deduction under  section 170, 545(b)(2), 556(b)(2), 642(c), 2055, 2106(a)(2), or 2522, if  made:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To a foreign private foundation described in paragraph (b) of  this section after the date on which the Commissioner publishes notice  under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section that he has notified such  organization that it has engaged in a prohibited transaction, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> shall be treated as made on the date of  death of the decedent. For example, assume that an individual gives  money to a foreign private foundation described in section 4948(b) in  January 1970, January 1971, and January 1972. The organization has a  taxable year from June 1 through May 31. In February 1970, notice is  duly published that the foreign organization has engaged in a prohibited  transaction. In December 1970, the organization duly submits a request  for exemption under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(a) of this   section which is granted for the taxable year ending May 31, 1972. The  January 1970 gift is allowable as a deduction under section 2522 since  it was made before the notice (February 1970). The January 1971 gift is  not allowable as a deduction because the taxable year ending May 31,  1971, is a nonexempt year (the first taxable year subsequent to the  taxable year of the notice) for the foreign organization. The January  1972 gift is allowable as a deduction under section 2522 because the  taxable year ending May 31, 1972, is an exempt year for the  organization.
