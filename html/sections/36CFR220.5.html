                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Classes of actions normally requiring environmental impact  statements--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Class 1: Proposals to carry out or to approve aerial  application of chemical pesticides on an operational basis. Examples  include but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Applying chemical insecticides by helicopter on an area infested  with spruce budworm to prevent serious resource loss.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Authorizing the application of herbicides by helicopter on a  major utility corridor to control unwanted vegetation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Applying herbicides by fixed-wing aircraft on an area to  release trees from competing vegetation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Class 2: Proposals that would substantially alter the  undeveloped character of an inventoried roadless area or a potential  wilderness area. Examples include but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Constructing roads and harvesting timber in an inventoried  roadless area where the proposed road and harvest units impact a  substantial part of the inventoried roadless area.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Constructing or reconstructing water reservoir facilities in a  potential wilderness area where flow regimens may be substantially  altered.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Approving a plan of operations for a mine that would cause  considerable surface disturbance in a potential wilderness area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice of intent. Normally, a notice of intent to prepare an EIS  shall be published in the Federal Register as soon as practicable after  deciding that an EIS will be prepared. Where there is a lengthy period  between the agency's decision to prepare an environmental impact  statement and the time of actual preparation, the notice of intent may  be published at a reasonable time in advance of preparation of the draft  statement. A notice must meet the requirements of 40 CFR 1508.22, and in  addition, include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Title of the responsible official(s);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any permits or licenses required to implement the proposed  action and the issuing authority;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Lead, joint lead, or cooperating agencies if identified; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Address(es) to which comments may be sent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Withdrawal notice. A withdrawal notice must be published in the  Federal Register if, after publication of the notice of intent or notice  of availability, an EIS is no longer necessary. A withdrawal notice must  refer to the date and Federal Register page number of the previously  published notice(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Environmental impact statement format and content. The  responsible official may use any EIS format and design as long as the  statement is in accord with 40 CFR 1502.10.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Alternative(s). The EIS shall document the examination of  reasonable alternatives to the proposed action. An alternative should  meet the purpose and need and address one or more significant issues  related to the proposed action. Since an alternative may be developed to  address more than one significant issue, no specific number of  alternatives is required or prescribed. The following procedures are  available to the responsible official to develop and analyze  alternatives:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The responsible official may modify the proposed action and  alternative(s) under consideration prior to issuing a draft EIS. In such  cases, the responsible official may consider the incremental changes as  alternatives considered. The documentation of   these incremental changes to a proposed action or alternatives shall be  included or incorporated by reference in accord with 40 CFR 1502.21.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The proposed action and one or more alternatives to the proposed  action may include adaptive management. An adaptive management proposal  or alternative must clearly identify the adjustment(s) that may be made  when monitoring during project implementation indicates that the action  is not having its intended effect, or is causing unintended and  undesirable effects. The EIS must disclose not only the effect of the  proposed action or alternative but also the effect of the adjustment.  Such proposal or alternative must also describe the monitoring that  would take place to inform the responsible official during  implementation whether the action is having its intended effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Circulating and filing draft and final environmental impact  statements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The draft and final EISs shall be filed with the  Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Federal Activities in  Washington, DC (see 40 CFR 1506.9).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requirements at 40 CFR 1506.9 ``Filing requirements,'' 40 CFR  1506.10 ``Timing of agency action,'' and 40 CFR 1502.19 ``Circulation of  the environmental impact statement'' shall only apply to the last draft  and final EIS and not apply to material produced prior to the draft EIS  or between the draft and final EIS which are filed with EPA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the responsible official determines that an extension of  the review period on a draft EIS is appropriate, notice shall be given  in the same manner used for inviting comments on the draft.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Distribution of the record of decision. The responsible official  shall notify interested or affected parties of the availability of the  record of decision as soon as practical after signing.</p>
