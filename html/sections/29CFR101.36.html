                            <p class="depth0">After the issuance of determination by the Board, the Regional Director in the Region in which the proceeding arose communicates with the parties for the purpose of ascertaining their intentions in regard to compliance. Conferences may be held for the purpose of working out details. If satisfied that the parties are complying with the determination, the Regional Director dismisses the charge. If not satisfied that the parties are complying, the Regional Director issues a complaint and notice of hearing, charging violation of section 8(b)(4)(D) of the Act, and the proceeding follows the procedure outlined in Sec. Sec. 101.8 to 101.15, inclusive. However, if the Board determines that employees represented by a charged union are entitled to perform the work in dispute, the Regional Director dismisses the charge against that union irrespective of whether the employer complies with the determination.</p>
