                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The ISMLS localizer equipment must provide an automatic monitor system that transmits a warning to designated local and remote control points when any of the following occurs:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A shift of the mean course line of the localizer from the runway centerline equivalent to more than 0.015 DDM at the ISMLS reference datum.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For localizers in which the basic functions are provided by the use of a single-frequency system, a reduction of power output to less than 50 percent of normal or a loss of ground station identification transmissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Changes of displacement sensitivity to a value differing by more than 17 percent from nominal value for the localizer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Failure of any part of the monitor itself. Such failure must automatically produce the same results as the malfunctioning of the element being monitored.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Within 10 seconds of the occurrence of any of the conditions prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, including periods of zero radiation, localizer signal radiation must cease or the navigation and identification components must be removed.</p>
