Treasury bills will  be acceptable at maturity value to secure deposits of public monies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Acceptable in payment of taxes. The Secretary of the Treasury,  in his discretion, when inviting tenders for Treasury bills, may provide  that Treasury bills of any series will be acceptable at maturity value,  whether at or before maturity, under such rules and regulations as he  shall prescribe or approve, in payment of income taxes payable under the  provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Treasury bills which by the  terms of their issue are acceptable in payment of income taxes may be  surrendered to any Federal Reserve Bank or Branch, acting as fiscal  agent of the United States, or to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service,  Washington, DC 20226, 15 days or less before the date on which the taxes  become due.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of payments of corporation income taxes (including  payments of estimates) for taxable years ending on or after December 31,  1967, the bills shall be accompanied by a preinscribed Form 503, Federal  Tax Deposit, Corporation Income Taxes, on which the face amount of the  bills being surrendered should be entered in the space provided for the  amount of the tax deposit. The office receiving the bills and Form 503  will acknowledge receipt of the bills to the owner corporation and  effect the tax deposit on the date on which the taxes become due.  Accordingly, in these cases, it will no longer be necessary to submit  receipts for Treasury bills to the Internal Revenue Service with the  corporation's declaration or tax return.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of payments of all other income taxes the office  receiving the bills will issue receipts (in duplicate) to the owners.

Treasury bills will be acceptable at maturity, but not before,  in payment of interest or of principal on account of obligations of  foreign governments held by the United States.</p>
