                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> After the Commission has directed a case for review, any person  may move to participate as amicus curiae. Such participation before the  Commission shall not be a matter of right but of the sound discretion of  the Commission. A motion for participation as amicus curiae shall set  forth the interest of the movant; indicate which party's position, if  any, the movant supports; the reason why an amicus brief is desirable  and why the matters asserted are relevant to the disposition of the  case; and show that the granting of the motion will not unduly delay the  proceeding or prejudice any party. The movant may conditionally attach  its brief to its motion for participation as amicus curiae.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The brief of an amicus curiae shall be filed within the initial  briefing period (see Sec. 2700.75(a)(1)) allotted to the party whose  position the amicus curiae supports.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the interest of avoiding duplication of argument, however,  the Commission may permit the filing of an amicus curiae brief within 20  days after the close of the briefing period set forth in  Sec. 2700.75(a)(1), provided that the amicus curiae's motion for  participation as an amicus curiae is filed within the initial briefing  period (see Sec. 2700.75(a)(1)) allotted to the party whose position the  amicus curiae supports. If the Commission grants any such motion, the  Commission's order shall specify the time within which a   response or reply may be made to the amicus curiae brief.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any person who does not support a party in the proceeding must  file its motion for participation as amicus curiae and brief no later  than 20 days after initial briefs are filed (see Sec. 2700.75(a)(1)). A  motion for participation as amicus curiae must comply with the  requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. A brief of  amicus curiae must comply with Sec. 2700.75(c).
