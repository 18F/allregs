                            <p class="depth0">With respect to each employee compensated for overtime hours at a ``basic'' rate which is substantially equivalent to the employee's average hourly earnings, as authorized in accordance with section 7(g)(3) of the Act and part 548 of this chapter, employers shall maintain and preserve records containing all the information and data required by Sec. 516.2 except paragraph (a)(6) thereof and, in addition, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)</em> The hourly rates, piece rates, or commission rates applicable to each type of work performed by the employee,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The hourly rates, piece rates, or commission rates applicable to each type of work performed by the employee,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The computation establishing the basic rate at which the employee is compensated for overtime hours (if the employee is part of a workforce or employed in or by an establishment all of whose workers have agreed to accept this method of compensation, a single entry of this computation will suffice),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The amount and nature of each payment which, pursuant to section 7(e) of the Act, is excluded from the ``regular rate.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> Identity of representative period for computing the basic rate, (2) the period during which the established basic rate is to be used for computing overtime compensation, (3) information which establishes that there is no significant difference between the pertinent terms, conditions and circumstances of employment in the period selected for the computation of the basic rate and those in the period for which the basic rate is used for computing overtime compensation, which could affect the representative character of the period from which the
basic rate is derived.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Identity of representative period for computing the basic rate, (2) the period during which the established basic rate is to be used for computing overtime compensation, (3) information which establishes that there is no significant difference between the pertinent terms, conditions and circumstances of employment in the period selected for the computation of the basic rate and those in the period for which the basic rate is used for computing overtime compensation, which could affect the representative character of the period from which the
basic rate is derived.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A copy of the written agreement or, if there is no such agreement, a memorandum summarizing the terms of and showing the date and period covered by the oral agreement or understanding to use this method of computation. If the employee is one of a group, all of whom have agreed to use this method of computation, a single memorandum will suffice.


Sec. 516.27  ``Board, lodging, or other facilities'' under section3(m) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In addition to keeping other records required by this part, an employer who makes deductions from the wages of employees for ``board, lodging, or other facilities'' (as these terms are used in sec. 3(m) of the Act) furnished to them by the employer or by an affiliated person, or who furnishes such ``board, lodging, or other facilities'' to employees as an addition to wages, shall maintain and preserve records substantiating the cost of furnishing each class of facility except as noted in paragraph (c) of this section. Separate records of the cost of each item furnished to an employee need not be kept. The requirements may be met by keeping combined records of the costs incurred in furnishing each class of facility, such as housing, fuel, or merchandise furnished through a company store or commissary. Thus, in the case of an employer who furnishes housing, separate cost records need not be kept for each house. The cost of maintenance, utilities, and repairs for all the houses may be shown together. Original cost and depreciation records may be kept for groups of houses acquired at the same time. Costs incurred in furnishing similar or closely related facilities, moreover, may be shown in combined records. Where cost records are kept for a ``class'' of facility rather than for each individual article furnished to employees, the records must also show the gross income derived from each such class of facility; e.g., gross rentals in the case of houses, total sales through the store or commissary, total receipts from sales of fuel, etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Such records shall include itemized accounts showing the nature and amount of any expenditures entering into the computation of the reasonable cost, as defined in part 531 of this chapter, and shall contain the data required to compute the amount of the depreciated investment in any assets allocable to the furnishing of the facilities, including the date of acquisition or construction, the original cost, the rate of depreciation and the total amount of accumulated depreciation on such assets. If the assets include merchandise held for sale to employees, the records should contain data from which the average net investment in inventory can be determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No particular degree of itemization is prescribed. However, the amount of detail shown in these accounts should be consistent with good accounting practices, and should be sufficient to enable the Administrator or authorized representative to verify the nature of the expenditure and the amount by reference to the basic records which must be preserved pursuant to Sec. 516.6(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If additions to or deductions from wages paid (1) so affect the total cash wages due in any workweek (even though the employee actually is paid on other than a workweek basis) as to result in the employee receiving less in cash than the applicable minimum hourly wage, or (2) if the employee works in excess of the applicable maximum hours standard and (i) any additions to the wages paid are a part of wages, or (ii) any deductions made are claimed as allowable deductions under sec. 3(m) of the Act, the employer shall maintain records showing on a workweek basis those additions to or deductions from wages. (For legal deductions not claimed under sec. 3(m) and which need not be maintained on a workweek basis, see part 531 of this chapter.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The records specified in this section are not required with respect to an employee in any workweek in which the employee is not subject to the overtime provisions of the Act and receives not less than the applicable statutory minimum wage in cash for all hours worked in that workweek. (The application of section 3(m) of the Act in nonovertime weeks is discussed in part 531 of this chapter.)</p>
