                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> and 400.22 shall be submitted  simultaneously to the Board's Executive Secretary and to CBP (as well as  to the grantee of the zone, if the grantee is not the party making the  submission).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b))</em>. The notice shall be transmitted to the Federal Register  within 15 days of the commencement of the processing of the  notification, and the comment period shall normally close 40 days after  the date the notice appears. If the notification indicates that a  material or component to be used in the activity is subject to an AD/CVD  order or proceeding, or suspension of liquidation under AD/CVD  procedures, the notice shall include that information. Evidence, factual  information and written arguments submitted in response to the notice  must be submitted by the deadline for comments. Any comments by CBP  pertaining to the notification shall be submitted to the Executive  Secretary by the end of the comment period. Within 80 days of receipt of  the notification, the Executive Secretary shall submit to the Board a  recommendation on whether further review of all or part of the activity  subject to the notification is warranted. The Executive Secretary's  recommendation shall consider comments submitted during the comment  period, any guidance from specialists within government, and other  relevant factors based on the Board staff's assessment of the  notification, in the context of the factors set forth in Sec. 400.27.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determinations regarding further review. Within 30 days of  receipt of the Executive Secretary's recommendation, the Board members  shall provide to the Executive Secretary their determinations on whether  further review is warranted concerning all or part of the activity that  is the subject of the notification. If either Board member makes a  determination that further review is warranted, the activity that is  subject   to further review (which may constitute all or part of the notified  activity) shall not be conducted without authorization pursuant to the  application requirements of Sec. 400.23 and the procedural requirements  of Sec. Sec. 400.31-400.34 and 400.36 (or the provisions of paragraph  (d) of this section, where applicable). Within 120 days of receipt of  the notification, the Executive Secretary shall notify the party that  submitted the notification (and the zone grantee, if it did not submit  the notification) that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Further review is not needed for all or part of the activity  that is the subject of the notification, and that the activity in  question may be conducted; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Further review is needed for all or part of the activity that is  the subject of the notification, with such activity precluded absent  specific authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Authorization for commencement of an activity on an interim  basis. For an activity notified pursuant to Sec. 400.14(a), the  Executive Secretary may authorize the commencement of some or all of the  activity on an interim basis. Such authorization shall only be made  based on a showing that commencement of the activity is time-sensitive,  with such showing to include comments from CBP that specifically address  the projected timeframe for commencement of the activity. Interim  authorization shall not apply to materials or components subject to an  AD/CVD order or proceeding or suspension of liquidation under AD/CVD  procedures. As warranted, a determination that further review is needed  for all or some of the notified activity pursuant to Sec. 400.37(c) may  also revoke the interim authorization until the Board makes a  determination after conduct of that further review.</p>
