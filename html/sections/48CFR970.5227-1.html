The Contractor agrees to leave a copy of such data at the facility or plant to which such data relate, and to make available for access or to deliver to the Government such data upon request by the contracting officer. If such data are limited rights data or restricted computer software, the rights of the Government in such data shall be governed solely by the provisions of paragraph (e) of this clause (``Rights in Limited Rights Data'') or paragraph (f) of this clause (``Rights in Restricted Computer Software''); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The right to remove, cancel, correct, or ignore any markings not authorized by the terms of this Contract on any data furnished hereunder if, in response to a written inquiry by DOE concerning the propriety of the markings, the Contractor fails to respond thereto within 60 days or fails to substantiate the propriety of the markings. In either case DOE will notify the Contractor of the action taken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Contractor shall have:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The right to withhold limited rights data and restricted computer software unless otherwise provided in accordance with the provisions of this clause; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The right to use for its private purposes, subject to patent, security or other provisions of this Contract, data it first produces in the performance of this Contract, except for data in DOE's Uranium Enrichment Technology, including diffusion, centrifuge, and atomic vapor laser isotope separation, provided the data requirements of this Contract have been met as of the date of the private use of such data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Contractor agrees that for limited rights data or restricted computer software or other technical, business or financial data in the form of recorded information which it receives from, or is given access to by, DOE or a third party, including a DOE Contractor or subcontractor, and for technical data or computer software it first produces under this Contract which is authorized to be marked by DOE, the Contractor shall treat such data in accordance with any restrictive legend contained thereon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Copyrighted Material.

material for which the license cannot be obtained must be included in the technical data or computer software to be delivered, rather than merely incorporated therein by reference, the Contractor shall obtain the written authorization of the contracting officer to include such material in the technical data or computer software prior to its delivery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Subcontracting. (1) Unless otherwise directed by the contracting officer, the Contractor agrees to use in subcontracts in which technical data or computer software is expected to be produced or in subcontracts for supplies that contain a requirement for production or delivery of data in accordance with the policy and procedures of 48 CFR Subpart 27.4 as supplemented by 48 CFR 927.401 through 927.409, the clause entitled, ``Rights in Data-General'' at 48 CFR 52.227-14 modified in accordance with 927.409(a) and including Alternate V.

In the event of refusal by a subcontractor to accept a clause affording the Government such rights, the Contractor shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Promptly submit written notice to the contracting officer setting forth reasons or the subcontractor's refusal and other pertinent information which may expedite disposition of the matter, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Not proceed with the subcontract without the written authorization of the contracting officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Neither the Contractor nor higher-tier subcontractors shall use their power to award subcontracts as economic leverage to acquire rights in a subcontractor's limited rights data or restricted computer software for their private use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Rights in Limited Rights Data. Except as may be otherwise specified in this Contract as data which are not subject to this paragraph, the Contractor agrees to and does hereby grant to the Government an irrevocable, nonexclusive, paid-up license by or for the Government, in any limited rights data of the Contractor specifically used in the performance of this Contract, provided, however, that to the extent that any limited rights data when furnished or delivered is specifically identified by the Contractor at the time of initial delivery to the Government or a representative of the Government, such data shall not be used within or outside the Government except as provided in the ``Limited Rights Notice'' set forth.
