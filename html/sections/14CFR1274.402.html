                            <p class="depth0">As provided in Sec. 1274.923(c), title to property acquired with government funds vests in the government. Under a cost shared cooperative agreement, joint ownership of property equal to the cost-sharing ratio will result if the parties make no specific arrangements regarding such property. The disposition of acquired property should be addressed in the cooperative agreement at the time of award. The cooperative agreement may provide that all such property be contributed by the recipient as a non-cash contribution. A reasonable dollar value must be specified and adequately supported. In this case, title will vest in the recipient. Alternatively, NASA and the recipient may include in the cooperative agreement any other appropriate arrangement for the disposition of acquired property upon completion of the effort.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart 1274.5_Procurement Standards</p>
