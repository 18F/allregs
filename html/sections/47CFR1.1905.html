                            <p class="depth0">Nothing contained in these regulations is intended to require the Commission to duplicate administrative or other proceedings required by contract or other laws or regulations, nor do these regulations supercede procedures permitted or required by other statutes or regulations. In particular, the assessment and collection of monetary forfeitures imposed by the Commission will be governed initially by the procedures prescribed by 47 U.S.C. 503, 504 and 47 CFR 1.80. After compliance with those procedures, the Commission may determine that the collection of a monetary forfeiture under the collection alternatives prescribed by this subpart is appropriate but need not duplicate administrative or other proceedings. Fees and penalties prescribed by law, e.g., 47 U.S.C. 158 and 159, and promulgated under the authority of 47 U.S.C. 309(j) (e.g., 47 CFR part 1, subpart Q) may be collected as permitted by applicable law. Nothing contained herein is intended to restrict the Commission from exercising any other right to recover or collect amounts owed to it.</p>
