                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The authorized officer will reject any application for selection of unsurveyed lands if: (1) The costs of survey of the lands would grossly exceed the average per-acre costs of surveying public lands under the rectangular system of surveys in the State in which the lands are located, or (2) if the conveyance of the lands would create serious problems in the administration of the remaining public lands or resources thereof or would significantly diminish the value of the remaining public lands. The term remaining public lands means the public lands from which the applied-for lands would be separated by survey.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the provisions of this section, applications for selection of unsurveyed lands are subject to the provisions of subpart 2400.
