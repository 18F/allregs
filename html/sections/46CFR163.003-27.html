                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Each ladder produced under Coast Guard approval must be  tested in accordance with this section and subpart 159.007 of this  chapter. Steps that fail testing may not be marked with the Coast Guard  approval number and each assembled ladder that fails testing may not be  sold as Coast Guard approved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Test No. 1: Steps. Steps must be separated into lots of 100  steps or less. Steps of different types must be placed in separate lots.  One step from each lot must be selected at random and tested as  described in Sec. 163.003-21(c)(2) except that supports are placed  under the step at the points where it would be attached to suspension  members in an assembled ladder. If the step fails the test, ten more  steps must be selected at random from the lot and tested. If one or more  of the ten steps fails the test, each step in the lot must be tested. No  step that has any residual deflection after the test may be used in a  ladder represented by the manufacturer as Coast Guard approved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(3)</em> except that only a 3 m  section of the ladder need be subjected to the static load. If the  ladder fails the test, each other ladder in the lot must be tested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Independent laboratory. Each production test must be conducted  or supervised by an independent laboratory. However, if a test is  performed more than 4 different times per year, laboratory participation  is required only 4 times per year. If the laboratory does not  participate in all tests, the times of laboratory participation must be  as selected by the laboratory. The times selected must provide for  effective monitoring throughout the production schedule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Visual examination. The visual examination described in Sec.  163.003-21(b) must be conducted as a part of each production test.
