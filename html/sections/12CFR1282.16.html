                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. FHFA shall determine whether an Enterprise shall  receive full, partial, or no credit toward achievement of any of the  housing goals for a transaction that otherwise   qualifies under this part. In this determination, FHFA will consider  whether a transaction or activity of the Enterprise is substantially  equivalent to a mortgage purchase and either creates a new market or  adds liquidity to an existing market, provided however that such  mortgage purchase actually fulfills the Enterprise's purposes and is in  accordance with its Charter Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Not counted. The following transactions or activities shall not  be counted for purposes of the housing goals and shall not be included  in the numerator or the denominator in calculating either Enterprise's  performance under the housing goals, even if the transaction or activity  would otherwise be counted pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Equity investments in low-income housing tax credits;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Purchases of State and local government housing bonds except as  provided in paragraph (c)(8) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Purchases of single-family non-conventional mortgages and  multifamily non-conventional mortgages, except:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Multifamily mortgages acquired under a risk-sharing arrangement  with a Federal agency;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Multifamily mortgages under other multifamily mortgage programs  involving Federal guarantees, insurance or other Federal obligation  where FHFA determines in writing that the financing needs addressed by  the particular mortgage program are not well served and that the  mortgage purchases under such program should count under the housing  goals;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Commitments to buy mortgages at a later date or time;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Options to acquire mortgages;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Rights of first refusal to acquire mortgages;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Any interests in mortgages that the Director determines, in  writing, shall not be treated as interests in mortgages;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Mortgage purchases to the extent they finance any dwelling units  that are secondary residences;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Single-family refinancing mortgages that result from conversion  of balloon notes to fully amortizing notes, if the Enterprise already  owns or has an interest in the balloon note at the time conversion  occurs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Purchases of subordinate lien mortgages (second mortgages);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Purchases of mortgages or interests in mortgages that were  previously counted by the Enterprise under any current or previous  housing goal within the five years immediately preceding the current  performance year;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Purchases of mortgages where the property, or any units within  the property, have not been approved for occupancy;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Purchases of private label securities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Enterprise contributions to the Housing Trust Fund (12 U.S.C.  4568) or the Capital Magnet Fund (12 U.S.C. 4569), and mortgage  purchases funded with such grant amounts; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> Any combination of factors in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(14)  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> shall be treated as mortgage purchases  as described. A transaction or activity that is covered by more than one  paragraph below must satisfy the requirements of each such paragraph.  The mortgages (or dwelling units, for the multifamily housing goals)  from each such transaction or activity shall be included in the  denominator in calculating the Enterprise's performance under the  housing goals, and shall be included in the numerator, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Credit enhancements. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Mortgages (or dwelling units) financed  under a credit enhancement entered into by an Enterprise shall be  treated as mortgage purchases for purposes of the housing goals only  when:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The Enterprise provides a specific contractual obligation to  ensure timely payment of amounts due under a mortgage or mortgages  financed by the issuance of housing bonds (such bonds may be issued by  any entity, including a State or local housing finance agency); and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The Enterprise assumes a credit risk in the transaction  substantially equivalent to the risk that would have been assumed by the  Enterprise if it had securitized the mortgages financed by such bonds.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When an Enterprise provides a specific contractual obligation  to ensure timely payment of amounts due under any mortgage originally  insured by a public purpose mortgage insurance entity or fund, the  Enterprise may, on a case-by-case basis, seek approval from the Director  for such activities to count toward achievement of the housing goals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Risk-sharing. Mortgages purchased under risk-sharing  arrangements between an Enterprise and any Federal agency under which  the Enterprise is responsible for a substantial amount of the risk shall  be treated as mortgage purchases for purposes of the housing goals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Participations. Participations purchased by an Enterprise shall  be treated as mortgage purchases for purposes of the housing goals only  when the Enterprise's participation in the mortgage is 50 percent or  more.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Cooperative housing and condominiums. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The purchase of a  mortgage on a cooperative housing unit (``a share loan'') or a mortgage  on a condominium unit shall be treated as a mortgage purchase for  purposes of the housing goals. Such a purchase shall be counted in the  same manner as a mortgage purchase of single-family owner-occupied  units.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The purchase of a mortgage on a cooperative building (``a  blanket loan'') or a mortgage on a condominium project shall be treated  as a mortgage purchase for purposes of the housing goals. The purchase  of a blanket loan or a condominium project mortgage shall be counted in  the same manner as a mortgage purchase of a multifamily rental property.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Where an Enterprise purchases both a blanket loan on a  cooperative building and share loans for units in the same building,  both the blanket loan and the share loan(s) shall be treated as mortgage  purchases for purposes of the housing goals. Where an Enterprise  purchases both a condominium project mortgage and mortgages on  condominium dwelling units in the same project, both the condominium  project mortgages and the mortgages on condominium dwelling units shall  be treated as mortgage purchases for purposes of the housing goals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Seasoned mortgages. An Enterprise's purchase of a seasoned  mortgage shall be treated as a mortgage purchase for purposes of the  housing goals, except where the Enterprise has already counted the  mortgage under any current or previous housing goal within the five  years immediately preceding the current performance year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Purchase of refinancing mortgages. The purchase of a refinancing  mortgage by an Enterprise shall be treated as a mortgage purchase for  purposes of the housing goals only if the refinancing is an arms-length  transaction that is borrower-driven.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Mortgage revenue bonds. The purchase or guarantee by an  Enterprise of a mortgage revenue bond issued by a State or local housing  finance agency shall be treated as a purchase of the underlying  mortgages for purposes of the housing goals only to the extent the  Enterprise has sufficient information to determine whether the  underlying mortgages or mortgage-backed securities qualify for inclusion  in the numerator for one or more housing goal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Loan modifications. An Enterprise's permanent modification, in  accordance with the Making Home Affordable program announced on March 4,  2009, of a loan that is held in the Enterprise's portfolio or that is in  a pool backing a security guaranteed by the Enterprise, shall be treated  as a mortgage purchase for purposes of the housing goals. Each such  permanent loan modification shall be counted in the same manner as a  purchase of a refinancing mortgage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)-(13)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Seller dissolution option. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Mortgages acquired through  transactions involving seller dissolution options shall be treated as  mortgage purchases for purposes of the housing goals, only when:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The terms of the transaction provide for a lockout period that  prohibits the exercise of the dissolution option for at least one year  from the date on which the transaction was entered into by the  Enterprise and the seller of the mortgages; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The transaction is not dissolved during the one-year minimum  lockout period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Director may grant an exception to the one-year minimum  lockout period described in paragraphs (c)(14)(i)(A) and (B) of this  section, in response to a written request from an Enterprise, if the  Director determines that the transaction furthers the purposes of the  Safety and Soundness Act and the Enterprise's Charter Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (c)(14), ``seller dissolution  option'' means an option for a seller of mortgages to the Enterprises to  dissolve or otherwise cancel a mortgage purchase agreement or loan sale.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> HOEPA mortgages and mortgages with unacceptable terms or  conditions. HOEPA mortgages and mortgages with unacceptable terms or  conditions, as defined in Sec. 1282.1, shall be treated as mortgage  purchases for purposes of the housing goals and shall be included in the  denominator for each applicable single-family housing goal, but such  mortgages shall not be counted in the numerator for any housing goal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> FHFA review of transactions. FHFA may determine whether and how  any transaction or class of transactions shall be counted for purposes  of the housing goals, including treatment of missing data. FHFA will  notify each Enterprise in writing of any determination regarding the  treatment of any transaction or class of transactions under the housing  goals.</p>
