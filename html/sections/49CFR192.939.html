                            <p class="depth0">An operator must comply with the following requirements in establishing the reassessment interval for the operator's covered pipeline segments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Pipelines operating at or above 30% SMYS. An operator must establish a reassessment interval for each covered segment operating at or above 30% SMYS in accordance with the requirements of this section. The maximum reassessment interval by an allowable reassessment method is seven years. If an operator establishes a reassessment interval that is greater than seven years, the operator must, within the seven-year period, conduct a confirmatory direct assessment on the covered segment, and then conduct the follow-up reassessment at the interval the operator has established. A reassessment carried out using confirmatory direct assessment must be done in accordance with Sec. 192.931. The table that follows this section sets forth the maximum allowed reassessment intervals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pressure test or internal inspection or other equivalent technology. An operator that uses pressure testing or internal inspection as an assessment method must establish the reassessment interval for a covered pipeline segment by--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Basing the interval on the identified threats for the covered segment (see Sec. 192.917) and on the analysis of the results from the last integrity assessment and from the data integration and risk assessment required by Sec. 192.917; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Using the intervals specified for different stress levels of pipeline (operating at or above 30% SMYS) listed in ASME B31.8S (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 192.7), section 5, Table 3.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> External Corrosion Direct Assessment.

An operator that uses ICDA or SCCDA in accordance with the requirements of this subpart must determine the reassessment interval according to the following method. However, the reassessment interval cannot exceed those specified for direct assessment in ASME/ANSI B31.8S, section 5, Table 3.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Determine the largest defect most likely to remain in the covered segment and the corrosion rate appropriate for the pipe, soil and protection conditions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use the largest remaining defect as the size of the largest defect discovered in the SCC or ICDA segment; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Estimate the reassessment interval as half the time required for the largest defect to grow to a critical size.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Pipelines Operating Below 30% SMYS.
