                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Under section 993(c), except as otherwise provided  with respect to excluded property in paragraph (f) of this section and  with respect to certain short supply property in paragraph (i) of this  section, export property is property in the hands of any person (whether  or not a DISC)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted in the United States  by any person or persons other than a DISC (see paragraph (c) of this  section),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Held primarily for sale or lease in the ordinary course of a  trade or business to any person for direct use, consumption, or  disposition outside the United States (see paragraph (d) of this  section),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Not more than 50 percent of the fair market value of which is  attributable to articles imported into the United States (see paragraph  (e) of this section), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Which is not sold or leased by a DISC, or with a DISC as  commission agent, to another DISC which is a member of the same  controlled group (as defined in Sec. 1.993-1(k)) as the DISC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Services. For purposes of this section, services (including the  written communication of services in any form) are not export property.  Whether an item is property or services shall be determined on the basis  of the facts and circumstances attending the development and disposition  of the item. Thus, for example, the preparation of a map of a particular  construction site would constitute services and not export property, but  standard maps prepared for sale to customers generally would not  constitute services and would be export property if the requirements of  this section were otherwise met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Manufacture, production, growth, or extraction of property--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  By a person other than a DISC. Export property may be manufactured,  produced, grown, or extracted in the United States by any person,  provided that such person does not qualify (and is not treated) as a  DISC. Property held by a DISC which was manufactured, produced, grown,  or extracted by it at a time when it did not qualify (and was not  treated) as a DISC is not export property of the DISC. Property which  sustains further manufacture or production outside the United States  prior to sale or lease by a person but after manufacture or production  in the United States will not be considered as manufactured, produced,  grown, or extracted in the United States by such person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Manufactured or produced--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of this  section, property which is sold or leased by a person is considered to  be manufactured or produced by such person if such property is  manufactured or produced (within the meaning of either subdivision (ii),  (iii), or (iv) of this subparagraph) by such person or by another person  pursuant to a contract with such person. Except as provided in  subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph, manufacture or production of  property does not include assembly or packaging operations with respect  to property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Substantial transformation. Property is manufactured or  produced by a person if such property is substantially transformed by  such person. Examples of substantial transformation of property would  include the conversion of woodpulp to paper, steel rods to screws and  bolts, and the canning of fish.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Operations generally considered to constitute manufacturing.  Property is manufactured or produced by a person if the operations  performed by such person in connection with such property are  substantial in nature and are generally considered to constitute the  manufacture or production of property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Value added to property. Property is manufactured or produced  by a person if with respect to such property conversion costs (direct  labor and factory burden including packaging or assembly) of such person  account for 20 percent of more of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The cost of goods sold or inventory amount of such person for  such property is such property is sold or held for sale, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The adjusted basis of such person for such property, as  determined in accordance with the provisions of section 1011, if such  property is held for lease or leased.  The value of parts provided pursuant to a services contract, as  described in Sec. 1.993-1 (d)(4)(v), is not taken into account in  applying this subdivision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Primary purpose of which property is held--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  General rule. Under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, export property  (a) must be held primarily for the purpose of sale or lease in the  ordinary course of trade or business to a DISC, or to any other person,  and (b) such sale or lease must be for direct use, consumption, or  disposition outside the United States. Thus, property cannot qualify as  export property unless it is sold or leased for direct use, consumption  or disposition outside the United States. Property is sold or leased for  direct use, consumption, or disposition outside the United States if  such sale or lease satisfies the destination test described in  subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the proof of compliance requirements  described in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, and the use outside the  United States test described in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Factors not taken into account. In determining whether property  which is sold or leased to a DISC is sold or leased for direct use  consumption, or disposition outside the United States, the fact that the  acquiring DISC holds the property in inventory or for lease prior to the  time it sells or leases it for direct use, consumption, or disposition  outside the United States will not affect the characterization of the  property as export property. Export property need not be physically  segregated from other property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Destination test. (i) For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph the destination test in this subparagraph is satisfied with  respect to property sold or leased by a seller or lessor only if it is  delivered by such seller or lessor (or an agent of such seller or  lessor) regardless of the F.O.B. point or the place at which title  passes or risk of loss shifts from the seller or lessor--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Within the United States to a carrier or freight forwarder for  ultimate delivery outside the United States to a purchaser or lessee (or  to a subsequent purchaser or sublessee),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Within the United States to a purchaser or lessee, if such  property is ultimately delivered, directly used, or directly consumed  outside the United States (including delivery to a carrier or freight  forwarder for delivery outside the United States) by the purchaser or  lessee (or a subsequent purchaser or sublessee) within 1 year after such  sale or lease,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Within or outside the United States to a purchaser or lessee  which, at the time of the sale or lease, is a DISC and is not a member  of the same controlled group (as defined in Sec. 1.993-1(k)) as the  seller or lessor,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> From the United States to the purchaser or lessee (or a  subsequent purchaser or sublessee) at a point outside the United States  by means of a ship, aircraft, or other delivery vehicle, owned, leased,  or chartered by the seller or lessor,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Outside the United States to a purchaser or lessee from a  warehouse, a storage facility, or assembly site located outside the  United States, if such property was previously shipped by such seller or  lessor from the United States, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Outside the United States to a purchaser or lessee if such  property was previously shipped by such seller or lessor from the United  States and if such property is located outside the United States  pursuant to a prior lease by the seller or lessor, and either (1) such  prior lease terminated at the expiration of its term (or by the action  of the prior lessee acting alone), (2) the sale occurred or the term of  the subsequent lease began after the time at which the term of the prior  lease would have expired, or (3) the lessee under the subsequent lease  is not a related person (as defined in Sec. 1.993-1(a)(6)) with respect  to the lessor and the prior lease was terminated by the action of the  lessor (acting alone or together with the lessee).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of this subparagraph (other than (c) and (f)(3) of  subdivision (i) thereof), any relationship between the seller or lessor  and any purchaser, subsequent purchaser, lessee, or sublessee is  immaterial.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In no event is the destination test of this subparagraph  satisfied with respect to property which is subject to any use (other  than a resale or sublease), manufacture, assembly, or other processing  (other than packaging) by any person between the time of the sale or  lease by such seller or lessor and the delivery or ultimate delivery   outside the United States described in this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If property is located outside the United States at the time it  is purchased by a person or leased by a person as lessee, such property  may be export property in the hands of such purchaser or lessee only if  it is imported into the United States prior to its further sale or lease  (including a sublease) outside the United States. Paragraphs (a)(3) and  (e) of this section (relating to 50 percent foreign content test) are  applicable in determining whether such property is export property.  Thus, for example, if such property is not subjected to manufacturing or  production (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) within the  United States after such importation, it does not qualify as export  property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Proof of compliance with destination test--(i) Delivery outside  the United States. For purposes of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph  (other than subdivision (i)(c) thereof), a seller or lessor shall  establish ultimate delivery, use, or consumption of property outside the  United States by providing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A facsimile or carbon copy of the export bill of lading issued  by the carrier who delivers the property,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A certificate of an agent or representative of the carrier  disclosing delivery of the property outside the United States,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A facsimile or carbon copy of the certificate of lading for the  property executed by a customs officer of the country to which the  property is delivered,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If such country has no customs administration, a written  statement by the person to whom delivery outside the United States was  made,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> A facsimile or carbon copy of the shipper's export declaration,  a monthly shipper's summary declaration filed with the Bureau of  Customs, or a magnetic tape filed in lieu of the Shipper's Export  Declaration, covering the property,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Any other proof (including evidence as to the nature of the  property or the nature of the transaction) which establishes to the  satisfaction of the Commissioner that the property was ultimately  delivered, or directly sold, or directly consumed outside the United  States within 1 year after the sale or lease.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The requirements of subdivision (i) (a), (b), (c), or (e) of  this subparagraph will be considered satisfied even though the name of  the ultimate consignee and the price paid for the goods is marked out  provided that, in the case of a Shipper's Export Declaration or other  document listed in such subdivision (e) or a document such as an export  bill of lading such document still indicates the country in which  delivery to the ultimate consignee is to be made and, in the case of a  certificate of an agent or representative of the carrier, that such  document indicates that the property was delivered outside the United  States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A seller or lessor shall also establish the meeting of the  requirement of subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph (other than  subdivision (c) thereof), that the property was delivered outside the  United States without further use, manufacture, assembly, or other  processing within the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Sale or lease to an unrelated DISC. For purposes of  subparagraph (2)(i)(c) of this paragraph, a purchaser or lessee of  property is deemed to qualify as a DISC for its taxable year if the  seller or lessor obtains from such purchaser or lessee a copy of such  purchaser's or lessee's election to be treated as a DISC as described in  Sec. 1.992-2(a) together with such purchaser's or lessee's sworn  statement that such election has been filed with the Internal Revenue  Service Center. The copy of the election and the sworn statement of such  purchaser or lessee must be received by the seller or lessor within 6  months after the sale or lease. A purchaser or lessee is not treated as  a DISC with respect to a sale or lease during a taxable year for which  such purchaser or lessee does not qualify as a DISC if the seller or  lessor does not believe or if a reasonable person would not believe at  the time such sale or lease is made that the purchaser or lessee will  qualify as a DISC for such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Failure of proof. If a seller or lessor fails to provide proof  of compliance with the destination test as required by this  subparagraph, the property sold or leased is not export property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Sales and leases of property for ultimate use in the United  States--(i) In general. For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph, the use test in this subparagraph is satisfied with respect  to property which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Under subdivisions (ii) through (iv) of this subparagraph is not  sold for ultimate use in the United States or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Under subdivision (v) of this subparagraph is leased for  ultimate use outside the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Sales of property for ultimate use in the United States. For  purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, a purchaser of  property (including components, as defined in subdivision (vii) of this  subparagraph) is deemed to use such property ultimately in the United  States if any of the following conditions exists:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(6))</em> with respect to the seller and such purchaser ultimately uses  such property, or a second product into which such property is  incorporated as a component, in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> At the time of the sale, there is an agreement or understanding  that such property, or a second product into which such property is  incorporated as a component, will be ultimately used by the purchaser in  the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> At the time of the sale, a reasonable person would have believed  that such property or such second product would be ultimately used by  such purchaser in the United States unless, in the case of a sale of  components, the fair market value of such components at the time of  delivery to the purchaser constitutes less than 20 percent of the fair  market value of the second product into which such components are  incorporated (determined at the time of completion of the production,  manufacture or assembly of such second product).  For purposes of (b) of this subdivision, there is an agreement or  understanding that property will ultimately be used in the United States  if, for example, a component is sold abroad under an express agreement  with the foreign purchaser that the component is to be incorporated into  a product to be sold back to the United States. As a further example  there would also be such an agreement or understanding if the foreign  purchaser indicated at the time of the sale or previously that the  component is to be incorporated into a product which is designed  principally for the United States market. However, such an agreement or  understanding does not result from the mere fact that a second product,  into which components exported from the United States have been  incorporated and which is sold on the world market, is sold in  substantial quantities in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Use in the United States. For purposes of subdivision (ii) of  this subparagraph, property (including components incorporated into a  second product) is or would be ultimately used in the United States by  such purchaser if, at any time within 3 years after the purchase of such  property or components, either such property or components (or the  second product into which such components are incorporated) is resold by  such purchaser for use by a subsequent purchaser within the United  States or such purchaser or subsequent purchaser fails, for any period  of 365 consecutive days, to use such property or second product  predominantly outside the United States as defined in subdivision (vi)  of this subparagraph).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Sales to retailers. For purposes of subdivision (ii)(c) of this  subparagraph, property sold to any person whose principal business  consists of selling from inventory to retail customers at retail outlets  ouside the United States will be considered as property for ultimate use  outside the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Leases of property for ultimate use outside the United States.  For purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph a lessee of  property is deemed to use such property ultimately outside the United  States during a taxable year of the lessor if such property is used  predominantly outside the United States (as defined in subdivision (vi)  of this subparagraph) by the lessee during the portion of the lessor's  taxable year which is included within the term of the lease. A  determination as to whether the ultimate use of leased property  satisfies the requirements of this subdivision is made for each taxable  year of the lessor. Thus, leased property may be used predominantly  outside the   United States for a taxable year of the lessor (and thus, constitute  export property if the remaining requirements of this section are met)  even if the property is not used predominantly outside the United States  in earlier taxable years or later taxable years of the lessor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Predominant use outside the United States. For purposes of this  subparagraph, property is used predominantly outside the United States  for any period if, during such period, such property is located outside  the United States more than 50 percent of the time. An aircraft,  railroad rolling stock, vessel, motor vehicle, container, or other  property used for transportation purposes in deemed to be used  predominantly outside the United States for any period if, during such  period, either such property is located outside the United States more  than 50 percent of the time or more than 50 percent of the miles  traversed in the use of such property are traversed in outside the  United States. However, any such property is deemed to be within the  United States at all times during which it is engaged in transport  between any two points within the United States, except where such  transport constitutes uninterrupted international air transportation  within the meaning of section 4262(c)(3) and the regulations thereunder  (relating to tax on air transportation of persons). For purposes of  applying section 4262(c)(3) to this subdivision, the term ``United  States'' has the same meaning as in Sec. 1.993-7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Component. For purposes of this subparagraph, a component is  property which is (or is reasonably expected to be) incorporated into a  second product by the purchaser of such component by means of  production, manufacture, or assembly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Foreign content of property--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The 50 percent test. Under  paragraph (a)(3) of this section, no more than 50 percent of the fair  market value of export property may be attributable to the fair market  value of articles which were imported into the United States. For  purposes of this paragraph, articles imported into the United States are  referred to as ``foreign content''. The fair market value of the foreign  content of export property is computed in accordance with subparagraph  (4) of this paragraph. The fair market value of export property which is  sold to a person who is not a related person with respect to the seller  is the sale price for such property (not including interest finance or  carrying charges, or similar charges)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Application of 50 percent test. The 50 percent test described in  subparagraph (1) of this paragraph is applied on an item-by-item basis  If, however, a person sells or leases a substantial volume of  substantially identical export property in a taxable year and if all of  such property contains substantially identical foreign content is  substantially the same proportion, such person may determine the portion  of foreign content contained in such property on an aggregate basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Parts and services. If, at the time property is sold or leased  the seller or lessor agrees to furnish parts pursuant to a services  contract (as provided in Sec. 1.993-1(d)(4)(v)) and the price for the  parts is not separately stated, the 50 percent test described in  subparagraph (1) of this paragraph is applied on an aggregate basis to  the property and parts. If the price for the parts is described in  subparagraph (1) of this paragraph is applied separately to the property  and to the parts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Computation of foreign content--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Valuation. For purposes of  applying the 50 percent test described in subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph, it is necessary to determine the fair market value of all  articles which constitute foreign content of the property being tested  to determine if it is export property. The fair market value of such  imported articles is determined as of the time such articles are  imported into the United States. With respect to articles imported into  the United States before July 1, 1980, the fair market value of such  articles is their appraised value as determined under section 402 or  402a of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1401a or 1402) in connection  with their importation. With respect to articles imported into the  United States on or after July 1, 1980, the fair market value of such  articles is their appraised value as determined under section 402 of the  Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C.   1401a) in connection with their importation. The appraised value of such  articles is the full dutiable value of such articles, determined,  however, without regard to any special provision in the United States  tariff laws which would result in a lower dutiable value. Thus, an  article which is imported into the United States is treated as entirely  imported even if all or a portion of such article was originally  manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Evidence of fair market value. For purposes of subdivision (i)  of this subparagraph, the fair market value of imported articles  constituting foreign content may be evidenced by the customs invoice  issued on the importation of such articles into the United States. If  the holder of such articles is not the importer (or a related person  with respect to the importer), the fair market value of such articles  may be evidenced by a certificate based upon information contained in  the customs invoice and furnished to the holder by the person from whom  such articles (or property incorporating such articles) were purchased.  If a customs invoice or certificate described in the preceding sentence  is not available to a person purchasing property, such person shall  establish that no more than 50 percent of the fair market value of such  property is attributable to the fair market value of articles which were  imported into the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Interchangeable component articles--(a) Where identical or  similar component articles can be incorporated interchangeably into  property and a person acquires some such component articles that are  imported into the United States and other such component articles that  are not imported into the United States, the determination whether  imported component articles were incorporated in such property as is  exported from the United States shall be made on a substitution basis as  in the case of the rules relating to drawback accounts under the customs  laws. See section 313(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19  U.S.C. 1313(b)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The provisions of (a) of this subdivision may be illustrated by  the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Assume that a manufacturer produces a total of 20,000  electronic devices. The manufacturer exports 5,000 of the devices and  subsequently sells 11,000 of the devices to a DISC which exports the  11,000 devices. The major single component article in each device is a  tube which represents 60 percent of the fair market value of the device  at the time the device is sold by the manufacturer. The manufacturer  imports 8,000 of the tubes and produces the remaining 12,000 tubes. For  purposes of this subdivision, in accordance with the substitution  principle used in the customs drawback laws, the 5,000 devices exported  by the manufacturer are each treated as containing an imported tube  because the devices were exported prior to the sale to the DISC. The  remaining 3,000 imported tubes are treated as being contained in the  first 3,000 devices purchased and exported by the DISC. Thus, since the  50 percent test is not met with respect to the first 3,000 devices  purchased and exported by the DISC, those devices are not export  property. The remaining 8,000 devices purchased and exported by the DISC  are treated as containing tubes produced in United States, and those  devices are export property (if they otherwise meet the requirements of  this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Excluded property--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Notwithstanding any other  provision of this section, the following property is not export  property--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Property described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph  (relating to property leased to a member of a controlled group),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Property described in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph  (relating to certain types of intangible property),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Products described in paragraph (g) of this section (relating  to depletable products), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Products described in paragraph (h) of this section (relating  to certain export controlled products).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Property leased to member of controlled group--(i) In general.  Property leased to a person (whether or not a DISC) which is a member of  the same controlled group (as defined in Sec. 1.993-1(k)) as the lessor  constitutes export property for any period of time only if during the  period--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Such property is held for sublease, or is subleased, by such  person to a third person for the ultimate use of such third person;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Such third person is not a member of the same controlled group;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Such property is used predominantly outside the United States by  such third person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Predominant use. The provisions of paragraph (d)(4)(vi) of this  section apply in determining under subdivision (i)(c) of this  subparagraph whether such property is used predominently outside the  United States by such third person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Leasing rule. For purposes of this subparagraph, leased  property is deemed to be ultimately used by a member of the same  controlled group as the lessor if such property is leased to a person  which is not a member of such controlled group but which subleases such  property to a person which is a member of such controlled group. Thus,  for example, if X, a DISC for the taxable year, leases a movie film to  Y, a foreign corporation which is not a member of the same controlled  group as X, and Y then subleases the film to persons which are members  of such group for showing to the general public, the film is not export  property. On the other hand, if X, a DISC for the taxable year, leases a  movie film to Z, a foreign corporation which is a member of the same  controlled group as X, and Z then subleases the film to Y, another  foreign corporation, which is not a member of the same controlled group  for showing to the general public, the film is not disqualified under  this subparagraph from being export property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Certain copyrights. With respect to a copyright which is not  excluded by subparagraph (3) of this paragraph from being export  property, the ultimate use of such property is the sale or exhibition of  such property to the general public. Thus, if A, a DISC for the taxable  year, leases recording tapes to B, a foreign corporation which is a  member of the same controlled group as A, and if B makes records from  the recording tape and sells the records to C, another foreign  corporation, which is not a member of the same controlled group, for  sale by C to the general public, the recording tape is not disqualified  under this subparagraph from being export property, notwithstanding the  leasing of the recording tape by A to a member of the same controlled  group, since the ultimate use of the tape is the sale of the records  (i.e., property produced from the recording tape).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Intangible property. Export property does not include any  patent, invention, model, design, formula, or process, whether or not  patented, or any copyright (other than films, tapes, records, or similar  reproductions, for commercial or home use), goodwill, trademark,  tradebrand, franchise, or other like property. Although a copyright such  as a copyright on a book does not constitute export property, a  copyrighted article (such as a book) if not accompanied by a right to  reproduce it is export property if the requirements of this section are  otherwise satisfied. However, a license of a master recording tape for  reproduction outside the United States is not disqualified under this  subparagraph from being export property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Depletable products--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Under section 993(c)(2)(C),  a product or commodity which is a depletable product (as defined in  subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) or contains a depletable product is  not export property if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> It is a primary product from oil, gas, coal, or uranium (as  described in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> It does not qualify as a 50-percent manufactured or processed  product (as described in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definition of ``depletable product''. For purposes of this  paragraph, the term ``depletable product'' means any product or  commodity of a character with respect to which a deduction for depletion  is allowable under section 613 or 613A. Thus, the term depletable  product includes any mineral extracted from a mine, an oil or gas well,  or any other natural deposit, whether or not the DISC or related  supplier is allowed a deduction, or is eligible to take a deduction, for  depletion with respect to the mineral in computing its taxable income.  Thus, for example, iron ore purchased by a DISC from a broker is a  depletable product in the hands of the DISC for purposes of this  paragraph even though the DISC is not eligible to take a deduction for  depletion under section 613 or 613A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Primary product from oil, gas, coal, or uranium. A primary  product from oil, gas, coal, or uranium is not export   property. For purposes of this paragraph--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Primary product from oil. The term ``primary product from oil''  means crude oil and all products derived from the destructive  distillation of crude oil, including--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Volatile products,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Light oils such as motor fuel and kerosene,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Distillates such as naphtha,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Lubricating oils,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Greases and waxes, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Residues such as fuel oil.  For purposes of this paragraph, a product or commodity derived from  shale oil which would be a primary product from oil if derived from  crude oil is considered a primary product from oil.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Primary product from gas. The term ``primary product from gas''  means all gas and associated hydrocarbon components from gas wells or  oil wells, whether recovered at the lease or upon further processing,  including--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Natural gas,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Condensates,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Liquefied petroleum gases such as ethane, propane, and butane,  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Liquid products such as natural gasoline.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Primary product from coal. The term ``primary product from  coal'' means coal and all products recovered from the carbonization of  coal including--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Coke,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Coke-oven gas,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Gas liquor,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Crude light oil, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Coal tar.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Primary product from uranium. The term ``primary product from  uranium'' means uranium ore and uranium concentrates (known in the  industry as ``yellow cake''), and nuclear fuel materials derived from  the refining of uranium ore and uranium concentrates, or produced in a  nuclear reaction, including--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Uranium hexafluoride,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Enriched uranium hexafluoride,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Uranium metal,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Uranium compounds, such as uranium carbide,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Uranium dioxide, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Plutonium fuels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Primary products and changing technology. The primary products  from oil, gas, coal, or uranium described in subdivisions (i) through  (iv) of this subparagraph and the processes described in those  subdivisions are not intended to represent either the only primary  products from oil, gas, coal, or uranium, or the only processes from  which primary products may be derived under existing and future  technologies, such as the gasification and liquefaction of coal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Petrochemicals. For purposes of this paragraph, petrochemicals  are not considered primary products from oil, gas, or coal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> 50-percent manufactured or processed product--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A  product or commodity (other than a primary product from oil, gas, coal,  or uranium) which is or contains a depletable product is not excluded  from the term ``export property'' by reason of section 993(c)(2)(C) if  it is a 50-percent manufactured or processed product. Such a product or  commodity is a ``50-percent manufactured or processed product'' if,  after the cutoff point of the depletable product, it is manufactured or  processed (as defined in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph) and  either the cost test described in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph  or the fair market value test described in subdivision (v) of this  subparagraph is satisfied. To determine cutoff point, see subdivisions  (vi) and (vii) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Manufactured or processed. A product is manufactured or  processed if it is manufactured or produced within the meaning of  paragraph (c)(2) of this section, except that for purposes of this  subdivision the term manufacturing or processing does not include any  excluded process (as defined in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph)  and the term conversion costs (as used in subdivision (iv) of such  paragraph (c)(2)) does not include any costs attributable to any  excluded process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Excluded processes. For purposes of this paragraph, excluded  processes are extracting (i.e., all processes which are applied before  the cutoff point of the mineral to which such processes are applied),  and handling, packing, packaging, grading, storing, and transporting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Cost test. A product or commodity will qualify as a 50-percent  manufactured or processed product if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Its manufacturing and processing costs (that is, the portion of  the cost of goods sold or inventory amount of the product or commodity  attributable to the aggregate cost of manufacturing or processing each  mineral contained therein) equal or exceed--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> An amount equal to either of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> 50 percent of its cost of goods sold or inventory amount  (decreased, at the DISC's option, by the portion of such cost or amount  the DISC establishes is allocable to the difference between each prior  owner's selling price for each depletable product contained in such  product or commodity and such prior owner's cost of goods sold with  respect thereto).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> shall be  increased, by so much of the cost of goods sold or inventory amount of  the product or commodity as is properly allocable to any process other  than transportation applied after the cutoff point of such mineral which  would be a mining process (within the meaning of Sec. 1.613-4) were it  applied before such point.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Fair market value test. A product or commodity will qualify as a  50-percent manufactured or processed product if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The excess of its fair market value on the date it is sold,  exchanged, or otherwise disposed of (or, if not sold, exchanged, or  otherwise disposed of, the last day of the DISC's taxable year) over the  portion thereof properly allocable to excluded processes other than  extracting is equal to or greater than</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Twice the aggregate of the fair market value at the cutoff point  for each mineral contained in such product or commodity.  For purposes of this subdivision (v), the fair market value of a product  or commodity on the date it is sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of  is the price at which it is disposed of, subject to any adjustment that  may be required under the arm's length standard of section 482 and the  regulations thereunder. If such product or commodity is not sold,  exchanged, or otherwise disposed of, then, for purposes of section  992(a)(1)(B) (relating to the 95-percent test with respect to qualified  export assets), the fair market value of a product or commodity on the  last day of the DISC's taxable year is the arm's length price at which  such product or commodity would have been sold on such date, determined  by applying the principles of section 482 and the regulations  thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Cutoff point of a mineral. For purposes of this subparagraph:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a))</em> was in fact determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The cost at the cutoff point is deemed to be the amount of the  gross income from the property of the taxpayer eligible for a depletion  deduction with respect to the mineral.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The fair market value at the cutoff point is deemed to be the  amount of the gross income from the property of the taxpayer eligible  for a depletion deduction with respect to the mineral, except that, if  (1) the fair market value of a product or commodity on the date  specified in subdivision (v)(a) of this subparagraph exceeds the  aggregate of the fair market value at the cutoff point for each mineral  contained therein and (2) 10 percent or more of such excess is  attributable to a net increase in the fair market values of such  minerals by reason of factors other than manufacturing or processing or  the application of excluded processes (such as, for example, increases  in the fair market values of some minerals by reason of inflation or  speculation exceed decreases in such values of other minerals by reason  of deflation or speculation), then the aggregate of the fair market  value at the cutoff point for each such mineral shall be increased to  reflect the net excess so attributable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The provisions of this subdivision (vi) are illustrated by the  following example.</p><p class="depth0">Example. An integrated manufacturer, X, on February 1, 1976, had  gross income from the property (within the meaning of section 613(a)) of  $50 with respect to a specified volume of a mineral. Thus, the cost at  the cutoff point of the mineral was $50. X converted the mineral into a  product which it sold on July 15, 1976, for $75. Of the $25 excess of  the selling price over the gross income from the property, $23 was  attributable to manufacturing, processing, and the application or  excluded processes, and $2 was attributable to an increase in the fair  market value of the mineral due to inflation between February 1 and July  15, 1976. Since only 8 percent of such excess ($2/$25) was attributable  to factors other than manufacturing, processing, and the application of  excluded processes, the fair market value at the cutoff point of the  mineral is $50. However, had $3 of the $25 excess, or 12 percent, been  attributable to an increase in the fair market value of the mineral due  to inflation, then the fair market value at the cutoff point of the  mineral would be $53.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Special rule for certain used products and scrap products. If  a product or commodity is a used 50-percent manufactured or processed  product, or is recovered as scrap from a 50-percent manufactured or  processed product, such product or commodity will be treated as a 50- percent manufactured or processed product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Special rule for byproducts and waste products. For purposes of  applying the cost test or fair market value test of subdivision (iv) or  (v) of this subparagraph if a depletable product is recovered from a  manufacturing process as a byproduct or waste product, then the cost and  fair market value at the cutoff point are each deemed to be the lesser  of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The fair market value of the waste product or byproduct  containing the depletable product, determined as of the date the  byproduct or waste product is recovered, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> of this subdivision the cutoff point for the  depletable product of like kind and grade is deemed to be the point at  which gross income from the property would be determined if such  depletable product were sold by the taxpayer eligible to take a  deduction for depletion after the completion of all mining processes  applied to the depletable product and before the application of any  nonmining process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Proof of satisfaction of 50-percent manufactured or processed  test. (a) No substantiation is required to establish that either the  cost test or the fair market value test of subdivisions (iv) or (v) of  this subparagraph is satisfied or that a product or commodity qualifies  under (viii) of this subdivision as either a used 50-percent  manufactured or processed product or as scrap from a 50-percent  manufactured or processed product as long as it is reasonably obvious,  on the basis of all relevant facts and circumstances, that either the  cost test or fair market value test is satisfied, or that the product or  commodity qualifies as either as used 50-percent manufactured or  processed product or as scrap from a 50-percent manufactured or  processed product. Thus, for example, in the case of a DISC exporting a  high precision lens at least 50 percent of the fair market value of  which is obviously attributable to grinding, no substantiation of gross  income from the property properly allocable to the depletable products  contained in the lens, cost, or fair market values will be required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In cases in which satisfaction of either the cost test or the  fair market value test is not reasonably obvious, a DISC will be  required to substantiate the gross income from the property properly  allocable to each depletable product in a product or commodity and  either all costs or fair market values relied upon the DISC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> For purposes of substantiating (1) gross income from the  property properly allocable to a depletable product, (2) costs, and (3)  fair market values, the DISC and related supplier shall each identify  items in (or that were in) inventory in the same manner each used to  identify items in inventory for purposes of computing Federal income  tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Application of 50-percent test. The 50-percent test described  in this subparagraph is applied on an item-by-item basis. If, however, a  DISC sells a   substantial volume of substantially identical products or commodities  and if all or a group of such products or commodities contain  substantially identical depletable products in substantially the same  proportions and have cost or fair market value relationships (as the  case may be) that are in substantially the same proportions, such DISC  may apply the 50-percent test on an aggregate basis with respect to all  such products or commodities, or group, as the case may be.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Effective dates. Except as provided in subparagraph (6) of this  paragraph, section 993(c)(2)(C) applies--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> With respect to any product or commodity not owned by a DISC, to  sales, exchanges, or other dispositions made after March 18, 1975, with  respect to which the DISC derives gross receipts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> With respect to any product or commodity acquired by a DISC  after March 18, 1975.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> With respect to any product or commodity owned by a DISC on  March 18, 1975, to sales, exchanges, or other dispositions made after  March 18, 1976, and to owning such product or commodity after such date.  For purposes of this paragraph and subparagraph (6) of this paragraph,  the date of a sale, exchange, or other disposition of a product or  commodity is the date as of which title to such product or commodity  passes. The accounting method of a person is not determinative of the  date of a sale, exchange, or other disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Fixed contracts. Section 1101(f) of the Tax Reform Act of 1976  provides an exception to the effective date rules in this paragraph and  in paragraph (h) of this section. Section 1101(f)(2) of the Act provides  that section 993(c)(2)(C) and (D) shall not apply to sales, exchanges,  and other dispositions made after March 18, 1975, but before March 19,  1980, if they are made pursuant to a fixed contract. Section 1101(f)(2)  also defines fixed contract. Under that definition, if the seller can  vary the price of the product for unspecified cost increases (which  could include tax cost increases), or if the quantity of products or  commodities to be sold can be increased or decreased under the contract  by the seller without penalty, the contract is not to be considered a  fixed contract with respect to the amount over which the seller has  discretion. For example, if a contract calls for a minimum delivery of x  amount of a product but allows the seller to refuse to deliver goods  beyond that minimum amount (or allows a renegotiation of the sales price  of goods beyond that amount), then with respect to the amount above the  minimum the contract is not a fixed quantity contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Export controlled products--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. An export controlled  product is not export property. A product or commodity may be an export  controlled product at one time but not an export controlled product at  another time. For purposes of this paragraph, a product or commodity is  an ``export controlled product'' at a particular time if at that time  the export of such product or commodity is prohibited or curtailed under  section 4(b) of the Export Administration Act of 1969 or section 7(a) of  the Export Administration Act of 1979, to effectuate the policy relating  to the protection of the domestic economy set forth in such Acts  (paragraph (2)(A) of section 3 of the Export Administration Act of 1969  and paragraph (2)(C) of section 3 of the Export Administration Act of  1979). Such policy is to use export controls to the extent necessary  ``to protect the domestic economy from the excessive drain of scarce  materials and to reduce the serious inflationary impact of foreign  demand.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Products considered export controlled products--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.  For purposes of this paragraph, an export controlled product is a  product or commodity which is subject to short supply export controls  under 15 CFR part 377. A product or commodity is considered an export  controlled product for the duration of each control period which applies  to such product or commodity. A control period of a product or commodity  begins on and includes the initial control date (as defined in  subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph) and ends on and includes the  final control date (as defined in subdivision (iii) of this  subparagraph).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Initial control date. The initial control date of a product or  commodity which was subject to short supply export controls on March 19,  1975, is   March 19, 1975. The initial control date of a product or commodity which  is subject to short supply export controls after March 19, 1975, is the  effective date stated in the regulations to 15 CFR part 377 which  subjects such product or commodity to short supply export controls. If  there is no effective date stated in such regulations, the initial  control date of such product or commodity is the date on which such  regulations are filed for publications in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Final control date. The final control date of a product or  commodity is the effective date stated in the regulations to 15 CFR part  377 which removes such product or commodity from short supply export  controls. If there is no effective date stated in such regulations, the  final control date of such product or commodity is the date on which  such regulations are filed for publication in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Expiration of Export Administration Act. An initial control  date and a final control date cannot occur after the expiration date of  the Export Administration Act under the authority of which the short  supply export controls were issued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Effective dates--(i) Products controlled on March 19, 1975.  Except as provided in paragraph (g)(6) of this section, if a product or  commodity was subject to short supply export controls on March 19, 1975,  this paragraph applies--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> With respect to any such product or commodity not owned by a  DISC, to sales, exchanges, other dispositions, or leases made after  March 18, 1975, with respect to which the DISC derives gross receipts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> With respect to any such product or commodity acquired by a DISC  after March 18, 1975, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> With respect to any such product or commodity owned by a DISC on  March 18, 1975, to sales, exchanges, other dispositions, and leases made  after March 18, 1976, and to owning such product or commodity after such  date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Products first controlled after March 19, 1975. If a product or  commodity becomes subject to short supply export controls after March  19, 1975, this paragraph applies to sales, exchanges, other  dispositions, or leases of such product or commodity made on or after  the initial control date of such product or commodity, and to owning  such product or commodity on or after such date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Date of sale, exchange, lease, or other disposition. For  purposes of this subparagraph, the date of sale, exchange, or other  disposition of a product or commodity is the date as of which title to  such product or commodity passes. The date of a lease is the date as of  which the lessee takes possession of a product or commodity. The  accounting method of a person is not determinative of the date of sale,  exchange, other disposition, or lease.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Property in short supply. If the President determines that the  supply of any property which is otherwise export property as defined in  this section is insufficient to meet the requirements of the domestic  economy, he may by Executive order designate such property as in short  supply. Any property so designated will be treated as property which is  not export property during the period beginning with the date specified  in such Executive order and ending with the date specified in an  Executive order setting forth the President's determination that such  property is no longer in short supply.
