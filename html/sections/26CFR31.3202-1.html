                                Sec. 31.3202-1  Collection of, and liability for, employee tax.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Collection; general rule. The employer shall collect from each  of his employees the employee tax imposed with respect to the  compensation of the employee by deducting or causing to be deducted the  amount of such tax from the compensation subject to the tax as and when  such compensation is paid. As to the measure of the employee tax, see  Sec. 31.3201-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Collection; payments by two or more employers in excess of  annual compensation limitation. For rules relating to payments by two or  more employers in excess of the annual compensation limitation see  Sec. 31.3121(a)(1)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Undercollections or overcollections. Any undercollection or  overcollection of employee tax resulting from the employer's inability  to determine, at the time compensation is paid, the correct amount of  compensation with respect to which the deduction should be made shall be  corrected in accordance with the provisions of Subpart G of the  regulations in this part relating to adjustments, credits, refunds, and  abatements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> When fractional part of cent may be disregarded. In collecting  the employee tax, the employer shall disregard any fractional part of a  cent of such tax unless it amounts to one-half cent or more, in which  case it shall be increased to one cent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Employer's liability. The employer is liable for the employee  tax with respect to compensation paid by him, whether or not collected  from the employee. If the employer deducts less than the correct amount  of employee tax or fails to deduct any part of the tax, he is  nevertheless liable for the correct amount of the tax. Until collected  from him, the employee is also liable for the employee tax. Any employee  tax collected by or on behalf of an employer is a special fund in trust  for the United States. See section 7501. An employer is not liable to  any person for the amount of the employee tax deducted by him and paid  to the district director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Concurrent employment. If two or more related corporations who  are rail employers concurrently employ the same individual and  compensate that individual through a common paymaster, which is one of  the related corporations employing the individual, see Sec. 31.3121(s)- 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Special rules regarding Additional Medicare Tax. (1) An employer  is required to collect from each of its employees the portion of the tax  imposed by section 3201(a) (as calculated under section 3101(b)(2))  (Additional Medicare Tax) with respect to compensation for employment  performed for the employer by the employee only to the extent the  employer pays compensation to the employee in excess of $200,000 in a  calendar year. This rule applies regardless of the employee's filing  status or other income. Thus, the employer disregards any amount of  compensation or Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) wages paid to  the employee's spouse. The employer also disregards any FICA wages paid  by the employer to the employee or any compensation or FICA wages paid  to the employee by another employer.</p><p class="depth0">Example. A, who is married and files a joint return, receives  $100,000 in compensation from her employer for the calendar year. B, A's  spouse, receives $300,000 in compensation from his employer for the same  calendar year. A's compensation is not in excess of $200,000, so A's  employer does not withhold Additional Medicare Tax. B's employer is  required to collect Additional Medicare Tax only with respect to  compensation it pays to B that is in excess of the $200,000 threshold  (that is, $100,000) for the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2))</em>, the employee is liable to pay the tax.</p><p class="depth0">Example. C, who is married and files a joint return, receives  $190,000 in compensation from her employer for the calendar year. D, C's  spouse, receives $150,000 in compensation from his employer for the same  calendar year. Neither C's nor D's compensation is in excess of  $200,000, so neither C's nor D's employers are required to withhold  Additional Medicare Tax. C and D are liable to pay Additional Medicare  Tax on $90,000 ($340,000 minus the $250,000 threshold for a joint  return).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the employer deducts less than the correct amount of  Additional Medicare Tax, or if it fails to deduct any part of Additional  Medicare Tax, it is nevertheless liable for the correct amount of tax  that it was required to withhold, unless and until the employee pays the  tax. If an employee subsequently pays the tax that the employer failed  to deduct, the tax will not be collected from the employer. The employer  will not be relieved of its liability for payment of the tax required to  be withheld unless it can show that the tax under section 3201(a) (as  calculated under section 3101(b)(2)) has been paid. The employer,  however, will remain subject to any applicable penalties or additions to  tax resulting from the failure to withhold as required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Effective/applicability date. Paragraph (g) of this section  applies to quarters beginning on or after November 29, 2013.  [T.D. 6516, 25 FR 13032, Dec. 20, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6541, 26 FR  553, Jan. 20, 1961; T.D. 6727, 29 FR 5866, May 5, 1964; T.D. 8582, 59 FR  66189, Dec. 23, 1994; T.D. 9645, 78 FR 71472, Nov. 29, 2013]</p><p class="depth0">Tax on Employee Representatives</p>
