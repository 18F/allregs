Every security issue within the scope of the jurisdiction conferred upon the Commission by sections 19 and 20 of the Federal Power Act shall be subject to the provisions of Sec. 20.2, except a security issue by a person organized and operating in a State under the laws of which its security issues are regulated by a State commission, or by any one described in subsection 201(f) of the act. No other security issue within the scope of sections 19 and 20 shall be subject to Sec. 20.2 except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reservation of possibility of regulation in other cases. Not later than 10 days prior to any proposed security issuance which is within the scope of section 19 or section 20 of the act, but excepted by paragraph (a) of this section, any person or state entitled to do so under section 19 or section 20, may file a complaint or request in accordance with the applicable rules of the Commission, or the Commission upon its own motion may by order initiate a proceeding, raising the question whether issuance of such security should be subjected by Commission order to the provisions of Sec. 20.2. After notice of such filing or order, and until such request or complaint is denied or dismissed or the proceeding initiated by such order is terminated without subjecting the issuance of the security to the provisions of Sec. 20.2, the security in question shall not be issued except it be issued subject to and in compliance with Sec. 20.2.</p>
