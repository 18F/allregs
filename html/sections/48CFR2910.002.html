                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(c), purchase descriptions must  not specify a product, or specific feature of a product, peculiar to a  manufacturer unless they are justified to the contracting officer in  writing by the office initiating   the purchase request. The justification must state that the product, or  specific product feature, is essential to the Government's requirements  and other similar products or features will not meet these requirements.  This determination must be signed by a representative of the office  originating the request and must accompany the purchase requisition  submitted to the appropriate contracting office. If such a justification  is not made, the contracting officer may assume that another make and  model or a generic product could equally meet the DOL requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>, the requisitioning office must  submit to the contracting officer information demonstrating that a  variety of products from various commercial sources have been  considered. This requirement is not necessary for required sources (See  FAR 8.001). Orders to be placed against non-mandatory sources, such as  the Federal Supply Schedules, or other Governmentwide Acquisition  Contracts, should include product information concerning multiple  sources based on research from www.contractdirectory.gov site or other  sources. When documented in this manner, the contracting officer may  rely on this information in developing a procurement strategy, or for  documenting the comparison of catalogs or pricelists.
