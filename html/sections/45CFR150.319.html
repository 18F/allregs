                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">For every violation subject to a civil money penalty, if there are  substantial or several mitigating circumstances, the aggregate amount of  the penalty is set at an amount sufficiently below the maximum permitted  by Sec. 150.315 to reflect that fact. As guidelines for taking into  account the factors listed in Sec. 150.317, CMS considers the  following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Record of prior compliance. It should be considered a mitigating  circumstance if the responsible entity has done any of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Before receipt of the notice issued under Sec. 150.307,  implemented and followed a compliance plan as described in Sec.  150.311(f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Had no previous complaints against it for noncompliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Gravity of the violation(s). It should be considered a  mitigating circumstance if the responsible entity has done any of the  following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Made adjustments to its business practices to come into  compliance with PHS Act requirements so that the following occur:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All employers, employees, individuals and non-Federal  governmental entities are identified that are or were issued any policy,  certificate of insurance or plan document, or any form used in  connection therewith that failed to comply.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All employers, employees, individuals, and non-Federal  governmental plans are identified that were denied coverage or were  denied a right provided under PHS Act requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Each employer, employee, individual, or non-Federal  governmental plan adversely affected by the violation has been, for  example, offered coverage or provided a certificate of creditable  coverage in a manner that complies with PHS Act requirements that were  violated so that, to the extent   practicable, that employer, employee, individual, or non-Federal  governmental entity is in the same position that he, she, or it would  have been in had the violation not occurred.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The adjustments are completed in a timely manner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Discovered areas of noncompliance without notice from CMS and  voluntarily reported that noncompliance, provided that the responsible  entity submits the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Documentation verifying that the rights and protections of all  individuals adversely affected by the noncompliance have been restored;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A plan of correction to prevent future similar violations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Demonstrated that the violation is an isolated occurrence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Demonstrated that the financial and other impacts on affected  individuals is negligible or nonexistent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Demonstrated that the noncompliance is correctable and that a  high percentage of the violations were corrected.
