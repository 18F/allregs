                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each emission  limitation in Table 1 to this subpart that applies to you according to  methods specified in Table 4 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> through (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determine the percentage of batches over a 12-month calculation  period that were in compliance with the applicable maximum  concentration. The total number of batches in the calculation period is  the sum of the numbers of batches of each fermentation stage for which  emission limits apply. To calculate the 12-month percentage, do not  include batches in production during periods of malfunction. In counting  the number of batches in the 12-month calculation period, include those  batches for which the batch monitoring period ended on or after 12 a.m.  on the first day of the period and exclude those batches for which the  batch monitoring period did not end on or before 11:59 p.m. on the last  day of the period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must determine the 12-month percentage at the end of each  calendar month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The first 12-month calculation period begins on the compliance  date that is specified for your source in Sec. 63.2133 and ends on the  last day of the month that includes the date 365 days after your  compliance date, unless the compliance date for your source is the first  day of the month, in which case the first 12-month calculation period  ends on the last day of the month that is 11 calendar months after the  compliance date. (For example, if the compliance date for your source is  October 15, 2003, the first 12-month calculation period would begin on  October 15, 2003, and end on October 31, 2004. If the compliance date  for your source is October 1, 2003, the first 12-month calculation  period would begin on October 1, 2003, and end on September 30, 2004.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The second 12-month calculation period and each subsequent 12- month calculation period begin on the first day of the month following  the first full month of the previous 12-month averaging period and end  on the last day of the month 11 calendar months later. (For example, if  the compliance date for your source is October 15, 2003, the second  calculation period would begin on December 1, 2003 and end on November  30, 2004.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must report each instance (that is, each 12-month  calculation period) in which you did not meet each emission requirement  in Table 4 to this subpart that applies to you. (Failure of a single  batch to meet a concentration limit does not in and of itself constitute  a failure to meet the emission limitation.) Each instance in which you  failed to meet each applicable emission limitation is reported as part  of the requirements in Sec. 63.2181.
