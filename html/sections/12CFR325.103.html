The FDIC may reclassify a well capitalized bank as adequately  capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized bank or an  undercapitalized bank to comply with certain mandatory or discretionary  supervisory actions as if the bank were in the next lower capital  category (except that the FDIC may not reclassify a significantly  undercapitalized bank as critically undercapitalized) (each of these  actions are hereinafter referred to generally as ``reclassifications'')  in the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unsafe or unsound condition. The FDIC has determined, after  notice and opportunity for hearing pursuant to Sec. 308.202(a) of this  chapter, that the bank is in unsafe or unsound condition; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unsafe or unsound practice. The FDIC has determined, after  notice and opportunity for hearing pursuant to Sec. 308.202(a) of this  chapter, that, in the most recent examination of the bank, the bank  received and has not corrected a less-than-satisfactory rating for any  of the categories of asset quality, management, earnings, or liquidity.
