                            <p class="depth0">States that are parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the  Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on  Their Destruction, also known as the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC or  Convention), undertake never to develop, produce, acquire, stockpile,  transfer, or use chemical weapons. As a State Party to the Convention,  the United States is subjecting certain toxic chemicals and their  precursors listed in Schedules within the Convention to trade  restrictions. Trade restrictions include: a prohibition on the export of  Schedule 1 chemicals to States not Party to the CWC; a prohibition on  the reexport of Schedule 1 chemicals to all destinations (both States  Parties to the CWC and States not Party to the CWC); license  requirements for the export of Schedule 1 chemicals to all States  Parties; a prohibition on the export of Schedule 2 chemicals to States  not Party to the CWC; and an End-Use Certificate requirement for exports  of Schedule 3 chemicals to States not Party to the CWC. Exports of CWC  chemicals that do not require a license for CW reasons (e.g., exports  and reexports of Schedule 2 and Schedule 3 chemicals to States Parties  to the CWC) may require a license for other reasons set forth in the  EAR. (See, in particular, the license requirements in Sec. 742.2 of the  EAR that apply to exports and reexports of precursor chemicals  controlled by ECCN 1C350, for CB reasons. Also note the end-use and end- user restrictions in part 744 of the EAR and the restrictions that apply  to embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> License requirements (1) Schedule 1 chemicals and mixtures  controlled under ECCN 1C351. A license is required for CW reasons to  export or reexport Schedule 1 chemicals controlled under ECCN 1C351.d.11  or d.12 to all destinations including Canada. CW applies to 1C351.d.11  for ricin in the form of Ricinus Communis AgglutininII  (RCAII), which is also known as ricin D or Ricinus Communis  LectinIII (RCLIII), and Ricinus Communis  LectinIV (RCLIV), which is also known as ricin E.  CW applies to 1C351.d.12 for saxitoxin identified by C.A.S. 35523-89-8.  (Note that the advance notification procedures and annual reporting  requirements described in Sec. 745.1 of the EAR also apply to exports  of Schedule 1 chemicals.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Schedule 2 and 3 chemicals and mixtures controlled under ECCN  1C350, ECCN 1C355, or ECCN 1C395--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> States Parties to the CWC.

A license is required for CW  reasons to export Schedule 3 chemicals and mixtures controlled under  ECCN 1C350.c, ECCN 1C355.b, or ECCN 1C395.b to States not Party to the  CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to Part 745 of the  EAR), unless the exporter obtains from the consignee an   End-Use Certificate (issued by the government of the importing country)  prior to exporting the Schedule 3 chemicals and submits it to BIS in  accordance with the procedures described in Sec. 745.2 of the EAR.  Note, however, that obtaining an End-Use Certificate does not relieve  the exporter from the responsibility of complying with other license  requirements set forth elsewhere in the EAR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reexports. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Reexports from States Parties to the CWC.
