                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Violations of Seaway Regulations, Subpart A of this part, will  be brought to the attention of the alleged violator at the time of  detection whenever possible. When appropriate, there will be a written  notification of the fact of the violation. This notification will set   forth the time and nature of the violation and advise the alleged  violator relative to the administrative procedure employed in processing  civil penalty cases. The alleged violator will be advised that he or she  has 15 days in which to appear before the Associate Administrator or  submit a written statement for consideration. The Associate  Administrator shall, upon expiration of the 15-day period, determine  whether there has been a violation of the Seaway Regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the Associate Administrator decides that a violation of  Seaway Regulations has occurred, a determination will be made as to  whether to invoke no penalty at all and close the case or whether to  invoke a part or full statutory penalty. In either event, a written  notice of the decision shall be given to advise the violator. If a  penalty is assessed, such notice will advise the violator of the right  to petition for relief within 15 days or such longer period as the  Associate Administrator, in his or her discretion, may allow. The  Associate Administrator may mitigate the penalty or remit it in full,  except as the latter action is limited to paragraph (f) of this section.  The violator may appear in person before the Associate Administrator. If  the violator does not apply for relief but instead maintains that he or  she has not committed the violation(s) charged, and the Associate  Administrator, upon review, concludes that invocation of the penalty was  proper, no remission or mitigation action will be taken. On the other  hand, should the violator petition the Associate Administrator for  relief without contesting the determination that violation did, in fact,  occur, relief may be granted as the circumstances may warrant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When the penalty is mitigated, such mitigation will be made  conditional upon payment of the balance within 15 days of notice or  within such other longer period of time as the Associate Administrator,  in his or her discretion, may allow.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The violator may appeal to the Administrator from the action of  the Associate Administrator. Any such appeal shall be submitted to the  Administrator through the Associate Administrator within 15 days of the  date of notification by the Associate Administrator, or such longer  period of time as the Associate Administrator, in his or her  discretions, may allow.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Should the alleged violator require additional time to present  matters favorable to the case at any stage of these penalty proceedings,  a request for additional time shall be addressed to the Associate  Administrator who will grant a reasonable extension of time where  sufficient justification is shown.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Under the following circumstances, the Corporation's Chief  Counsel shall forward cases involving violations of the Seaway  Regulations to the United States Attorney with the recommendation that  action be taken to collect the assessed statutory penalty:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When, within the prescribed time, the violator does not explain  the violation, appeal for mitigation or remission, or otherwise respond  to written notices from the Associate Administrator; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When, having responded to such inquiries, the violator fails or  refuses to pay the assessed or mitigated penalty, or to appeal to the  Administrator, within the time prescribed; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the violator denies that the violation(s) was committed by  him or her, the Associate Administrator, upon review, disagrees and the  violator thereafter fails to appeal to the Administrator, or to remit  payment of the assessed penalty within the time prescribed (see  paragraph (b) of this section); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When the violator fails to pay within the prescribed time the  penalty as determined by the Administrator after consideration of the  violator's appeal from the action of the Associate Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If a report of boarding or an investigation report submitted by  a Corporation employee or investigative body discloses evidence of  violation of a Federal criminal statute, the Corporation's Chief  Counsel, in accordance with Sec. 401.204, shall refer the findings to   the United States Attorney for appropriate action.
