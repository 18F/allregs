                            <p class="depth0">A member of the Navy or Marine Corps arrested by Federal or State  authorities and released on bail or on his own recognizance has a duty  to return to his parent organization. Accordingly, when a member of the  Navy or Marine Corps is arrested by Federal or State authorities and  returns to his ship or station on bail, or on his own recognizance, the  commanding officer, upon verification of the attesting facts, date of  trial, and approximate length of time that should be covered by the  absence, shall grant liberty or leave to permit appearance for trial,  unless this would have a serious negative impact on the command. In the  event that liberty or leave is not granted, a judge advocate of the Navy  or Marine Corps should immediately be requested to act as liaison with  the court. Nothing in this section is to be construed as permitting the  member arrested and released to avoid the obligations of bond or  recognizance by reason of the member's being in the military service.</p>
