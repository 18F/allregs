                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the following records may be withheld from disclosure:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Records specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and which are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order. Records to which this provision applies shall be deemed by the Commission to have been properly classified. This exception may apply to records in the custody of the Commission which have been transmitted to the Commission by another agency which has designated the record as nonpublic under an Executive order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Records related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Records specifically exempted from disclosure by statute, provided that such statute:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Requires that the matter be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Trade secrets and commercial financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Personnel and medical files and similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nothing in this section authorizes withholding of information or limiting the availability of records to the public except as specifically stated in this part, nor shall this part be authority to withhold information from Congress.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this part. The amount of information deleted shall be indicated on the released portion of the record, unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption in this section under which the deletion is made. If technically feasible, the amount of the information deleted shall be indicated at the place in the record where such deletion is made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Whenever a request is made which involves access to records described in paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section and the investigation or proceeding involves a possible violation of criminal law, and there is reason to believe that the subject of the investigation or proceeding is not aware of its pendency, and disclosure of the existence of the records could reasonably be expected to

interfere with enforcement proceedings, the Commission may, during only such time as that circumstance continues, treat the records as not subject to the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552 and this subpart.</p>
