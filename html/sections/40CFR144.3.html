                            <p class="depth0">Terms not defined in this section have the meaning given by the appropriate Act. When a defined term appears in a definition, the defined term

is sometimes placed within quotation marks as an aid to readers.</p><p class="depth0">Administrator means the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or an authorized representative.</p><p class="depth0">Application means the EPA standard national forms for applying for a permit, including any additions, revisions or modifications to the forms; or forms approved by EPA for use in approved States, including any approved modifications or revisions.</p><p class="depth0">Appropriate Act and regulations means the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); or Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), whichever is applicable; and applicable regulations promulgated under those statutes.</p><p class="depth0">Approved State Program means a UIC program administered by the State or Indian Tribe that has been approved by EPA according to SDWA sections 1422 and/or 1425.</p><p class="depth0">Aquifer means a geological ``formation,'' group of formations, or part of a formation that is capable of yielding a significant amount of water to a well or spring.</p><p class="depth0">Area of review means the area surrounding an injection well described according to the criteria set forth in Sec.  146.06 or in the case of an area permit, the project area plus a circumscribing area the width of which is either \1/4\ of a mile or a number calculated according to the criteria set forth in Sec.  146.06.</p><p class="depth0">Cesspool means a ``drywell'' that receives untreated sanitary waste containing human excreta, and which sometimes has an open bottom and/or perforated sides.</p><p class="depth0">Contaminant means any physical, chemical, biological, or radiological substance or matter in water.</p><p class="depth0">Director means the Regional Administrator, the State director or the Tribal director as the context requires, or an authorized representative. When there is no approved State or Tribal program, and there is an EPA administered program, ``Director'' means the Regional Administrator. When there is an approved State or Tribal program, ``Director'' normally means the State or Tribal director. In some circumstances, however, EPA retains the authority to take certain actions even when there is an approved State or Tribal program. In such cases, the term ``Director'' means the Regional Administrator and not the State or Tribal director.</p><p class="depth0">Draft permit means a document prepared under Sec.  124.6 indicating the Director's tentative decision to issue or deny, modify, revoke and reissue, terminate, or reissue a ``permit.'' A notice of intent to terminate a permit, and a notice of intent to deny a permit, as discussed in Sec.  124.5 are types of ``draft permits.'' A denial of a request for modification, revocation and reissuance, or termination, as discussed in Sec.  124.5 is not a ``draft permit.''</p><p class="depth0">Drilling mud means a heavy suspension used in drilling an ``injection well,'' introduced down the drill pipe and through the drill bit.</p><p class="depth0">Drywell means a well, other than an improved sinkhole or subsurface fluid distribution system, completed above the water table so that its bottom and sides are typically dry except when receiving fluids.</p><p class="depth0">Eligible Indian Tribe is a Tribe that meets the statutory requirements established at 42 U.S.C. 300j-11(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0">Emergency permit means a UIC ``permit'' issued in accordance with Sec.  144.34.</p><p class="depth0">Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'') means the United States Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p class="depth0">EPA means the United States ``Environmental Protection Agency.''</p><p class="depth0">Exempted aquifer means an ``aquifer'' or its portion that meets the criteria in the definition of ``underground source of drinking water'' but which has been exempted according to the procedures in Sec.  144.7.</p><p class="depth0">Existing injection well means an ``injection well'' other than a ``new injection well.''</p><p class="depth0">Facility or activity means any UIC ``injection well,'' or an other facility or activity that is subject to regulation under the UIC program.</p><p class="depth0">Fluid means any material or substance which flows or moves whether in a semisolid, liquid, sludge, gas, or any other form or state.</p><p class="depth0">Formation means a body of consolidated or unconsolidated rock characterized by a degree of lithologic homogeneity which is prevailingly, but not
