subpart shall achieve initial compliance with the requirements of this subpart no later than June 22, 2001.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator of a new or reconstructed steel pickling facility and/or hydrochloric acid regeneration plant subject to this subpart that commences construction or reconstruction after September 18, 1997, shall achieve compliance with the requirements of this subpart immediately upon startup of operations or by June 22, 1999, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Maintenance requirements. (1) The owner or operator shall prepare an operation and maintenance plan for each emission control device to be implemented no later than the compliance date. The plan shall be incorporated by reference into the source's title V permit. All such plans must be consistent with good maintenance practices, and, for a scrubber emission control device, must at a minimum:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Require monitoring and recording the pressure drop across the scrubber once per shift while the scrubber is operating in order to identify changes that may indicate a need for maintenance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Require the manufacturer's recommended maintenance at the recommended intervals on fresh solvent pumps, recirculating pumps, discharge pumps, and other liquid pumps, in addition to exhaust system and scrubber fans and motors associated with those pumps and fans;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Require cleaning of the scrubber internals and mist eliminators at intervals sufficient to prevent buildup of solids or other fouling;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Require an inspection of each scrubber at intervals of no less than 3 months with:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Cleaning or replacement of any plugged spray nozzles or other liquid delivery devices;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Repair or replacement of missing, misaligned, or damaged baffles, trays, or other internal components;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Repair or replacement of droplet eliminator elements as needed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Repair or replacement of heat exchanger elements used to control the temperature of fluids entering or leaving the scrubber; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Adjustment of damper settings for consistency with the required air flow.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If the scrubber is not equipped with a viewport or access hatch allowing visual inspection, alternate means of inspection approved by the Administrator may be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The owner or operator shall initiate procedures for corrective action within 1 working day of detection of an operating problem and complete all corrective actions as soon as practicable. Procedures to be initiated are the applicable actions that are specified in the maintenance plan. Failure to initiate or provide appropriate repair, replacement, or other corrective action is a violation of the maintenance requirement of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The owner or operator shall maintain a record of each inspection, including each item identified in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, that is signed by the responsible maintenance official and that shows the date of each inspection, the problem identified, a description of the repair, replacement, or other corrective action taken, and the date of the repair, replacement, or other corrective action taken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator of each hydrochloric acid regeneration plant shall develop and implement a written maintenance program. The program shall require:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Performance of the manufacturer's recommended maintenance at the recommended intervals on all required systems and components;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Initiation of procedures for appropriate and timely repair, replacement, or other corrective action within 1 working day of detection; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Maintenance of a daily record, signed by a responsible maintenance official, showing the date of each inspection for each requirement, the problems found, a description of the repair, replacement, or other action taken, and the date of repair or replacement.
