Oral motions and petitions may be  ruled on immediately. Motions and petitions submitted to the reviewing  authority or the presiding officer, respectively, and not disposed of in  separate rulings or in their respective decisions will be deemed denied.  Oral arguments shall not be held on written motions or petitions unless  the presiding officer in the officer's discretion expressly so orders.
