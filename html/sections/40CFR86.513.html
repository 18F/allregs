Sec. 86.515-78  EPA urban dynamometer driving schedule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The dynamometer driving schedules are listed in appendix I. The driving schedules are defined by a smooth trace drawn through the specified

speed vs. time relationships. They consist of a nonrepetitive series of idle, acceleration, cruise, and deceleration modes of various time sequences and rates. Appropriate driving schedules are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Class I--Appendix I(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Class II--Appendix I(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Class III--Appendix I(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The speed tolerance at any given time on the dynamometer driving schedule prescribed in appendix I or as printed on a driver's aid chart approved by the Administrator, when conducted to meet the requirements of Sec. 86.537 is defined by upper and lower limits. The upper limit is 3.2 km/h (2 mph) higher than the highest point on the trace within 1 second of the given time. The lower limit is 3.2 km/h (2 mph) lower than the lowest point on the trace within 1 second of the given time. Speed variations greater than the tolerances (such as may occur during gear changes) are acceptable provided they occur for less than 2 seconds on any occasion. Speeds lower than those prescribed are acceptable provided the vehicle is operated at maximum available power during such occurrences. When conducted to meet the requirements of Sec. 86.532 the speed tolerance shall be as specified above, except that the upper and lower limits shall be 6.4 km/h (4 mph).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Figure F78-4 shows the range of acceptable speed tolerances for typical points. Figure F78-4(a) is typical of portions of the speed curve which are increasing or decreasing throughout the two second time interval. Figure F78-4(b) is typical of portions of the speed curve which include a maximum or minimum value.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.177</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> For motorcycles with an engine displacement less than 50 cc and a top speed less than 58.7 km/hr (36.5 mph), the speed indicated for each second of operation on the applicable Class I driving trace (speed versus time sequence) specified in appendix I(b) shall be adjusted downward by the ratio of actual top speed to specified maximum test speed. Calculate the ratio with three significant figures by dividing the top speed of the motorcycle in km/hr by 58.7. For example, for a motorcycle with a top speed of 48.3 km/hr (30 mph), the ratio would be 48.3/58.7 = 0.823. The top speed to be used under this section shall be indicated in the manufacturer's application for certification, and shall be the highest sustainable speed of the motorcycle with an 80 kg rider on a flat paved surface. If the motorcycle is equipped with a permanent speed governor that is unlikely to be removed in actual use, measure the top speed in the governed configuration; otherwise measure the

top speed in the ungoverned configuration.

Sec. 86.518-78  Dynamometer calibration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The dynamometer shall be calibrated at least once each month or performance verified at least once each week and then calibrated as required. The dynamometer is driven above the test speed range. The device used to drive the dynamometer is then disengaged from the dynamometer and the roll is allowed to coast down. The kinetic energy of the system is dissipated by the dynamometer. This method neglects the variations in roll bearing friction due to the drive axle weight of the vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Calibration shall consist of coasting down the dynamometer for each inertia load combination used. Coastdown times for the interval from 70 to 60 km/h shall be within the tolerances specified in Sec. 86.529. The dynamometer adjustments necessary to produce these results shall be noted for future reference.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The performance check consists of conducting a dynamometer coastdown at one or more inertia-horsepower settings and comparing the coastdown time to the table in Figure F98-9 of Sec. 86.529-98. If the coastdown time is outside the tolerance, a new calibration is required.

Sec. 86.519-90  Constant volume sampler calibration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The CVS (Constant Volume Sampler) is calibrated using an accurate flowmeter and restrictor valve. Measurements of various parameters are made and related to flow through the unit. Procedures used by EPA for both PDP (Positive Displacement Pump) and CFV (Critical Flow Venturi) are outlined below. Other procedures yielding equivalent results may be used if approved in advance by the Administrator. After the calibration curve has been obtained, verification of the entire system can be performed by injecting a known mass of gas into the system and comparing the mass indicated by the system to the true mass injected. An indicated error does not necessarily mean that the calibration is wrong, since other factors can influence the accuracy of the system, e.g., analyzer calibration. A verification procedure is found in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> PDP calibration. (1) The following calibration procedures outlines the

equipment, the test configuration, and the various parameters which must be measured to establish the flow rate of the constant volume sampler pump. All the parameters related to the pump are simultaneously measured with the parameters related to a flowmeter which is connected in series with the pump. The calculated flow rate (at pump inlet absolute pressure and temperature) can then be plotted versus a correlation function which is the value of a specific combination of pump parameters. The linear equation which relates the pump flow and the correlation function is then determined. In the event that a CVS has a multiple speed drive, a calibration for each range must be performed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> This calibration procedure is based on the measurement of the absolute values of the pump and flowmeter parameters that relate the flow rate at each point. Three conditions must be maintained to assure the accuracy and integrity of the calibration curve. First, the pump pressures should be measured at taps on the pump rather than at the external piping on the pump inlet and outlet. Pressure taps that are mounted at the top center and bottom center of the pump drive headplate are exposed to the actual pump cavity pressures, and therefore reflect the absolute pressure differentials. Secondly, temperature stability must be maintained during the calibration. The laminar flowmeter is sensitive to inlet temperature oscillations which cause the data points to be scattered. Gradual changes ([1 C ([1.8 F)) in temperature are acceptable as long as they occur over a period of several minutes. Finally, all connections between the flowmeter and the CVS pump must be absolutely void of any leakage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> During an exhaust emission test the measurement of these same pump parameters enables the user to calculate the flow rate from the calibration equation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Connect a system as shown in Figure F78-5. Although particular types of equipment are shown, other configurations that yield equivalent results may be used if approved in advance by the Administrator.

A parallel sample of the dilution air is similarly analyzed for hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and, optionally, for oxides of nitrogen.
