                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Before statutory review. At any time prior to the expiration of  the time allowed for filing a petition for review or prior to the filing  of the transcript of the record of a proceeding in a U.S. court of  appeals pursuant to a petition for review, the Commission may upon its  own initiative and without prior notice to the parties reopen the  proceeding and enter a new decision modifying or setting aside the whole  or any   part of the findings as to the facts, conclusions, rule, order, or  opinion issued by the Commission in such proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> After decision has become final. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whenever the Commission is  of the opinion that changed conditions of fact or law or the public  interest may require that a Commission decision containing a rule or  order which has become effective, or an order to cease and desist which  has become final by reason of court affirmance or expiration of the  statutory period for court review without a petition for review having  been filed, or a Commission decision containing an order dismissing a  proceeding, should be altered, modified, or set aside in whole or in  part, the Commission will, except as provided in Sec. 2.51, serve upon  each person subject to such decision (in the case of proceedings  instituted under Sec. 3.13, such service may be by publication in the  Federal Register) an order to show cause, stating the changes it  proposes to make in the decision and the reasons they are deemed  necessary. Within thirty (30) days after service of such order to show  cause, any person served may file an answer thereto. Any person not  responding to the order within the time allowed may be deemed to have  consented to the proposed changes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whenever an order to show cause is not opposed, or if opposed  but the pleadings do not raise issues of fact to be resolved, the  Commission, in its discretion, may decide the matter on the order to  show cause and answer thereto, if any, or it may serve upon the parties  (in the case of proceedings instituted under Sec. 3.13, such service  may be by publication in Federal Register) a notice of hearing, setting  forth the date when the cause will be heard. In such a case, the hearing  will be limited to the filing of briefs and may include oral argument  when deemed necessary by the Commission. When the pleadings raise  substantial factual issues, the Commission will direct such hearings as  it deems appropriate, including hearings for the receipt of evidence by  it or by an Administrative Law Judge. Unless otherwise ordered and  insofar as practicable, hearings before an Administrative Law Judge to  receive evidence shall be conducted in accordance with subparts B, C, D,  and E of part 3 of this chapter. Upon conclusion of hearings before an  Administrative Law Judge, the record and the Administrative Law Judge's  recommendations shall be certified to the Commission for final  disposition of the matter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Termination of existing orders--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Generally. Notwithstanding  the foregoing provisions of this rule, and except as provided in  paragraphs (b)(3) (ii) and (iii) of this section, an order issued by the  Commission before August 16, 1995, will be deemed, without further  notice or proceedings, to terminate 20 years from the date on which the  order was first issued, or on January 2, 1996, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exception. This paragraph applies to the termination of an  order issued before August 16, 1995, where a complaint alleging a  violation of the order was or is filed (with or without an accompanying  consent decree) in federal court by the United States or the Federal  Trade Commission while the order remains in force, either on or after  August 16, 1995, or within the 20 years preceding that date. If more  than one complaint was or is filed while the order remains in force, the  relevant complaint for purposes of this paragraph will be the latest  filed complaint. An order subject to this paragraph will terminate 20  years from the date on which a court complaint described in this  paragraph was or is filed, except as provided in the following sentence.  If the complaint was or is dismissed, or a federal court rules or has  ruled that the respondent did not violate any provision of the order,  and the dismissal or ruling was or is not appealed, or was or is upheld  on appeal, the order will terminate according to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of  this section as though the complaint was never filed; provided, however,  that the order will not terminate between the date that such complaint  is filed and the later of the deadline for appealing such dismissal or  ruling and the date such dismissal or ruling is upheld on appeal. The  filing of a complaint described in this paragraph will not affect the  duration of any order provision that has expired, or will expire, by its  own terms. The filing of a complaint described in this paragraph also  will not affect the duration of an order's application to   any respondent that is not named in the complaint.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Stay of Termination. Any party to an order may seek to stay,  in whole or part, the termination of the order as to that party pursuant  to paragraph (b)(3) (i) or (ii) of this section. Petitions for such  stays shall be filed in accordance with the procedures set forth in  Sec. 2.51 of these rules. Such petitions shall be filed on or before  the date on which the order would be terminated pursuant to paragraph  (b)(3) (i) or (ii) of this section. Pending the disposition of such a  petition, the order will be deemed to remain in effect without  interruption.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Orders not terminated. Nothing in Sec. 3.72(b)(3) is intended  to apply to in camera orders or other procedural or interlocutory  rulings by an Administrative Law Judge or the Commission.
