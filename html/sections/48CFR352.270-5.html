Before award may be made to an applicant organization, the organization shall file, with the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW), National Institutes of Health (NIH), a written Animal Welfare Assurance (Assurance) which commits the organization to comply with the provisions of the PHS Policy, the Animal Welfare Act, and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Academy Press, Washington, DC). In accordance with the PHS Policy, applicant organizations must establish an Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee (IACUC), qualified through the experience and expertise of its members, to oversee the institution's animal program, facilities and procedures. Applicant organizations are required to provide verification of IACUC approval prior to release of an award involving live vertebrate animals. No award involving the use of animals shall be made unless OLAW approves the Assurance and verification of IACUC approval for the proposed animal activities has been provided to the Contracting Officer. Prior to award, the Contracting Officer will notify Contractor(s) selected for projects that involve live vertebrate animals that an Assurance and verification of IACUC approval are required. The Contracting Officer will request that OLAW negotiate an acceptable Assurance with those Contractor(s) and request verification of IACUC approval.
