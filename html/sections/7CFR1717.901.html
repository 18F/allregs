                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Conditions. If requested by a borrower in writing, RUS will review the application for a lien accommodation for required supplemental financing early in the process, before funding is available for the concurrent RUS insured loan, and approve the lien accommodation if the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The required supplemental loan meets the requirements for an insured loan, as set forth in 7 CFR part 1710, subparts A through G, and other RUS regulations pertaining to required supplemental loans;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The borrower has demonstrated the ability to obtain the funds that would be needed to complete other portions of the project, if the portion to be constructed with private loan funds could not be used productively without completion of such other portions, in the event concurrent RUS insured loan funds are not forthcoming. Such evidence may include financial records demonstrating the availability of general funds, and/or a written commitment from the private lender to provide a loan for the remaining amount of financing required, with such commitment being conditioned upon the availability of a lien accommodation from RUS; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An authorized official of the borrower has requested early approval of the lien accommodation and explained the reasons therefor, and has certified that the funds are needed and will be drawn down before funds from the concurrent insured loan are expected to be available, assuming that the insured loan is approved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Timeframe for RUS action. (1) RUS will either approve or disapprove the lien accommodation within 90 days of receiving the borrower's request for early approval and the complete application for the concurrent RUS loan and required supplemental financing, in form and substance satisfactory to RUS, or notify the borrower in writing of the estimated date when a decision is expected. If an environmental assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement is required, additional time beyond the 90 days may be required to prepare these documents. RUS's approval of the lien accommodation will be conditioned upon execution and delivery by the borrower of a satisfactory security instrument, if required, and such additional information, documents, and opinions of counsel as RUS may require.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> RUS will either approve or disapprove the lien accommodation within 90 days of receiving the borrower's request for early approval and the complete application for the concurrent RUS loan and required supplemental financing, in form and substance satisfactory to RUS, or notify the borrower in writing of the estimated date when a decision is expected.

Within 30

days of obtaining the documents satisfactory to RUS, including required execution counterparts, RUS will execute the documents and send them to the borrower, along with instructions pertaining to recording of the mortgage, an opinion of borrower's counsel, and other matters. RUS will promptly notify the borrower upon receiving satisfactory evidence that the borrower has complied with said instructions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Approval of concurrent insured loan. Early approval of a lien accommodation for a required supplemental loan does not ensure that the concurrent RUS insured loan will be approved. The request for the concurrent insured loan will be reviewed when funds are available to make the loan. The borrower may be requested to update certain supporting information in the loan application if substantial time has elapsed since the lien accommodation or subordination was approved.</p>
