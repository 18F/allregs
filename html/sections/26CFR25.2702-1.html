If the retained  interest is not a qualified interest (as defined in Sec. 25.2702-3),  the retained interest is generally valued at zero, and the amount of the  gift is the entire value of the property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exceptions to section 2702. Section 2702 does not apply to the  following transfers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Incomplete gift. A transfer no portion of which would be treated  as a completed gift without regard to any consideration received by the  transferor. If a transfer is wholly incomplete as to an undivided  fractional share of the property transferred (without regard to any  consideration received by the transferor), for purposes of this  paragraph the transfer is treated as incomplete as to that share.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Personal residence trust. A transfer in trust that meets the  requirements of Sec. 25.2702-5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Charitable remainder trust. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For transfers made on or after  May 19, 1997, a transfer to a pooled income fund described in section  642(c)(5); a transfer to a charitable remainder annuity trust described  in section 664(d)(1); a transfer to a charitable remainder unitrust  described in section 664(d)(2) if under the terms of the governing  instrument the unitrust amount can be computed only under section  664(d)(2)(A); and a transfer to a charitable remainder unitrust if under  the terms of the governing instrument the unitrust amount can be  computed under section 664(d)(2) and (3) and either there are only two  consecutive noncharitable beneficial interests and the transferor holds  the second of the two interests, or the only permissible recipients of  the unitrust amount are the transferor, the transferor's U.S. citizen  spouse, or both the transferor and the transferor's U.S. citizen spouse.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For transfers made before May 19, 1997, a transfer in trust if  the remainder interest in the trust qualifies for a deduction under  section 2522.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Pooled income fund. A transfer of property to a pooled income  fund (as defined in section 642(c)(5)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Charitable lead trust.

The assignment of a  remainder interest if the only retained interest of the transferor or an  applicable family member is as the permissible recipient of  distributions of income in the sole discretion of an independent trustee  (as defined in section 674(c)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Certain property settlements. A transfer in trust if the  transfer of an interest to a spouse is deemed to be for full and  adequate consideration by reason of section 2516 (relating to certain  property settlements) and the remaining interests in the trust are  retained by the other spouse.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Transfer or assignment to a Qualified Domestic Trust.
