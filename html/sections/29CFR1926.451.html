                            <p class="depth0">This section does not apply to aerial lifts, the criteria for which are set out exclusively in Sec. 1926.453.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Capacity. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5) and (g) of this section, each scaffold and scaffold component shall be capable of supporting, without failure, its own weight and at least 4 times the maximum intended load applied or transmitted to it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Direct connections to roofs and floors, and counterweights used to balance adjustable suspension scaffolds, shall be capable of resisting at least 4 times the tipping moment imposed by the scaffold operating at the rated load of the hoist, or 1.5 (minimum) times the tipping moment imposed by the scaffold operating at the stall load of the hoist, whichever is greater.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Each suspension rope, including connecting hardware, used on non-adjustable suspension scaffolds shall be capable of supporting, without failure, at least 6 times the maximum intended load applied or transmitted to that rope.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Each suspension rope, including connecting hardware, used on adjustable suspension scaffolds shall be capable of supporting, without failure, at least 6 times the maximum intended load applied or transmitted to that rope with the scaffold operating at either the rated load of the hoist, or 2 (minimum) times the stall load of the hoist, whichever is greater.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The stall load of any scaffold hoist shall not exceed 3 times its rated load.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Scaffolds shall be designed by a qualified person and shall be constructed and loaded in accordance with that design.
