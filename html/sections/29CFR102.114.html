                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> or (c) provide otherwise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When service is made by registered mail, or by certified mail,  the return post office receipt shall be proof of service. When service  is made by a private delivery service, the receipt from that service  showing delivery shall be proof of service. However, these methods of  proof of service are not exclusive; any sufficient proof may be relied  upon to establish service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Failure to comply with the requirements of this section relating  to timeliness of service on other parties shall be a basis for either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A rejection of the document; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Withholding or reconsidering any ruling on the subject matter  raised by the document until after service has been made and the served  party has had reasonable opportunity to respond.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Papers filed with the Board, General Counsel, Regional Director,  Administrative Law Judge, or Hearing Officer shall be typewritten or  otherwise legibly duplicated on 8\1/2\- by 11-inch plain white paper,  shall have margins no less than one inch on each side, shall be in a  typeface no smaller than 12 characters-per-inch (elite or the  equivalent), and shall be double spaced (except that quotations and  footnotes may be single spaced). Nonconforming papers may, at the  Agency's discretion, be rejected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The person or party serving the papers or process on other  parties in conformance with Sec. 102.113 and paragraph (a) of this  section shall submit a written statement of service thereof to the Board  stating the names of the parties served and the date and manner of  service. Proof of service as defined in paragraph (a) of this section  shall be required by the Board only if subsequent to the receipt of the  statement of service a question is raised with respect to proper  service. Failure to make proof of service does not affect the validity  of the service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Unfair labor practice charges, petitions in representation  proceedings, objections to elections, and requests for extensions of  time for filing documents will be accepted by the Agency if transmitted  to the facsimile machine of the appropriate office. Other documents,  except those specifically prohibited in paragraph (g) of this section,  will be accepted by the Agency if transmitted to the facsimile machine  of the office designated to receive them only with advance permission  from the receiving office which may be obtained by telephone. Advance  permission must be obtained for each such filing. At the discretion of  the receiving office, the person submitting a document by facsimile may  be required simultaneously to serve the original and any required copies  on the office by overnight delivery service. When filing a charge, a  petition in a representation proceeding, or election objections by  facsimile transmission pursuant to this section, receipt of the  transmitted document by the Agency constitutes filing with the Agency. A  failure to timely file or serve a document will not be excused   on the basis of a claim that transmission could not be accomplished  because the receiving machine was off-line or busy or unavailable for  any other reason.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Facsimile transmissions of the following documents will not be  accepted for filing: Answers to Complaints; Exceptions or Cross- Exceptions; Briefs; Requests for Review of Regional Director Decisions;  Administrative Appeals from Dismissal of Petitions or Unfair Labor  Practice Charges; Objections to Settlements; EAJA Applications; Motions  for Default Judgment; Motions for Summary Judgment; Motions to Dismiss;  Motions for Reconsideration; Motions to Clarify; Motions to Reopen the  Record; Motions to Intervene; Motions to Transfer, Consolidate or Sever;  or Petitions for Advisory Opinions. Facsimile transmissions in  contravention of this rule will not be filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Documents and other papers filed through facsimile transmission  shall be served on all parties in the same way as used to serve the  office where filed, or in a more expeditious manner, in conformance with  paragraph (a) of this section. Thus, facsimile transmission shall be  used for this purpose whenever possible. When a party cannot be served  by this method, or chooses not to accept service by facsimile as  provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, the party shall be  notified personally or by telephone of the substance of the transmitted  document and a copy of the document shall be served by personal service  or overnight delivery service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Agency's Web site (http://www.nlrb.gov) contains certain  forms that parties or other persons are permitted to file with the  Agency electronically. Parties or other persons choosing to utilize  those forms to file documents electronically are permitted to do so by  following the instructions described on the Web site, notwithstanding  any contrary provisions elsewhere in these rules. In the event the  document being filed electronically is required to be served on another  party to a proceeding, the other party shall be served by electronic  mail (e-mail), if possible. If the other party does not have the ability  to receive electronic service, the other party shall be notified by  telephone of the substance of the transmitted document and a copy of the  document shall be served by personal service no later than the next day,  by overnight delivery service, or, with the permission of the party  receiving the document, by facsimile transmission.
