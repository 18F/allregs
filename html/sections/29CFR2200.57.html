                                Sec. 2200.57  Issuance of subpoenas; petitions to revoke or modify
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Issuance of subpoenas. On behalf of the Commission or any member thereof, the Judge shall, on the application of any party, issue to the applying party subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and

the production of any evidence, including relevant books, records, correspondence, or documents, in his possession or under his control. The party to whom the subpoena is issued shall be responsible for its service. Applications for subpoenas, if filed prior to the assignment of the case to a Judge, shall be filed with the Executive Secretary at One Lafayette Centre, 1120-20th Street NW., 9th Floor, Washington, DC 20036-3457. After the case has been assigned to a Judge, applications shall be filed with the Judge. Applications for subpoena(s) may be made ex parte. The subpoena shall show on its face the name and address of the party at whose request the subpoena was issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Service of subpoenas. A subpoena may be served by any person who is not a party and is not less than 18 years of age. Service of a subpoena upon a person named therein may be made by service on the person named, by certified mail return receipt requested, or by leaving a copy at the person's principal place of business or at the person's residence with some person of suitable age and discretion residing therein.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Revocation or modification of subpoenas. Any person served with a subpoena, whether ad testificandum or duces tecum, shall, within 5 days after the date of service of the subpoena upon him, move in writing to revoke or modify the subpoena if he does not intend to comply. All motions to revoke or modify shall be served on the party at whose request the subpoena was issued. The Judge or the Commission shall revoke or modify the subpoena if in its opinion the evidence whose production is required does not relate to any matter under investigation or in question in the proceedings or the subpoena does not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence whose production is required, or if for any other reason sufficient in law the subpoena is otherwise invalid. The Judge or the Commission, as the case may be, shall make a simple statement of procedural or other grounds for the ruling on the motion to revoke or modify. The motion to revoke or modify, any answer filed thereto, and any ruling thereon shall become a part of the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Rights of persons compelled to submit data. Persons compelled to submit data or evidence at a public proceeding are entitled to retain or, on payment of lawfully prescribed costs, to procure copies of transcripts of the data or evidence submitted by them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Failure to comply with subpoena. Upon the failure of any person to comply with a subpoena issued upon the request of a party, the Commission by its counsel shall initiate proceedings in the appropriate district court for the enforcement thereof, if in its judgment the enforcement of such subpoena would be consistent with law and with policies of the Act. Neither the Commission nor its counsel shall be deemed thereby to have assumed responsibility for the effective prosecution of the same before the court.
