Accordingly, it is the policy of the Commission:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To encourage each branch of the industry without such a  procedure to establish its own procedures to facilitate the settlement  of disputes over the terms and application of collective bargaining  agreements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To encourage each branch of the industry having such a  procedure, but which procedure is limited in application, to expand the  application of such procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To encourage parties in each branch of construction with a  procedure to utilize that machinery in all possible cases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> To encourage the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to  refer disputes wherever possible to such machinery established in  various branches of the industry.</p>
