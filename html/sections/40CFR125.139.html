                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Permit application. As the Director, you must review materials  submitted by the applicant under 40 CFR 122.21(r), Sec. 125.135, and  Sec. 125.136 at the time of the initial permit application and before  each permit renewal or reissuance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After receiving the initial permit application from the owner or  operator of a new offshore oil and gas extraction facility, the Director  must determine applicable standards in Sec. 125.134 or Sec. 125.135 to  apply to the new offshore oil and gas extraction facility. In addition,  the Director must review materials to determine compliance with the  applicable standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each subsequent permit renewal, the Director must review the  application materials and monitoring data to determine whether  requirements, or additional requirements, for design and construction  technologies or operational measures should be included in the permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For Track II facilities, the Director may review the information  collection proposal plan required by Sec. 125.136(c)(2)(ii). The  facility may initiate sampling and data collection activities prior to  receiving comment from the Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> requirements are  implemented for a facility through an NPDES permit. As the Director, you  must determine, based on the information submitted by the new offshore  oil and gas extraction facility in its permit application, the  appropriate requirements and conditions to include in the permit based  on the track (Track I or Track II), or alternative requirements in  accordance with Sec. 125.135, the new offshore oil and gas extraction  facility has chosen to comply with. The following requirements must be  included in each permit:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> and (2); or Sec. 125.135.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For a facility that chooses Track I, you must review the Design  and Construction Technology Plan required in Sec. 125.136(b)(3) to  evaluate the suitability and feasibility of the technology proposed to  minimize impingement mortality and (if applicable) entrainment of all  life stages of fish and shellfish. In the first permit issued, you must  include a condition requiring the facility to reduce impingement  mortality and/or entrainment commensurate with the implementation of the  technologies in the permit. Under subsequent permits, the Director must  review the performance of the technologies implemented and require  additional or different design and construction technologies, if needed  to minimize impingement mortality and/or entrainment of all life stages  of fish and shellfish. In addition, you must consider whether more  stringent conditions are reasonably necessary in accordance with Sec.  125.134(d).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For a fixed facility that chooses Track II, you must review the  information submitted with the Comprehensive Demonstration Study  information required in Sec. 125.136(c)(2), evaluate the suitability of  the proposed design and construction technology and/or operational  measures to determine whether they will reduce both impingement  mortality and/or entrainment of all life stages of fish and shellfish to  90 percent or greater of the reduction that could be achieved through  Track I. In addition, you must review the Verification Monitoring Plan  in Sec. 125.136(c)(2)(iii)(C) and require that the proposed monitoring  begin at the start of operations of the cooling water intake structure  and continue for a sufficient period of time to demonstrate that the  technologies and operational measures meet the requirements in Sec.  125.134(c)(1). Under subsequent permits, the Director must review the  performance of the additional and /or different technologies or measures  used and determine that they reduce the level of adverse environmental  impact from the cooling water intake structures to a comparable level  that the facility would achieve were it to implement the requirements of  Sec. 125.134(b)(2) and, if applicable, Sec. 125.134(b)(5).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If a facility requests alternative requirements in accordance  with Sec. 125.135, you must determine if data specific to the facility  meet the requirements in Sec. 125.135(a) and include in the permit  requirements that are no less stringent than justified by the wholly out  of proportion cost or the significant adverse impacts on local water  resources other than impingement or entrainment, or significant adverse  impacts on energy markets.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(iii)(C)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Record keeping and reporting. At a minimum, the permit must  require the permittee to report and keep records as required by Sec.  125.138.</p>
