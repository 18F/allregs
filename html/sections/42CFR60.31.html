These procedures must be  reviewed during the biennial audit required by Sec.  60.42(d). If the  applicant uses procedures more stringent than those required by  Sec. Sec.  60.34 and 60.35 for its other   loans of comparable dollar value, on which it has no Federal, State, or  other third party guarantee, it must include those more stringent  procedures in its written procedures for servicing and collecting its  HEAL loans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The applicant must submit sufficient materials with his or her  application to enable the Secretary to fairly evaluate the application  in accordance with these criteria.
