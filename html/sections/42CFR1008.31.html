                                Sec. 1008.31  OIG fees for the cost of advisory opinions.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Responsibility for fees. The requestor is responsible for paying  a fee   equal to the costs incurred by the Department in responding to the  request for an advisory opinion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Payment Method. Payment for a request for an advisory opinion  must be made to the Treasury of the United States, as directed by OIG.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Calculation of costs: Prior to the issuance of the advisory  opinion, the OIG will calculate the costs incurred by the Department in  responding to the request. The calculation will include the costs of  salaries and benefits payable to attorneys and others who have worked on  the request in question, as well as administrative and supervisory  support for such person. The OIG has the exclusive authority to  determine the cost of responding to a request for an advisory opinion  and such determination is not reviewable or waiveable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Agreement to pay all costs. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> By submitting the request for an  advisory opinion, the requestor agrees, except as indicated in paragraph  (d)(4) of this section, to pay all costs incurred by the OIG in  responding to the request for an advisory opinion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In its request for an advisory opinion, the requestor may  request a written estimate of the cost involved in processing the  advisory opinion. Within 10 business days of receipt of the request, the  OIG will notify in writing of such estimate. Such estimate will not be  binding on the Department, and the actual cost to be paid may be higher  or lower than estimated. The time period for issuing the advisory  opinion will be tolled from the time the OIG notifies the requestor of  the estimate until the OIG receives written confirmation from the  requestor that the requestor wants the OIG to continue processing the  request. Such notice may include a new or revised triggering dollar  amount, as set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In its request for an advisory opinion, the requestor may  designate a triggering dollar amount. If the OIG estimates that the  costs of processing the advisory opinion request have reached, or are  likely to exceed, the designated triggering dollar amount, the OIG will  notify the requestor. The requestor may revise its designated triggering  dollar amount in writing in its response to notification of a cost  estimate in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the OIG notifies the requestor that the estimated cost of  processing the request has reached or is likely to exceed the triggering  dollar amount, the OIG will stop processing the request until such time  as the requestor makes a written request for the OIG to continue  processing the request. Any delay in the processing of the request for  an advisory opinion attributable to these procedures will toll the time  for issuance of an advisory opinion until the requestor asks the OIG to  continue working on the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the requestor chooses not to pay for completion of an  advisory opinion, or withdraws the request, the requestor is still  obligated to pay for all costs incurred and identified by the OIG  attributable to processing the request for an advisory opinion up to  that point.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the costs incurred by the OIG in responding to the request  are greater than the amount paid by the requestor, the OIG will, prior  to the issuance of the advisory opinion, notify the requestor of any  additional amount due. The OIG will not issue an advisory opinion until  the full amount owed by the requestor has been paid. Once the requestor  has paid the OIG the total amount due for the costs of processing the  request, the OIG will issue the advisory opinion. The time period for  issuing advisory opinions will be tolled from the time the OIG notifies  the requestor of the amount owed until the time full payment is  received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Fees for outside experts. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In addition to the fees identified  in this section, the requestor also must pay any required fees for  expert opinions, if any, from outside sources, as described in Sec.  1008.33.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the OIG determines that it is necessary to obtain expert  advice to issue a requested advisory opinion, the OIG will notify the  requestor of that fact and provide the identity of the appropriate  expert and an estimate of the costs of the expert advice.
