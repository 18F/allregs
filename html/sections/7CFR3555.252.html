                            <p class="depth0">Lender servicing responsibility includes, but is not limited to, the following actions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Collecting regularly scheduled payments. Lender must collect regularly scheduled loan payments and apply them to the borrower's account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Payment of taxes and insurance. Lenders must ensure that real estate taxes, assessments, and flood and hazard insurance premiums for all property that secures a guaranteed loan are paid on schedule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Establish escrow account. Lenders with the capacity to escrow funds must establish escrow accounts for all guaranteed loans for the payment of taxes and insurance. Escrow accounts must be administered in accordance with the Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act (RESPA) of 1974, and insured by the FDIC or the NCUA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Plan and responsibility of lender to ensure payment. Lenders that do not have the capacity to escrow funds must implement procedures, subject to Agency approval, to ensure the borrower pays such obligations on a timely basis. In addition, such lenders must accept the responsibility for payment of taxes and insurance that comes due prior to liquidation. Rural Development will not include any taxes or insurance amounts that accrued prior to acceleration in any potential loss claim. Rural Development may revoke the acceptance of the lender's plan if loan performance indicates that delinquency and loss rates are being affected by the lender's inability to escrow for taxes, assessment, and insurance. This alternative is not available to lenders who contract for servicing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Insurance. (1) Until the loan is paid in full, lenders must ensure that borrowers maintain hazard and flood insurance as required, on property securing guaranteed loans. The insurance must be issued by companies in amounts, and on terms and conditions, acceptable to Rural Development. Flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program must be maintained for all property located in special flood or mudslide areas identified by FEMA and must be consistent with mortgage industry standards, as determined by the Agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Lenders must ensure that borrowers immediately notify them of any loss or damage to insured property securing guaranteed loans and collect the amount of the loss from the insurance company. Unless the borrower pays off the guaranteed loan using the insurance proceeds, the following requirements must be met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All repairs and replacements using the insurance proceeds must be planned, performed, and inspected in accordance with Agency construction requirements and procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When insurance funds remain after payments for all repairs, replacements, and other authorized disbursements have been made, the funds must be applied in the following order: prior liens (including past-due property taxes); past-due amounts; protective advances; and released to the borrower if the lender's debt is adequately secured.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the insurance claim is de minimis as determined by the Agency, the lender may release the funds directly to the borrower to advance funds to contractors, provided that the account is current and the borrower has a history of timely payments; the borrower occupies the property; and the borrower executes an affidavit agreeing to apply the funds for repairs or reconstruction of the dwelling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Credit reporting. The lender must notify a credit repository of each new guaranteed loan, must identify the loan as guaranteed by Rural Development, and must report to that repository whenever any account becomes more than 30 calendar days past due.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Bankruptcy actions. The lender is responsible for monitoring and taking all appropriate and prudent actions during bankruptcy proceedings to protect the borrower and Government's interest, in accordance with Sec. 3555.306(d).</p>
