                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Category One. The DE, as designee of the Chief of Engineers,  will satisfy himself that the clearance work, as certified in the  Statement of Clearance, has been performed and that such clearance  complies with the requirements of this section. If the DE determines  that the completed clearance work is not sufficient, he will request the  using command to perform the necessary additional clearance. The  Department of Defense Explosives Safety Board (DDESB), has  responsibility for reviewing and approving, from an explosive safety  veiwpoint, clearance reports for real property declared excess and  offered for disposal. DDESB should be consulted for review and analysis  of accomplished clearance work for Category One property when  determinations of adequacy are not within the capacities of the DE.  Requests, fully documented, for review and/or analysis by the Board may  be forwarded to DAEN-REM for submission to the Board. Department of  Defense procedures include staff study of all proposed excess reports by  the Board before grant of ``Prior Approval'' for those disposals  requiring reports to the Armed Services Committees (10 U.S.C. 2662).  When the clearance work has been satisfactorily performed, disposal  action will be continued as set forth in this subpart F. If the DE  determines that further clearance work is necessary to render the land  safe for use but that such further clearance work is not economically  justified, he will make a report to DAEN-REM with his recommendations  and pertinent supporting data. The report will include a statement of  the current status of the excess action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Category Two. The U.S. Army Toxic and Hazardous Materials Agency  (USATHAMA) is responsible for the identification and containment and  elimination of all toxic and hazardous materials, and related  contamination on all and/or buildings where an excessing action is  planned. USATHAMA will conduct the survey and assessments of all  proposed excess property to establish the type and quantities of  contaminants and then plan, direct and control the program to  decontaminate and clean up the property. Following the completion of the  decontamination clean up program, USATHAMA will prepare a clearance  statement stating the property has been cleared of all toxic and  hazardous materials reasonably possible to detect using present state- of-the-art methodology, and it will provide any exceptions or  restriction for utilization of the property. Clearance statements which  identify contaminations of ammunition and explosives will be submitted  to the DDESB for review. Category Two items may include chemical  munitions or agents, liquid propellants and pyrotechnics. The clearance  statement will be forwarded through the Major Army Command (MACOM) to  DAEN-REM.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Decontamination of Category Two real property will comply with  the requirements of TB 700-4 (Decontamination of Facilities and  Equipment). The Bulletin provides general policies, responsibilities and  procedures applicable whenever potentially contaminated facilities are  disposed of to other Government agencies, qualified users in industry,  or to the general public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The degrees of decontamination are designated in TB 700-4.  Contaminated real and personal property excessed for disposal shall be  decontaminated to XXXXX before it can be removed from the Government  premises, or transferred to nonqualified Government or industry users.</p>
