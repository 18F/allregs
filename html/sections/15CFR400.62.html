                                Sec. 400.62  Fines, penalties and instructions to suspend activated
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Fines are authorized solely for specific violations  of the FTZ Act or the Board's regulations as detailed in Sec. Sec.  400.62(b) and (c). Each specific violation is subject to a fine of not  more than 1,000 dollars (as adjusted for inflation pursuant to Sec.  400.62(j)), with each day during which a violation   continues constituting a separate offense subject to imposition of such  a fine (FTZ Act, section 19; 19 U.S.C. 81s). This section also  establishes the party subject to the fine which, depending on the type  of violation, would be the zone operator, grantee, or a person  undertaking one or more zone-related functions on behalf of the grantee,  where applicable. In certain circumstances, the Board or the Assistant  Secretary for Enforcement and Compliance could instruct CBP to suspend  the activated status of all or part of a zone or subzone. Violations of  the FTZ Act or the Board's regulations (including the sections  pertaining to uniform treatment and submission of annual reports),  failure to pay fines, or failure to comply with an order prohibiting or  restricting activity may also result in the Executive Secretary's  suspending the processing of any requests to the Board and staff  relating to the zone or subzone in question. In circumstances where non- compliance pertains to only a subset of the operations in a zone,  suspensions of activated status and suspensions of the processing of  requests shall be targeted to the specific non-compliant operation(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b))</em> and Sec.  400.51(c)(1) of these regulations constitutes a violation subject to a  fine, with each day of continued failure to submit the report  constituting a separate offense subject to a fine of not more than 1,000  dollars (as adjusted for inflation pursuant to Sec. 400.62(j)).  Further, each day during which a zone operator fails to submit to the  zone's grantee the information required for the grantee's timely  submission of a complete and accurate annual report to the Board shall  constitute a separate offense subject to a fine of not more than 1,000  dollars (as adjusted for inflation pursuant to Sec. 400.62(j)).  Consistent with Sec. 400.46, if the grantee submits a timely report to  the Board identifying any operator that has not provided complete and  timely information in response to a timely request(s) by the grantee,  the grantee shall not be subject to a fine-assessment action stemming  from the operator's failure to timely provide its report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Violations involving uniform treatment. Failure by a grantee or  a person undertaking one or more zone-related functions on behalf of the  grantee to comply with the uniform treatment requirement of section 14  of the FTZ Act (19 U.S.C. 81n) or the provisions of Sec. 400.43 of  these regulations constitutes a violation, with each day of continued  violation constituting a separate offense subject to a fine of not more  than 1,000 dollars (as adjusted for inflation pursuant to Sec.  400.62(j)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedures for determination of violations and imposition of  fines. When the Board or the Executive Secretary has reason to believe  that a violation pursuant to Sec. Sec. 400.62(b) and (c) has occurred  and that the violation warrants the imposition of a fine (such as a  situation where a party has previously been notified of action required  for compliance and has failed to take such action within a reasonable  period of time), the following steps shall be taken:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Executive Secretary shall notify the party or parties  responsible for the violation and the zone grantee in writing stating  the nature of the alleged violation, and provide the party(ies) a  specified period (no less than 30 days, with consideration given to any  requests for an extension, which shall not be unreasonably withheld) to  respond in writing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Executive Secretary shall conduct a hearing, if requested or  otherwise if appropriate. Parties may be represented by counsel at the  hearing, and any evidence and testimony of witnesses in the proceeding  shall be presented. A transcript of the hearing shall be produced and a  copy shall be made available to the parties;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Executive Secretary shall make a recommendation on the  record of the proceeding not earlier than the later of 15 days after the  deadline for the party(ies)'s response under paragraph (d)(1) of this  section or 15 days after the date of a hearing held under paragraph  (d)(2) of this section. If the recommendation is for an affirmative  determination of a violation, the Executive Secretary shall also  recommend the amount of the fine to be imposed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Board shall make a determination regarding the finding of a  violation and imposition of a fine based on the Executive Secretary's  recommendation under paragraph (d)(3) of this section. For related  actions where the total sum of recommended fines is no more than 10,000  dollars (50,000 dollars in the case of violations pursuant to paragraph  (b) of this section), the Board delegates to the Executive Secretary the  authority to make a determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Mitigation--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The Commerce Department's Assistant  Secretary for Enforcement and Compliance may approve the mitigation  (reduction or elimination) of an imposed fine based on specific evidence  presented by the affected party. Authority is delegated to the Executive  Secretary to mitigate a fine where the total sum of fines imposed on a  party for related actions does not exceed 10,000 dollars (50,000 dollars  in the case of violations pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section).  Mitigating evidence and argument pertaining to mitigating factors must  be submitted within 30 days of the determination described in paragraph  (d)(4) of this section, subject to requests for extension for cause, the  granting of which shall not be unreasonably withheld.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Mitigating factors. Factors to be taken into account in  evaluating potential mitigation include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A good record of a violator over the preceding five years with  regard to the type of violation(s) at issue;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The violation was due to the action of another party despite  violator's adherence to the requirements of the FTZ Act and the Board's  regulations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Immediate remedial action by the violator to avoid future  violations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A violator's cooperation with the Board (beyond the degree of  cooperation expected from a person under investigation for a violation)  in ascertaining the facts establishing the violation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A violation's resulting from a clerical error or similar  unintentional negligence; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Such other factors as the Board, or the Executive Secretary,  deems appropriate to consider in the specific circumstances presented.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Assessment of fines. After evaluating submitted mitigating  evidence and argument, where applicable, the Commerce Department's  Assistant Secretary for Enforcement and Compliance may assess an imposed  fine (in whole or in part). Authority is delegated to the Executive  Secretary to assess a fine where the total sum of the imposed fines for  related actions does not exceed 10,000 dollars (50,000 dollars in the  case of violations pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Time for payment. Full payment of an assessed fine must be made  within 30 days of the date of the assessment or within such longer  period of time as may be specified. Payment shall be made in the manner  specified by the Commerce Department's Assistant Secretary for  Enforcement and Compliance or the Executive Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Procedures for instruction to suspend activated status. If a  fine assessed pursuant to Sec. Sec. 400.62(d) through (g) has not been  paid within 90 days of the specified deadline for payment, if there is a  repeated and willful failure to comply with a requirement of the FTZ Act  or the Board's regulations, or if there is a repeated and willful  failure to comply with a prohibition or restriction on activity imposed  by an order of the Board or an order of the Commerce Department's  Assistant Secretary for Enforcement and Compliance pursuant to Sec.  400.49(c), the Board or the Commerce Department's Assistant Secretary  for Enforcement and Compliance may instruct CBP to suspend the activated  status of the zone operation(s) in question (or, if appropriate, the  suspension may be limited to a particular activity of a zone operator,  such as suspension of the privilege to admit merchandise), and the  suspension shall remain in place until the failure to pay a fine,  failure to comply with a requirement of the FTZ Act or the Board's  regulations, or failure to comply with an order's prohibition or  restriction on activity has been remedied. In determining whether to  instruct CBP to suspend the activated status of a zone operation in the  circumstances noted, the following steps shall be taken:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notification of party(ies). The Executive Secretary shall notify  the responsible party(ies) in writing stating the   nature of the failure to timely pay a fine, to comply with a requirement  of the FTZ Act or the Board's regulations or to comply with a  prohibition or restriction on activity imposed by an order of the Board  or an order of the Commerce Department's Assistant Secretary for  Enforcement and Compliance. If the grantee is not one of the responsible  parties notified, the Executive Secretary shall also provide a copy of  the notification to the grantee. The responsible party(ies) shall be  provided a specified period (of not less than 15 days) to respond in  writing to the notification;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Hearing. If the notified responsible party(ies) or the zone's  grantee requests a hearing (or if a hearing is determined to be  warranted by the Board, the Commerce Department's Assistant Secretary  for Enforcement and Compliance or the Executive Secretary), it shall be  held before the Executive Secretary (or a member of the Board staff  designated by the Executive Secretary) within 30 days following the  request for a hearing (or the determination by the Board, the Commerce  Department's Assistant Secretary for Enforcement and Compliance or the  Executive Secretary). Parties may be represented by counsel at the  hearing, and any evidence and testimony of witnesses in the proceeding  shall be presented. A transcript of the hearing shall be produced and a  copy shall be made available to the parties;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Executive Secretary shall make a recommendation on the  record of the proceeding not earlier than 15 days after the later of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The deadline for the party(ies)'s response under paragraph  (h)(1) of this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date of a hearing held under paragraph (h)(2) of this  section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Board or the Commerce Department's Assistant Secretary for  Enforcement and Compliance shall determine whether to instruct CBP to  suspend the activated status of the zone operation(s) in question. If  the determination is affirmative, the Executive Secretary shall convey  the instruction to CBP, with due consideration to allow for the transfer  of any affected merchandise from the applicable zone site(s).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Enforcement of assessment. Upon any failure to pay an assessed  fine, the Board may request the U.S. Department of Justice to recover  the amount assessed in any appropriate district court of the United  States or may commence any other lawful action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Adjustment for inflation. The maximum dollar value of a fine for  a violation of the FTZ Act or the Board's regulations is subject to  adjustment for inflation pursuant to the Federal Civil Penalties  Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-410), as amended by the  Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-134).</p>
