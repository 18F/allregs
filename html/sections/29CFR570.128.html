                                Sec. 570.128  Loading of certain scrap paper balers and paper box
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section 13(c)(5) of the FLSA provides for an exemption from the  child labor provisions for the employment of 16- and 17-year-olds to  load, but not operate or unload, certain power-driven scrap paper balers  and paper box compactors under certain conditions. The provisions of  this exemption, which are   contained in HO 12 (Sec. 570.63) include that the scrap paper baler or  compactor meet an applicable standard established by the American  National Standards Institute (ANSI) and identified in the statute, or a  more recent ANSI standard that the Secretary of Labor has found,  incorporated by reference (see Sec. 570.63), and declared to be as  protective of the safety of young workers as the ANSI standard named in  the statute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> These standards have been incorporated into these regulations by  reference by the Federal Register as discussed in Sec. 570.63. In  addition, the scrap paper baler or paper box compactor must include an  on-off switch incorporating a key-lock or other system and the control  of the system must be maintained in the custody of employees who are at  least 18 years of age. The on-off switch of the scrap paper baler or  paper box compactor must be maintained in an off position when the  machine is not in operation. Furthermore, the employer must also post a  notice on the scrap paper baler or paper box compactor that conveys  certain information, including the identification of the applicable ANSI  standard that the equipment meets, that 16- and 17-year-old employees  may only load the scrap paper baler or paper box compactor, and that no  employee under the age of 18 may operate or unload the scrap paper baler  or paper box compactor.
