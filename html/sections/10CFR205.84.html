The DOE may accept submissions from  third persons relevant to any request for interpretation provided that  the person making the request is afforded an opportunity to respond to  all third person submissions. In evaluating a request for  interpretation, the DOE may consider any other source of information.  The DOE on its own initiative may convene a conference, if, in its  discretion, it considers that such conference will advance its  evaluation of the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The DOE shall issue its interpretation on the basis of the  information provided in the request, unless that information is  supplemented by other information brought to the attention of the  General Counsel or a Regional Counsel during the proceeding. The  interpretation shall, therefore, depend for its authority on the  accuracy of the factual statement and may be relied upon only to the  extent that the facts of the actual situation correspond to those upon  which the interpretation was based.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the DOE determines that there is insufficient information  upon which to base a decision and if upon request additional information  is not submitted by the person requesting the interpretation, the DOE  may refuse to issue an interpretation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Criteria. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The DOE shall base an interpretation on the FEA  and EPAA and the regulations and published rulings of the DOE as applied  to the specific factual situation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The DOE shall take into consideration previously issued  interpretations dealing with the same or a related issue.</p>
