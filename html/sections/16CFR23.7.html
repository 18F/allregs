                                Sec. 23.7  Misuse of the words ``platinum,'' ``iridium,''
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> It is unfair or deceptive to use the words ``platinum,'' ``iridium,'' ``palladium,'' ``ruthenium,'' ``rhodium,'' and ``osmium,'' or any abbreviation to mark or describe all or part of an industry product if such marking or description misrepresents the product's true composition. The Platinum Group Metals (PGM) are Platinum, Iridium, Palladium, Ruthenium, Rhodium, and Osmium.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following are examples of markings or descriptions that may be misleading: \10\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\10\ See paragraph (c) of this section for examples of acceptable markings and descriptions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use of the word ``Platinum'' or any abbreviation, without qualification, to describe all or part of an industry product that is not composed throughout of 950 parts per thousand pure Platinum.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use of the word ``Platinum'' or any abbreviation accompanied by a number indicating the parts per thousand of pure Platinum contained in the product without mention of the number of parts per thousand of other PGM contained in the product, to describe all or part of an industry product that is not composed throughout of at least 850 parts per thousand pure platinum, for example, ``600Plat.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Use of the word ``Platinum'' or any abbreviation thereof, to mark or describe any product that is not composed throughout of at least 500 parts per thousand pure Platinum.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Use of the word ``Platinum,'' or any abbreviation accompanied by a number or percentage indicating the parts per thousand of pure Platinum contained in the product, to describe all or part of an industry product that contains at least 500 parts per thousand, but less than 850 parts per thousand, pure Platinum, and does not contain at least 950 parts per thousand PGM (for example, ``585 Plat.'') without a clear and conspicuous disclosure, immediately following the name or description of such product:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Of the full composition of the product (by name and not abbreviation) and percentage of each metal; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That the product may not have the same attributes or properties as traditional platinum products. Provided, however, that the marketer need not make disclosure under Sec. 23.7(b)(4)(ii), if the marketer has competent and reliable scientific evidence that such product does not differ materially from any one product containing at least 850 parts per thousand pure Platinum with respect to the following attributes or properties: durability, luster, density, scratch resistance, tarnish resistance, hypoallergenicity, ability to be resized or repaired, retention of precious metal over time, and any other attribute or property material to consumers.</p><p class="depth4">Note to paragraph (b)(4): When using percentages to qualify platinum representations, marketers should convert the amount in parts per thousand to a percentage that is accurate to the first decimal place (e.g., 58.5% Platinum, 41.5% Cobalt).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The following are examples of markings and descriptions that are not considered unfair or deceptive:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The following abbreviations for each of the PGM may be used for quality marks on articles: ``Plat.'' or ``Pt.'' for Platinum; ``Irid.'' or ``Ir.'' for Iridium; ``Pall.'' or ``Pd.'' for Palladium; ``Ruth.'' or ``Ru.'' for Ruthenium; ``Rhod.'' or ``Rh.'' for Rhodium; and ``Osmi.'' or ``Os.'' for Osmium.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An industry product consisting of at least 950 parts per thousand pure Platinum may be marked or described as ``Platinum.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An industry product consisting of 850 parts per thousand pure Platinum, 900 parts per thousand pure Platinum, or 950 parts per thousand pure Platinum may be marked ``Platinum,'' provided that the Platinum marking is preceded by a number indicating the amount in parts per thousand of pure Platinum (for industry products consisting of 950 parts per thousand pure Platinum, the marking described in Sec. 23.7(b)(2) above is also appropriate). Thus, the following markings may be used: ``950Pt.,'' ``950Plat.,'' ``900Pt.,'' ``900Plat.,'' ``850Pt.,'' or ``850Plat.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An industry product consisting of at least 950 parts per thousand PGM, and of at least 500 parts per thousand pure Platinum, may be marked ``Platinum,'' provided that the mark of each PGM constituent is preceded by a number indicating the amount in parts per thousand of each PGM, as for example, ``600Pt.350Ir.,'' ``600Plat.350Irid.,'' or ``550Pt.350Pd.50Ir.,'' ``550Plat.350Pall.50Irid.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An industry product consisting of at least 500 parts per thousand, but less than 850 parts per thousand, pure Platinum, and not consisting of at least 950 parts per thousand PGM, may be marked or stamped accurately, with a quality marking on the article, using parts per thousand and standard chemical abbreviations (e.g., 585 Pt., 415 Co.).</p><p class="depth3">Note to Sec. 23.7: Exemptions recognized in the assay of platinum industry products are listed in appendix A of this part.
