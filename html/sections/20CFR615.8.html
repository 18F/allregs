                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Particular provisions applicable. Except where the result would  be inconsistent with the provisions of the Act or this part, the terms  and conditions of the applicable State law which apply to claims for,  and the payment of, regular compensation shall apply to claims for, and  the payment of, Extended Benefits. The provisions of the applicable  State law which shall apply to claims for, and the payment of, Extended  Benefits include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Claim filing and reporting;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Information to individuals, as appropriate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notices to individuals and employers, as appropriate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Determinations, redeterminations, and appeal and review;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Ability to work and availability for work, except as provided  otherwise in this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Disqualifications, including disqualifying income provisions,  except as provided by paragraph (c) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Overpayments, and the recovery thereof;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Administrative and criminal penalties;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The Interstate Benefit Payment Plan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The Interstate Arrangement for Combining Employment and Wages,  in accordance with part 616 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Provisions not to be applicable. The State law and regulations  shall specify those of its terms and conditions which shall not be  applicable to claims for, or payment of, Extended Benefits. Among such  terms and conditions shall be at least those relating to--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any waiting period;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Monetary or other qualifying requirements, except as provided in  Sec. 615.4(b); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Computation of weekly and total regular compensation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Terminating disqualifications. A disqualification in a State  law, as to any individual who voluntarily left work, was suspended or  discharged for misconduct, gross misconduct or the commission or  conviction of a crime, or refused an offer of or a referral to work, as  provided in sections 202(a) (4) and (6) of the Act--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As applied to regular benefits which are not sharable, is not  subject to any limitation in sections 202(a) (4) and (6);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As applied to eligibility for Extended Benefits, shall require  that the individual be employed again subsequent to the date of the  disqualification before it may be terminated, even though it may have  been terminated on other grounds for regular benefits which are not  sharable; and if the State law does not also apply this provision to the  payment of what would otherwise be sharable regular benefits, the State  will not be entitled to a payment under the Act and Sec. 615.14 in  regard to such regular compensation; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Will not apply in regard to eligibility for Extended Benefits in  a subsequent eligibility period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Classification and determination of job prospects. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As to  each individual who files an initial claim for Extended Benefits (or  sharable regular compensation), the State agency shall classify the  individual's prospects for obtaining work in his/her customary  occupation within a reasonably short period, as ``good'' or ``not  good,'' and shall promptly (not later than the end of the week in which  the initial claim is filed) notify the individual in writing of such  classification and of the requirements applicable to the individual  under the provisions of the applicable State law corresponding to  section 202(a)(3) of the Act and this part. Such requirements shall be  applicable beginning with the week following the week in which the  individual is furnished such written notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an individual is thus classified as having good prospects,  but those prospects are not realized by the close of the period the  State law specifies as a reasonably short period, the individual's  prospects will be automatically reclassified as ``not good'' or  classified as ``good'' or ``not good'' depending on the individual's job  prospects as of that date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(A)(ii)</em> and (E) of the Act and paragraph (g) of this section),  a written appealable determination shall be made which includes a  finding as to the individual's job prospects at the time the issue  arose. The reasons for allowing or denying benefits in the written  notice of determination shall explain how the individual's job prospects  relate to the decision to allow or deny benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If an individual's job prospects are determined in accordance  with the preceding paragraph (3) to be ``good,'' the suitability of work  will be determined under the standard State law provisions applicable to  claimants for regular compensation which is not sharable; and if  determined to be ``not good,'' the suitability of work will be  determined under the definition of   suitable work in the State law provisions corresponding to sections  202(a)(3) (C) and (D) of the Act and this part. Any determination or  classification of an individual's job prospects is mutually exclusive,  and only one suitable work definition shall be applied to a claimant as  to any failure to accept or apply for work or seek work with respect to  any week.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Requirement of referral to work. (1) The State law shall  provide, as required by section 202(a)(3)(F) of the Act and this part,  that the State Workforce Agency shall refer every claimant for Extended  Benefits to work which is ``suitable work'' as provided in paragraph  (d)(4) of this section, beginning with the week following the week in  which the individual is furnished a written notice of classification of  job prospects as required by paragraphs (d)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> and (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To make such referrals, the State Workforce Agency shall assure  that each Extended Benefit claimant is registered for work and continues  to be considered for referral to job openings as long as he/she  continues to claim benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In referring claimants to available job openings, the State  Workforce Agency shall apply to Extended Benefit claimants the same  priorities, policies, and judgments as it does to other applicants,  except that it shall not restrict referrals only to work at higher skill  levels, prior rates of pay, customary work, or preferences as to work or  pay for individuals whose prospects of obtaining work in their customary  occupations have been classified as or determined to be ``not good.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For referral purposes, any work which does not exceed the  individual's capabilities shall be considered suitable work for an  Extended Benefit claimant whose job prospects have been classified as or  determined to be ``not good'', except as modified by this paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For Extended Benefit claimants whose prospects of obtaining work  in their customary occupations have been classified as or determined to  be ``not good'', work shall not be suitable, and referral to a job shall  not be made, if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The gross average weekly remuneration for the work for any week  does not exceed the sum of the individual's weekly benefit amount plus  any supplemental unemployment benefits (SUB) (as defined in section  501(c)(17)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) payable to the  individual,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The work is not offered in writing or is not listed with the  State employment service,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The work pays less than the higher of the minimum wage set in  section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, without regard  to any exemption, or any applicable State or local minimum wage, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Failure to accept or apply for the work would not result in a  denial of compensation under the provisions of the applicable State law  as defined in Sec. 615.2(o)(7).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In addition, if the State Workforce Agency classifies or  determines that an individual's prospects for obtaining work in his/her  customary occupation within a reasonably short period are ``good,''  referral shall not be made to a job if such referral would not be made  under the State law provisions applicable to claimants for regular  benefits which are not sharable, and such referrals shall be limited to  work which the individual is required to make a ``systematic and  sustained effort'' to search for as defined in Sec. 615.2(o)(8).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> For the purposes of the foregoing paragraphs of this paragraph  (e), State law applies regarding whether members of labor organizations  shall be referred to nonunion work in their customary occupations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If the State law does not also apply this paragraph (e) to  individuals who claim what would otherwise be sharable regular  compensation, the State will not be entitled to payment under the Act  and Sec. 615.14 in regard to such regular compensation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Refusal of work. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State law shall provide, as required by  section 202(a)(3)(A)(i) of the Act and this part, that if an individual  who claims Extended Benefits fails to accept an offer of work or fails  to apply for work to which he/she was referred by the State Workforce  Agency--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the individual's prospects for obtaining work in his/her  customary occupation within a reasonably short   period are determined to be ``good,'' the State agency shall determine  whether the work is suitable under the standard State law provisions  which apply to claimants for regular compensation which is not sharable,  and if determined to be suitable the individual shall be ineligible for  Extended Benefits for the week in which the individual fails to apply  for or accept an offer of suitable work and thereafter until the  individual is employed in at least four weeks with wages from such  employment totalling not less than four times the individual's weekly  benefit amount, as provided by the applicable State law; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the individual's prospects for obtaining work in his/her  customary occupation are determined to be ``not good,'' the State agency  shall determine whether the work is suitable under the applicable State  law provisions corresponding to sections 202(a)(3) (C) and (D) of the  Act and paragraphs (e)(5) and (f)(2) of this section, and if determined  to be suitable the individual shall be ineligible for Extended Benefits  for the week in which the individual fails to apply for or accept an  offer of suitable work and thereafter until the individual is employed  in at least four weeks with wages from such employment totalling not  less than four times the individual's weekly benefit amount, as provided  by the applicable State law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For an individual whose prospects of obtaining work in his/her  customary occupation within the period specified by State law are  classified or determined to be ``not good,'' the term ``suitable work''  shall mean any work which is within the individual's capabilities,  except that work shall not be suitable if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The gross average weekly remuneration for the work for any week  does not exceed the sum of the individual's weekly benefit amount plus  any supplemental unemployment benefits (SUB) (as defined in section  501(c)(17)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) payable to the  individual,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The work is not offered in writing or is not listed with the  State employment service,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The work pays less than the higher of the minimum wage set in  section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, without regard  to any exemption, or any applicable State or local minimum wage, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Failure to accept or apply for the work would not result in a  denial of compensation under the provisions of the applicable State law  as defined in Sec. 615.2(o)(7).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For the purposes of the foregoing paragraphs of this paragraph  (f), State law applies regarding whether members of labor organizations  shall be referred to nonunion work in their customary occupations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the State law does not also apply this paragraph (f) to  individuals who claim what would otherwise be sharable regular  compensation, the State will not be entitled to payment under the Act  and Sec. 615.14 in regard to such regular compensation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Actively seeking work.
