                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Default provider registration. Every provider of VRS or IP Relay must, no later than December 31, 2008, provide users with the capability to register with that VRS or IP Relay provider as a ``default provider.'' Upon a user's registration, the VRS or IP Relay provider shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Facilitate the user's valid number portability request as set forth in 47 CFR 52.34; or, if the user does not wish to port a number,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Assign that user a geographically appropriate North American Numbering Plan telephone number; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Route and deliver all of that user's inbound and outbound calls unless the user chooses to place a call with, or receives a call from, an alternate provider.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Certification of eligibility of VRS users. (i) A VRS provider seeking compensation from the TRS Fund for providing VRS to a particular user registered with that provider must first obtain a written certification from the user, attesting that the user is eligible to use VRS.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A VRS provider seeking compensation from the TRS Fund for providing VRS to a particular user registered with that provider must first obtain a written certification from the user, attesting that the user is eligible to use VRS.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The certification required by paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section must include the user's attestation that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The user has a hearing or speech disability; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The user understands that the cost of VRS calls is paid for by contributions from other telecommunications users to the TRS Fund.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The certification required by paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section must be made on a form separate from any other agreement or form, and must include a separate user signature specific to the certification. For the purposes of this rule, an electronic signature, defined by the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, as an electronic sound, symbol, or process, attached to or logically associated with a contract or other record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record, has the same legal effect as a written signature. For the purposes of this rule, an electronic record, defined by the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act as a contract or other record created, generated, sent, communicated, received, or stored by electronic means, constitutes a record.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Each VRS provider shall maintain the confidentiality of any registration and certification information obtained by the provider, and may not disclose such registration and certification information or the content of such registration and certification information except as required by law or regulation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> VRS providers must, for existing registered Internet-based TRS users, submit the certification required by paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section to the TRS User Registration Database within 60 days of notice from the Managing Director that the TRS User Registration Database is ready to accept such information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> When registering a user that is transferring service from another VRS provider, VRS providers shall obtain and submit a properly executed certification if a query of the TRS User Registration Database shows a properly executed certification has not been filed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> VRS providers shall require their CAs to terminate any call which does not involve an individual eligible to use VRS due to a hearing or speech disability or, pursuant to the provider's policies, the call does not appear to be a legitimate VRS call, and VRS providers may not seek compensation for such calls from the TRS Fund.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> TRS User Registration Database information. Each VRS provider shall collect and transmit to the TRS User Registration Database, in a format prescribed by the administrator of the TRS User Registration Database, the following information for each of its new and existing registered Internet-based TRS users: full name; full residential address; ten-digit telephone number assigned in the TRS numbering directory; last four digits of the social security number or Tribal Identification number, if the registered Internet-based TRS user is a member of a Tribal nation and does not have a social security number; date of birth; Registered Location; VRS provider name and dates of service initiation and termination; a digital copy of the user's self-certification of eligibility for VRS and the date obtained by the provider; the date on which the user's identification was verified; and (for existing users only) the date on which the registered Internet-based TRS user last placed a point-to-point or relay call.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each VRS provider must obtain, from each new and existing registered Internet-based TRS user, consent to transmit the registered Internet-based TRS user's information to the TRS User Registration Database. Prior to obtaining consent, the VRS provider must describe to the registered Internet-based TRS user, using clear, easily understood language, the specific information being transmitted, that the information is being transmitted to the TRS User Registration Database to ensure proper administration of the TRS program, and that failure to provide consent will result in the registered Internet-based TRS user being denied service. VRS providers must obtain and keep a record of affirmative acknowledgment by every registered Internet-based TRS user of such consent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> VRS providers must, for existing registered Internet-based TRS users, submit the information in paragraph (a)(3) of this section to the TRS User Registration Database within 60 days of notice from the Commission that the TRS User Registration Database is ready to accept such information. Calls from or to existing registered Internet-based TRS users that have not had their information populated in the TRS User Registration Database within 60 days of notice from the Commission that the TRS User Registration Database is ready to accept such information shall not be compensable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> VRS providers must submit the information in paragraph (a)(4) of this section upon initiation of service for users registered after 60 days of notice from the Commission that the TRS User Registration Database is ready to accept such information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Mandatory registration of new users. As of December 31, 2008, VRS and IP Relay providers must, prior to the initiation of service for an individual that has not previously utilized VRS or IP Relay, register that new user as described in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Obligations of default providers and former default providers. (1) Default providers must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Default providers must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Obtain current routing information, including IP addresses or domain names and user names, from their Registered Internet-based TRS Users;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provision such information to the TRS Numbering Directory; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Maintain such information in their internal databases and in the TRS Numbering Directory.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Internet-based TRS providers (and, to the extent necessary, their Numbering Partners) must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Take such steps as are necessary to cease acquiring routing information from any VRS or IP Relay user that ports his or her number to another VRS or IP Relay provider or otherwise selects a new default provider;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Communicate among themselves as necessary to ensure that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Only the default provider provisions routing information to the central database; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> VRS and IP Relay providers other than the default provider are aware

that they must query the TRS Numbering Directory in order to obtain accurate routing information for a particular user of VRS or IP Relay.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Proxy numbers. After December 31, 2008, a VRS or IP Relay provider:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> May not assign or issue a proxy or alias for a NANP telephone number to any user; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Must cease to use any proxy or alias for a NANP telephone number assigned or issued to any Registered Internet-based TRS User.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Toll free numbers. A VRS or IP Relay provider:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> May not assign or issue a toll free number to any VRS or IP Relay user.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That has already assigned or provided a toll free number to a VRS or IP Relay user must, at the VRS or IP Relay user's request, facilitate the transfer of the toll free number to a toll free subscription with a toll free service provider that is under the direct control of the user.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Must within one year after the effective date of this Order remove from the Internet-based TRS Numbering Directory any toll free number that has not been transferred to a subscription with a toll free service provider and for which the user is the subscriber of record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> iTRS access technology. (1) Every VRS or IP Relay provider must ensure that all iTRS access technology they have issued, leased, or otherwise provided to VRS or IP Relay users delivers routing information or other information only to the user's default provider, except as is necessary to complete or receive ``dial around'' calls on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Every VRS or IP Relay provider must ensure that all iTRS access technology they have issued, leased, or otherwise provided to VRS or IP Relay users delivers routing information or other information only to the user's default provider, except as is necessary to complete or receive ``dial around'' calls on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All iTRS access technology issued, leased, or otherwise provided to VRS or IP Relay users by Internet-based TRS providers must be capable of facilitating the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> User notification. Every VRS or IP Relay provider must include an advisory on its website and in any promotional materials addressing numbering or E911 services for VRS or IP Relay.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At a minimum, the advisory must address the following issues:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The process by which VRS or IP Relay users may obtain ten-digit telephone numbers, including a brief summary of the numbering assignment and administration processes adopted herein;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The portability of ten-digit telephone numbers assigned to VRS or IP Relay users;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The process by which persons using VRS or IP Relay may submit, update, and confirm receipt by the provider of their Registered Location information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An explanation emphasizing the importance of maintaining accurate, up-to-date Registered Location information with the user's default provider in the event that the individual places an emergency call via an Internet-based relay service;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The process by which a VRS or IP Relay user may acquire a toll free number, or transfer control of a toll free number from a VRS or IP Relay provider to the user; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The process by which persons holding a toll free number request that the toll free number be linked to their ten-digit telephone number in the TRS Numbering Directory.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> VRS and IP Relay providers must obtain and keep a record of affirmative acknowledgment by every Registered Internet-based TRS User of having received and understood the advisory described in this subsection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> A VRS CA service provider shall fulfill its obligations under paragraphs (a), (c), (d), and (e) of this section using the Neutral Video Communication Service Platform.
