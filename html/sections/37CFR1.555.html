A prima facie case of unpatentability of a claim pending in a  reexamination proceeding is established when the information compels a  conclusion that a claim is unpatentable under the preponderance of  evidence, burden-of-proof standard, giving each term in the claim its  broadest reasonable construction consistent with the specification, and  before any consideration is given to evidence which may be submitted in  an attempt to establish a contrary conclusion of patentability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>.
