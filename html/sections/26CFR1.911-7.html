Any such elections may be made on  Form 2555 or on a comparable form. Each election must be filed either  with the income tax return, or with an amended   return, for the first taxable year of the individual for which the  election is to be effective. An election once made remains in effect for  that year and all subsequent years unless revoked under paragraph (b) of  this section. Each election shall contain information sufficient to  determine whether the individual is a qualified individual as provided  in Sec. 1.911-2. The statement shall include the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The individual's name, address, and social security number;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The name of the individual's employer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Whether the individual claimed exclusions under section 911  for earlier years after 1981 and within the five preceding taxable  years;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Whether the individual has revoked a previously made election  and the taxable year for which such revocation was effective;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The exclusion or exclusions the individual is electing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The foreign country or countries in which the individual's tax  home is located and the date when such tax home was established;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The status (either bona fide residence or physical presence)  under which the individual claims the exclusion;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> The individual's qualifying period of residence or presence;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> The individual's foreign earned income for the taxable year  including the fair market value of all noncash remuneration; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> If the individual elects to exclude the housing cost amount, the  individual's housing expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Requirement of a return--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. In order to make a  valid election under this paragraph (a), the election must be made:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> With an income tax return that is timely filed (including any  extensions of time to file),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> With a later return filed within the period prescribed in  section 6511(a) amending the foregoing timely filed income tax return,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> With an original income tax return that is filed within one year  after the due date of the return (determined without regard to any  extension of time to file); this one year period does not constitute an  extension of time for any purpose--it is merely a period during which a  valid election may be made on a late return, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> With an income tax return filed after the period described in  paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(A), (B), or (C) of this section provided--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The taxpayer owes no federal income tax after taking into  account the exclusion and files Form 1040 with Form 2555 or a comparable  form attached either before or after the Internal Revenue Service  discovers that the taxpayer failed to elect the exclusion; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The taxpayer owes federal income tax after taking into account  the exclusion and files Form 1040 with Form 2555 or a comparable form  attached before the Internal Revenue Service discovers that the taxpayer  failed to elect the exclusion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A taxpayer filing an income tax return pursuant to paragraph  (a)(2)(i)(D)(1) or (2) of this section must type or legibly print the  following statement at the top of the first page of the Form 1040:  ``Filed Pursuant to Section 1.911-7(a)(2)(i)(D).''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Election for 1982 and 1983 taxable years. Solely for purposes  of paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) of this section, an income tax return for any  taxable year beginning before January 1, 1984, shall be considered  timely filed if it is filed on or before July 23, 1985.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Housing cost amount deduction. An individual does not have to  make an election in order to claim the housing cost amount deduction.  However, such individual must provide the Commissioner with information  sufficient to determine the individual's correct amount of tax. Such  information shall include the following: The individual's name, address,  and social security number; the name of the individual's employer; the  foreign country in which the individual's tax home was established; the  status under which the individual claims the deduction; the individual's  qualifying period of residence or presence; the individual's foreign  earned income for the taxable year; and the individual's housing  expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Effect of immaterial error or omission. An inadvertent error or  omission of information required to be provided   to make an election under this paragraph (a) shall not render the  election invalid if the error or omission is not material in determining  whether the individual is a qualified individual or whether the  individual intends to make the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Revocation of election--(1) In general. An individual may revoke  any election made under paragraph (a) of this section for any taxable  year. A revocation must be made separately with respect to each  election. The individual may revoke an election for any taxable year,  including the first taxable year for which an election was effective, by  filing a statement that the individual is revoking one or more of the  previously made elections. The statement must be filed with the income  tax return, or with an amended return, for the first taxable year of the  individual for which the revocation is to be effective. A revocation  once made is effective for that year and all subsequent years. If an  election is revoked for any taxable year, including the first taxable  year for which the election was effective, the individual may not,  without the consent of the Commissioner, again make the same election  until the sixth taxable year following the taxable year for which the  revocation was first effective. For example, a qualified individual  makes an election to exclude foreign earned income under section  911(a)(1) and files it with his 1982 income tax return. The individual  files 1983 and 1984 income tax returns on which he excludes his foreign  earned income. Then, within 3 years after filing his 1982 income tax  return, the individual files an amended 1982 income tax return with a  statement revoking his election to exclude foreign earned income under  section 911(a)(1). The revocation of the election is effective for  taxable years 1982, 1983, and 1984. The individual may not elect to  exclude income under section 911(a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> for any taxable year before 1988,  unless he obtains consent to reelect under paragraph (b)(2) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reelection before sixth taxable year after revocation. If an  individual revoked an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section  and within five taxable years the individual wishes to reelect the same  exclusion, then the individual may apply for consent to the reelection.  The application for consent shall be made by requesting a ruling from  the Associate Chief Counsel (Technical), National Office, Internal  Revenue Service, 1111 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20224. In  determining whether to consent to reelection the Associate Chief Counsel  or his delegate shall consider any facts and circumstances that may be  relevant to the determination. Relevant facts and circumstances may  include the following: a period of United States residence, a move from  one foreign country to another foreign country with differing tax rates,  a substantial change in the tax laws of the foreign country of residence  or physical presence, and a change of employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> and Sec. 1.6012-1(a)(3), relating  to returns to be filed and information to be furnished by individuals  who qualify for any exclusion or deduction under section 911.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Declaration of estimated tax. In estimating gross income for the  purpose of determining whether a declaration of estimated tax must be  made for any taxable year, an individual is not required to take into  account income which the individual reasonably believes will be excluded  from gross income under the provisions of section 911. In computing  estimated tax, however, the individual must take into account, among  other things, the denial of the foreign tax credit for foreign taxes  allocable to the excluded income (see Sec. 1.911-6(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section applies to  applications for extension of time to file returns filed after July 1,  2008.  (Sec. 911 (95 Stat. 194; 26 U.S.C. 911) and sec. 7805 (68A Stat. 917; 26  U.S.C. 7805) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954)  [T.D. 8006, 50 FR 2976, Jan. 23, 1985, as amended by T.D. 8480, 58 FR  34885, June 30, 1993; 73 FR 37365, July 1, 2008]</p>
