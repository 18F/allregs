                            <p class="depth0">``Practices * * * performed * * * on a farm'' must be performed as  an incident to or in conjunction with ``such farming operations'' in  order to constitute ``agriculture'' within the secondary meaning of the  term. No practice performed with respect to farm commodities is within  the language under discussion by reason of its performance on a farm  unless all of such commodities are the products of that farm. Thus, the  performance on a farm of any practice, such as packing or storing, which  may be incidental to farming operations cannot constitute a basis for  considering the employees engaged in agriculture if the practice is  performed upon any commodities that have been produced elsewhere than on  such farm (see Mitchell v. Hunt, 263 F. 2d 913). The construction by an  independent contractor of granary on a farm is not connected with  ``such'' farming operations if the farmer for whom it is built intends  to use the structure for storing grain produced on other farms. Nor is  the requirement met with respect to employees engaged in any other  practices performed on a farm, but not by a farmer, in connection with  farming operations that are not conducted on that particular farm. The  fact that such a practice pertains to farming operations generally or to  those performed on a number of farms, rather than to those performed on  the same farm only, is sufficient to take it outside the scope of the  statutory language. Area soil surveys and genetics research activities,  results of which are made available to a number of farmers, are typical  of the practices to which   this principle applies and which are not within section 3(f) under this  provision.</p>
