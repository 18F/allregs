                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of this subpart:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A temporary help service firm is a private sector entity which  quickly provides other organizations with specific services performed by  its pool of employees, possessing the appropriate work skills, for brief  or intermittent periods. The firm is the legally responsible employer  and maintains that relationship during the time its employees are  assigned to a client. The firm, not the client organization, recruits,  tests, hires, trains, assigns, pays, provides benefits and leave to, and  as necessary, addresses performance problems, disciplines, and  terminates its employees. Among other employer obligations, the firm is  responsible for payroll deductions and payment of income taxes, social  security (FICA), unemployment insurance, and workers' compensation, and  shall provide required liability insurance and bonding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Private sector temporaries or outside temporaries are those  employees of a temporary help service firm who are supervised and paid  by that firm and whom that firm assigns to various client organizations  who have contracted for the temporary use of their skills when required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Parental and family responsibilities are defined in OPM  issuances and include situations such as absence for pregnancy,  childbirth, child care, and care for elderly or infirm parents or other  dependents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A Federal supervisor of Federal employees is defined in 5 U.S.C.  7103(a)(10) as  an individual employed by an agency having authority in the interest of  the agency to hire, direct, assign, promote, reward, transfer, furlough,  layoff, recall, suspend, discipline, or remove employees, to adjust  their grievances, or to effectively recommend such action, if the  exercise of the authority is not merely routine or clerical in nature  but requires the consistent exercise of independent judgment * * *</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A critical need is a sudden or unexpected occurrence; an  emergency; a pressing necessity; or an exigency. Such occasions are  characterized by additional work or deadlines required by statute,  Executive order, court order, regulation, or formal directive from the  head of an agency or subordinate official authorized to take final  action on behalf of the agency head. A recurring, cyclical peak  workload, by itself, is not a critical need.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A local commuting area is defined in part 351 of this chapter.  [54 FR 3766, Jan. 25, 1989, as amended at 66 FR 66710, Dec. 27, 2001]</p>
