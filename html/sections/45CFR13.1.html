                            <p class="depth0">These rules implement section 203 of the Equal Access to Justice  Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 and 504 note, for the Department of Health and Human  Services. They describe the circumstances under which the Department may  award attorney fees and certain other expenses to eligible individuals  and entities who prevail over the Department in certain administrative  proceedings (called ``adversary adjudications''). The Department may  reimburse parties for expenses incurred in adversary adjudications if  the party prevails in the proceeding and if the Department's position in  the proceeding was not substantially justified or if the action is one  to enforce compliance with a statutory or regulatory requirement and the  Department's demand is substantially in excess of the ultimate decision  and is unreasonable when compared with that decision. They also describe  what proceedings constitute adversary adjudications covered by the Act,  what   types of persons and entities may be eligible for an award, and what  procedures and standards the Department will use to make a determination  as to whether a party may receive an award.  [48 FR 45252, Oct. 4, 1983, as amended at 69 FR 2845, Jan. 21, 2004]</p>
