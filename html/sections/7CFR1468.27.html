                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> To be considered for certification, an entity must submit a written request for certification to NRCS, which specifically addresses the following items:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An explanation of how the entity meets the requirements identified in Sec. 1468.20(d) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An agreement to use for ACEP-ALE funded acquisitions easement valuation methodologies identified in section Sec. 1468.24 of this part;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Proof that the entity holds, manages, and monitors a minimum of 25 agricultural land conservation easements, unless the entity requests and receives a waiver of this requirement from NRCS;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Proof that the entity holds, manages, and monitors a minimum of five ACEP-ALE, FRPP, or Farmland Protection Program conservation easements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A showing of a demonstrated ability to complete acquisition of easements in a timely fashion;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A showing that it has the capacity to enforce the provisions of easement deeds and history of such enforcement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> For nongovernmental organizations, information that the entity possesses a dedicated fund for the purposes of easement management, monitoring, and enforcement where such fund is sufficiently capitalized. The fund must be dedicated to the purposes of managing, monitoring, and enforcing each easement held by the eligible entity; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> A plan for administering easements enrolled under this part, as determined by NRCS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> NRCS will notify an entity in writing whether they have been certified and the rationale for the agency's decision. When NRCS determines an entity qualifies as certified:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> NRCS may enter into a cooperative agreement with the certified entity through which NRCS may obligate funding for up to 5 fiscal years. New parcels or prior-year unfunded parcels submitted for funding by certified entities must compete for funding each year. Selected parcels and funding will be added to the existing cooperative agreement using an amendment to the cooperative agreement. Amendments added in the last year of the agreement cannot be extended;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> NRCS will accept applications from certified entities continuously throughout the fiscal year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The terms of the cooperative agreement will include the minimum deed terms and conditions to ensure that ACEP-ALE purposes will be met by the certified entity without requiring NRCS to pre-approve each easement transaction prior to closing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Certified entities may purchase easements without NRCS approving the agricultural land easement deeds,

agricultural land easement plans, titles, or appraisals before the purchase of the easement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certified entities will prepare the agricultural land easement deeds, agricultural land easement plans, titles, and appraisals in accordance with NRCS requirements as identified in the cooperative agreement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> NRCS may provide technical assistance to develop the agricultural land easement plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> NRCS will conduct quality assurance reviews of a percentage of the agricultural land easement transactions submitted by the certified entity for payment and annual monitoring reports submitted by the certified entity. The review will include whether the deed, title review, agricultural land easement plan, easement valuation determinations, and subsequent monitoring were conducted in accordance with the requirements set forth by NRCS in its certification of the eligible entity or in the cooperative agreement entered into with the certified entity; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If an agricultural land easement deed, agricultural land easement plan, title, appraisal, or other easement valuation determination, or monitoring report fails the NRCS quality assurance review, NRCS will provide the certified entity an opportunity to correct the errors. If the certified entity fails to correct the errors to NRCS' satisfaction, NRCS will consider whether to allow the certified entity to continue to purchase ALE-funded easements without prior NRCS approval, to decertify the entity in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, or require the certified entity to take administrative steps necessary to remedy the deficiencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Review and decertification of the certified entity. (1) NRCS will conduct a review of the certified entity a minimum of once every 3 years to ensure that the certified entities are meeting the certification criteria established in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If NRCS determines that the certified entity no longer meets these criteria, the Chief will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Provide the certified entity a specified period of time, at a minimum 180 days, in which to take such actions as may be necessary to correct the identified deficiencies, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If NRCS determines the certified entity does not meet the criteria established in this part after the 180 days, NRCS will send written notice of decertification of the entity's certification status or eligibility for future ACEP-ALE funding. This notice will specify the actions that have not been completed to retain certification status, the actions entity must take to request certification status, the status of funds in the cooperative agreement; and the eligibility of the entity to apply for future ACEP-ALE funds. The entity may contest the Notice of Decertification in writing to NRCS within 20 calendar days of receipt of the notice of decertification. The entity's letter must provide specific reasons why the decision to decertify is in error.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The period of decertification may not exceed 3 years in duration, with duration of decertification based upon the seriousness of the facts; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The entity may be recertified upon application to NRCS, after the decertification period has expired, and when the entity has met the requirements as outlined under Sec. 1468.20(d).</p>
