                            <p class="depth0">A fixed-ceiling-price contract with retroactive price  redetermination is appropriate for research and development contracts  estimated at $150,000 or less when it is established at the outset that  a fair and reasonable firm fixed price cannot be negotiated and that the  amount involved and short performance period make the use of any other  fixed-price contract type impracticable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A ceiling price shall be negotiated for the contract at a level  that reflects a reasonable sharing of risk by the contractor. The  established ceiling price may be adjusted only if required by the  operation of contract clauses providing for equitable adjustment or  other revision of the contract price under stated circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The contract should be awarded only after negotiation of a  billing price that is as fair and reasonable as the circumstances  permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Since this contract type provides the contractor no cost control  incentive except the ceiling price, the contracting officer should make  clear to the contractor during discussion before award that the  contractor's management effectiveness and ingenuity will be considered  in retroactively redetermining the price.
