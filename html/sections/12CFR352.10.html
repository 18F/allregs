                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. Paragraph (b) of this section applies to employment complaints. The remaining sections concern complaints alleging disability discrimination in FDIC programs or activities and denial of technology access.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Employment complaints. The FDIC shall process complaints alleging employment discrimination on the basis of disability according to the procedures established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR parts 1614 and 1630 pursuant to section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Informal process. A complainant shall first exhaust informal administrative procedures before filing a formal complaint alleging disability discrimination in FDIC programs or activities, or a denial of technology access. The FDIC's Office of Diversity and Economic Opportunity shall be responsible for coordinating implementation of this section. An aggrieved individual initiates the process by filing an informal complaint with ODEO within 180 calendar days from the date of the alleged disability discrimination or denial of access to electronic information technology. An informal complaint with respect to any FDIC program or activity must include a written statement containing the individual's name and address which describes the FDIC's action in sufficient detail to inform the FDIC of the nature and date of the alleged violation of these regulations. An informal complaint for denial of technology access must clearly identify the individual and the manner in which the EIT was inaccessible. All informal complaints shall be signed by the complainant or one authorized to do so on his or her behalf. Informal complaints

filed on behalf of third parties shall describe or identify (by name if possible) the alleged victim of discrimination or denial of technology access. During the informal resolution process, ODEO has 30 days to attempt a resolution of the matter. If the aggrieved individual elects to participate in mediation, the period for attempting informal resolution will be extended for an additional 60 calendar days. If the matter is not resolved informally, the individual will be provided written notice of the right to file a formal complaint. All complaints should be sent to the FDIC's Office of Diversity and Economic Opportunity, 3501 Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22226.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the FDIC receives a complaint over which it does not have jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make reasonable efforts to refer the complainant to the appropriate government entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Formal complaints. The individual must file a written formal complaint within 15 calendar days after receiving the notice of a right to file a formal complaint. Formal complaints must be filed with the FDIC Chairman or the ODEO Director. Within 120 days of the receipt of such a complaint for which it has jurisdiction, the FDIC shall notify the complainant of the results of the investigation in a letter containing--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A finding regarding the alleged violations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of a remedy for each violation found; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A notice of the right to appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Appeals of the findings or remedies must be filed by the complainant within 30 days of receipt from the FDIC of the letter required by Sec. 352.10 (e). The FDIC may extend this time for good cause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Timely appeals shall be accepted and processed by the FDIC Chairman or ODEO Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The FDIC Chairman or ODEO Director shall notify the complainant of the results of the appeal within 60 days of the receipt of the request. If the FDIC Chairman or ODEO Director determines that additional information is needed from the complainant, he or she shall have 60 days from the date of receipt of the additional information to make a determination on the appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The time limits set forth in (e) and (h) above may be extended for an individual case when the FDIC Chairman or ODEO Director determines that there is good cause, based on the particular circumstances of that case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The FDIC may delegate its authority for conducting complaint investigations to other federal agencies or independent contractors, except that the authority for making the final determination may not be delegated.
