                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The FAA will determine the maximum probable loss (MPL) from  covered claims by a third party for bodily injury or property damage,  and the United States, its agencies, and its contractors and  subcontractors for covered property damage or loss, resulting from a  permitted or licensed activity. The maximum probable loss determination  forms the basis for financial responsibility requirements issued in a  license or permit order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The FAA issues its determination of maximum probable loss no  later than ninety days after a licensee or permittee has requested a  determination and submitted all information required by the FAA to make  the determination. The FAA will consult with Federal agencies that are  involved in, or whose personnel or property are exposed to risk of  damage or loss as a result of, a licensed or permitted activity before  issuing a license or permit order prescribing financial responsibility  requirements, and shall notify the licensee, or permittee, if  interagency consultation may delay issuance of the MPL determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Appendix A of this part contains information requirements for  obtaining a maximum probable loss determination. Any person requesting a  determination of maximum probable loss must submit the information  required by Appendix A, unless the FAA has waived a requirement. In lieu  of submitting required information, a person requesting a maximum  probable loss determination may designate and certify certain  information previously submitted for a prior determination as complete,  valid, and equally applicable to its current request. The requester is  responsible for the continuing accuracy and completeness of information  submitted under this part and must promptly report any changes in  writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The FAA will amend a determination of maximum probable loss  required under this section at any time prior to completion of licensed  or permitted activities as warranted by supplementary information  provided to or   obtained by the FAA after the MPL determination is issued. Any change in  financial responsibility requirements as a result of an amended MPL  determination shall be set forth in a license or permit order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The FAA may make a determination of maximum probable loss at any  time other than as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section upon  request by any person.</p>
