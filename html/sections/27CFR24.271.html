                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The tax on wine is paid by an Excise Tax Return, TTB F 5000.24, which is filled with remittance (check, cash, or money order) for the full amount of tax due. Prepayments of tax on wine during the period covered by the return are shown separately on the Excise Tax Return form. If no tax is due for the return period, the filing of a return is not required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Return periods and due dates. (1) Return periods. (i) Semimonthly return

period. Except in the case of a taxpayer who qualifies for, and chooses to use, the annual return period as provided in Sec. 24.273 or the quarterly return period as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, all taxpayers who have filed a bond for deferred payment of taxes must use semimonthly return periods. The semimonthly return periods run from the 1st day through the 15th day of each month, and from the 16th day through the last day of each month, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Return periods. (i) Semimonthly return

period. Except in the case of a taxpayer who qualifies for, and chooses to use, the annual return period as provided in Sec. 24.273 or the quarterly return period as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, all taxpayers who have filed a bond for deferred payment of taxes must use semimonthly return periods. The semimonthly return periods run from the 1st day through the 15th day of each month, and from the 16th day through the last day of each month, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Semimonthly return

period. Except in the case of a taxpayer who qualifies for, and chooses to use, the annual return period as provided in Sec. 24.273 or the quarterly return period as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, all taxpayers who have filed a bond for deferred payment of taxes must use semimonthly return periods. The semimonthly return periods run from the 1st day through the 15th day of each month, and from the 16th day through the last day of each month, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Quarterly return period. A taxpayer who has filed a bond for deferred payment of taxes may choose to use a quarterly return period if the taxpayer was not liable for more than $50,000 in taxes with respect to wine imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5041 and 7652 in the preceding calendar year and if that taxpayer reasonably expects to be liable for not more than $50,000 in such taxes during the current calendar year. In such a case the last day for paying the tax and filing the return shall be the 14th day after the last day of the calendar quarter. However, the taxpayer may not use the quarterly return period procedure for any portion of the calendar year following the first date on which the aggregate amount of tax due from the taxpayer during the calendar year exceeds $50,000, and any tax that has not been paid on that date shall be due on the 14th day after the last day of the semimonthly period in which that date occurs. The following additional rules apply to the quarterly return period procedure under this section:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A ``taxpayer'' is an individual, corporation, partnership, or other entity that is assigned a single Employer Identification Number as defined in 26 CFR 301.7701-12;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> ``Reasonably expects'' means that there is no existing or anticipated circumstance known to the taxpayer (such as an increase in production capacity) that would cause the taxpayer's tax liability to exceed the prescribed limit;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A taxpayer with multiple locations must combine the wine tax liability for all locations to determine eligibility for the quarterly return procedure;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> A taxpayer who has both domestic operations and import transactions must combine the wine tax liability on the domestic operations and the imports to determine eligibility for the quarterly return procedure;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The controlled group rules of 26 U.S.C. 5061(e), which concern treatment of controlled groups as one taxpayer, do not apply for purposes of determining eligibility for the quarterly return procedure. However, a taxpayer who is eligible for the quarterly return procedure, and who is a member of a controlled group that owes $5 million or more in wine excise taxes per year, is required to pay taxes by electronic fund transfer (EFT). Quarterly payments via EFT shall be transmitted in accordance with section 5061(e);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> A new taxpayer is eligible to file quarterly returns in the first year of business simply if the taxpayer reasonably expects to be liable for not more than $50,000 in wine taxes during that calendar year; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> If a taxpayer filing quarterly exceeds $50,000 in tax liability during a taxable year and therefore must revert to the semimonthly return procedure, that taxpayer may resume quarterly payments only after a full calendar year has passed during which the taxpayer's liability did not exceed $50,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Semimonthly and quarterly tax return due dates. The taxpayer shall file the semimonthly or quarterly return, with remittance, for each return period not later than the 14th day after the last day of the return period. If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the return and remittance are due on the immediately preceding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special September rule for taxes due by semimonthly return. (1) Division of second semimonthly period. (i) General. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the second semimonthly period for the month of September is divided into two payment periods, from the 16th day through the 26th day, and from the 27th day through the 30th day. The proprietor shall file a return on TTB F 5000.24, and make remittance, for the

period September 16-26, no later than September 29. The proprietor shall file a return on TTB F 5000.24, and make remittance, for the period September 27-30, no later than October 14.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Division of second semimonthly period.

In the case of taxes for which remittance by electronic fund transfer (EFT) is not required by Sec. 24.272, the second semimonthly period of September is divided into two payment periods, from the 16th day through the 25th day, and from the 26th day through the 30th day. The proprietor shall file a return on TTB F 5000.24, and make remittance, for the period September 16-25, no later than September 28. The proprietor shall file a return on TTB F 5000.24, and make remittance, for the period September 26-30, no later than October 14.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Amount of payment--Safe harbor rule. (i) General. Taxpayers are considered to have met the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section if the amount paid no later than September 29 is not less than 11/15ths (73.3 percent) of the tax liability incurred for the semimonthly period beginning on September 1 and ending on September 15, and if any underpayment of tax is paid by October 14.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General.

If the required taxpayment due date for the period September 16-25 or September 16-26, as applicable, falls on a Saturday or legal holiday, the return and remittance are due on the immediately preceding day. If the required due date falls on a Sunday, the return and remittance are due on the immediately following day.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Example: Payment of tax for the month of September. (i) Facts. X, a proprietor required to pay taxes by electronic fund transfer, incurred tax liability in the amount of $30,000 for the first semimonthly period of September. For the period September 16-26, X incurred tax liability in the amount of $45,000, and for the period September 27-30, X incurred tax liability in the amount of $2,000.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Facts. X, a proprietor required to pay taxes by electronic fund transfer, incurred tax liability in the amount of $30,000 for the first semimonthly period of September. For the period September 16-26, X incurred tax liability in the amount of $45,000, and for the period September 27-30, X incurred tax liability in the amount of $2,000.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Payment requirement.
