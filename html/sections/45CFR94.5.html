Examples of conditions or restrictions that might be imposed to manage a financial conflict of interest include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Public disclosure of financial conflicts of interest (e.g., when presenting or publishing the research);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For research projects involving human subjects research, disclosure of financial conflicts of interest directly to participants;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Appointment of an independent monitor capable of taking measures to protect the design, conduct, and reporting of the research against bias, resulting from the financial conflict of interest;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Modification of the research plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Change of personnel or personnel responsibilities, or disqualification of personnel from participation in all or a portion of the research;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Reduction or elimination of the financial interest (e.g., sale of an equity interest); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Severance of relationships that create financial conflicts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Whenever, in the course of an ongoing PHS-funded research project, an Investigator who is new to participating in the research project discloses a significant financial interest or an existing Investigator discloses a new significant financial interest to the Institution, the designated official(s) of the Institution shall, within sixty days: review the disclosure of the significant financial interest; determine whether it is related to PHS-funded research; determine whether a financial conflict of interest exists; and, if so, implement, on at least an interim basis, a management plan that shall specify the actions that have been, and will be, taken to manage such financial conflict of interest. Depending on the nature of the significant financial interest, an Institution may determine that additional interim measures are necessary with regard to the Investigator's participation in the PHS-funded research project between the date of disclosure and the completion of the Institution's review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Whenever an Institution identifies a significant financial interest that was not disclosed timely by an Investigator or, for whatever reason, was not previously reviewed by the Institution during an ongoing PHS-funded research project (e.g., was not timely reviewed

or reported by a subrecipient), the designated official(s) shall, within sixty days: review the significant financial interest; determine whether it is related to PHS-funded research; determine whether a financial conflict of interest exists; and, if so:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Implement, on at least an interim basis, a management plan that shall specify the actions that have been, and will be, taken to manage such financial conflict of interest going forward;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> (A) In addition, whenever a financial conflict of interest is not identified or managed in a timely manner including failure by the Investigator to disclose a significant financial interest that is determined by the Institution to constitute a financial conflict of interest; failure by the Institution to review or manage such a financial conflict of interest; or failure by the Investigator to comply with a financial conflict of interest management plan, the Institution shall, within 120 days of the Institution's determination of noncompliance, complete a retrospective review of the Investigator's activities and the PHS-funded research project to determine whether any PHS-funded research, or portion thereof, conducted during the time period of the noncompliance, was biased in the design, conduct, or reporting of such research.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In addition, whenever a financial conflict of interest is not identified or managed in a timely manner including failure by the Investigator to disclose a significant financial interest that is determined by the Institution to constitute a financial conflict of interest; failure by the Institution to review or manage such a financial conflict of interest; or failure by the Investigator to comply with a financial conflict of interest management plan, the Institution shall, within 120 days of the Institution's determination of noncompliance, complete a retrospective review of the Investigator's activities and the PHS-funded research project to determine whether any PHS-funded research, or portion thereof, conducted during the time period of the noncompliance, was biased in the design, conduct, or reporting of such research.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The Institution is required to document the retrospective review; such documentation shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, all of the following key elements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Project number;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Project title;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> PD/PI or contact PD/PI if a multiple PD/PI model is used;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Name of the Investigator with the FCOI;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Name of the entity with which the Investigator has a financial conflict of interest;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Reason(s) for the retrospective review;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Detailed methodology used for the retrospective review (e.g., methodology of the review process, composition of the review panel, documents reviewed);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Findings of the review; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Conclusions of the review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Based on the results of the retrospective review, if appropriate, the Institution shall update the previously submitted FCOI report, specifying the actions that will be taken to manage the financial conflict of interest going forward. If bias is found, the Institution is required to notify the PHS Awarding Component promptly and submit a mitigation report to the PHS Awarding Component. The mitigation report must include, at a minimum, the key elements documented in the retrospective review above and a description of the impact of the bias on the research project and the Institution's plan of action or actions taken to eliminate or mitigate the effect of the bias (e.g., impact on the research project; extent of harm done, including any qualitative and quantitative data to support any actual or future harm; analysis of whether the research project is salvageable). Thereafter, the Institution will submit FCOI reports annually, as specified elsewhere in this part. Depending on the nature of the financial conflict of interest, an Institution may determine that additional interim measures are necessary with regard to the Investigator's participation in the PHS-funded research project between the date that the financial conflict of interest or the Investigator's noncompliance is determined and the completion of the Institution's retrospective review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Whenever an Institution implements a management plan pursuant to this part, the Institution shall monitor Investigator compliance with the management plan on an ongoing basis until the completion of the PHS-funded research project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)(i)</em> Prior to the Institution's expenditure of any funds under a PHS-funded research project, the Institution shall ensure public accessibility, via a publicly accessible Web site or written response to any requestor within five business days of a request, of information concerning any significant financial interest disclosed to the Institution that meets the following three criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Prior to the Institution's expenditure of any funds under a PHS-funded research project, the Institution shall ensure public accessibility, via a publicly accessible Web site or written response to any requestor within five business days of a request, of information concerning any significant financial interest disclosed to the Institution that meets the following three criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The significant financial interest was disclosed and is still held by key personnel as defined in this part;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The Institution determines that the significant financial interest is related to the PHS-funded research; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The Institution determines that the significant financial interest is a financial conflict of interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The information that the Institution makes available via a publicly accessible Web site or written response to any requestor within five business days of a request, shall include, at a minimum, the following: The Investigator's name; the Investigator's title and role with respect to the research project; the name of the entity in which the significant financial interest is held; the nature of the significant financial interest; and the approximate dollar value of the significant financial interest (dollar ranges are permissible: $0-$4,999; $5,000-$9,999; $10,000-$19,999; amounts between $20,000-$100,000 by increments of $20,000; amounts above $100,000 by increments of $50,000), or a statement that the interest is one whose value cannot be readily determined through reference to public prices or other reasonable measures of fair market value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the Institution uses a publicly accessible Web site for the purposes of this subsection, the information that the Institution posts shall be updated at least annually. In addition, the Institution shall update the Web site within sixty days of the Institution's receipt or identification of information concerning any additional significant financial interest of the senior/key personnel for the PHS-funded research project that was not previously disclosed, or upon the disclosure of a significant financial interest of senior/key personnel new to the PHS-funded research project, if the Institution determines that the significant financial interest is related to the PHS-funded research and is a financial conflict of interest. The Web site shall note that the information provided is current as of the date listed and is subject to updates, on at least an annual basis and within 60 days of the Institution's identification of a new financial conflict of interest. If the Institution responds to written requests for the purposes of this subsection, the Institution will note in its written response that the information provided is current as of the date of the correspondence and is subject to updates, on at least an annual basis and within 60 days of the Institution's identification of a new financial conflict of interest, which should be requested subsequently by the requestor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Information concerning the significant financial interests of an individual subject to paragraph (a)(5) of this section shall remain available, for responses to written requests or for posting via the Institution's publicly accessible Web site for at least three years from the date that the information was most recently updated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> In addition to the types of financial conflicts of interest as defined in this part that must be managed pursuant to this section, an Institution may require the management of other financial conflicts of interest in its policy on financial conflicts of interest, as the Institution deems appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Reporting of financial conflicts of interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Prior to the Institution's expenditure of any funds under a PHS-funded research project, the Institution shall provide to the PHS Awarding Component an FCOI report regarding any Investigator's significant financial interest found by the Institution to be conflicting and ensure that the Institution has implemented a management plan in accordance with this part. In cases in which the Institution identifies a financial conflict of interest and eliminates it prior to the expenditure of PHS-awarded funds, the Institution shall not submit an FCOI report to the PHS Awarding Component.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For any significant financial interest that the Institution identifies as conflicting subsequent to the Institution's initial FCOI report during an ongoing PHS-funded research project (e.g., upon the participation of an Investigator who is new to the research project), the Institution shall provide to the PHS Awarding Component, within sixty days, an FCOI report regarding the financial conflict of interest and ensure that the Institution has implemented a management plan in accordance with this part. Pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, where such FCOI report involves a significant financial interest that was not disclosed timely by an Investigator or,

for whatever reason, was not previously reviewed or managed by the Institution (e.g., was not timely reviewed or reported by a subrecipient), the Institution also is required to complete a retrospective review to determine whether any PHS-funded research, or portion thereof, conducted prior to the identification and management of the financial conflict of interest was biased in the design, conduct, or reporting of such research. Additionally, pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section, if bias is found, the Institution is required to notify the PHS Awarding Component promptly and submit a mitigation report to the PHS Awarding Component.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any FCOI report required under paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section shall include sufficient information to enable the PHS Awarding Component to understand the nature and extent of the financial conflict, and to assess the appropriateness of the Institution's management plan. Elements of the FCOI report shall include, but are not necessarily limited to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Project/Contract number;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> PD/PI or Contact PD/PI if a multiple PD/PI model is used;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Name of the Investigator with the financial conflict of interest;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Name of the entity with which the Investigator has a financial conflict of interest;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Nature of the financial interest (e.g., equity, consulting fee, travel reimbursement, honorarium);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Value of the financial interest (dollar ranges are permissible: $0-$4,999; $5,000-$9,999; $10,000-$19,999; amounts between $20,000-$100,000 by increments of $20,000; amounts above $100,000 by increments of $50,000), or a statement that the interest is one whose value cannot be readily determined through reference to public prices or other reasonable measures of fair market value;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> A description of how the financial interest relates to the PHS-funded research and the basis for the Institution's determination that the financial interest conflicts with such research; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> A description of the key elements of the Institution's management plan, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Role and principal duties of the conflicted Investigator in the research project;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Conditions of the management plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> How the management plan is designed to safeguard objectivity in the research project;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Confirmation of the Investigator's agreement to the management plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> How the management plan will be monitored to ensure Investigator compliance; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Other information as needed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For any financial conflict of interest previously reported by the Institution with regard to an ongoing PHS-funded research project, the Institution shall provide to the PHS Awarding Component an annual FCOI report that addresses the status of the financial conflict of interest and any changes to the management plan for the duration of the PHS-funded research project. The annual FCOI report shall specify whether the financial conflict is still being managed or explain why the financial conflict of interest no longer exists.
