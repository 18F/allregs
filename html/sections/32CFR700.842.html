The commanding officer of such ship or aircraft shall take no disciplinary action against a passenger not in the naval service, other than that authorized by law. The commanding officer may, when he or

she deems such an action to be necessary for the safety of the ship or aircraft or of any persons embarked, subject a passenger not in the naval service to such restraint as the circumstances require until such time as delivery to the proper authorities is possible. A report of the matter shall be made to an appropriate superior of the passenger.</p>
