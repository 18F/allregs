Among the demands in response to which disclosure will not be authorized by the Chief Counsel are those demands with respect to which any of the following factors exist:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Disclosure would violate a treaty, statute (such as the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905, or the income tax laws, 26 U.S.C. 6103 and 7213), or a rule of procedure, such as the grand jury secrecy rule, Fed.R.Crim.Proc. rule 6(e) (18 U.S.C.App.);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disclosure would violate a specific regulation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disclosure would reveal classified or confidential information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Disclosure would reveal a confidential source or informant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Disclosure would reveal investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, interfere with enforcement proceedings, or disclose investigative techniques and procedures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Disclosure would improperly reveal confidential commercial information without the owner's consent (e.g., entry information);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Disclosure relates to documents which were produced by another agency or entity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Disclosure would unduly interfere with the orderly conduct of CBP business;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> CBP has no interest, records, or other official information regarding the matter in which disclosure is sought;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> There is a failure to make proper service upon the United States; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> There is a failure to comply with federal, state, or local rules of discovery.
