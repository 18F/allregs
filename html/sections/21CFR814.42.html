Within 45 days after a PMA is received by FDA, the  agency will notify the applicant whether the application has been filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If FDA does not find that any of the reasons in paragraph (e) of  this section for refusing to file the PMA applies, the agency will file  the PMA and will notify the applicant in writing of the filing. The  notice will include the PMA reference number and the date FDA filed the  PMA. The date of filing is the date that a PMA accepted for filing was  received by the agency. The 180-day period for review of a PMA starts on  the date of filing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If FDA refuses to file a PMA, the agency will notify the  applicant of the reasons for the refusal. This notice will identify the  deficiencies in the application that prevent filing and will include the  PMA reference number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If FDA refuses to file the PMA, the applicant may:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> (A)-(G) of the act and Sec.  814.20.

FDA will hold the informal conference within 10 working  days of its receipt of the request and will render its decision on  filing within 5 working days after the informal conference. If, after  the informal conference, FDA accepts the PMA for filing, the date of  filing will be the date of the decision to accept the PMA for filing. If  FDA does not reverse its decision not to file the PMA, the applicant may  request reconsideration of the decision from the Director of the Center  for Devices and Radiological Health, the Director of the Center for  Biologics Evaluation and Research, or the Director of the Center for  Drug Evaluation and Research, as applicable. The Director's decision  will constitute final administrative action for the purpose of judicial  review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> FDA may refuse to file a PMA if any of the following applies:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> (A)-(G) of  the act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The PMA does not contain each of the items required under Sec.  814.20 and justification for omission of any item is inadequate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The applicant has a pending premarket notification under section  510(k) of the act with respect to the same device, and FDA has not  determined whether the device falls within the scope of Sec. 814.1(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The PMA contains a false statement of material fact.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The PMA is not accompanied by a statement of either  certification or disclosure as required by part 54 of this chapter.
