                            <p class="depth0">Approved JDs, permit denials, and declined permits associated with  after-the-fact permit applications are appealable actions for the  purposes of this part. If the Corps accepts an after-the-fact permit  application, an administrative appeal of an approved JD, permit denial,  or declined permit may be filed and processed in accordance with these  regulations subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of  this section. An appeal of an approved JD associated with unauthorized  activities will normally not be accepted unless the Corps accepts an  after-the-fact permit application. However, in rare cases, the district  engineer may accept an appeal of such an approved JD, if the district  engineer determines that the interests of justice, fairness, and  administrative efficiency would be served thereby. Furthermore, no such  appeal will be accepted if the unauthorized activity is the subject of a  referral to the Department of Justice or the EPA, or for which the EPA  has the lead enforcement authority or has requested lead enforcement  authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Initial corrective measures. If the district engineer determines  that initial corrective measures are necessary pursuant to 33 CFR  326.3(d), an RFA for an appealable action will not be accepted by the  Corps, until the initial corrective measures have been completed to the  satisfaction of the district engineer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Penalties. If an affected party requests, under this Section, an  administrative appeal of an appealable action prior to the resolution of  the unauthorized activity, and the division engineer determines that the  appeal has no merit, the responsible party remains subject to any civil,  criminal, and administrative penalties as provided by law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Tolling of statute of limitations. Any person who appeals an  approved JD associated with an unauthorized activity or applies for an  after-the-fact permit, where the application is accepted and processed  by the Corps, thereby agrees that the statute of limitations regarding  any violation associated with that approved JD or application is tolled  until one year after the final Corps decision, as defined at  Sec. 331.10. Moreover, the recipient of an approved JD associated with  an unauthorized activity or applicant for an after-the-fact permit must  also memorialize that agreement to toll the statute of limitations, by  signing an agreement to that effect, in exchange for the Corps  acceptance of the after-the-fact permit application, and/or any  administrative appeal (See 33 CFR 326.3(e)(1)(v)). No administrative  appeal associated with an unauthorized activity or after-the-fact permit  application will be accepted until such signed tolling agreement is  furnished to the district engineer.</p>
