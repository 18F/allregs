                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Methods of diversion. Handlers may divert cherries by redeeming grower diversion certificates, by destroying cherries at handlers' facilities (at-plant), by diverting cherry products accidentally or voluntarily destroyed, by donating cherries or cherry products to charitable organizations or by using cherries or cherry products for exempt purposes under Sec. 930.162, including export to countries other than Canada, and Mexico. Once diversion has taken place, handlers will receive diversion certificates stating the weight of cherries diverted. Diversion credit may be used to fulfill any restricted percentage requirement in full or in part. Any information of a confidential and/or proprietary nature included in this application would be held in confidence pursuant to Sec. 930.73 of the order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Board notification and handler plan. Any handler intending to divert cherries or cherry products pursuant to Sec. 930.59 of the order (except through exempt uses under Sec. 930.62 of the order) must notify the Board of such intent and provide a plan by October 1 which shows how the handler intends to meet the restricted percentage obligation, except that, for the 1997-98 season only, the deadline is February 5, 1998. The Board may extend this date in individual cases pursuant to a written request showing good cause why the plan cannot be provided by the due date. A handler will have one year to fulfill such plan. The details of the plan shall include, but not be limited to, the name and address of the handler, the total product processed at-plant, product diverted at-plant, in-orchard diversion certificates to be redeemed, anticipated donations to charitable outlets, disposition to exempt outlets or uses and detailed plans for how and where such disposition will be made, and inventory reserve amount. It shall also contain an agreement that the proposed diversion is to be carried out under the supervision of the Board and that the cost of such supervision is to be paid by the handler. Supervision of diversion by means other than destruction of the cherries at a handler's facility will be subject to supervision as found necessary by the Board. USDA inspectors or Board employees will supervise diversion of cherry products at the current hourly rate under USDA's inspection fee schedule (7 CFR 52.42). Any cherries not diverted in accordance with the handler's plan will be placed into the secondary inventory reserve or the primary inventory reserve if a secondary inventory reserve has not been established.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> At-plant diversion. Diversion by disposal at-plant may take place prior to placing the cherries into the processing line, or after processing, but before a finished product is manufactured. Such diversion will take place under the supervision of USDA Inspection Service or Board employee inspectors. USDA inspectors or Board employees or Board agents will supervise diversion of cherry products at-plant at the current hourly rate under USDA's inspection fee schedule (7 CFR 52.42).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Diversion of finished products. Handlers may be granted diversion credit for finished tart cherry products that are accidentally destroyed or voluntarily destroyed by the handler. To receive diversion credit under this option the cherry products must be owned by the handler at the time of accidental or voluntary destruction, be a marketable product at the time of processing, be included in the handler's end of the year handler plan, and have been assigned a Raw Product Equivalent (RPE) by the handler to determine the volume of cherries. In addition, the accidental or voluntary destruction and disposition of the product must be verified by either a USDA inspector or Board agent or employee who witnesses the disposition of the accidentally or voluntarily destroyed product. Products will be considered as accidentally

destroyed if they sustain damage which renders them unacceptable in normal market channels. Products which are voluntarily destroyed must have deteriorated in condition to such an extent that they are not acceptable for use in normal market channels.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Contributions to approved charitable organizations. When diverting by donating cherries or cherry products to charitable organizations, handlers should follow the requirements specified herein. For contributions to qualify for diversion credit, the contributed product should be marked clearly ``NOT FOR RESALE''. The receiving organization must be approved by the Board as a qualified recipient of contributions of tart cherry products. Such organizations must be tax-exempt, must not sell the donated products and must be noncompetitive with other tart cherry industry sales outlets. Once products are donated to an organization, the Board must receive satisfactory documentation of the transaction. Handlers should provide the Board with information on how the product was used and the volume of product used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Grower diversion certificates. To satisfy restricted percentage obligations by redeeming grower diversion certificates handlers must present to the Board grower diversion certificates obtained from growers who have diverted cherries by non-harvest, and who have been issued diversion certificates by the Board in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations governing the issuance of grower diversion certificates. For this crop year July 1, 1997, through June 30, 1998, grower diversion certificates will be valid until February 5, 1998.
