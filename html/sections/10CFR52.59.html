The Commission shall grant the amendment  request if it determines that the amendment will comply with the Atomic  Energy Act and the Commission's regulations in effect at the time of  renewal. If the amendment request entails such an extensive change to  the design certification that an essentially new standard design is  being proposed, an application for a design certification must be filed  in accordance with this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Denial of renewal does not bar the applicant, or another  applicant, from filing a new application for certification of the  design, which proposes design changes that correct the deficiencies  cited in the denial of the renewal.
