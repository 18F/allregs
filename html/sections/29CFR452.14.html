                            <p class="depth0">The initial selection of officers by newly formed or merged labor organizations is not subject to the requirements of title IV. \15\ Such labor organizations may have temporary or provisional officers serve until a regular election subject to the Act can be scheduled. An election under all the safeguards prescribed in these regulations must be held within a reasonable period after the organization begins to function. What would be a reasonable time for this purpose depends on the circumstances, but after the formation or consolidation of the labor organization, a regular election subject to title IV may not be deferred longer than the statutory period provided for that type of organization. However, when a pre-existing labor organization changes its affiliation without substantially altering its basic structure or identity the terms of its officers may not be extended beyond the maximum period specified by the Act for the type of labor organization involved.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\15\ However, the other provisions of the Act are applicable immediately upon such formation or merger.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
