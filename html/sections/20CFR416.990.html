                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> of the Social Security Act if you  receive benefits based on disability or Sec. 416.986 of this subpart if  you receive benefits based on blindness. In paragraphs (b) through (g)  of this section, we explain when and how often we conduct continuing  disability reviews for most individuals. In paragraph (h) of this  section, we explain special rules for some individuals who are  participating in the Ticket to Work program. In paragraph (i) of this  section, we explain special rules for some individuals who work and have  received social security benefits as well as supplemental security  income payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> When we will conduct a continuing disability review. Except as  provided in paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section, we will start a  continuing disability review if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> You have been scheduled for a medical improvement expected diary  review;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> You have been scheduled for a periodic review (medical  improvement possible or medical improvement not expected) in accordance  with the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> We need a current medical or other report to see if your  disability continues. (This could happen when, for example, an advance  in medical technology, such as improved treatment for Alzheimer's  disease, or a change in vocational therapy or technology raises a  disability issue);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> You return to work;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Substantial earnings are reported to your wage record;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> You tell us that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> You have recovered from your disability; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> You have returned to work;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Your State Vocational Rehabilitation Agency tells us that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The services have been completed; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> You are now working; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> You are able to work;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Someone in a position to know of your physical or mental  condition tells us any of the following, and it appears that the report  could be substantially correct:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> You are not disabled or blind; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> You are not following prescribed treatment; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> You have returned to work; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> You are failing to follow the provisions of the Social Security  Act or these regulations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Evidence we receive raises a question whether your disability or  blindness continues;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> You have been scheduled for a vocational reexamination diary  review; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> By your first birthday, if you are a child whose low birth  weight was a contributing factor material to our determination that you  were disabled; i.e., whether we would have found you disabled if we had  not considered your low birth weight. However, we will conduct your  continuing disability review later if at the time of our initial  determination that you were disabled:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> We determine that you have an impairment that is not expected to  improve by your first birthday; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> We schedule you for a continuing disability review after your  first birthday.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definitions. As used in this section--</p><p class="depth0">Medical improvement expected diary--refers to a case which is  scheduled for review at a later date because the individual's  impairment(s) is expected to improve. Generally, the diary period is set  for not less than 6 months or for not more than 18 months. Examples of  cases likely to be scheduled for medical improvement expected diary are  fractures and cases in which corrective surgery is planned and recovery  can be anticipated.</p><p class="depth0">Permanent impairment--medical improvement not expected--refers to a  case in which any medical improvement in a person's impairment(s) is not  expected. This means an extremely severe condition determined on the  basis of our experience in administering the disability programs to be  at least static, but more likely to be progressively   disabling either by itself or by reason of impairment complications, and  unlikely to improve so as to permit the individual to engage in  substantial gainful activity or, if you are a child, unlikely to improve  to the point that you will no longer have marked and severe functional  limitations. The interaction of the individual's age, impairment  consequences and the lack of recent attachment to the labor market may  also be considered in determining whether an impairment is permanent.  Improvement which is considered temporary under  Sec. 416.994(b)(2)(iv)(D) or Sec. 416.994(c)(2)(iv), as appropriate,  will not be considered in deciding if an impairment is permanent.  Examples of permanent impairments taken from the list contained in our  other written guidelines which are available for public review are as  follows and are not intended to be all inclusive:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Parkinsonian Syndrome which has reached the level of severity  necessary to meet the Listing in appendix 1 of subpart P or part 404 of  this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis which has reached the level of  severity necessary to meet the Listing in appendix 1 of subpart P of  part 404 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Diffuse pulmonary fibrosis in an individual age 55 or over which  has reached the level of severity necessary to meet the Listing in  appendix 1 of subpart P of part 404 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Amputation of leg at hip.</p><p class="depth0">Nonpermanent impairment--refers to a case in which any medical  improvement in the person's impairment(s) is possible. This means an  impairment for which improvement cannot be predicted based on current  experience and the facts of the particular case but which is not at the  level of severity of an impairment that is considered permanent.  Examples of nonpermanent impairments are: Regional enteritis,  hyperthyroidism, and chronic ulcerative colitis.</p><p class="depth0">Vocational reexamination diary--refers to a case which is scheduled  for review at a later date because the individual is undergoing  vocational therapy, training or an educational program which may improve  his or her ability to work so that the disability or blindness  requirement of the law is no longer met. Generally, the diary period  will be set for the length of the training, therapy, or program of  education.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Frequency of review. If your impairment is expected to improve,  generally we will review your continuing eligibility for payments based  on disability or blindness at intervals from 6 months to 18 months  following our most recent decision. Our notice to you about the review  of your case will tell you more precisely when the review will be  conducted. If your disability is not considered permanent but is such  that any medical improvement in your impairment(s) cannot be accurately  predicted, we will review your continuing eligibility for payments at  least once every 3 years. If your disability is considered permanent, we  will review your continuing eligibility for payments no less frequently  than once every 7 years but no more frequently than once every 5 years.  Regardless of your classification we will conduct an immediate  continuing disability review if a question of continuing disability is  raised pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Change in classification of impairment. If the evidence  developed during a continuing disability review demonstrates that your  impairment has improved, is expected to improve, or has worsened since  the last review, we may reclassify your impairment to reflect this  change in severity. A change in the classification of your impairment  will change the frequency with which we will review your case. We may  also reclassify certain impairments because of improved tests,  treatment, and other technical advances concerning those impairments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Review after administrative appeal. If you were found eligible  to receive or to continue to receive, payments on the basis of a  decision by an administrative law judge, the Appeals Council or a  Federal court, we will not conduct a continuing disability review  earlier than 3 years after that decision unless your case should be  scheduled for a medical improvement expected or vocational reexamination  diary review or a question of continuing disability is raised pursuant  to paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Waiver of timeframes. All cases involving a nonpermanent  impairment will be reviewed by us at least once every 3 years unless we,  after consultation with the State agency, determine that the requirement  should be waived to ensure that only the appropriate number of cases are  reviewed. The appropriate number of cases to be reviewed is to be based  on such considerations as the backlog of pending reviews, the projected  number of new applications, and projected staffing levels. Such waiver  shall be given only after good faith effort on the part of the State to  meet staffing requirements and to process the reviews on a timely basis.  Availability of independent medical resources may also be a factor. A  waiver in this context refers to our administrative discretion to  determine the appropriate number of cases to be reviewed on a State by  State basis. Therefore, your continuing disability review may be delayed  longer than 3 years following our original decision or other review  under certain circumstances. Such a delay would be based on our need to  ensure that backlogs, reviews required to be performed by the Social  Security Disability Benefits Reform Act (Pub. L. 98-460), and new  disability claims workloads are accomplished within available medical  and other resources in the State agency and that such reviews are done  carefully and accurately.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> If you are participating in the Ticket to Work program. If you  are participating in the Ticket to Work program, we will not start a  continuing disability review during the period in which you are using a  ticket. See subpart C of part 411 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If you are working and have received social security disability  benefits for at least 24 months--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. Notwithstanding the  provisions in paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), (b)(6)(ii), (b)(7)(ii), and  (b)(8)(iii) of this section, we will not start a continuing disability  review based solely on your work activity if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> You are currently entitled to disability insurance benefits as a  disabled worker, child's insurance benefits based on disability, or  widow's or widower's insurance benefits based on disability under title  II of the Social Security Act (see subpart D of part 404 of this  chapter); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> You have received such benefits for at least 24 months (see  paragraph (i)(2) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The 24-month requirement. (i) The months for which you have  actually received disability insurance benefits as a disabled worker,  child's insurance benefits based on disability, or widow's or widower's  insurance benefits based on disability that you were due under title II  of the Social Security Act, or for which you have constructively  received such benefits, will count for the 24-month requirement under  paragraph </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(1)(ii)</em> of this section, regardless of whether the months  were consecutive. We will consider you to have constructively received a  benefit for a month for purposes of the 24-month requirement if you were  otherwise due a social security disability benefit for that month and  your monthly benefit was withheld to recover an overpayment. Any month  for which you were entitled to social security disability benefits but  for which you did not actually or constructively receive a benefit  payment will not be counted for the 24-month requirement. Months for  which your social security disability benefits are continued under  Sec. 404.1597a pending reconsideration and/or a hearing before an  administrative law judge on a medical cessation determination will not  be counted for the 24-month requirement. Months for which you received  only supplemental security income payments will not be counted for the  24-month requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In determining whether paragraph (i)(1) of this section  applies, we consider whether you have received disability insurance  benefits as a disabled worker, child's insurance benefits based on  disability, or widow's or widower's insurance benefits based on  disability under title II of the Social Security Act for at least 24  months as of the date on which we start a continuing disability review.  For purposes of this provision, the date on which we start a continuing  disability review is the date on the notice we send you that tells you  that we are beginning to review your disability case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When we may start a continuing disability review even if you  have received   social security disability benefits for at least 24 months. Even if you  meet the requirements of paragraph (i)(1) of this section, we may still  start a continuing disability review for a reason(s) other than your  work activity. We may start a continuing disability review if we have  scheduled you for a periodic review of your continuing disability, we  need a current medical or other report to see if your disability  continues, we receive evidence which raises a question as to whether  your disability or blindness continues, or you fail to follow the  provisions of the Social Security Act or these regulations. For example,  we will start a continuing disability review when you have been  scheduled for a medical improvement expected diary review, and we may  start a continuing disability review if you failed to report your work  to us.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Erroneous start of the continuing disability review. If we start  a continuing disability review based solely on your work activity that  results in a medical cessation determination, we will vacate the medical  cessation determination if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(1)</em> of this section as of the date of the  start of your continuing disability review and that the start of the  review was erroneous; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> We receive the evidence within 12 months of the date of the  notice of the initial determination of medical cessation.
