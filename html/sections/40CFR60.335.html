                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The owner or operator shall conduct the performance tests  required in Sec. 60.8, using either</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> EPA Method 20,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ASTM D6522-00 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 60.17), or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> EPA Method 7E and either EPA Method 3 or 3A in appendix A to  this part, to determine NOX and diluent concentration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Sampling traverse points are to be selected following Method 20  or Method 1, (non-particulate procedures) and sampled for equal time  intervals. The sampling shall be performed with a traversing single-hole  probe or, if feasible, with a stationary multi-hole probe that samples  each of the points sequentially. Alternatively, a multi-hole probe  designed and documented to sample equal volumes from each hole may be  used to sample simultaneously at the required points.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the owner or  operator may test at few points than are specified in Method 1 or Method  20 if the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You may perform a stratification test for NOX and  diluent pursuant to</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The procedures specified in section 6.5.6.1(a) through (e)  appendix A to part 75 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Once the stratification sampling is completed, the owner or  operator may use the following alternative sample point selection  criteria for the performance test:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If each of the individual traverse point NOX  concentrations, normalized to 15 percent O2, is within 10  percent of the mean normalized concentration for all traverse points,  then you may use 3 points (located either 16.7, 50.0, and 83.3 percent  of the way across the stack or duct, or, for circular stacks or ducts  greater than 2.4 meters (7.8 feet) in diameter, at 0.4, 1.2, and 2.0  meters from the wall). The 3 points shall be located along the  measurement line that exhibited the highest average normalized  NOX concentration during the stratification test; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If each of the individual traverse point NOX  concentrations, normalized to 15 percent O2, is within 5  percent of the mean normalized concentration for all traverse points,  then you may sample at a single point, located at least 1 meter from the  stack wall or at the stack centroid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Other acceptable alternative reference methods and procedures  are given in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the  applicable nitrogen oxides emission limitation in Sec. 60.332 and shall  meet the performance test requirements of Sec. 60.8 as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each run of the performance test, the mean nitrogen oxides  emission concentration (NOXo) corrected to 15 percent  O2 shall be corrected to ISO standard conditions using the  following equation. Notwithstanding this requirement, use of the ISO  correction equation is optional for: Lean premix stationary combustion  turbines; units used in association with heat recovery steam generators  (HRSG) equipped with duct burners; and units equipped with add-on  emission control devices:  NOX = (NOXo)(Pr/Po)\0.5\  e19 (Ho-0.00633) (288 [deg]K/Ta)\1.53\  Where:  NOX = emission concentration of NOX at 15 percent</p><p class="depth3">O2 and ISO standard ambient conditions, ppm by</p><p class="depth3">volume, dry basis, NOXo = mean observed NOX concentration, ppm by</p><p class="depth3">volume, dry basis, at 15 percent O2, Pr = reference combustor inlet absolute pressure at 101.3  kilopascals ambient pressure. Alternatively, you may use 760 mm Hg  (29.92 in Hg), Po = observed combustor inlet absolute pressure at test, mm  Hg. Alternatively, you may use the barometric pressure for the date of  the test, Ho = observed humidity of ambient air, g H2O/g</p><p class="depth3">air, e = transcendental constant, 2.718, and Ta = ambient temperature, [deg]K.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The 3-run performance test required by Sec. 60.8 must be  performed within 5 percent at 30, 50, 75, and 90-to-100 percent of peak  load or at four evenly-spaced load points in the normal operating range  of the gas turbine, including the minimum point in the   operating range and 90-to-100 percent of peak load, or at the highest  achievable load point if 90-to-100 percent of peak load cannot be  physically achieved in practice. If the turbine combusts both oil and  gas as primary or backup fuels, separate performance testing is required  for each fuel. Notwithstanding these requirements, performance testing  is not required for any emergency fuel (as defined in Sec. 60.331).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For a combined cycle turbine system with supplemental heat (duct  burner), the owner or operator may elect to measure the turbine  NOX emissions after the duct burner rather than directly  after the turbine. If the owner or operator elects to use this  alternative sampling location, the applicable NOX emission  limit in Sec. 60.332 for the combustion turbine must still be met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If water or steam injection is used to control NOX  with no additional post-combustion NOX control and the owner  or operator chooses to monitor the steam or water to fuel ratio in  accordance with Sec. 60.334(a), then that monitoring system must be  operated concurrently with each EPA Method 20, ASTM D6522-00  (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 60.17), or EPA Method 7E run and  shall be used to determine the fuel consumption and the steam or water  to fuel ratio necessary to comply with the applicable Sec. 60.332  NOX emission limit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the owner operator elects to claim an emission allowance for  fuel bound nitrogen as described in Sec. 60.332, then concurrently with  each reference method run, a representative sample of the fuel used  shall be collected and analyzed, following the applicable procedures  described in Sec. 60.335(b)(9). These data shall be used to determine  the maximum fuel nitrogen content for which the established water (or  steam) to fuel ratio will be valid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the owner or operator elects to install a CEMS, the  performance evaluation of the CEMS may either be conducted separately  (as described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section) or as part of the  initial performance test of the affected unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If the owner or operator elects to install and certify a  NOX CEMS under Sec. 60.334(e), then the initial performance  test required under Sec. 60.8 may be done in the following alternative  manner:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Perform a minimum of 9 reference method runs, with a minimum  time per run of 21 minutes, at a single load level, between 90 and 100  percent of peak (or the highest physically achievable) load.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use the test data both to demonstrate compliance with the  applicable NOX emission limit under Sec. 60.332 and to  provide the required reference method data for the RATA of the CEMS  described under Sec. 60.334(b).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The requirement to test at three additional load levels is  waived.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If the owner or operator elects under Sec. 60.334(f) to monitor  combustion parameters or parameters indicative of proper operation of  NOX emission controls, the appropriate parameters shall be  continuously monitored and recorded during each run of the initial  performance test, to establish acceptable operating ranges, for purposes  of the parameter monitoring plan for the affected unit, as specified in  Sec. 60.334(g).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> To determine the fuel bound nitrogen content of fuel being fired  (if an emission allowance is claimed for fuel bound nitrogen), the owner  or operator may use equipment and procedures meeting the requirements  of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For liquid fuels, ASTM D2597-94 (Reapproved 1999), D6366-99,  D4629-02, D5762-02 (all of which are incorporated by reference, see  Sec. 60.17); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For gaseous fuels, shall use analytical methods and procedures  that are accurate to within 5 percent of the instrument range and are  approved by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> If the owner or operator is required under Sec. 60.334(i)(1)  or (3) to periodically determine the sulfur content of the fuel  combusted in the turbine, a minimum of three fuel samples shall be  collected during the performance test. Analyze the samples for the total  sulfur content of the fuel using:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For liquid fuels, ASTM D129-00, D2622-98, D4294-02, D1266-98,  D5453-00 or D1552-01 (all of which are incorporated by reference, see  Sec. 60.17); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For gaseous fuels, ASTM D1072-80, 90 (Reapproved 1994); D3246- 81, 92, 96; D4468-85 (Reapproved 2000); or D6667-01 (all of which are  incorporated by reference, see Sec. 60.17). The applicable   ranges of some ASTM methods mentioned above are not adequate to measure  the levels of sulfur in some fuel gases. Dilution of samples before  analysis (with verification of the dilution ratio) may be used, subject  to the prior approval of the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> The fuel analyses required under paragraphs (b)(9) and (b)(10)  of this section may be performed by the owner or operator, a service  contractor retained by the owner or operator, the fuel vendor, or any  other qualified agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The owner or operator may use the following as alternatives to  the reference methods and procedures specified in this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this  section, manufacturers may develop ambient condition correction factors  to adjust the nitrogen oxides emission level measured by the performance  test as provided in Sec. 60.8 to ISO standard day conditions.
