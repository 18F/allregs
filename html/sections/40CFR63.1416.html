                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Data retention. Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, each owner or operator of an affected source shall keep copies of all applicable records and reports required by this subpart for at least 5 years, as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, with the exception listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All applicable records shall be maintained in such a manner that they can be readily accessed.

The remaining 4 and one-half years of records may be retained offsite. Records may be maintained in hard copy or computer-readable form including, but not limited to, on paper, microfilm, computer, floppy disk, CD-ROM, optical disc, magnetic tape, or microfiche.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If an owner or operator submits copies of reports to the appropriate EPA Regional Office, the owner or operator is not required to maintain copies of reports. If the EPA Regional Office has waived the requirement of Sec.  63.10(a)(4)(ii) for submittal of copies of reports, the owner or operator is not required to maintain copies of those reports.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Malfunction records.

The calculated average shall cover a 24-hour period if operation is continuous, or the number of hours of operation per operating day if operation is not continuous for daily average values or batch cycle daily average values. The calculated average shall cover the entire period of the batch cycle for block average values.

alert in an operating day or block constitute a single occurrence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The monitoring system generates, updated at least hourly throughout each operating day, a running average of the parameter values that have been obtained during that operating day or block, and the capability to observe this running average is readily available on-site to the Administrator during the operating day.

the daily average, batch cycle daily average, or block average value for any operating day when the daily average, batch cycle daily average, or block average value is less than the maximum or greater than the minimum established limit. With approval by the Administrator, monitoring data generated prior to the compliance date of this subpart shall be credited toward the period of 6 consecutive months if the parameter limit and the monitoring accomplished during the period prior to the compliance date were required and/or approved by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the owner or operator elects not to retain the daily average, batch cycle daily average, or block average values, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in the next Periodic Report as specified in Sec.  63.1417(f)(11).
