                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Each interstate pipeline listed in Sec. 281.202  shall file tariff sheets, in accordance with Sec. 154.4 of this  chapter, including an index of entitlements, which provides that if the  interstate pipeline is in curtailment, natural gas will be delivered in  accordance with the provisions of this subpart. If the interstate  pipeline has curtailment provisions in its currently effective tariff,  the tariff sheets or sections shall amend the existing curtailment  provisions. If the interstate pipeline has no curtailment plan in its  currently effective tariff, when it files tariff sheets or sections to  amend its currently effective tariff to include a curtailment plan such  curtailment plan shall comply with the requirements of this subpart. The  tariff sheets or sections shall be filed no later than October 1, 1979,  with a proposed effective date of November 1, 1979. The Data  Verification Committee report prepared in accordance with Sec. 281.213  shall be filed with the tariff sheets.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Index of entitlements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The index of entitlements for an  interstate pipeline shall identify the natural gas entitlements in  priority of service categories 1 and 2 (established in accordance with  Sec. 281.205(a)) for each direct sale customer, each local distribution  company customer and each interstate pipeline purchaser on a daily,  monthly, seasonal or other periodic basis used in the currently  effective curtailment plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Periodic update. Each interstate pipeline shall update its index  of entitlements annually to reflect changes in Priority 2 entitlements.  The new index of requirements shall be filed on September 15 of each  year with a proposed effective date of November 1, except that if the  interstate pipeline uses a rolling base period in its currently  effective curtailment plan it shall file its new index of entitlements  on the date upon which other end-uses of the customers of the interstate  pipeline are updated in accordance with the currently effective tariff.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Alternative fuel determination. The index of entitlements shall  not include the volumes of natural gas for which volumes the essential  agricultural user has the ability to use an alternative fuel, as  determined under Subpart C of this part. Each interstate pipeline shall  amend its index of entitlements pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this  section to remove from the priority 2 entitlements and place in an  appropriate priority of service category any such volumes or natural gas  included in any index of entitlements that is effective on or after  October 31, 1979.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other tariff provisions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Every tariff filed under this  subpart shall contain provisions that will require the interstate  pipeline:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To provide for deliveries of sufficient volumes of natural gas  to respond to emergency situations (including environmental emergencies)  during periods of curtailment where additional supplies are required to  forestall irreparable injury to life or to property; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To provide for deliveries of sufficient volumes of natural gas  to provide for minimum plant protection when the plant is shut down.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Volumetric delivery requirements. Notwithstanding any other  provisions of this subpart, an interstate pipeline which is delivering  natural gas in accordance with this subpart shall not be required to  deliver to any customer volumes of natural gas on a daily, monthly,  seasonal or other periodic basis which exceed the volumes of natural gas  that the interstate pipeline may deliver to such customer without  causing the interstate pipeline to violate any daily, monthly, seasonal  or other periodic volumetric limitations   established in the contract between the interstate pipeline and such  customer.
