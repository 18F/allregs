                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> HUD may change a participating agency's status to inactive, in lieu of terminations of HUD-approved status or removals from the list of HUD-approved agencies, under certain circumstances that may temporarily impair an agency from complying with its housing counseling plan. An agency's status may be changed to inactive on a case-by-case basis for a period not to exceed 6 months, unless an extension is provided by HUD under paragraph (d) of this section. HUD may change an agency's status through either a request submitted to HUD or as a result of information obtained by the Department. Some of the conditions under which inactive status may be considered include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Loss of counselor(s);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Damage to facilities by natural disasters that renders the agency unable to function properly;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Loss of funds;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Relocation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Other circumstances caused by reasons beyond the agency's control; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Results of performance review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Agencies that seek temporary inactive status must submit a request to HUD in writing. Documentation or evidence of the condition(s) that rendered the agency incapable of carrying out its housing counseling plan must be submitted along with the request, if possible. Upon receipt of the request, HUD will review and notify the agency of approval or rejection, in writing. If approved, the agency's name and contact information will be temporarily removed from the HUD-approved Web list of agencies and the telephone referral system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The agency must notify HUD in writing and provide supporting documentation or evidence when it is ready to resume operation, or no later than the end of the inactive period. After review and acceptance by HUD, the agency's contact information may be restored to the Web list of HUD-approved and participating agencies and the telephone referral system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> At HUD's discretion, if the condition(s) still exists, an extension of the inactive period may be considered or the agency may be terminated or removed from the Housing Counseling program. HUD will notify the agency in writing of its decision.</p>
