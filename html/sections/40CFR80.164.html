                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)(iii)</em> are contained in Sec. 80.177.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Quantitative specifications for the four basic fuel parameters,  provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section,   refer to the levels of these parameters in the base gasoline prior to  the addition of any oxygenate. The levels of the basic fuel parameters  must be measured in accordance with applicable procedures in Sec. 80.46.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Oxygenate components of certification test fuels must be of fuel  grade quality. The type and amount of oxygenate to be blended into the  test fuel (if any) shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To certify a detergent for generic use (i.e., for use in  gasoline containing any oxygenate compound, as well as for use in  nonoxygenated gasoline), the finished test fuel shall contain ethanol at  10 volume percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To certify a detergent specifically for use in nonoxygenated  gasoline, no oxygenate compounds shall be added to the test fuel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> To certify a detergent specifically for use in gasoline  blended with a specified oxygenate compound other than ethanol, the  specified oxygenate must be added to the test fuel in an amount such  that the finished fuel contains the oxygenate at the highest  concentration at which the specific oxygenate may be used in in-use  gasoline.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> No detergent-active substance other than the detergent additive  package undergoing testing may be added to a certification test fuel.  Typical nondetergent additives, such as antioxidants, corrosion  inhibitors, and metal deactivators, may be present in the test fuel at  the discretion of the additive certifier. In addition, any nondetergent  additives (other than oxygenate compounds) which are commonly blended  into gasoline and which are known or suspected to affect IVD or PFID  formation, or to reduce the ability of the detergent in question to  control such deposits, should be added to the test fuel for  certification testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Certification test requirements may be satisfied for a detergent  additive using more than one batch of test fuel, provided that each  batch satisfies all applicable test fuel requirements under this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Unless otherwise required by this section, finished test fuels  must conform to the requirements for commercial gasoline described in  ASTM D 4814-95c, ``Standard Specification for Automotive Spark-Ignition  Engine Fuel'', which is incorporated by reference.

The source of such samples must be  normally-operating gasoline production or distribution facilities  located in the U.S. Samples must not be drawn from a segregated gasoline  pool that is or will be covered by a fuel-specific certification under  Sec. 80.163(c) on the date when the certification information under this  option is submitted to EPA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> To be eligible for use in detergent additive certification  testing, in addition to the specifications above, national and PADD test  fuels which are specially formulated from refinery blend stocks must  themselves undergo testing to demonstrate their deposit-forming  tendency. For this purpose, the unadditized, nonoxygenated test fuel  must be subjected to the IVD control test procedure described in  Sec. 80.165(b). At the discretion of the tester, the duration of the  demonstration test may be less than 10,000 miles, provided the results  satisfy the standard of this paragraph. In order to qualify for use in  certification testing, the formulated fuel's test results must meet or  exceed the values shown in Table 4 for the relevant certification  option. If the demonstration test results do not meet these criteria,  then the formulated fuel may not be used for detergent certification  testing.</p><p class="depth0">Table 4--IVD Demonstration Test Criteria ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Minimum required deposit level in IVD demonstration test (mg/valve, average)</p><p class="depth0">Certification option        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">National      PADD 1       PADD 2       PADD 3       PADD 4       PADD 5 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Generic...........................          290          290          260          290          260          260 Premium...........................          260          260          235          260          235          235 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Fuel-specific certification test fuels. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Test fuels required  for fuel-specific certification must contain levels of each of the four  basic fuel parameters (aromatics, olefins, T-90, and fuel sulfur) at no  less than their respective 65th percentile values in the segregated  gasoline pool for which the detergent certification is sought in  accordance with Sec. 80.163(c). These values must be determined by the  certifier as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> At least once monthly for at least one complete year prior to  the certification, the certifier must measure the levels of the required  parameters in   representative fuel samples contributed to the segregated gasoline pool  by each participating refinery, terminal, or other fuel production or  distribution facility. The fuel parameters must be measured in  accordance with the test procedures in Sec. 80.46. If the applicability  of the fuel-specific certification is to be limited to premium gasoline,  then the required fuel compositional data must be collected only from  samples of premium gasoline.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The fuel composition survey results, weighted according to the  percentage of gasoline contributed to the segregated gasoline pool from  each participating facility, shall be used to construct a percentile  distribution of the measured values for each of the fuel parameters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Data from more than one year may be used to construct the  required statistical distribution provided that only the total data from  complete consecutive years is used and that all survey data must have  been collected within three years of the date the certification  information is submitted to EPA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> At the discretion of the certifier, other fuel parameters may  be used to define the certification test fuels in addition to the four  required parameters. To be taken into account by EPA in case of  confirmatory testing pursuant to Sec. 80.167, such additional parameters  must be surveyed and analyzed according to the same requirements  applicable to the four standard parameters. In addition, any optional  parameters must be measured using test procedures which conform to  reasonable and customary standards of repeatability and reproducibility,  and reasonable and customary limits of detection and accuracy for the  type of test procedure or analytic procedure in question.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Using the percentile distributions calculated from the survey  data for the four required parameters and any additional discretionary  parameters, the 65th percentile value for each such parameter shall be  determined. Prior to the addition of any oxygenate compound, the fuel- specific certification test fuel shall contain each specified parameter  at a level or concentration no less than this 65th percentile value.  Test fuel oxygenate requirements for generic, nonoxygenate, and  oxygenate-specific certification suboptions are specified in paragraph  (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fuel-specific certification test fuels must either be formulated  to specification from the same refinery blend stocks which are normally  used to blend the gasolines included in the subject gasoline pool, or  drawn from the finished fuel supplies which contribute to this pool of  gasoline. Fuel-specific certification test fuels need not undergo an IVD  demonstration test prior to use in certification testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The certifier must submit an annual report to EPA within 30 days  of the anniversary of the initial certification effective date. Failure  to submit the annual report by the required date will invalidate the  fuel-specific certification and may subject the certifier to liability  and penalties under Sec. Sec. 80.169 and 80.172. The purpose of the  annual report is to update the information on the composition of the  segregated gasoline pool that was characterized by the initial fuel  survey.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i),(ii)</em>,  and (iv) of this section must be repeated, using data for the most  current twelve-month period from each of the production/distribution  facilities that contributed to the original fuel survey.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The annual report must present the percentile distributions for  each fuel parameter as determined from the new survey data and, for each  measured fuel parameter, must compare the newly determined 50th  percentile value with the 60th percentile value for that parameter as  determined in the original fuel survey.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the new 50th percentile level for any fuel parameter is  greater than or equal to the 60th percentile level reported in the  initial certification, then the fuel-specific certification is no longer  valid. In such instance, the certifier must immediately discontinue the  sale and use of the subject detergent under the conditions of the fuel- specific certification and must immediately notify any downstream  customers/recipients of the subject detergent that the certification is  no longer   valid and that their use of the detergent must discontinue within seven  days. To avoid liability and penalties under Sec. Sec. 80.169 and  80.172, the certifier must take these remedial steps within 45 days of  the anniversary of the original fuel-specific certification. Downstream  customers/recipients must discontinue usage of the detergent within  seven days of receipt of notification of the detergent's invalidity to  avoid such liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The fuel composition survey results which support the original  test fuel specifications and the annual statistical analyses, along with  related documentation on test methods and statistical procedures, shall  be retained by the certifier for a period of at least five years, and  shall be made available to EPA upon request.
