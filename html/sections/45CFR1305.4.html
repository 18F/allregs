(1) A pregnant woman or a child is eligible, if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The family's income is equal to or below the poverty line; or,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The family is eligible or, in the absence of child care, would be potentially eligible for public assistance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the family's income is above the poverty line, a program may enroll a pregnant woman or a child who would benefit from services. These participants can only make up to 10 percent of a program's enrollment in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Additional allowances for programs. (1) A program may enroll an additional 35 percent of participants whose families are neither income nor categorically eligible and whose family incomes are below 130 percent of the poverty line, if the program:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Establishes and implements outreach, and enrollment policies and procedures to ensure it is meeting the needs of income or categorically eligible pregnant women, children, and children with disabilities, before serving ineligible pregnant women or children; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Establishes criteria that ensures eligible pregnant women and children are served first.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If a program chooses to enroll participants, who are neither income nor categorically eligible, and whose family incomes are between 100 and 130 percent of the poverty line, it must be able to report to the Head Start Regional Program Office:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> How it is meeting the needs of low-income families or families potentially eligible for public assistance, homeless children, and children in foster care, and include local demographic data on these populations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Outreach and enrollment policies and procedures that ensure it is meeting the needs of income eligible or categorically eligible children or pregnant women, before serving over-income children or pregnant women;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Efforts, including outreach, to be fully enrolled with income eligible or categorically eligible pregnant women or children;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Policies, procedures, and selection criteria it uses to serve eligible children;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Its current enrollment and its enrollment for the previous year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The number of pregnant women and children served, disaggregated by whether they are either income or categorically eligible or meet the over-income requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The eligibility criteria category of each child on the program's waiting list.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Additional Allowances for Indian tribes. (1) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a tribal Head Start or Early Head Start program may fill more than10 percent of its enrollment with participants whose family incomes exceed the low-income guidelines or who are not categorically eligible, if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The program has served all pregnant women or children who wish to be enrolled from Indian and non-Indian families living on the reservation who either meet low-income guidelines or who are categorically eligible;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The program has served all pregnant women or children who wish to be enrolled from income-eligible or categorically-eligible Indian families native to the reservation, but living in non-reservation areas the tribe has approved as part of its service area;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The tribe has resources within its grant or from other non-Federal sources, without using additional funds from HHS intended to expand Early Head Start or Head Start services, to enroll pregnant women or children whose family incomes exceed low-income guidelines or who are not categorically eligible; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> At least 51 percent of the program's participants are either income or categorically eligible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If another Early Head Start or Head Start program does not serve a non-reservation area, the program
