Applicants that begin construction pursuant to this section before receiving an authorization do so at their own risk and have no recourse against the United States for any losses resulting from:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applications that are not granted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Errors or delays in issuing Public Notices;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Having to alter, relocate or dismantle the facility; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Incurring whatever costs may be necessary to bring the facility into compliance with applicable laws, or FCC rules and orders.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Conditions.

marking and lighting specifications (FCC Form 854R) from the FCC for the proposed construction or alteration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The applicant has indicated in the application that the proposed facility would not have a significant environmental effect, in accordance with Sec. Sec. 1.1301 through 1.1319 of this chapter; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Under applicable international agreements and rules in this part, individual coordination of the proposed channel assignment(s) with a foreign administration is not required.
