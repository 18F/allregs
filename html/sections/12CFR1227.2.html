                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of this part:</p><p class="depth0">Administrative sanction means debarment or suspension imposed by any Federal agency, or any similar administrative action that has the effect of limiting the ability of a person to do business with a Federal agency, including Limited Denials of Participation, Temporary Denials of Participation, or settlements of proposed administrative sanctions if the terms of the settlement restrict the person's ability to do

business with the Federal agency in question.</p><p class="depth0">Affiliate means a party that either controls or is controlled by another person, whether directly or indirectly, including one or more persons that are controlled by the same third person.</p><p class="depth0">Conviction means:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> A judgment or any other determination of guilt of a criminal offense by any court of competent jurisdiction, whether entered upon a verdict or plea; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Any other resolution that is the functional equivalent of a judgment of guilt of a criminal offense, including probation before judgment and deferred prosecution. A disposition without the participation of the court is the functional equivalent of a judgment only if it includes an admission of guilt.</p><p class="depth0">Covered misconduct means:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Any conviction or administrative sanction within the past three (3) years if the basis of such action involved fraud, embezzlement, theft, conversion, forgery, bribery, perjury, making false statements or claims, tax evasion, obstruction of justice, or any similar offense, in each case in connection with a mortgage, mortgage business, mortgage securities or other lending product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> FHFA may impute covered misconduct among affiliates as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Conduct imputed from an individual to an organization. FHFA may impute the covered misconduct of any officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other individual associated with an organization, to that organization when the conduct occurred in connection with the individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of that organization, or with the organization's knowledge, approval, or acquiescence. The organization's acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Conduct imputed from an organization to an individual, or between individuals. FHFA may impute the covered misconduct of any organization to an individual, or from one individual to another individual, if the individual to whom the conduct is imputed either participated in, had knowledge of, or had reason to know of the conduct.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> Conduct imputed from one organization to another organization. FHFA may impute the covered misconduct of one organization to another organization when the conduct occurred in connection with a partnership, joint venture, joint application, association, or similar arrangement, or when the organization to whom the conduct is imputed has the power to direct, manage, control, or influence the activities of the organization responsible for the conduct. Acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval, or acquiescence and hence is a basis for imputation of conduct.</p><p class="depth3">Covered transaction means a contract, agreement, or financial or business relationship between a regulated entity and a person and any affiliates thereof.</p><p class="depth3">Person means an individual, sole proprietor, partnership, corporation, unincorporated association, trust, joint venture, pool, syndicate, organization, or other entity.</p><p class="depth3">Respondent means a person and any affiliate thereof that is the subject of a proposed or final suspension order.</p><p class="depth3">Suspending official means the Director, or any other FHFA official with delegated authority to sign proposed and final suspension orders and their accompanying notices.</p><p class="depth3">Suspension means an action taken by a suspending official pursuant to a final suspension order that requires a regulated entity to cease or refrain from engaging in any covered transactions with a person and any affiliates thereof for a specified period of time or permanently.</p>
