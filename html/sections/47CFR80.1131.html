                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In a terrestrial system the announcement of the urgency message  must be made on one or more of the distress and safety calling  frequencies specified in Sec. 80.1077 using digital selective calling  and the urgency call format. A separate announcement need not be made if  the urgency message is to be transmitted through the maritime mobile- satellite service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The urgency signal and message must be transmitted on one or  more of   the distress and safety traffic frequencies specified in Sec. 80.1077,  or via the maritime mobile-satellite service or on other frequencies  used for this purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The urgency signal consists of the words PAN PAN. In  radiotelephony each word of the group must be pronounced as the French  word ``panne''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The urgency call format and the urgency signal indicate that the  calling station has a very urgent message to transmit concerning the  safety of a mobile unit or a person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In radiotelephony, the urgency message must be preceded by the  urgency signal, repeated three times, and the identification of the  transmitting station.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In narrow-band direct-printing, the urgency message must be  preceded by the urgency signal and the identification of the  transmitting station.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The urgency call format or urgency signal must be sent only on  the authority of the master or the person responsible for the mobile  unit carrying the mobile station or mobile earth station.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The urgency call format or the urgency signal may be transmitted  by a land station or a coast earth station with the approval of the  responsible authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> When an urgency message which calls for action by the stations  receiving the message has been transmitted, the station responsible for  its transmission must cancel it as soon as it knows that action is no  longer necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Error correction techniques, in accordance with ITU-R M.625-3  (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 80.7), as specified in Sec.  80.1101, must be used for urgency messages by direct-printing  telegraphy. All messages must be preceded by at least one carriage  return, a line feed signal, a letter shift signal, and the urgency  signal PAN PAN.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Urgency communications by direct-printing telegraphy should be  in the ARQ mode when communicating directly to the Coast Guard or other  coast stations on channels which they normally guard. Other distress  communications, including those on simplex channels provided for that  purpose, should be in the broadcast forward error correction mode. The  ARQ mode may subsequently be used when it is advantageous to do so.  [57 FR 9065, Mar. 16, 1992, as amended at 68 FR 46981, Aug. 7, 2003; 76  FR 67618, Nov. 2, 2011]</p>
