                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A consumer reporting agency shall not circumvent or evade treatment as a ``consumer reporting agency that compiles and maintains files on consumers on a nationwide basis,'' as defined under section 603(p) of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681a(p), by any means, including, but not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Corporate organization, reorganization, structure, or restructuring, including merger, acquisition, dissolution, divestiture, or asset sale of a consumer reporting agency; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Maintaining or merging public record and credit account information in a manner that is substantially equivalent to that described in Paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 603(p) of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681a(p).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Circumvention through reorganization by data type. XYZ Inc. is a consumer reporting agency that compiles and maintains files on consumers on a nationwide basis. It restructures its operations so that public record information is assembled and maintained only by its corporate affiliate, ABC Inc. XYZ continues operating as a consumer reporting agency but ceases to comply with the FCRA obligations of a consumer reporting agency that compiles and maintains files on consumers on a nationwide basis, asserting that it no longer meets the definition found in FCRA section 603(p), because it no longer maintains public record information. XYZ's conduct is a circumvention or evasion of treatment as a consumer reporting agency that compiles and maintains files on consumers on a nationwide basis, and thus violates this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Circumvention through reorganization by regional operations. PDQ Inc. is a consumer reporting agency that compiles and maintains files on consumers on a nationwide basis. It restructures its operations so that corporate affiliates separately assemble and maintain all information on consumers residing in each state. PDQ continues to operate as a consumer reporting agency but ceases to comply with the FCRA obligations of a consumer reporting agency that compiles and maintains files on consumers on a nationwide basis, asserting that it no longer meets the definition found in FCRA section 603(p), because it no longer operates on a nationwide basis. PDQ's conduct is a circumvention or evasion of treatment as a consumer reporting agency that compiles and maintains files on consumers on a nationwide basis, and thus violates this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Circumvention by a newly formed entity. Smith Co. is a new entrant in the marketplace for consumer reports that bear on a consumer's credit worthiness, standing and capacity. Smith Co. organizes itself into two affiliated companies: Smith Credit Co. and Smith Public Records Co. Smith Credit Co. assembles and maintains credit account information from persons who furnish that information regularly and in the ordinary course of business on consumers residing nationwide. Smith Public Records Co. assembles and maintains public record information on consumers nationwide. Neither Smith Co. nor its affiliated organizations comply with FCRA obligations of consumer reporting agencies that compile and maintain files on consumers on a nationwide basis. Smith Co.'s conduct is a circumvention or evasion of treatment as a consumer reporting agency that compiles and maintains files on consumers on a nationwide basis, and thus violates this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Bona fide, arm's length transaction with unaffiliated party. Foster Ltd. is a consumer reporting agency that compiles and maintains files on consumers on a nationwide basis. Foster Ltd. sells its public record information business to an unaffiliated company in a bona fide, arm's length transaction. Foster Ltd. ceases to assemble, evaluate and maintain public record information on consumers residing nationwide, and ceases to offer reports containing public record information. Foster Ltd.'s conduct is not a circumvention or evasion of treatment as a consumer reporting agency that compiles and

maintains files on consumers on a nationwide basis. Foster Ltd.'s conduct does not violate this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Limitation on applicability. Any person who is otherwise in violation of paragraph (a) of this section shall be deemed to be in compliance with this part if such person is in compliance with all obligations imposed upon consumer reporting agencies that compile and maintain files on consumers on a nationwide basis under the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix A to Part 1022 [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix B to Part 1022--Model Notices of Furnishing Negative</p><p class="depth0">Information</p><p class="depth0">a. Although use of the model notices is not required, a financial institution that is subject to section 623(a)(7) of the FCRA shall be deemed to be in compliance with the notice requirement in section 623(a)(7) of the FCRA if the institution properly uses the model notices in this appendix (as applicable).</p><p class="depth0">b. A financial institution may use Model Notice B-1 if the institution provides the notice prior to furnishing negative information to a nationwide consumer reporting agency.</p><p class="depth0">c. A financial institution may use Model Notice B-2 if the institution provides the notice after furnishing negative information to a nationwide consumer reporting agency.</p><p class="depth0">d. Financial institutions may make certain changes to the language or format of the model notices without losing the safe harbor from liability provided by the model notices. The changes to the model notices may not be so extensive as to affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the language in the model notices. Financial institutions making such extensive revisions will lose the safe harbor from liability that this appendix provides. Acceptable changes include, for example,</p><p class="depth0">1. Rearranging the order of the references to ``late payment(s),'' or ``missed payment(s).''</p><p class="depth0">2. Pluralizing the terms ``credit bureau,'' ``credit report,'' and ``account.''</p><p class="depth0">3. Specifying the particular type of account on which information may be furnished, such as ``credit card account.''</p><p class="depth0">4. Rearranging in Model Notice B-1 the phrases ``information about your account'' and ``to credit bureaus'' such that it would read ``We may report to credit bureaus information about your account.''</p><p class="depth0">Model Notice B-1</p><p class="depth0">We may report information about your account to credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report.</p><p class="depth0">Model Notice B-2</p><p class="depth0">We have told a credit bureau about a late payment, missed payment or other default on your account. This information may be reflected in your credit report.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix C to Part 1022--Model Forms for Opt-Out Notices</p><p class="depth0">a. Although use of the model forms is not required, use of the model forms in this appendix (as applicable) complies with the requirement in section 624 of the Act for clear, conspicuous, and concise notices.</p><p class="depth0">b. Certain changes may be made to the language or format of the model forms without losing the protection from liability afforded by use of the model forms. These changes may not be so extensive as to affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the language in the model forms. Persons making such extensive revisions will lose the safe harbor that this appendix provides. Acceptable changes include, for example:</p><p class="depth0">1. Rearranging the order of the references to ``your income,'' ``your account history,'' and ``your credit score.''</p><p class="depth0">2. Substituting other types of information for ``income,'' ``account history,'' or ``credit score'' for accuracy, such as ``payment history,'' ``credit history,'' ``payoff status,'' or ``claims history.''</p><p class="depth0">3. Substituting a clearer and more accurate description of the affiliates providing or covered by the notice for phrases such as ``the [ABC] group of companies,'' including without limitation a statement that the entity providing the notice recently purchased the consumer's account.</p><p class="depth0">4. Substituting other types of affiliates covered by the notice for ``credit card,'' ``insurance,'' or ``securities'' affiliates.</p><p class="depth0">5. Omitting items that are not accurate or applicable. For example, if a person does not limit the duration of the opt-out period, the notice may omit information about the renewal notice.</p><p class="depth0">6. Adding a statement informing consumers how much time they have to opt out before shared eligibility information may be used to make solicitations to them.</p><p class="depth0">7. Adding a statement that the consumer may exercise the right to opt out at any time.</p><p class="depth0">8. Adding the following statement, if accurate: ``If you previously opted out, you do not need to do so again.''</p><p class="depth0">9. Providing a place on the form for the consumer to fill in identifying information, such as his or her name and address.</p><p class="depth0">10. Adding disclosures regarding the treatment of opt-outs by joint consumers to comply with Sec. 1022.23(a)(2) of this part.

Appendix E to Part 1022--Interagency Guidelines Concerning the</p><p class="depth0">Accuracy and Integrity of Information Furnished to Consumer Reporting</p><p class="depth0">Agencies</p><p class="depth0">The Bureau encourages voluntary furnishing of information to consumer reporting agencies. Section 1022.42 of this part requires each furnisher to establish and implement reasonable written policies and procedures concerning the accuracy and integrity of the information it furnishes to consumer reporting agencies. Under Sec. 1022.42(b) of this

part, a furnisher must consider the guidelines set forth below in developing its policies and procedures. In establishing these policies and procedures, a furnisher may include any of its existing policies and procedures that are relevant and appropriate. Section 1022.42(c) requires each furnisher to review its policies and procedures periodically and update them as necessary to ensure their continued effectiveness.</p><p class="depth0">I. Nature, Scope, and Objectives of Policies and Procedures</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Nature and Scope. Section 1022.42(a) of this part requires that a furnisher's policies and procedures be appropriate to the nature, size, complexity, and scope of the furnisher's activities. In developing its policies and procedures, a furnisher should consider, for example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The types of business activities in which the furnisher engages;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The nature and frequency of the information the furnisher provides to consumer reporting agencies; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The technology used by the furnisher to furnish information to consumer reporting agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Objectives. A furnisher's policies and procedures should be reasonably designed to promote the following objectives:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To furnish information about accounts or other relationships with a consumer that is accurate, such that the furnished information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Identifies the appropriate consumer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reflects the terms of and liability for those accounts or other relationships; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Reflects the consumer's performance and other conduct with respect to the account or other relationship;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To furnish information about accounts or other relationships with a consumer that has integrity, such that the furnished information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is substantiated by the furnisher's records at the time it is furnished;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Is furnished in a form and manner that is designed to minimize the likelihood that the information may be incorrectly reflected in a consumer report; thus, the furnished information should:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Include appropriate identifying information about the consumer to whom it pertains; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Be furnished in a standardized and clearly understandable form and manner and with a date specifying the time period to which the information pertains; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Includes the credit limit, if applicable and in the furnisher's possession;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> To conduct reasonable investigations of consumer disputes and take appropriate actions based on the outcome of such investigations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> To update the information it furnishes as necessary to reflect the current status of the consumer's account or other relationship, including, for example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any transfer of an account (e.g., by sale or assignment for collection) to a third party; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any cure of the consumer's failure to abide by the terms of the account or other relationship.</p><p class="depth0">II. Establishing and Implementing Policies and Procedures</p><p class="depth0">In establishing and implementing its policies and procedures, a furnisher should:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Identify practices or activities of the furnisher that can compromise the accuracy or integrity of information furnished to consumer reporting agencies, such as by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Reviewing its existing practices and activities, including the technological means and other methods it uses to furnish information to consumer reporting agencies and the frequency and timing of its furnishing of information;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reviewing its historical records relating to accuracy or integrity or to disputes; reviewing other information relating to the accuracy or integrity of information provided by the furnisher to consumer reporting agencies; and considering the types of errors, omissions, or other problems that may have affected the accuracy or integrity of information it has furnished about consumers to consumer reporting agencies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Considering any feedback received from consumer reporting agencies, consumers, or other appropriate parties;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Obtaining feedback from the furnisher's staff; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Considering the potential impact of the furnisher's policies and procedures on consumers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Evaluate the effectiveness of existing policies and procedures of the furnisher regarding the accuracy and integrity of information furnished to consumer reporting agencies; consider whether new, additional, or different policies and procedures are necessary; and consider whether implementation of existing policies and procedures should be modified to enhance the accuracy and integrity of information about consumers furnished to consumer reporting agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Evaluate the effectiveness of specific methods (including technological means) the furnisher uses to provide information to consumer reporting agencies; how those methods may affect the accuracy and integrity of the information it provides to consumer reporting agencies; and whether new, additional, or different methods (including technological means) should be used to provide information to consumer reporting agencies to enhance the accuracy and integrity of that information.</p><p class="depth0">III. Specific Components of Policies and Procedures</p><p class="depth0">In developing its policies and procedures, a furnisher should address the following, as appropriate:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Establishing and implementing a system for furnishing information about consumers to consumer reporting agencies that is appropriate to the nature, size, complexity, and scope of the furnisher's business operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Using standard data reporting formats and standard procedures for compiling and furnishing data, where feasible, such as the electronic transmission of information about consumers to consumer reporting agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Maintaining records for a reasonable period of time, not less than any applicable recordkeeping requirement, in order to substantiate the accuracy of any information about consumers it furnishes that is subject to a direct dispute.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Establishing and implementing appropriate internal controls regarding the accuracy and integrity of information about consumers furnished to consumer reporting agencies, such as by implementing standard procedures and verifying random samples of information provided to consumer reporting agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Training staff that participates in activities related to the furnishing of information about consumers to consumer reporting agencies to implement the policies and procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Providing for appropriate and effective oversight of relevant service providers whose activities may affect the accuracy or integrity of information about consumers furnished to consumer reporting agencies to ensure compliance with the policies and procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Furnishing information about consumers to consumer reporting agencies following mergers, portfolio acquisitions or sales, or other acquisitions or transfers of accounts or other obligations in a manner that prevents re-aging of information, duplicative reporting, or other problems that may similarly affect the accuracy or integrity of the information furnished.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Deleting, updating, and correcting information in the furnisher's records, as appropriate, to avoid furnishing inaccurate information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Conducting reasonable investigations of disputes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Designing technological and other means of communication with consumer reporting agencies to prevent duplicative reporting of accounts, erroneous association of information with the wrong consumer(s), and other occurrences that may compromise the accuracy or integrity of information provided to consumer reporting agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Providing consumer reporting agencies with sufficient identifying information in the furnisher's possession about each consumer about whom information is furnished to enable the consumer reporting agency properly to identify the consumer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Conducting a periodic evaluation of its own practices, consumer reporting agency practices of which the furnisher is aware, investigations of disputed information, corrections of inaccurate information, means of communication, and other factors that may affect the accuracy or integrity of information furnished to consumer reporting agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Complying with applicable requirements under the FCRA and its implementing regulations.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.
