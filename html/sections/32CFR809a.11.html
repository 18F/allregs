Intervention by United States military personnel outside the United States is governed by international law, bilateral and other international agreements to which the United States is a party, and host-nation laws. Local plans to counter such situations must include provisions to request and obtain host nation civil or military support as quickly as possible.</p><p class="depth0">SUBCHAPTER B_SALES AND SERVICES</p>
