                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. For purposes of the food stamp time limit, the  terms below have the following meanings:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fulfilling the work requirement means:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Working 20 hours per week, averaged monthly; for purposes of  this provision, 20 hours a week averaged monthly means 80 hours a month;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Participating in and complying with the requirements of a work  program 20 hours per week, as determined by the State agency;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any combination of working and participating in a work program  for a total of 20 hours per week, as determined by the State agency; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Participating in and complying with a workfare program;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Working means:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Work in exchange for money;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Work in exchange for goods or services (``in kind'' work); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Unpaid work, verified under standards established by the State  agency.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Any combination of paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (a)(2)(ii) and  (a)(2)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Work Program means:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A program under the Workforce Investment Act (Pub. L. 105-220);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A program under section 236 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C.  2296); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An employment and training program, other than a job search or  job search training program, operated or supervised by a State or  political subdivision of a State that meets standards approved by the  Governor of the State, including a program under Sec. 273.7(f). Such a  program may contain job search or job search training as a subsidiary  component as long as such component is less than half the requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Workfare program means:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A program under Sec. 273.7(m); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A comparable program established by a State or political  subdivision of a State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General Rule. Individuals are not eligible to participate in the  Food Stamp Program as a member of any household if the individual  received food stamps for more than three countable months during any  three-year period, except that individuals may be eligible for up to  three additional countable months in accordance with paragraph (e) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Countable months. Countable months are months during which an  individual receives food stamps for the full benefit month while not:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Exempt under paragraph (c) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Covered by a waiver under paragraph (f) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Fulfilling the work requirement as defined in paragraph (a)(1)  of this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Receiving benefits that are prorated in accordance with  Sec. 273.10.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Good cause. As determined by the State agency, if an individual  would have worked an average of 20 hours per week but missed some work  for good cause, the individual shall be considered to have met the work  requirement if the absence from work is temporary and the individual  retains his or her job. Good cause shall include circumstances beyond  the individual's control, such as, but not limited to, illness, illness  of another household member requiring the presence of the member, a  household emergency, or the unavailability of transportation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Measuring the three-year period. The State agency may measure  and track the three-year period as it deems appropriate. The State  agency may use either a ``fixed'' or ``rolling'' clock. If the State  agency chooses to switch tracking methods it must inform FNS in writing.  With respect to a State, the three-year period:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Shall be measured and tracked consistently so that individuals  who are similarly situated are treated the same; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Shall not include any period before the earlier of November 22,  1996, or the date the State notified food stamp recipients of the  application of Section 824 of the Personal Responsibility and Work  Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-193).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Treatment of income and resources. The income and resources of  an individual made ineligible under this paragraph (b) shall be handled  in accordance with Sec. 273.11(c)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Benefits received erroneously. If an individual subject to this  section receives food stamp benefits erroneously, the State agency shall  consider the benefits to have been received for purposes of this  provision unless or until the individual pays it back in full.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Verification. Verification shall be in accordance with  Sec. 273.2(f)(1) and (f)(8).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Reporting. A change in work hours below 20 hours per week,  averaged monthly, is a reportable change in accordance with  Sec. 273.12(a)(1)(viii). Regardless of the type of reporting system the  State agency assigns to potential ABAWDs, the State agency must adhere  to the statutory requirements of time-limited benefits for individuals  who are subject to the work requirement. The State agency may opt to  consider work performed in a job that was not reported according to the  requirements of Sec. 273.12 ``work.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exceptions. The time limit does not apply to an individual if he  or she is:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Under 18 or 50 years of age or older;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determined by the State agency to be medically certified as  physically or mentally unfit for employment. An individual is medically  certified as physically or mentally unfit for employment if he or she:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is receiving temporary or permanent disability benefits issued  by governmental or private sources;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is obviously mentally or physically unfit for employment as  determined by the State agency; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the unfitness is not obvious, provides a statement from a  physician, physician's assistant, nurse, nurse practitioner, designated  representative of the physician's office, a licensed or certified  psychologist, a social worker, or any other medical personnel the State  agency determines appropriate, that he or she is physically or mentally  unfit for employment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Is a parent (natural, adoptive, or step) of a household member  under age 18, even if the household member who is under 18 is not  himself eligible for food stamps;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Is residing in a household where a household member is under age  18, even if the household member who is under 18 is not himself eligible  for food stamps;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Is otherwise exempt from work requirements under section 6(d)(2)  of the Food Stamp Act, as implemented in regulations at Sec. 273.7(b);  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Is pregnant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Regaining eligibility. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An individual denied eligibility  under paragraph (b) of this section, or who did not reapply for benefits  because he was not meeting the work requirements under paragraph (b) of  this section, shall regain eligibility to participate in the Food Stamp  Program if, as determined by the State agency, during any 30 consecutive  days, he or she:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Worked 80 or more hours;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Participated in and complied with the requirements of a work  program for 80 or more hours;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any combination of work and participation in a work program  for a total of 80 hours; or participated in and complied with a workfare  program; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> At State agency option, verifies that the he or she will meet  one of the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(ii),  (d)(1)(iii), or (d)(1)(v) of this section, within the 30 days subsequent  to application; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Becomes exempt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An individual regaining eligibility under paragraph (d)(1) of  this section shall have benefits calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For individuals regaining eligibility by working, participating  in a work program, or combining hours worked and hours participating in  a work program, the State agency may either prorate benefits from the  day the 80 hours are completed or from the date of application, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For individuals regaining eligibility by participating in a  workfare program, and the workfare obligation   is based on an estimated monthly allotment prorated back to the date of  application, then the allotment issued must be prorated back to this  date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> There is no limit on how many times an individual may regain  eligibility and subsequently maintain eligibility by meeting the work  requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> more than once in any three-year period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Waivers--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. On the request of a State agency, FNS may  waive the time limit for a group of individuals in the State if we  determine that the area in which the individuals reside:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Has an unemployment rate of over 10 percent; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Does not have a sufficient number of jobs to provide employment  for the individuals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Required data. The State agency may submit whatever data it  deems appropriate to support its request. However, to support waiver  requests based on unemployment rates or labor force data, States must  submit data that relies on standard Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)  data or methods. A non-exhaustive list of the kinds of data a State  agency may submit follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To support a claim of unemployment over 10 percent, a State  agency may submit evidence that an area has a recent 12 month average  unemployment rate over 10 percent; a recent three month average  unemployment rate over 10 percent; or an historical seasonal  unemployment rate over 10 percent; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To support a claim of lack of sufficient jobs, a State may  submit evidence that an area: is designated as a Labor Surplus Area  (LSA) by the Department of Labor's Employment and Training  Administration (ETA); is determined by the Department of Labor's  Unemployment Insurance Service as qualifying for extended unemployment  benefits; has a low and declining employment-to-population ratio; has a  lack of jobs in declining occupations or industries; is described in an  academic study or other publications as an area where there are lack of  jobs; has a 24-month average unemployment rate 20 percent above the  national average for the same 24-month period. This 24-month period may  not be any earlier than the same 24-month period the ETA uses to  designate LSAs for the current fiscal year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Waivers that are readily approvable. FNS will approve State  agency waivers where FNS confirms:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Data from the BLS or the BLS cooperating agency that shows an  area has a most recent 12 month average unemployment rate over 10  percent;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Evidence that the area has been designated a Labor Surplus Area  by the ETA for the current fiscal year; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Data from the BLS or the BLS cooperating agency that an area  has a 24 month average unemployment rate that exceeds the national  average by 20 percent for any 24-month period no earlier than the same  period the ETA uses to designate LSAs for the current fiscal year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Effective date of certain waivers. In areas for which the State  certifies that data from the BLS or the BLS cooperating agency show a  most recent 12 month average unemployment rate over 10 percent; or the  area has been designated as a Labor Surplus Area by the Department of  Labor's Employment and Training Administration for the current fiscal  year, the State may begin to operate the waiver at the time the waiver  request is submitted. FNS will contact the State if the waiver must be  modified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Duration of waiver. In general, waivers will be approved for one  year. The duration of a waiver should bear   some relationship to the documentation provided in support of the waiver  request. FNS will consider approving waivers for up to one year based on  documentation covering a shorter period, but the State agency must show  that the basis for the waiver is not a seasonal or short term  aberration. We reserve the right to approve waivers for a shorter period  at the State agency's request or if the data is insufficient. We reserve  the right to approve a waiver for a longer period if the reasons are  compelling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Areas covered by waivers. States may define areas to be covered  by waivers. We encourage State agencies to submit data and analyses that  correspond to the defined area. If corresponding data does not exist,  State agencies should submit data that corresponds as closely to the  area as possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> 15 percent exemptions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For the purpose of establishing the  15 percent exemption for each State agency, the following terms are  defined:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Caseload means the average monthly number of individuals  receiving food stamps during the 12-month period ending the preceding  June 30.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Covered individual means a food stamp recipient, or an  applicant denied eligibility for benefits solely because he or she  received food stamps during the 3 months of eligibility provided under  paragraph (b) of this section, who:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Is not exempt from the time limit under paragraph (c) of this  section;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Does not reside in an area covered by a waiver granted under  paragraph (f) of this section;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Is not fulfilling the work requirements as defined in paragraph  (a)(1) of this section; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Is not receiving food stamp benefits under paragraph (e) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subject to paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section, a State  agency may provide an exemption from the 3-month time limit of paragraph  (b) of this section for covered individuals. Exemptions do not count  towards a State agency's allocation if they are provided to an  individual who is otherwise exempt from the time limit during that  month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For each fiscal year, a State agency may provide a number of  exemptions such that the average monthly number of exemptions in effect  during the fiscal year does not exceed 15 percent of the number of  covered individuals in the State, as estimated by FNS, based on FY 1996  quality control data and other factors FNS deems appropriate, and  adjusted by FNS to reflect changes in:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The State agency's caseload; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> FNS's estimate of changes in the proportion of food stamp  recipients covered by waivers granted under paragraph (f) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> State agencies must not discriminate against any covered  individual for reasons of age, race, color, sex, disability, religious  creed, national origin, or political beliefs. Such discrimination is  prohibited by this part, the Food Stamp Act, the Age Discrimination Act  of 1975 (Public Law 94-135), the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Public Law  93-112, section 504), and title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42  U.S.C. 2000d). Enforcement action may be brought under any applicable  Federal law. Title VI complaints will be processed in accord with 7 CFR  part 15.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Adjustments. FNS will make adjustments as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Caseload adjustments. FNS will adjust the number of exemptions  estimated for a State agency under paragraph (g)(2) of this section  during a fiscal year if the number of food stamp recipients in the State  varies from the State's caseload by more than 10 percent, as estimated  by FNS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exemption adjustments. During each fiscal year, FNS will adjust  the number of exemptions allocated to a State agency based on the number  of exemptions in effect in the State for the preceding fiscal year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the State agency does not use all of its exemptions by the  end of the fiscal year, FNS will increase the estimated number of  exemptions allocated to the State agency for the subsequent fiscal year  by the remaining balance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the State agency exceeds its exemptions by the end of the  fiscal year, FNS will reduce the estimated number of exemptions  allocated to the State agency for the subsequent fiscal year by the  corresponding number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Reporting requirement. The State agency will track the number of  exemptions used each month and report this number to the regional office  on a quarterly basis as an addendum to the quarterly Employment and  Training Report (Form FNS-583) required by Sec. 273.7(c)(8).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Other Program rules. Nothing in this section will make an  individual eligible for food stamp benefits if the individual is not  otherwise eligible for benefits under the other provisions of this part  and the Food Stamp Act.  [Amdt. 379, 64 FR 48257, Sept. 3, 1999, as amended at 66 FR 4469, Jan.  17, 2001; 67 FR 41618, June 19, 2002; 71 FR 33384, June 9, 2006]</p>
