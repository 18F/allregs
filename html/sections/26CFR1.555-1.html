                            <p class="depth0">The gross income of a foreign corporation which is a foreign  personal holding company is computed the same as if the foreign  corporation were a domestic corporation which is a personal holding  company. See section 542(a)(1) and Sec. 1.542-2. The gross income of a  foreign personal holding company thus includes income from all sources,  whether within or without the United States, which is not specifically  excluded from gross income under any other provisions of the Code. For  example, the gross income of a foreign personal holding company includes  all income from sources outside the United States even though the  foreign personal holding company is a foreign corporation not engaged in  trade or business within the United States. However, the gross income of  a foreign corporation which is a foreign personal holding company shall  not include, with respect to a United States shareholder described in  section 951(b), dividends received by such corporation which are  excluded under section 959(b) from the income of such corporation with  respect to such shareholder.
