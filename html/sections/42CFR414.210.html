                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. For items furnished on or after January 1, 1989, except as provided in paragraphs (c), (d), and (g) of this section, Medicare pays for durable medical equipment, prosthetics and orthotics, including a separate payment for maintenance and servicing of the items as described in paragraph (e) of this section, on the basis of 80 percent of the lesser of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The actual charge for the item;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The fee schedule amount for the item, as determined in accordance with the provisions of Secs. 414.220 through 414.232</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Payment classification. (1) The carrier determines fee schedules for the following classes of equipment and devices:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Inexpensive or routinely purchased items, as specified in Sec. 414.220.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Items requiring frequent and substantial servicing, as specified in Sec. 414.222.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Certain customized items, as specified in Sec. 414.224.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Oxygen and oxygen equipment, as specified in Sec. 414.226.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Prosthetic and orthotic devices, as specified in Sec. 414.228.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Other durable medical equipment (capped rental items), as specified in Sec. 414.229.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulators (TENS), as specified in Sec. 414.232.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> CMS designates the items in each class of equipment or device through its program instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Exception for certain HHAs. Public HHAs and HHAs that furnish services or items free-of-charge or at nominal

prices to a significant number of low-income patients, as defined in Sec. 413.13(a) of this chapter, are paid on the basis of 80 percent of the fee schedule amount determined in accordance with the provision of Secs. 414.220 through 414.230.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Prohibition on special limits. For items furnished on or after January 1, 1989 and before January 1, 1991, neither CMS nor a carrier may establish a special reasonable charge for items covered under this subpart on the basis of inherent reasonableness as described in Sec. 405.502(g) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Maintenance and servicing--(1) General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the carrier pays the reasonable and necessary charges for maintenance and servicing of beneficiary-owned equipment. Reasonable and necessary charges are those made for parts and labor not otherwise covered under a manufacturer's or supplier's warranty. Payment is made for replacement parts in a lump sum based on the carrier's consideration of the item. The carrier establishes a reasonable fee for labor associated with repairing, maintaining, and servicing the item. Payment is not made for maintenance and servicing of a rented item other than the maintenance and servicing fee for oxygen equipment described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section or for other durable medical equipment as described in Sec. 414.229(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Maintenance and servicing payment for certain oxygen equipment furnished after the 36-month rental period from January 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010. The carrier makes a maintenance and servicing payment for oxygen equipment other than liquid and gaseous equipment (stationary and portable) as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For the first 6-month period following the date on which the 36-month rental period ends in accordance with Sec. 414.226(a)(1) of this subpart, no payments are made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For each succeeding 6-month period, payment may be made during the first month of that period for 30 minutes of labor for routine maintenance and servicing of the equipment in the beneficiary's home (including an institution used as the beneficiary's home).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The supplier must visit the beneficiary's home (including an institution used as the beneficiary's home) to inspect the equipment during the first month of the 6-month period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exception to maintenance and servicing payments. For items purchased on or after June 1, 1989, no payment is made under the provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of this section for the maintenance and servicing of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Items requiring frequent and substantial servicing, as defined in Sec. 414.222(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Capped rental items, as defined in Sec. 414.229(a), that are not beneficiary-owned in accordance with Sec. 414.229(d), Sec. 414.229(f)(2), or Sec. 414.229(h); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Capped rental items, as defined in Sec. 414.229(a), that are not beneficiary-owned in Sec. 414.229(d), Sec. 414.229(f)(2), or Sec. 414.229(h); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Oxygen equipment, as described in Sec. 414.226.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Supplier replacement of beneficiary-owned equipment based on accumulated repair costs. A supplier that transfers title to a capped rental item to a beneficiary in accordance with Sec. 414.229(f)(2) is responsible for furnishing replacement equipment at no cost to the beneficiary or to the Medicare program if the carrier determines that the item furnished by the supplier will not last for the entire reasonable useful lifetime established for the equipment in accordance with Sec. 414.210(f)(1). In making this determination, the carrier may consider whether the accumulated costs of repair exceed 60 percent of the cost to replace the item.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Maintenance and servicing payment for certain oxygen equipment furnished after the 36-month rental period and on or after July 1, 2010. For oxygen equipment other than liquid and gaseous equipment (stationary and portable), the carrier makes payment as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For the first 6-month period following the date on which the 36-month rental period ends in accordance with Sec. 414.226(a)(1) of this subpart, no payments are made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For each succeeding 6-month period, payment may be made during the first month of that period for routine maintenance and servicing of the equipment in the beneficiary's home

(including an institution used as the beneficiary's home).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Payment for maintenance and servicing is made based on a reasonable fee not to exceed 10 percent of the purchase price for a stationary oxygen concentrator. This payment includes payment for maintenance and servicing of all oxygen equipment other than liquid or gaseous equipment (stationary or portable).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The supplier must visit the beneficiary's home (including an institution used as the beneficiary's home) to inspect the equipment during the first month of the 6-month period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Payment for replacement of equipment. If an item of DME or a prosthetic or orthotic device paid for under this subpart has been in continuous use by the patient for the equipment's reasonable useful lifetime or if the carrier determines that the item is lost, stolen, or irreparably damaged, the patient may elect to obtain a new piece of equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The reasonable useful lifetime of DME or prosthetic and orthotic devices is determined through program instructions. In the absence of program instructions, carriers may determine the reasonable useful lifetime of equipment but in no case can it be less than 5 years. Computation is based on when the equipment is delivered to the beneficiary, not the age of the equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the beneficiary elects to obtain replacement oxygen equipment, payment is made in accordance with Sec. 414.226(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the beneficiary elects to obtain a replacement capped rental item, payment is made in accordance with Sec. 414.229(a)(2) or (a)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For all other beneficiary-owned items, if the beneficiary elects to obtain replacement equipment, payment is made on a purchase basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Application of Competitive Bidding Information and Limitation of Inherent Reasonableness Authority. For items furnished on or after January 1, 2011, the fee schedule amounts may be adjusted, and for DME items furnished on or after January 1, 2016, the fee schedule amounts shall be adjusted, based on information on the payment determined as part of implementation of the programs under subpart F, of this part, excluding information on the payment determined in accordance with the special payment rules at Sec. 414.409. In the case of such adjustments, the rules at Sec. 405.502(g) and (h) of this chapter shall not be applied. The methodologies for adjusting fee schedule amounts are provided below. In any case where application of these methodologies results in an increase in the fee schedule amount, the adjustment to the fee schedule amount is not made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Payment adjustments for areas within the contiguous United States using information from competitive bidding programs. For an item or service subject to the programs under subpart F of this part, the fee schedule amounts for such item or service for areas within the contiguous United States shall be adjusted as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> CMS determines a regional price for each state in the contiguous United States and the District of Columbia equal to the un-weighted average of the single payment amounts for an item or service established in accordance with Sec. 414.416 for competitive bidding areas that are fully or partially located in the same region that contains the state or District of Columbia.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> CMS determines a national average price equal to the un-weighted average of the regional prices determined under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A regional price determined under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section cannot be greater than 110 percent of the national average price determined under paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section nor less than 90 percent of the national average price determined under paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The fee schedule amount for all areas within a state that are not defined as rural areas for purposes of this subpart is adjusted to the regional price determined under paragraphs (g)(1)(i) and (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The fee schedule amount for all areas within a state that are defined as rural areas for the purposes of this subpart is adjusted to 110 percent of the national average price determined under paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Payment adjustments for areas outside the contiguous United States using

information from competitive bidding programs. For an item or service subject to the programs under subpart F, the fee schedule amounts for areas outside the contiguous United States are reduced to the greater of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The average of the single payment amounts for the item or service for CBAs outside the contiguous United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 110 percent of the national average price for the item or service determined under paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Payment adjustments for items and services included in no more than ten competitive bidding programs. Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(1) of this section, for an item or service that is included in ten or fewer competitive bidding programs as defined at Sec. 414.402, the fee schedule amounts applied for all areas within and outside the contiguous United States are reduced to 110 percent of the un-weighted average of the single payment amounts from the ten or fewer competitive bidding programs for the item or service in the areas where the ten or fewer competitive bidding programs are in place.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Payment adjustments using data on items and services included in competitive bidding programs no longer in effect. In the case where adjustments to fee schedule amounts are made using any of the methodologies described, if the adjustments are based solely on single payment amounts from competitive bidding programs that are no longer in effect, the single payment amounts are updated before being used to adjust the fee schedule amounts. The single payment amounts are updated based on the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U) from the mid-point of the last year the single payment amounts were in effect to the month ending 6 months prior to the date the initial fee schedule reductions go into effect. Following the initial adjustments to the fee schedule amounts, if the adjustments continue to be based solely on single payment amounts from competitive bidding programs that are no longer in effect, the single payment amounts used to reduce the fee schedule amounts are updated every 12 months using the percentage change in the CPI-U for the 12-month period ending 6 months prior to the date the updated payment adjustments would go into effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Adjusted payment amounts for accessories used with different types of base equipment. In situations where a HCPCS code that describes an item used with different types of base equipment is included in more than one product category in a CBA under competitive bidding, a weighted average of the single payment amounts for the code is computed for each CBA based on the total number of allowed services for the item on a national basis for the code from each product category prior to applying the payment adjustment methodologies in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Payment adjustments for enteral infusion pumps and standard power wheelchairs. (i) In situations where a single payment amount in a CBA for an enteral infusion pump without alarm is greater than the single payment amount in the same CBA for an enteral infusion pump with alarm, the single payment amount for the enteral infusion pump without alarm is adjusted to be equal to the single payment amount for the enteral infusion pump with alarm prior to applying the payment adjustment methodologies in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In situations where a single payment amount in a CBA for a Group 1, standard, sling/solid seat and back power wheelchair is greater than the single payment amount in the same CBA for a Group 2, standard, sling/solid seat and back power wheelchair, the single payment amount for the Group 1, standard, sling/solid seat and back power wheelchair is adjusted to be equal to the single payment amount for the Group 2, standard, sling/solid seat and back power wheelchair prior to applying the payment adjustment methodologies in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In situations where a single payment amount in a CBA for a Group 1, standard, captains chair power wheelchair is greater than the single payment amount in the same CBA for a Group 2, standard, captains chair power wheelchair, the single payment

amount for the Group 1, standard, captains chair power wheelchair is adjusted to be equal to the single payment amount for the Group 2, standard, captains chair power wheelchair prior to applying the payment adjustment methodologies in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In situations where a single payment amount in a CBA for a Group 2, standard, portable, sling/solid seat and back power wheelchair is greater than the single payment amount in the same CBA for a Group 2, standard, sling/solid seat and back power wheelchair, the single payment amount for the Group 2, standard, portable, sling/solid seat and back power wheelchair is adjusted to be equal to the single payment amount for the Group 2, standard, sling/solid seat and back power wheelchair prior to applying the payment adjustment methodologies in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> In situations where a single payment amount in a CBA for a Group 2, standard, portable, captains chair power wheelchair is greater than the single payment amount in the same CBA for a Group 2, standard, captains chair power wheelchair, the single payment amount for the Group 2, standard, portable, captains chair power wheelchair is adjusted to be equal to the single payment amount for the Group 2, standard, captains chair power wheelchair prior to applying the payment adjustment methodologies in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Payment adjustments for mail order items furnished in the Northern Mariana Islands. The fee schedule amounts for mail order items furnished to beneficiaries in the Northern Mariana Islands are adjusted so that they are equal to 100 percent of the single payment amounts established under a national mail order competitive bidding program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Updating adjusted fee schedule amounts. The adjusted fee schedule amounts are revised each time a single payment amount for an item or service is updated following one or more new competitions and as other items are added to programs established under Subpart F of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Transition rules. The payment adjustments described above are phased in as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For applicable items and services furnished with dates of service from January 1, 2016, through June 30, 2016, based on the fee schedule amount for the area is equal to 50 percent of the adjusted payment amount established under this section and 50 percent of the unadjusted fee schedule amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For items and services furnished with dates of service on or after July 1, 2016, the fee schedule amount for the area is equal to 100 percent of the adjusted payment amount established under this section.
