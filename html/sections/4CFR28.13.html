Pursuant to Sec. 28.98, individuals raising  discrimination issues in connection with a RIF action need not file a  complaint with GAO's Office of Opportunity and Inclusiveness before  pursuing a RIF challenge alleging discrimination, either by filing  directly with the PAB or by filing a charge with the Board's Office of  General Counsel.
