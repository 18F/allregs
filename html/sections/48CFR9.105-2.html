When an offer on which an  award would otherwise be made is rejected because the prospective  contractor is found to be nonresponsible, the contracting officer shall  make, sign, and place in the contract file a determination of  nonresponsibility, which shall state the basis for the determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the contracting officer determines that a responsive small  business lacks certain elements of responsibility, the contracting  officer shall comply with the procedures in subpart 19.6. When a  Certificate of Competency is issued for a small business concern (see  subpart 19.6), the contracting officer shall accept the Small Business  Administration's decision to issue a Certificate of Competency and award  the contract to the concern.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Support documentation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Documents and reports supporting a  determination of responsibility or nonresponsibility, including any  preaward survey reports, the use of FAPIIS information (see 9.104-6),  and any applicable Certificate of Competency, must be included in the  contract file.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The contracting officer shall document the determination of  nonresponsibility in FAPIIS (available at www.cpars.gov, then select  FAPIIS) if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The contract is valued at more than the simplified acquisition  threshold;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The determination of nonresponsibility is based on lack of  satisfactory performance record or satisfactory record of integrity and  business ethics; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The Small Business Administration does not issue a Certificate  of Competency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The contracting officer is responsible for the timely  submission, within 3 working days, and sufficiency, and accuracy of the  documentation regarding the nonresponsibility determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> As required by section 3010 of the Supplemental Appropriations  Act, 2010 (Pub. L. 111-212), all information posted   in FAPIIS on or after April 15, 2011, except past performance reviews,  will be publicly available.

If the contractor asserts within 7 calendar days, to the Government  official who posted the information, that some of the information posted  to the non-public segment of FAPIIS is covered by a disclosure exemption  under the Freedom of Information Act, the Government official who posted  the information must within 7 calendar days remove the posting from  FAPIIS and resolve the issue in accordance with agency Freedom of  Information Act procedures, prior to reposting the releasable  information.
