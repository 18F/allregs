                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An individual or agency filing an application for disability  retirement is responsible for providing OPM with the evidence described  in Sec. 844.201(b)(1), as well as whatever documentation OPM requires  in order to determine whether the individual meets the eligibility  requirements set forth in Sec. 844.103. The documentation must be  provided in a form prescribed by OPM. Failure to submit the  documentation required is grounds for dismissing the application. It is  also the responsibility of the disability annuitant to obtain and submit   evidence OPM requires to show continuing entitlement to disability  benefits. Unless OPM orders an examination by a physician of its choice  under paragraph (b) of this section, the cost of providing medical  documentation rests with the applicant or disability annuitant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> OPM may offer the applicant a medical examination when it  determines that an independent evaluation of medical evidence is needed  in order to make a decision regarding an application for a disability  annuity or a disability annuitant's entitlement to continuing benefits.  The medical examination will be conducted by a medical officer of the  United States or a qualified physician or board of physicians designated  by OPM. The applicant's refusal to submit to an examination is grounds  for dismissal of the application or termination of payments to an  annuitant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> OPM will review the documentation submitted under paragraph  (a) of this section to determine whether the individual has met the  eligibility requirements set forth in Sec. 844.103. OPM will issue its  decision in writing to the individual and to the employing agency. The  decision will include a statement of OPM's findings and conclusions and  an explanation of the applicant's right to request reconsideration or  MSPB review under Sec. 844.104.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> OPM may rescind a decision to allow an application for  disability retirement at any time if OPM determines that the original  decision was erroneous due to fraud, misstatement of fact, or upon the  acquisition of additional medical or other documentation. OPM will  provide the individual and the employing agency with written  notification of the rescission, including a statement of OPM's findings  and conclusions and an explanation of the individual's right to request  reconsideration or MSPB review under Sec. 844.104.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Subject to 5 U.S.C. 552a, any supporting documentation provided  to OPM under this section may be shared with the Social Security  Administration and the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs of the  U.S. Department of Labor.</p>
