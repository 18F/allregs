                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In minor restoration cases, ENG Form 1440A-R, Joint Terminal Condition Survey, will be used. The Government representative, in these cases, will also make a detailed investigation as to the extent of damages, cost of repairs, and other factors sufficient to properly complete and sign ENG Form 1440B-R, Cost of Restoration. In order to effect economies, the DE may arrange for the utilitization of the services of the Facilities Engineer or the using service to perform joint terminal condition surveys. Such use, however, should be coupled with issuance of proper instructions for guidance of the respective personnel. A restoration case is considered to be minor under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The initial cost of Government improvements or alterations did not exceed $5,000; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The net salvage value of Government improvements remaining does not exceed $1,000; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The cash payment to the lessor in lieu of restoration does not exceed $1,000; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The lessor has agreed to accept a cash settlement in lieu of physical restoration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Preparation of ENG Form 1440-R. Use of ENG Form 1440B-R is premised upon the ability of the field investigator to adequately analyze conditions and develop sufficient supporting data as to the cost of the items of restoration involved. While this form is considered self-explanatory, the following is to be noted:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The procedure hereunder envisions the use of both ENG Form 1440A-R and ENG Form 1440B-R, which complement each other.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The use of ENG Form 1440B-R for estimating restoration costs does not waive the requirements for a proper evaluation of the Government's restoration obligations either as to the legal principles or as to the proper measure of damages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Distribution of these forms, together with any supporting exhibits, will be accomplished in the same manner as set forth in paragraph (b) of Sec. 644.460.</p>
