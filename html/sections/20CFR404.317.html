                                Sec. 404.317  How is the amount of my disability benefit calculated?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Your monthly benefit is equal to the primary insurance amount (PIA).  This amount is computed under the rules in subpart C of this part as if  it was an old-age benefit, and as if you were 62 years of age at the  beginning of the 5-month waiting period mentioned in Sec. 404.315(a). If  the 5-month waiting period is not required because of your previous  entitlement, your PIA is figured as if you were 62 years old when you  become entitled to benefits this time. Your monthly benefit amount may  be reduced if you receive worker's compensation or public disability  payments before you become 65 years old as described in Sec. 404.408.  Your benefits may also be reduced if you were entitled to other  retirement-age benefits before you attained full retirement age (as  defined in Sec. 404.409).  [68 FR 4704, Jan. 30, 2003]</p>
