                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any producer of any book, magazine, periodical, film, videotape,  digitally- or computer-manipulated image, digital image, or picture, or  other matter (including but not limited to an Internet computer site or  service) that contains one or more visual depictions of an actual human  being engaged in actual sexually explicit conduct made after July 3,  1995, and produced, manufactured, published, duplicated, reproduced, or  reissued after July 3, 1995, or of a performer in a visual depiction of  simulated sexually explicit conduct or actual sexually explicit conduct  limited to lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any  person made after March 18, 2009, shall cause to be affixed to every  copy of the matter a statement describing the location of the records  required by this part. A producer may cause such statement to be  affixed, for example, by instructing the manufacturer of the book,  magazine, periodical, film, videotape, digitally- or computer- manipulated image, digital image, picture, or other matter to affix the  statement. In this paragraph, the term ``copy'' includes every page of a  Web site on which a visual depiction of an actual human being engaged in  actual or simulated sexually explicit conduct appears.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Every statement shall contain:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The title of the book, magazine, periodical, film, or videotape,  digitally- or computer-manipulated image, digital image, picture, or  other matter (unless the title is prominently set out elsewhere in the  book, magazine, periodical, film, or videotape, digitally- or computer- manipulated image, digital image, picture, or other matter) or, if there  is no title, an identifying number or similar identifier that  differentiates this matter from other matters which the producer has  produced;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A street address at which the records required by this part may  be made available. A post office box address does not satisfy this  requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the producer is an organization, the statement shall also  contain the title and business address of the person who is responsible  for maintaining the records required by this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The information contained in the statement must be accurate as  of the date on which the book, magazine, periodical, film, videotape,  digitally or computer-manipulated image, digital image, picture, or  other matter is produced or reproduced.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For the purposes of this section, the required statement shall  be displayed in typeface that is no less than 12-point type or no  smaller than the second-largest typeface on the material and in a color  that clearly contrasts with the background color of the material. For  any electronic or other display of the notice that is limited in time,  the notice must be displayed for a sufficient duration and of a  sufficient size to be capable of being read by the average viewer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If the producer contracts with a non-employee custodian of  records to serve as the person responsible for maintaining his records,  the statement shall contain the name and business address of that  custodian and may contain that information in lieu of the information  required in paragraphs (b)(3) and (c) of this section.  [Order No. 2765-2005, 70 FR 29619, May 24, 2005, as amended at 73 FR  77470, Dec. 18, 2008]</p>
