You may leave in place improvements such as roads, culverts, and  bridges if BLM consents. If you fail to remove equipment, personal  property, or any other improvement, it becomes the property of the  United States. However, you remain liable for the cost of its removal  and for restoration of the site.</p><p class="depth0">Contract and Permit Cancellation</p>
