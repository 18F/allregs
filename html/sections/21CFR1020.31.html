The technique factors to be used during an exposure shall be  indicated before the exposure begins, except when automatic exposure  controls are used, in which case the technique factors which are set  prior to the exposure shall be indicated. On equipment having fixed  technique factors, this requirement may be met by permanent markings.  Indication of technique factors shall be visible from the operator's  position except in the case of spot films made by the fluoroscopist.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Timers. Means shall be provided to terminate the exposure at a  preset time interval, a preset product of current and time, a preset  number of pulses, or a preset radiation exposure to the image receptor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except during serial radiography, the operator shall be able to  terminate the exposure at any time during an exposure of greater than  one-half second. Except during panoramic dental radiography, termination  of exposure shall cause automatic resetting of the timer to its initial  setting or to zero. It shall not be possible to make an exposure when  the timer is set to a zero or off position if either position is  provided.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> During serial radiography, the operator shall be able to  terminate the x-ray exposure(s) at any time, but means may be provided  to permit completion of any single exposure of the series in process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Automatic exposure controls. When an automatic exposure control  is provided:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Indication shall be made on the control panel when this mode of  operation is selected;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When the x-ray tube potential is equal to or greater than 51  kilovolts peak (kVp), the minimum exposure time for field emission  equipment rated for pulsed operation shall be equal to or less than a  time interval equivalent to two pulses and the minimum exposure time for  all other equipment shall be equal to or less   than \1/60\ second or a time interval required to deliver 5 milliampere- seconds (mAs), whichever is greater;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Either the product of peak x-ray tube potential, current, and  exposure time shall be limited to not more than 60 kilowatt-seconds  (kWs) per exposure or the product of x-ray tube current and exposure  time shall be limited to not more than 600 mAs per exposure, except when  the x-ray tube potential is less than 51 kVp, in which case the product  of x-ray tube current and exposure time shall be limited to not more  than 2,000 mAs per exposure; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A visible signal shall indicate when an exposure has been  terminated at the limits described in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this  section, and manual resetting shall be required before further  automatically timed exposures can be made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Accuracy.

Equipment manufactured after September 5, 1978, shall be subject to the  additional requirement that all variable controls for technique factors  shall be adjusted to alternate settings and reset to the test setting  after each measurement. The percent line-voltage regulation shall be  determined for each measurement. All values for percent line-voltage  regulation shall be within 1 of the mean value for  all measurements. For equipment having automatic exposure controls,  compliance shall be determined with a sufficient thickness of  attenuating material in the useful beam such that the technique factors  can be adjusted to provide individual exposures of a minimum of 12  pulses on field emission equipment rated for pulsed operation or no less  than one-tenth second per exposure on all other equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Linearity. The following requirements apply when the equipment  is operated on a power supply as specified by the manufacturer in  accordance with the requirements of Sec. 1020.30(h)(3) for any fixed x- ray tube potential within the range of 40 percent to 100 percent of the  maximum rated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Equipment having independent selection of x-ray tube current  (mA).

Determination of compliance will be based  on 10 exposures, made within 1 hour, at each of the two settings. These  two settings may include any two focal spot sizes except where one is  equal to or less than 0.45 mm and the other is greater than 0.45 mm. For  purposes of this requirement, focal spot size is the focal spot size  specified by the x-ray tube manufacturer. The percent line-voltage  regulation shall be determined for each measurement.
