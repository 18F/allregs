                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The purpose of Sec. Sec.  655.200-655.235 is to establish certain procedures for employers who apply to the Department of Labor to obtain labor certifications to hire temporary agricultural foreign workers to perform herding or production of livestock on the range, as defined in Sec.  655.201. Unless otherwise specified in Sec. Sec.  655.200-655.235, employers whose job opportunities meet the qualifying criteria under Sec. Sec.  655.200-655.235 must fully comply with all of the requirements of Sec. Sec.  655.100-655.185; part 653, subparts B and F; and part 654 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Jobs subject to Sec. Sec.  655.200-655.235. These procedures apply to job opportunities with the following unique characteristics:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The work activities involve the herding or production of livestock (which includes work that is closely and directly related to herding and/or the production of livestock), as defined under Sec.  655.201;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The work is performed on the range for the majority (meaning more than 50 percent) of the workdays in the work contract period. Any additional work performed at a place other than the range must constitute the production of livestock (which includes work that is closely and directly related to herding and/or the production of livestock); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The work activities generally require the workers to be on call 24 hours per day, 7 days a week.</p>
