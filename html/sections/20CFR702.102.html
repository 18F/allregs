Such areas will be designated ``jurisdictional areas.'' The Director will also designate which of his district directors will be in charge thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To further aid in the efficient administration of the OWCP, the Director may from time to time establish suboffices within compensation districts or jurisdictional areas, and will designate a person to be in charge thereof.</p>
