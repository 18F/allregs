Whenever the contract contains the clause at 52.227-13, Patent Rights--Ownership by the Government, or a patent rights clause modified pursuant to 27.303(e)(2), the contractor (or an employee-inventor of the contractor after consultation with the contractor) may request greater rights to an identified invention within the period specified in the clause.

The contractor has the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable regulations in 37 CFR part 404 and agency licensing regulations, any decisions concerning the revocation or modification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Exercise of march-in rights.
