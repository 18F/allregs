                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Administrator shall require in all activities under new  permits, and wherever practicable in activities under existing permits,  the use of the best available technologies for the protection of safety,  health, and the environment wherever such activities would have a  significant adverse effect on safety, health, or the environment, except  where the Administrator determines that the incremental benefits are  clearly insufficient to justify the incremental costs of using such  technologies. Because of the embryonic nature of the industry, NOAA is  unable either to specify particular equipment or procedures comprising  BAT or to define performance standards. Until such experience exists,  the applicant shall submit such information as is necessary to indicate,  as required above, the use of BAT, the alternatives considered to the  specific equipment or procedures proposed, and the rationale as to why  one alternative technology was selected in place of another. This  analysis shall include a discussion of the relative costs and benefits  of the technologies considered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> NOAA is not specifying particular mitigation methodologies or  techniques at this time (such as requiring the sub-surface release of  mining vessel discharges), but expects applicants and permittees to  develop and carry out their operations, to the extent possible, to  minimize adverse environmental effects and to be able to demonstrate  efforts to that end. The applicant must submit a plan describing how he  would mitigate a problem, if it were caused by the surface release of  mining vessel discharges, including a plan for the monitoring of any  discharges. Based upon monitoring results, NOAA may find it necessary in  the future to specify particular procedures for minimizing adverse  environmental effects. These procedures would be incorporated into  permit TCRs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> NOAA will require the permittee to report, prior to  implementation, any proposed technological or operational changes that  will increase or have unknown environmental effects. Changes in  composition, concentration or size distribution of suspended  particulates discharged from the mining vessel, water depth of vessel  discharges, depth of cut in the seafloor of the mining collector, and  direction or amount of sediment discharged at the seafloor are factors  of concern to NOAA. In reporting any such change, the permittee shall  submit information to indicate the use of BAT, alternatives considered,  and rationale for selecting one technology in place of another, in a  manner comparable to and to the extent required in paragraph (a) of this  section. If proposed changes have a high potential for increasing  adverse environmental effects, the Administrator may disapprove or  require modification of the changes.</p>
