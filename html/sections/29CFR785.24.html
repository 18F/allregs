                                Sec. 785.24  Principles noted in Portal-to-Portal Bulletin.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">In November, 1947, the Administrator issued the Portal-to-Portal  Bulletin (part 790 of this chapter). In dealing with this subject, Sec.  790.8 (b) and (c) of this chapter said:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The term ``principal activities'' includes all activities which  are an integral part of a principal activity. Two examples of what is  meant by an integral part of a principal activity are found in the  report of the Judiciary Committee of the Senate on the Portal-to-Portal  bill. They are the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In connection with the operation of a lathe, an employee will  frequently, at the commencement of his workday, oil, grease, or clean  his machine, or install a new cutting tool. Such activities are an  integral part of the principal activity, and are included within such  term.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a garment worker in a textile mill, who is  required to report 30 minutes before other employees report to commence  their principal activities, and who during such 30 minutes distributes  clothing or parts of clothing at the workbenches of other employees and  gets machines in readiness for operation by other employees, such  activities are among the principal activities of such employee.  Such preparatory activities, which the Administrator has always regarded  as work and as compensable under the Fair Labor Standards Act, remain so  under the Portal Act, regardless of contrary custom or contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Among the activities included as an integral part of a principal  activity are those closely related activities which are indispensable to  its performance. If an employee in a chemical plant, for example, cannot  perform his principal activities without putting on certain clothes,  changing clothes on the employer's premises at the beginning and end of  the workday would be an integral part of the employee's principal  activity. On the other hand, if changing clothes is merely a convenience  to the employee and not directly related to his principal activities, it  would be considered as a ``preliminary'' or ``postliminary'' activity  rather than a principal part of the activity. However, activities such  as checking in and out and waiting in line to do so would not ordinarily  be regarded as integral parts of the principal activity or activities.</p>
