                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. Article XI of the Treaty provides general guidelines for meetings of the countries that have ratified, accepted, approved, or acceded to CITES. The Parties currently meet for 2 weeks every 3 years. At these meetings, the Parties consider amendments to the Appendices and resolutions and decisions to improve the implementation of CITES. The Parties adopt amendments to the lists of species in Appendix I and II and resolutions by a two-thirds majority of Parties present and voting. The Secretariat or any

Party may also submit reports on wildlife and plant trade for consideration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> CoP locations and dates. At a CoP, Parties interested in hosting the next meeting notify the Secretariat. The Parties vote to select the location of the next CoP. Once a country has been chosen, it works with the Secretariat to set the date and specific venue. The Secretariat then notifies the Parties of the date for the next CoP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Attendance at a CoP. All Parties may participate and vote at a CoP. Non-Party countries may participate, but may not vote. Organizations technically qualified in protection, conservation, or management of wildlife or plants may participate in a CoP as observers if they are approved, but they are not eligible to vote.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> International organizations must apply to the CITES Secretariat for approval to attend a CoP as an observer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> National organizations must apply to the Management Authority of the country where they are located for approval to attend a CoP as an observer.</p>
