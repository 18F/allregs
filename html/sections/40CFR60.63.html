For any kiln subject to an emissions limitation on PM, NOX, or SO2 emissions (lb/ton of clinker), you must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Determine hourly clinker production by one of two methods:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a permanent weigh scale system to measure and record weight rates of the amount of clinker produced in tons of mass per hour.

The system of measuring feed must be maintained within 5 percent accuracy. Calculate your hourly clinker production rate using a kiln specific feed-to-clinker ratio based on reconciled clinker production rates determined for accounting purposes and recorded feed rates. This ratio should be updated monthly. Note that if this ratio changes at clinker reconciliation, you must use the new ratio going forward, but you do not have to retroactively change clinker production rates previously estimated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For each kiln operating hour for which you do not have data on clinker production or the amount of feed to the kiln, use the value from the most recent previous hour for which valid data are available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determine, record, and maintain a record of the accuracy of the system of measuring hourly clinker production rates or feed rates before initial use (for new sources) or by the effective compliance date of this rule (for existing sources). During each quarter of source operation, you must determine, record, and maintain a record of the ongoing accuracy of the system of measuring hourly clinker production rates or feed rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If you measure clinker production directly, record the daily clinker production rates; if you measure the kiln feed rates and calculate clinker production, record the daily kiln feed and clinker production rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> PM Emissions Monitoring Requirements. (1) For each kiln or clinker cooler subject to a PM emissions limit in Sec. 60.62, you must demonstrate compliance through an initial performance test. You will conduct your performance test using Method 5 or Method 5I at appendix A-3 to part 60 of this chapter. You must also monitor continuous performance through use of a PM continuous parametric monitoring system (PM CPMS).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For each kiln or clinker cooler subject to a PM emissions limit in Sec. 60.62, you must demonstrate compliance through an initial performance test. You will conduct your performance test using Method 5 or Method 5I at appendix A-3 to part 60 of this chapter. You must also monitor continuous performance through use of a PM continuous parametric monitoring system (PM CPMS).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For your PM CPMS, you will establish a site-specific operating limit. If your PM performance test demonstrates your PM emission levels to be below 75 percent of your emission limit you will use the average PM CPMS value recorded during the PM compliance test, the milliamp equivalent of zero output from your PM CPMS, and the average PM result of your compliance test to establish your operating limit equivalent to 75 percent of the standard. If your PM compliance test demonstrates your PM emission levels to be at or above 75 percent of your emission limit you will use the average PM CPMS value recorded during the PM compliance test demonstrating compliance with the PM limit to establish your operating limit. You will use the PM CPMS to demonstrate continuous compliance with your operating limit. You must repeat the performance test annually and reassess and adjust the site-specific operating limit in accordance with the results of the performance test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Your PM CPMS must provide a 4-20 milliamp output and the establishment of its relationship to manual reference method measurements must be determined in units of milliamps.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Your PM CPMS operating range must be capable of reading PM concentrations from zero to a level equivalent to two times your allowable emission limit. If your PM CPMS is an auto-ranging instrument capable of multiple scales, the primary range of the instrument must be capable of reading PM concentration from zero to a level equivalent to two times your allowable emission limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> During the initial performance test or any such subsequent performance test that demonstrates compliance with the PM limit, record and average all milliamp output values from the PM CPMS for the periods corresponding to the compliance test runs (e.g., average all your PM CPMS output values for three corresponding 2-hour Method 5I test runs).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Determine your operating limit as specified in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(5) of this section. If your PM performance test demonstrates your PM emission levels to be below 75 percent of your emission limit you will use the average PM CPMS value recorded during the PM compliance test, the milliamp equivalent of zero output from your PM CPMS, and the average

PM result of your compliance test to establish your operating limit. If your PM compliance test demonstrates your PM emission levels to be at or above 75 percent of your emission limit you will use the average PM CPMS value recorded during the PM compliance test to establish your operating limit. You must verify an existing or establish a new operating limit after each repeated performance test. You must repeat the performance test at least annually and reassess and adjust the site-specific operating limit in accordance with the results of the performance test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the average of your three Method 5 or 5I compliance test runs are below 75 percent of your PM emission limit, you must calculate an operating limit by establishing a relationship of PM CPMS signal to PM concentration using the PM CPMS instrument zero, the average PM CPMS values corresponding to the three compliance test runs, and the average PM concentration from the Method 5 or 5I compliance test with the procedures in (c)(4)(i)(A) through (D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determine your PM CPMS instrument zero output with one of the following procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Zero point data for in-situ instruments should be obtained by removing the instrument from the stack and monitoring ambient air on a test bench.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Zero point data for extractive instruments should be obtained by removing the extractive probe from the stack and drawing in clean ambient air.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The zero point can also can be obtained by performing manual reference method measurements when the flue gas is free of PM emissions or contains very low PM concentrations (e.g., when your process is not operating, but the fans are operating or your source is combusting only natural gas) and plotting these with the compliance data to find the zero intercept.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If none of the steps in paragraphs (c)(4)(i)(A) through (C) of this section are possible, you must use a zero output value provided by the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determine your PM CPMS instrument average in milliamps, and the average of your corresponding three PM compliance test runs, using equation 1.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR12FE13.000

You must demonstrate continuous compliance by using all quality-assured hourly average data collected by the PM CPMS for all operating hours to calculate the arithmetic average operating parameter in units of the operating limit (milliamps) on a 30 operating day rolling average basis, updated at the end of each new kiln operating day. Use Equation 5 to determine the 30 kiln operating day average.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR12FE13.004

For each performance test, conduct at least three separate runs under the conditions

that exist when the affected source is operating at the highest load or capacity level reasonably expected to occur. Conduct each test run to collect a minimum sample volume of 2 dscm for determining compliance with a new source limit and 1 dscm for determining compliance with an existing source limit. Calculate the average of the results from three consecutive runs to determine compliance. You need not determine the particulate matter collected in the impingers (``back half'') of the Method 5 or Method 5I particulate sampling train to demonstrate compliance with the PM standards of this subpart. This shall not preclude the permitting authority from requiring a determination of the ''back half'' for other purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> For PM performance test reports used to set a PM CPMS operating limit, the electronic submission of the test report must also include the make and model of the PM CPMS instrument, serial number of the instrument, analytical principle of the instrument (e.g. beta attenuation), span of the instruments primary analytical range, milliamp value equivalent to the instrument zero output, technique by which this zero value was determined, and the average milliamp signals corresponding to each PM compliance test run.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> You must install, operate, calibrate, and maintain a CEMS continuously monitoring and recording the concentration by volume of NOX emissions into the atmosphere for any kiln subject to the NOX emissions limit in Sec. 60.62(a)(3). If the kiln has an alkali bypass, NOX emissions from the alkali bypass do not need to be monitored, and NOX emission monitoring of the kiln exhaust may be done upstream of any commingled alkali bypass gases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> You must install, operate, calibrate, and maintain a CEMS for continuously monitoring and recording the concentration by volume of SO2 emissions into the atmosphere for any kiln subject to the SO2 emissions limit in Sec. 60.62(a)(4). If you are complying with the alternative 90 percent SO2 emissions reduction emissions limit, you must also continuously monitor and record the concentration by volume of SO2 present at the wet scrubber inlet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The NOX and SO2 CEMS required under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section must be installed, operated and maintained according to Performance Specification 2 of appendix B of this part and the requirements in paragraphs (f)(1) through (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The span value of each NOX CEMS monitor must be set at 125 percent of the maximum estimated hourly potential NOX emission concentration that translates to the applicable emissions limit at full clinker production capacity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> You must conduct performance evaluations of each NOX CEMS monitor according to the requirements in Sec. 60.13(c) and Performance Specification 2 of appendix B to this part. You must use Methods 7, 7A, 7C, 7D, or 7E of appendix A-4 to this part for conducting the relative accuracy evaluations. The method ASME PTC 19.10-1981, ``Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses,'' (incorporated by reference--see Sec. 60.17) is an acceptable alternative to Method 7 or 7C of appendix A-4 to this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The span value for the SO2 CEMS monitor is the SO2 emission concentration that corresponds to 125 percent of the applicable emissions limit at full clinker production capacity and the expected maximum fuel sulfur content.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> You must conduct performance evaluations of each SO2 CEMS monitor according to the requirements in Sec. 60.13(c) and Performance Specification 2 of appendix B to this part.

A monitoring system malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring system failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. An owner or operator must use all the data collected during all other periods in reporting emissions or operating levels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> You must meet the requirements of Sec. 60.13(h) when determining the 1-hour averages of emissions data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> You must install, operate, calibrate, and maintain instruments for continuously measuring and recording the stack gas flow rate to allow determination of the pollutant mass emissions rate to the atmosphere for each kiln subject to the PM emissions limits in Sec. 60.62(a)(1)(ii) and (iii) and (b)(1)(i) and (ii), the NOX emissions limit in Sec. 60.62(a)(3), or the SO2 emissions limit in Sec. 60.62(a)(4) according to the requirements in paragraphs (h)(1) through (10), where appropriate, of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator must install each sensor of the flow rate monitoring system in a location that provides representative measurement of the exhaust gas flow rate at the sampling location of the NOX and/or SO2 CEMS, taking into account the manufacturer's recommendations.
