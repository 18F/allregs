                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must conduct all applicable performance tests according to  the procedures in Sec. 63.9020 on the earlier of your title V operating  permit renewal or within 5 years of issuance of your title V permit. For  emission points meeting the outlet concentration limits in table 1 to  this subpart without the use of a control device, all applicable  performance tests must also be conducted whenever process changes are  made that could reasonably be expected to increase the outlet  concentration. Examples of process   changes include, but are not limited to, changes in production capacity,  production rate, feedstock type, or catalyst type, or whenever there is  replacement, removal, or addition of recovery equipment. For purposes of  this paragraph, process changes do not include: process upsets and  unintentional, temporary process changes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must report the results of subsequent performance tests  within 60 days after the completion of the test. This report should also  verify that the operating limits for your affected source have not  changed or provide documentation of revised operating limits established  as specified in Table 2 to this subpart. The reports for all subsequent  performance tests should include all applicable information required in  Sec. 63.9050.  [68 FR 19090, Apr. 17, 2003, as amended at 71 FR 17745, Apr. 7, 2006]</p>
