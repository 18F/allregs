It should be noted that the existence of  legislation, court order, or Presidential mandate is not, of itself, a  sufficient basis for a JOFOC. However, the circumstances necessitating  legislation, court order, or Presidential mandate may justify  contractual action on an other than full and open competition basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> for contents of the evaluation document).
