If that occurs, we will reduce the historic coal funds we distribute to you to the amount that you need to fully fund reclamation of all your remaining Priority 1 or 2 coal problems.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> We award these funds to you in grants according to the provisions of part 886 of this chapter.</p>
