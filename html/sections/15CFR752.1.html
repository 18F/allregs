This part describes the provisions of the Special Comprehensive License (SCL). You may apply for an SCL, when appropriate, in lieu of a license described in part 748 of the EAR, or a License Exception described in part 740 of the EAR, for multiple exports and reexports of items subject to the EAR. The SCL provides authorization to make specified exports and reexports that are otherwise prohibited by General Prohibitions One, Two, and Three described in part 736 of the EAR. The existence of an SCL does not supersede an exporter's obligation to request a separate license as may be required by part 744 of the EAR. Because the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) does not review each individual transaction authorized by an SCL, parties to the SCL must have the mechanisms in place to ensure that each export and reexport made under an SCL meets all the terms and conditions of the license and are in accordance with all applicable provisions of the EAR. It is through the design and effective implementation of an Internal Control Program (ICP) that the SCL holder and the SCL consignee (referred to as ``consignee'' for purposes of this part) assure that exports and reexports are not made contrary to the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Introduction.

To qualify for an SCL, you must develop an ICP. Section 752.11 of this part includes a general description of the elements of the ICP, and guidance on which elements your company must implement before making shipments under the SCL. The elements of the ICP your company will develop reflect the complexity of the activities authorized under the SCL, the countries and items involved, and the relationship between the SCL holder and the approved consignees. BIS may require you to include in your ICP any combination of elements, depending upon the nature of your SCL application. During your pre-application consultation required by Sec. 752.5(a)(1), BIS will provide you guidance on which elements you must implement.
