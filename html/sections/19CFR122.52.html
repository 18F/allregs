Each commercial aircraft shall proceed under a permit on Customs Form 7507 or 7509, as provided in Sec. 122.54. Treatment of the aircraft as other than an imported article shall continue for so long as the aircraft:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is used only for commercial purposes between the U.S. and foreign areas; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Will leave the U.S. for a foreign destination in commercial use or carrying neither passengers nor cargo.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Treatment as an imported article.
