                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Noninvestment income. Each financial disclosure report filed  pursuant to this subpart shall disclose the source, type, and the actual  amount or value, of earned or other noninvestment income in excess of  $200 from any one source which is received by the filer or has accrued  to his benefit during the reporting period, including:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Salaries, fees, commissions, wages and any other compensation  for personal services (other than from United States Government  employment);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Retirement benefits (other than from United States Government  employment, including the Thrift Savings Plan, or from Social Security);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any honoraria, and the date services were provided, including  payments made or to be made to charitable organizations on behalf of the  filer in lieu of honoraria; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any other noninvestment income, such as prizes, awards, or  discharge of indebtedness.</p><p class="depth3">Note: In calculating the amount of an honorarium, subtract any  actual and necessary travel expenses incurred by the recipient and one  relative. For example, if such expenses are paid or reimbursed by the  honorarium source, they shall not be counted as part of the honorarium  payment; if the expenses are paid or reimbursed by the individual  receiving the honorarium, the amount of honorarium shall be reduced by  the amount of such expenses.</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. An official is a participant in a retirement plan of  Coastal Airlines. Pursuant to such plan, the official and his spouse  receive passage on some Coastal flights without charge, and they receive  passage on other flights at a discounted fare. The difference between  what Coastal charges members of the public generally and what the  official and his spouse are charged for a particular flight is deemed  income in-kind and must be disclosed by this reporting individual if it  exceeds the $200 threshold.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. An official serves on the board of directors at a bank,  for which he receives a $500 fee each calendar quarter. He also receives  an annual fee of $1,500 for service as trustee of a private trust. In  both instances, such fees received or earned during the reporting period  must be disclosed, and the actual amount must be shown.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Investment income. Each financial disclosure report filed  pursuant to this subpart shall disclose:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The source and type of investment income, characterized as  dividends, rents, interest, capital gains, or income from qualified or  excepted trusts or excepted investment funds (see Sec. 2634.310 of this  subpart), which is received by the filer or accrued to his benefit  during the reporting period, and which exceeds $200 in amount or value  from any one source. Examples include, but are not limited to, income  derived from real estate, collectible items, stocks, bonds, notes,  copyrights, pensions, mutual funds, the investment portion of life  insurance contracts, loans, and personal savings accounts (as defined in  Sec. 2634.301(c)(2) of this subpart). Note that for entities with  portfolio holdings, such as Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA's),  brokerage accounts, trusts, and mutual or pension funds, each underlying  source of income must be separately disclosed, unless the entity  qualifies for special treatment under Sec. 2634.310 of this subpart. The  amount or value of income from each reported source shall also be  disclosed and categorized in accordance with the following table:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Not more than $1,000;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Greater than $1,000 but not more than $2,500;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Greater than $2,500 but not more than $5,000;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Greater than $5,000 but not more than $15,000;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Greater than $15,000 but not more than $50,000;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Greater than $50,000 but not more than $100,000;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Greater than $100,000 but not more than $1,000,000; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Greater than $1,000,000;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Provided that, with respect to investment income of the filer  alone or joint investment income of the filer with the filer's spouse  and/or dependent children, the following additional categories over  $1,000,000 shall apply:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Greater than $1,000,000 but not more than $5,000,000; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Greater than $5,000,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The source, type, andthe actual amount or value of gross income  from a business, distributive share of a partnership, joint business  venture income, payments from an estate or an annuity or endowment  contract, or any other items of income not otherwise covered by  paragraphs (a) or (b)(1) of this section which are received by the filer  or accrued to his benefit during the reporting period and which exceed  $200 from any one source.</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. An official rents out a portion of his residence. He  receives rental income of $600 from one individual for four months and  $1,200 from another individual for the remaining eight months of the  year covered by his incumbent financial disclosure report. He must  identify the property, specify the type of income (rent), and indicate  the category   of the total amount of rent received. (He must also disclose the asset  information required by Sec. 2634.301 of this subpart.)</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. A reporting individual has three savings accounts with  Bank A. One is in his name and earned $85 in interest during the  reporting period. One is in a joint account with his spouse and earned  $120 in interest. One is in his name and his dependent daughter's name  and earned $35 in interest. Since the aggregate interest income from  this source exceeds $200, the official must disclose the name of the  bank, the type of income, and the category of the total amount of  interest earned from all three accounts. (He must also disclose the  accounts as assets under Sec. 2634.301 of this subpart if, in the  aggregate, they total more than $5,000 in that bank.)</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. An official has an ownership interest in a fast-food  restaurant, from which she receives $10,000 in annual income. She must  specify on her financial disclosure report the type of income, such as  partnership distributive share or gross business income, and indicate  the actual amount of such income. (Additionally, she must describe the  business and categorize its asset value, pursuant to Sec. 2634.301 of  this subpart).
