                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Use. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Grant funds may be used for rental assistance for  homeless individuals and families. Rental assistance cannot be provided  to a program participant who is already receiving rental assistance, or  living in a housing unit receiving rental assistance or operating  assistance through other federal, State, or local sources.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The rental assistance may be short-term, up to 3 months of rent;  medium-term, for 3 to 24 months of rent; or long-term, for longer than  24 months of rent and must be administered in accordance with the  policies and procedures established by the Continuum as set forth in  Sec.  578.7(a)(9) and this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The rental assistance may be tenant-based, project-based, or  sponsor-based, and may be for transitional or permanent housing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Grant funds may be used for security deposits in an amount not  to exceed 2 months of rent. An advance payment of the last month's rent  may be provided to the landlord, in addition to the security deposit and  payment of first month's rent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Rental assistance administrator. Rental assistance must be  administered by a State, unit of general local government, or a public  housing agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Tenant-based rental assistance. Tenant-based rental assistance  is rental assistance in which program participants choose housing of an  appropriate size in which to reside. When necessary to facilitate the  coordination of supportive services, recipients and subrecipients may  require program participants to live in a specific area for their entire  period of participation, or in a specific structure for the first year  and in a specific area for the remainder of their period of  participation. Program participants who are receiving rental assistance  in transitional housing may be required to live in a specific structure  for their entire period of participation in transitional housing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Up to 5 years worth of rental assistance may be awarded to a  project in one competition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Program participants who have complied with all program  requirements during their residence retain the rental assistance if they  move within the Continuum of Care geographic area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Program participants who have complied with all program  requirements during their residence and who have been a victim of  domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, and who  reasonably believe they are imminently threatened by harm from further  domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking (which  would include threats from a third party, such as a friend or family  member of the perpetrator of the violence), if they remain in the  assisted unit, and are able to document the violence and basis for their  belief, may retain the rental assistance and move to a different  Continuum of Care geographic area if they move out of the assisted unit  to protect their health and safety.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Sponsor-based rental assistance. Sponsor-based rental assistance  is provided through contracts between the recipient and sponsor  organization. A sponsor may be a private, nonprofit organization, or a  community mental health agency established as a public nonprofit  organization. Program participants must reside in housing owned or  leased by the sponsor. Up to 5 years worth of rental assistance may be  awarded to a project in one competition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Project-based rental assistance. Project-based rental assistance  is provided through a contract with the owner of an existing structure,  where the owner agrees to lease the subsidized units to program  participants. Program participants will not retain rental assistance if  they move. Up to 15 years of rental assistance may be awarded in one  competition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Grant amount. The amount of rental assistance in each project  will be based on the number and size of units proposed by the applicant  to be assisted over the grant period. The amount of rental assistance in  each project will be calculated by multiplying the number and size of  units proposed by the FMR of each unit on   the date the application is submitted to HUD, by the term of the grant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Rent reasonableness. HUD will only provide rental assistance for  a unit if the rent is reasonable. The recipient or subrecipient must  determine whether the rent charged for the unit receiving rental  assistance is reasonable in relation to rents being charged for  comparable unassisted units, taking into account the location, size,  type, quality, amenities, facilities, and management and maintenance of  each unit. Reasonable rent must not exceed rents currently being charged  by the same owner for comparable unassisted units.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Payment of grant. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The amount of rental assistance in each  project will be reserved for rental assistance over the grant period. An  applicant's request for rental assistance in each grant is an estimate  of the amount needed for rental assistance. Recipients will make draws  from the grant funds to pay the actual costs of rental assistance for  program participants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For tenant-based rental assistance, on demonstration of need:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Up to 25 percent of the total rental assistance awarded may be  spent in any year of a 5-year grant term; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A higher percentage if approved in advance by HUD, if the  recipient provides evidence satisfactory to HUD that it is financially  committed to providing the housing assistance described in the  application for the full 5-year period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A recipient must serve at least as many program participants as  shown in its application for assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the amount in each grant reserved for rental assistance over  the grant period exceeds the amount that will be needed to pay the  actual costs of rental assistance, due to such factors as contract rents  being lower than FMRs and program participants being able to pay a  portion of the rent, recipients or subrecipients may use the excess  funds for covering the costs of rent increases, or for serving a greater  number of program participants.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Vacancies. If a unit assisted under this section is vacated  before the expiration of the lease, the assistance for the unit may  continue for a maximum of 30 days from the end of the month in which the  unit was vacated, unless occupied by another eligible person. No  additional assistance will be paid until the unit is occupied by another  eligible person. Brief periods of stays in institutions, not to exceed  90 days for each occurrence, are not considered vacancies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Property damage. Recipients and subrecipients may use grant  funds in an amount not to exceed one month's rent to pay for any damage  to housing due to the action of a program participant. This shall be a  one-time cost per participant, incurred at the time a participant exits  a housing unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Resident rent. Rent must be calculated as provided in Sec.   578.77. Rents collected from program participants are program income and  may be used as provided under Sec.  578.97.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Leases. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Initial lease. For project-based, sponsor-based, or  tenant-based rental assistance, program participants must enter into a  lease agreement for a term of at least one year, which is terminable for  cause. The leases must be automatically renewable upon expiration for  terms that are a minimum of one month long, except on prior notice by  either party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Initial lease for transitional housing. Program participants in  transitional housing must enter into a lease agreement for a term of at  least one month. The lease must be automatically renewable upon  expiration, except on prior notice by either party, up to a maximum term  of 24 months.</p>
