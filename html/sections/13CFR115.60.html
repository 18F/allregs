                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Selection of PSB Sureties. SBA's selection of PSB Sureties will  be guided by, but not limited to, these factors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An underwriting limitation of at least $2,000,000 on the U.S.  Treasury Department list of acceptable sureties;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An agreement that the Surety will neither charge a bond premium  in excess of that authorized by the appropriate State insurance  department, nor impose any non-premium fee unless such fee is permitted  by applicable State law and approved by SBA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Premium income from contract bonds guaranteed by any government  agency (Federal, State or local) of no more than one- quarter of the  total contract bond premium income of the Surety;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The vesting of underwriting authority for SBA guaranteed bonds  only in employees of the Surety;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The vesting of final settlement authority for claims and  recovery under the PSB program only in employees of the Surety's  permanent claims department; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The rating or ranking designations assigned to the Surety by  recognized authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Admission of PSB Sureties. A Surety admitted to the PSB program  must execute a PSB Agreement before approving SBA guaranteed bonds. No  SBA guarantee attaches to bonds approved before the D/SG or designee has  countersigned the Agreement.
