                            <p class="depth0">When the owner requests HUD approval of adjustment in Contract Rents under Sec. 886.112, an analysis of the project's Utility Allowances must be included. Such data as changes in utility rates and other facts affecting utility consumption should be provided as part of this analysis to permit appropriate adjustments in the Utility Allowances. In addition, when approval of a utility rate change would result in a cumulative increase of 10 percent or more in the most recently approved Utility Allowances, the owner must advise the Secretary and request approval of new Utility Allowances.
