                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Assessment of fees, generally. FHFA or FHFA-OIG will assess you  for fees covering the direct costs of responding to your request and  costs for duplicating records, except as otherwise provided in a statute  with respect to the determination of fees that may be assessed for  disclosure, search time, or review of particular records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Assessment of fees, categories of requesters. The fees that FHFA  or FHFA-OIG may assess vary depending on the type of request or the type  of requester you are--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Commercial use. If you request records for a commercial use, the  fees that FHFA or FHFA-OIG may assess are limited to FHFA's or FHFA- OIG's operating costs incurred for document search, review, and  duplication.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Educational institution, noncommercial scientific institution,  or representative of the news media. If you are not requesting records  for commercial use and you are an educational institution or a  noncommercial scientific institution, whose purpose is scholarly or  scientific research, or a representative of the news media, the fees  that may be assessed are limited to standard reasonable charges for  duplication in excess of 100 pages or an electronic equivalent of 100  pages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other. If neither paragraph (b)(1) nor paragraph (b)(2) of this  section applies, the fees assessed are limited to the costs for document  searching in excess of two hours and duplication in excess of 100 pages,  or an electronic equivalent of 100 pages.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fee schedule. The current schedule of fees is maintained on  FHFA's Web site at: http://www.fhfa.gov.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $100.00. When FHFA or  FHFA-OIG determines or estimates that the fees chargeable to you will  exceed $100.00, you will be notified of the actual or estimated amount  of fees you will incur, unless you earlier indicated your willingness to  pay fees as high as those anticipated. When you are notified that the  actual or estimated fees exceed $100.00, your FOIA request will not be  considered received by FHFA or FHFA-OIG until you agree to pay the  anticipated total fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Advance payment of fees. FHFA or FHFA-OIG may request that you  pay estimated fees or a deposit in advance of responding to your  request. If FHFA or FHFA-OIG requests advance payment or a deposit, your  request will not be considered received by FHFA or FHFA-OIG until the  advance payment or deposit is received. FHFA or FHFA-OIG will request  advance payment or a deposit if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The fees are likely to exceed $500.00. FHFA or FHFA-OIG will  notify you of the likely cost and obtain from you satisfactory assurance  of full payment if you have a history of prompt payment of FOIA fees to  FHFA or FHFA-OIG;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You do not have a history of payment, or if the estimate of fees  exceeds $1,000.00, FHFA or FHFA-OIG may require an advance payment of  fees in an amount up to the full estimated charge that will be incurred;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You previously failed to pay a fee to FHFA or FHFA-OIG in a  timely fashion, i.e., within 30 calendar days of the date of a billing,  FHFA or FHFA-OIG may require you to make advance payment of the full  amount of the fees anticipated before processing a new request or  finishing processing of a pending request; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You have an outstanding balance due from a prior request. FHFA  or FHFA-OIG may require you to pay the full amount owed plus any  applicable interest, as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, or  demonstrate that the fee owed has been paid, as well as payment of the  full amount of anticipated fees before processing your request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Interest. FHFA or FHFA-OIG may charge you interest on an unpaid  bill starting on the 31st calendar day following the day on which the  bill was sent. Once a fee payment has been received by FHFA or FHFA-OIG,  even if not processed, FHFA or FHFA-OIG will stay the accrual of  interest. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate prescribed by 31  U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date of the billing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> FHFA or FHFA-OIG assistance to reduce costs. If FHFA or FHFA-OIG  notifies you of estimated fees exceeding $100.00 or requests advance  payment or a deposit, you will have an opportunity to consult with FHFA  or FHFA-OIG FOIA staff to modify or reformulate your request to meet  your needs at a lower cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Fee waiver requests. You may request a fee waiver in accordance  with FOIA and this regulation. FHFA or FHFA-OIG may grant your fee  waiver request if disclosure of the information is in the public  interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public  understanding of the operations or activities of the Federal Government  and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. In  submitting a fee waiver request, you   must address the following six factors--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether the subject of the requested records concerns the  operations or activities of the Federal Government;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute to an  understanding of Federal Government operations or activities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute  to public understanding;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to  public understanding of Federal Government operations or activities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be  furthered by the requested disclosure; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of  the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public  interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial  interest of the requester.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Determination on request. FHFA or FHFA-OIG will notify you  within 20 days of receipt of your request whether the fee waiver has  been granted. A request for fee waiver that is denied may only be  appealed when a final decision has been made on the initial FOIA  request.</p>
