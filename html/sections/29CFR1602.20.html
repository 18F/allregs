                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Every person required to file Report EEO-2 shall make or keep  such records as are necessary for its completion under the conditions  and circumstances set forth in the instructions accompanying the report,  which are specifically incorporated herein by reference and have the  same force and effect as other sections of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Every employer, labor organization, and joint labor-management  committee subject to title VII which controls an apprenticeship program  (regardless of any joint or individual obligation to file a report)  shall beginning August 1, 1967, maintain a list in chronological order  containing the names and addresses of all persons who have applied to  participate in the apprenticeship program, including the dates on which  such applications were received. (See section 709(c), title VII, Civil  Rights Act of 1964.) Such list shall, contain a notation of the sex of  the applicant and of the applicant's identification as ``White,''  ``Black,'' ``Hispanic,'' ``Asian or Pacific Islander'' or ``American  Indian or Alaskan Native.'' The methods of making such identification  are set forth in the instruction accompanying Report EEO-2. The words  ``applied,'' ``applicant'' and ``application'' as used in this section  refer to situations involving actual applications only. An applicant is  considered to be a person who files a formal application, or in some  informal way indicates a specific intention to be considered for  admission to the apprenticeship program. A person who casually appears  to make an informal inquiry about the program, or about apprenticeship  in general, is not considered to be an applicant. The term  ``apprenticeship program'' as used herein refers to programs described  in the instructions accompanying Report EEO-2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In lieu of maintaining the chronological list referred to in  Sec. 1602.20 (b), persons required to compile the list may maintain on  file written applications for participation in the apprenticeship  program, provided that the application form contains a notation of the  date the form was received, the address of the applicant, and a notation  of the sex, and the race, color, or national origin of the applicant as  described above.
