                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em>  apply only to this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Classified Information means information that is classified for  national security purposes under Executive Order No. 12958, entitled  ``Classified National Security Information,'' including any amendments  or superseding orders that the President of the United States may issue  from time to time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Confidential Supervisory Information means confidential  supervisory information of the Board, as defined in 12 CFR 261.2(c).  Three internal security designations, which are subject to change by the  Board, apply to Confidential Supervisory Information. Those designations  are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Restricted-Controlled FR generally applies to information that,  if disclosed to or modified by unauthorized individuals, might result in  the risk of serious monetary loss, serious productivity loss or serious  embarrassment to the Federal Reserve System. Examples   of Confidential Supervisory Information designated as Restricted- Controlled FR include, but are not limited to, certain significant lists  of financial institution supervisory ratings and nonpublic advance  information regarding bank mergers or failures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Restricted FR covers information that is less sensitive than  Restricted-Controlled FR information and, in general, is the largest  category of Confidential Supervisory Information. This information, if  disclosed to or modified by unauthorized individuals, might result in  the risk of significant monetary loss, significant productivity loss, or  significant embarrassment to the Federal Reserve System. Examples of  Confidential Supervisory Information designated as Restricted FR  include, but are not limited to, single supervisory ratings (e.g.,  CAMELS, BOPEC, etc.), Federal Reserve examination and inspection reports  and workpapers, Interagency Country Exposure Review Committee (ICERC)  country exposure determinations, and shared national credit data or  listings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Internal FR covers information that is less sensitive than  Restricted FR or Restricted-Controlled FR and generally applies to  information that, if disclosed to or modified by unauthorized  individuals, might result in the risk of some monetary loss, some  productivity loss, or some embarrassment to the Federal Reserve System.  Examples of Confidential Supervisory Information designated as Internal  FR include, but are not limited to, foreign banking organization country  studies and Federal Reserve risk assessments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Country List refers to the list contained in the annual federal  appropriations laws of specific countries, including a general category  of ``countries allied with the United States in a current defense  effort,'' from which particular categories of persons who are exempt  from a ban on the use of appropriated funds are eligible to be hired as  Federal employees in the excepted service or in the senior executive  service. The appropriations ban is codified at 5 U.S.C. 3101 note. The  list of eligible countries and persons is subject to legislative and  other change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Eligible Position refers to a position or job family requiring  access to Sensitive Information for which the Board determines that  hiring a Non-Citizen is appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Employee means an individual who works full-time or part-time  and is appointed into Board service for a period of more than 90 days.  The term ``Employee'' does not include members of the Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> FOMC Information means confidential information of the Federal  Open Market Committee (FOMC) regardless of the form or format in which  it is created, conveyed, or maintained. FOMC Information includes  information derived from confidential FOMC materials. Three internal  security designations, which are subject to change by the FOMC, apply to  FOMC Information as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Class I FOMC generally applies to materials containing  policymaker input, such as that related to monetary policy decisions at  meetings, views expressed by policy makers on future policy, and  identification of meeting participants who express particular views.  Examples of Class I FOMC Information include, but are not limited to,  the ``Bluebook,'' drafts of meeting minutes, unreleased meeting  transcripts, documents reflecting the preparation of semi-annual  forecasts and related testimony, and certain sensitive internal  memorandums and reports.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Class II FOMC covers information that is less sensitive than  Class I FOMC. This designation generally applies to staff forecasts  prepared for the FOMC and to information about open market operations.  Examples of Class II FOMC Information include, but are not limited to,  Part I of the ``Greenbook,'' reports of the Manager on domestic and  foreign open market operations, and other materials on economic and  financial developments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Class III FOMC covers information that is less sensitive than  either Class II or Class I. This designation generally applies to  background information supporting policy discussions and includes, but  is not limited to, Part II of the Greenbook.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> National refers to any individual who meets the requirements  described in 8 U.S.C. 1408.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Non-Citizen refers to any individual who is not a Protected  Individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Protected Individual means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A citizen or National of the United States,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An alien who:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Meets the conditions set forth in 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3)(B), as  amended, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Has filed with the Board or the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank  a declaration of intention to become a citizen of the United States, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An alien who:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Is lawfully admitted for permanent residence, is admitted for  temporary residence under 8 U.S.C. 1160(a) or section 1255a(a)(1), is  admitted as a refugee under 8 U.S.C. 1157, or is granted asylum under 8  U.S.C. 1158;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Was an Employee of the Board or a Federal Reserve Bank on  January 1, 2006;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Before requesting access to Sensitive Information filed an  application for U.S. citizenship;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Has had his or her application for citizenship pending for two  years or less, unless in the case of an application pending for a longer  period, the alien can establish that the alien is actively pursuing  naturalization. Time consumed by the Department of Homeland Security,  Citizenship and Immigration Services (or its predecessor or successor  agency) in processing the application shall not be counted toward the 2- year period; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Has completed a background investigation acceptable to the  Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Sensitive Information means FOMC Information, Classified  Information, and Confidential Supervisory Information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Hiring and access--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Prohibition against hiring unauthorized  aliens. An individual is eligible for employment with the Board only if  he or she satisfies the requirements of Section 101 of the Immigration  Reform and Control Act of 1986, 8 U.S.C. 1324a.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Preference. Consistent with applicable law, where two applicants  for employment at the Board are equally qualified for a position, the  Board shall prefer the citizen or National of the United States over the  equally qualified person who is not a citizen or National of the United  States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Protected Individuals' access to Sensitive Information. The  Board may hire a person as an Employee into a position that requires  access to Sensitive Information if the person is a Protected Individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Non-Citizens' access to Sensitive Information. The Board shall  not hire a Non-Citizen into a position that requires access to Sensitive  Information unless the Non-Citizen:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is in an Eligible Position; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section  allowing access to Sensitive Information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Access to Sensitive Information--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Generally. The Board will  grant access to Sensitive Information only in accordance with the  Board's rules and policies regarding access to Sensitive Information  and, if applicable, the rules and policies of the FOMC. Access to any  level of Sensitive Information includes access to all lower levels of  that type of Sensitive Information. An Employee who is not a Protected  Individual may not have access to FOMC Information or Confidential  Supervisory Information unless otherwise permitted by this paragraph  (c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> FOMC Information--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Access by a Non-Citizen from a country on  the Country List. An Employee in an Eligible Position who is a Non- Citizen from a country that, on the date the Employee begins employment  with the Federal Reserve System or on the date access is granted, is on  the Country List shall be granted access to Class I FOMC Information  only if the Employee:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Has been recommended for such access by the Employee's Division  Director;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Has been resident in the United States for at least six years,  at least two of which include satisfactory employment with the Board  and/or one or more of the Federal Reserve Banks; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Has completed a background investigation acceptable to the  Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Access by a Non-Citizen from a country not on the Country List.  An Employee in an Eligible Position who is a Non-Citizen from a country  that, on the date the Employee begins employment with the Federal  Reserve System   and on the date access is granted, is not on the Country List:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Shall not be granted access to Class I FOMC Information, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Shall be granted access to Class II FOMC Information only upon:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The recommendation of the Employee's Division Director;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Six years of residence in the United States, at least two of  which include satisfactory employment by the Board and/or one or more of  the Federal Reserve Banks; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Completion of a background investigation acceptable to the  Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Changes to the Country List. If the Employee's country is  deleted from the Country List after the date the Employee begins  employment with the Federal Reserve System, the Employee's existing  access to Class I or Class II FOMC information will not be affected by  the change in the Country List. Similarly, the Employee would continue  to be eligible for access to Class I information and may be granted such  access if he or she meets the remaining conditions outlined in paragraph  (c)(2)(i) for employees from a country on the Country List.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Confidential Supervisory Information--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Access by a Non- Citizen from a country on the Country List. An Employee in an Eligible  Position who is a Non-Citizen from a country that, on the date the  Employee begins employment with the Federal Reserve System or on the  date access is granted, is on the Country List shall be granted access  to Confidential Supervisory Information designated as Restricted- Controlled FR only if the Employee:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Has been recommended for such access by the Employee's Division  Director;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Has been resident in the United States for at least six years,  at least two of which include satisfactory employment with the Board  and/or one or more of the Federal Reserve Banks; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Has completed a background investigation acceptable to the  Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Access by a Non-Citizen from a country not on the Country List.  An Employee in an Eligible Position who is a Non-Citizen from a country  that, on the date the Employee begins employment with the Federal  Reserve System and on the date access is granted, is not on the Country  List:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Shall not be granted access to Confidential Supervisory  Information designated as Restricted-Controlled FR; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Shall be granted access to Confidential Supervisory Information  designated as Restricted FR only upon:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The recommendation of the Employee's Division Director;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Six years of residence in the United States, at least two of  which include satisfactory employment by the Board and/or one or more of  the Federal Reserve Banks; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Completion of a background investigation acceptable to the  Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Changes to the Country List. If the Employee's country is  deleted from the Country List after the date the Employee begins  employment with the Federal Reserve System, the Employee's existing  access to Confidential Supervisory Information designated as Restricted  FR or Restricted-Controlled FR will not be affected by the change in the  Country List. Similarly, the Employee would continue to be eligible for  access to Confidential Supervisory Information designated as Restricted- Controlled FR information and may be granted such access if he or she  meets the remaining conditions outlined in paragraph (c)(3)(i) for  employees from a country on the Country List.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Access to Sensitive Information by Reserve Bank employees--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  FOMC Information.

A  Board or Reserve Bank employer may request an exception for access to  Confidential Supervisory Information. The requester must demonstrate  that unusual circumstances exist and that the Board or Reserve Bank  employee for whom access is being requested has a strong and  particularized need for access to the information. All exceptions for  access to Confidential Supervisory Information must be approved by the  Chairman of the Board's Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Affairs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Classified Information. Access to Classified Information is  limited to those persons who are permitted access to Classified  Information pursuant to the applicable executive orders and any  subsequent amendments or superseding orders that the President of the  United States may issue from time to time.
