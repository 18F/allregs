                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Each manufacturer of motor vehicles (except vehicles  manufactured in two or more stages) shall affix to each vehicle a label,  of the type and in the manner described below, containing the statements  specified in paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The label shall be riveted or permanently affixed in such a  manner that it cannot be removed without destroying or defacing it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Except for trailers and motorcycles, the label shall be affixed  to either the hinge pillar, door-latch post, or the door edge that meets  the door-latch post, next to the driver's seating position, or if none  of these locations is practicable, to the left side of the instrument  panel. If that location is also not practicable, the label shall be  affixed to the inward-facing surface of the door next to the driver's  seating position. If none of the preceding locations is practicable,  notification of that fact, together with drawings or photographs showing  a suggested alternate location in the same general area, shall be  submitted for approval to the Administrator, National Highway Traffic  Safety Administration, Washington, D.C. 20590. The location of the label  shall be such that it is easily readable without moving any part of the  vehicle except an outer door.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The label for trailers shall be affixed to a location on the  forward half of the left side, such that it is easily readable from  outside the vehicle without moving any part of the vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The label for motorcycles shall be affixed to a permanent member  of the vehicle as close as is practicable to the intersection of the  steering post with the handle bars, in a location such that it is easily  readable without moving any part of the vehicle except the steering  system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The lettering on the label shall be of a color that contrasts  with the background of the label.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The label shall contain the following statements, in the English  language, lettered in block capitals and numerals not less than three  thirty-seconds of an inch high, in the order shown:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em>, (ii) and (iii) of this section, the full corporate or  individual name of the actual assembler of the vehicle shall be spelled  out, except that such abbreviations as ``Co.'' or ``Inc.'' and their  foreign equivalents, and the first and middle   initials of individuals, may be used. The name of the manufacturer shall  be preceded by the words ``Manufactured By'' or ``Mfd By.'' In the case  of imported vehicles to which the label required by this section is  affixed by the Registered Importer, the name of the Registered Importer  shall also be placed on the label in the manner described in this  paragraph, directly below the name of the actual assembler.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If a vehicle is assembled by a corporation that is controlled by  another corporation that assumes responsibility for conformity with the  standards, the name of the controlling corporation may be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a vehicle is fabricated and delivered in complete but  unassembled form, such that it is designed to be assembled without  special machinery or tools, the fabricator of the vehicle may affix the  label and name itself as the manufacturer for the purposes of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If a trailer is sold by a person who is not its manufacturer,  but who is engaged in the manufacture of trailers and assumes legal  responsibility for all duties and liabilities imposed by the Act with  respect to that trailer, the name of that person may appear on the label  as the manufacturer. In such a case the name shall be preceded by the  words ``Responsible Manufacturer'' or ``Resp Mfr.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Month and year of manufacture: This shall be the time during  which work was completed at the place of main assembly of the vehicle.
