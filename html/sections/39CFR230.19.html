If the authorizing official allows the  release of documents or testimony to be given by an employee,  arrangements shall be made for the taking of testimony or receipt of  documents by the method least disruptive to the employee's official  duties. Testimony may, for example, be provided by affidavits, answers  to interrogatories, written depositions, or depositions transcribed,  recorded, or preserved by any other means allowable by law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon issuance of an unfavorable final determination by the  authorizing official, the party or the party's counsel seeking testimony  or documents may consult or negotiate with the authorizing official to  refine and limit the demand.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Office of Inspector General will offer all possible  assistance to the courts, but the question of disclosing information for  which an exemption may be claimed is a matter of discretion that rests  with the authorizing official. If in the opinion of the authorizing  official the documents should not be released or testimony should not be  furnished, that determination will be final.</p>
