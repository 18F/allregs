                                Sec. 825.303  Employee notice requirements for unforeseeable FMLA leave.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Timing of notice. When the approximate timing of the need for  leave is not foreseeable, an employee must provide notice to the  employer as soon as practicable under the facts and circumstances of the  particular case. It generally should be practicable for the employee to  provide notice of leave that is unforeseeable within the time prescribed  by the employer's usual and customary notice requirements applicable to  such leave. See Sec. 825.303(c). Notice may be given by the employee's  spokesperson (e.g., spouse, adult family member, or other responsible  party) if the employee is unable to do so personally. For example, if an  employee's child has a severe asthma attack and the employee takes the  child to the emergency room, the employee would not be required to leave  his or her child in order to report the absence while the child is  receiving emergency treatment. However, if the child's asthma attack  required only the use of an inhaler at home followed by a period of  rest, the employee would be expected to call the employer promptly after  ensuring the child has used the inhaler.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>,  and the anticipated duration of the absence; or if the leave is for a  family member that the condition renders the family member unable to  perform daily activities or that the family member is a covered  servicemember with a serious injury or illness; and the anticipated  duration of the absence, if known. When an employee seeks leave for the  first time for a FMLA-qualifying reason, the employee need not expressly  assert rights under the FMLA or even mention the FMLA. When an employee  seeks leave due to a qualifying reason, for which the employer has  previously provided the employee FMLA-protected leave, the employee must  specifically reference either the qualifying reason for leave or the  need for FMLA leave. Calling in ``sick'' without providing more  information will not be considered sufficient notice to trigger an  employer's obligations under the Act. The employer will be expected to  obtain any additional required information through informal means. An  employee has an obligation to respond to an employer's questions  designed to determine whether an absence is potentially FMLA-qualifying.  Failure to respond to reasonable employer inquiries regarding the leave  request may result in denial of FMLA protection if the employer is  unable to determine whether the leave is FMLA-qualifying.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Complying with employer policy. When the need for leave is not  foreseeable, an employee must comply with the employer's usual and  customary notice and procedural requirements for requesting leave,  absent unusual circumstances. For example, an employer may require  employees to call a designated number or a specific individual to  request leave. However, if an employee requires emergency medical  treatment, he or she would not be required to follow the call-in  procedure until his or her condition is stabilized and he or she has  access to, and is able to use, a phone. Similarly, in the case of an  emergency requiring leave because of a FMLA-qualifying reason,   written advance notice pursuant to an employer's internal rules and  procedures may not be required when FMLA leave is involved. If an  employee does not comply with the employer's usual notice and procedural  requirements, and no unusual circumstances justify the failure to  comply, FMLA-protected leave may be delayed or denied.</p>
