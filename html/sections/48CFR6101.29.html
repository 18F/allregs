                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Clerical mistakes. Clerical mistakes in decisions, orders, or  other parts of the record, and errors arising therein through oversight  or inadvertence, may be corrected by the Board at any time on its own  initiative or upon motion of a party on such terms, if any, as the Board  may prescribe. During the pendency of an appeal to another tribunal,  such mistakes may be corrected only with leave of the appellate  tribunal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Harmless error. No error in the admission or exclusion of  evidence, and no error or defect in any ruling, order, or decision of  the Board, and no other error in anything done or not done by the Board  will be a ground for granting a new hearing or for vacating,  reconsidering, modifying, or otherwise disturbing a decision or order of  the Board unless refusal to act upon such error will prejudice a party  or work a substantial injustice. At every stage of the proceedings the  Board will disregard any error or defect that does not affect the  substantial rights of the parties.</p>
