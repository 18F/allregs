                            <p class="depth0">If the veteran dies after making application under the Adjusted  Compensation Payment Act, 1936, but before it is filed, it may be filed  by any person and will be considered valid if found to bear the bona- fide signature of the applicant, discloses an intention to claim  benefits under the Act, and is filed before the maturity of the  certificate and before payment is made to the beneficiary. An  application made by the veteran or his legal representative shall  evidence his intention to claim the benefits of this Act; no other  evidence shall be acceptable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the veteran's death occurs after the application is filed but  before payment is received under this Act, or if the application is  filed after death occurs but before the maturity of the certificate and  before payment is made to   the beneficiary under section 501 of the World War Adjusted Compensation  Act, as amended, payment under this act shall be made to the estate of  the veteran irrespective of any beneficiary designation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the veteran dies without filing a valid application under  this Act, no payment under this Act shall be made. In such case, payment  of the certificate will be made under the World War Adjusted  Compensation Act, as amended, in accordance with Sec.  11.128; however,  in making any settlement there shall be deducted from the face value of  the certificate the amount of any outstanding loans and so much of the  unpaid interest as accrued prior to October 1, 1931.
