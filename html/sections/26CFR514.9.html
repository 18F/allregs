For this purpose, beginning with the calendar year 1954, certain distributions from employees' trusts, and amounts received incident to disposal of timber or coal or patent rights shall be included in such capital gains. See section 871(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for provisions pertaining to individual taxpayers and section 881(a) for provisions pertinent to corporate taxpayers.

For the purpose of refund of excess tax withheld resulting from the tax convention, a properly executed return on Form 1040NB France or Form 1120NB France shall constitute a claim for refund or credit for the amount of the overpayment disclosed by such return.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Date of payment of tax. The United States tax withheld from dividends and interest derived from sources within the United States by nonresident aliens, or by a foreign corporation not engaged in trade or business in the United States, is deemed to have been paid on March 15 of the calendar year immediately succeeding that in which such income has been so derived.
