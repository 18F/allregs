                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">A report of the salvage derived from the sale of each animal for  which a claim for payment is made under this subpart must be made on a  salvage form acceptable to APHIS that must be signed by the purchaser or  by the selling agent handling the animals. If the cattle are sold by the  pound, the salvage form must show the weight, price per pound, gross  receipts, expenses if any, and net proceeds. If the cattle are not sold  on a per-pound basis, the net purchase price of each animal must be  stated on the salvage form and an explanation showing how the amount was  arrived at must be submitted. In the event the animals are not disposed  of through regular slaughterers or through selling agents, the owner  must furnish, in lieu of the salvage form, an affidavit showing the  amount of salvage obtained by him or her and must certify that such  amount is all he or she has received or will receive as salvage for the  animals. The original of the salvage form or the affidavit of the owner  must be furnished to the veterinarian in charge within 3 months of  destruction of the animals, if such document is not already in his or  her possession. Disposal of cattle by burial, incineration, or other  means must be supervised by an APHIS or State representative, who will  prepare and transmit to the veterinarian in charge a report identifying  the animals and showing their disposition, or be documented by an  affidavit of the owner that identifies the animals and describes their  disposition. The owner must provide a copy of the affidavit to the  veterinarian in charge within 3 months of destruction of the animals.  The salvage form, disposal certificate, or affidavit will be for  information purposes only and will have no effect on the amount of any  payment due.
