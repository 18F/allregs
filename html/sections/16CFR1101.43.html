                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Statutory provision. Section (6)(b)(4)(A) provides that the requirements of section 6(b)(1) do not apply to public disclosure of information about any consumer product which the Commission has reasonable cause to believe is in violation of any consumer product safety rule or provision under the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2051 et seq.) or similar rule or provision of any other act enforced by the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope of exception. This exception applies once the Commission has ``reasonable cause to believe'' there has occurred a violation of any consumer product safety rule or provision under the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2051 et seq.) or similar rule or provision of any other act enforced by the Commission. Once the exception applies, the Commission may disclose information to the public without following the requirements of section 6(b)(1) if the information concerning the product is reasonably related to the violation.
