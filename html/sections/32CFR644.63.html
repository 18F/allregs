                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Survey of area and source of title evidence. Contemporaneously with the preparation of the real estate design memorandum, or real estate planning report, the Division or District Engineer is requested to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Give careful consideration to the problems involved to determine the most acceptable type of title evidence, its source, availability of title plants, costs, and time of procurement, so that the most advantageous bid(s) may be received and accepted and the acquisition schedule maintained. In considering costs of abstracts of title versus certificates of title or title insurance, the workhours involved in the examination of abstracts of title by both Corps and Department of Justice personnel should be considered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determine the total number of tracks in the project area. In major projects, it may be desirable to invite bids for title evidence for each county or other specified areas, in addition to the entire project, in order to maintain the acquisition schedule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Determine the names and addresses of title companies and abstractors available to furnish title evidence and whether such companies or abstractors have been approved by the Attorney General as acceptable companies or abstractors. Current information on approved title companies and abstractors may be obtained direct from the Land and Natural Resources Division, Department of Justice, WASH DC 20530.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Selection procedure. (1) Normally selection of persons or firms to perform

title evidence services will be based upon formal advertising in accordance with the Armed Services Procurement Regulation (ASPR) (chapter I of this title).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Normally selection of persons or firms to perform

title evidence services will be based upon formal advertising in accordance with the Armed Services Procurement Regulation (ASPR) (chapter I of this title).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In those States where the furnishing of title evidence is held to constitute the practice of law and the State canons of legal ethics prohibit attorneys from engaging in competitive bidding for such services, contracts for title evidence services must necessarily be negotiated. In such cases, negotiations shall be conducted with attorneys or law firms duly authorized to practice law in the jurisdiction within which the real property is located. Division and District Engineers shall notify HQDA (DAEN-REA-P) WASH DC 20314 before negotiating for title evidence, and submit the list of attorneys with whom negotiations may be conducted. Selections shall be in accordance with the procedures set forth below:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A contract for title services shall be based upon, but not limited to, consideration of the following professional qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of the services required:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Professionally trained for type of work;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Specialized experience in the type of work required;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Past experience, if any, with respect to performance on Corps of Engineers contracts;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Location in the general geographical area of the project to which the services relate: Provided, That there is an appropriate number of qualified attorneys or law firms therein for consideration; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Volume of work previously awarded, with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of title evidence contracts among qualified attorneys and law firms.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A preselection list of qualified attorneys and law firms shall be prepared by a preselection board from data submitted by interested attorneys and law firms and from other pertinent information which may be available. The list shall be approved by the District Engineer or his designee.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A selection board shall review the qualifications of each of the attorneys or law firms on the preselection list, in accordance with the procedure established in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and shall recommend to the District Engineer, in order of preference, a minimum of three for approval for contract negotiations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Upon approval of the selections by the District Engineer and such approval as may be required by paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section, negotiations shall be initiated with the first selected attorney or law firm. If the negotiations result in a price which exceeds the Government estimate, revised to correct errors of fact or judgment, if any, by more than ten percent, the Contracting Officer shall terminate the negotiations and request a proposal from the attorney or law firm next in order of preference.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Preparation of preselection lists and selections for contracts estimated to cost more than $10,000, shall be accomplished by formally constituted boards consisting of at least three members, one of whom shall be the District Counsel or an attorney on his staff, and one of whom shall be the Chief, Real Estate Division, or a member of his staff.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Special approval shall be required for certain selections as indicated below:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> When the estimated cost of a contract to be negotiated exceeds $100,000, the selection shall require the approval of the Division Engineer.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> When an attorney or law firm, to which the District has awarded contracts totalling over $100,000 during the current fiscal year, has been selected by the District for additional negotiations, the selection shall require the approval of the Division Engineer.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> When the estimated cost of a contract to be negotiated exceeds $200,000, the selection shall require the approval of the Director of Real Estate, OCE, or his designee, with the concurrence of the Chief Counsel or his designee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Forms to be used. When purchasing title evidence, Standard Form 33, Solicitation, Offer, and Award, which form embraces an invitation, bid, and acceptance, should be used with copies of ENG Form 1012 or ENG Form 1016,

depending upon the type of title evidence to be obtained. Standard Form 33 will state that time is of the essence; that ability to comply with delivery requirements is mandatory; that the specifications attached thereto constitute a part of the proposed contract; the quantity and description of the supplies by item to be furnished; the time, place, and method of delivery; and the primary period of contract and extensions. Bids must be submitted in the form required by the invitations for the bids, so that the successful bid can be accepted on Standard Form 33 and a formal contract consummated thereby. The contract must incorporate all the covenants, terms, and conditions which are contemplated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Base price vs. per-item basis. The invitation will call for the furnishing of an approximate number of certificates of title, abstracts of title, or preliminary binders and title guarantee (insurance) policies, as the case may be, at a stated price per certificate of title, abstract, or preliminary binder and title guarantee (insurance) policy. If this basis of payment is not possible, payment for abstracts may be made on a per-item or per-page basis and certificates of title and interim binders and title guarantee (insurance) policies may be paid for in accordance with an established rate schedule based on the cost of the property. Where necessary, alterations in the payment paragraphs of the specifications may be made in order to comply with local practices, State statutes, or other special requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Specifications. The specifications for title service will follow ENG Form 1012 for abstracts, ENG Form 1016 for certificates of title and ENG Form 1014 for interim binders on owner's title guarantee (insurance) policies. Additional provisions may be added as circumstances require, but basic requirements will not be changed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Several contracts for title evidence. To meet the acquisition schedule, it may be necessary to enter into several contracts for title evidence to lands within a designated project area. In such cases, the portions of the projects to be covered by each contract will be defined according to established political subdivisions, such as districts, townships, counties, or any specified part thereof.</p>
