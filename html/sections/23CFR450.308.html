At the State's option, funds provided under  23 U.S.C. 104(b)(1) and (b)(3) and 23 U.S.C. 105 may also be provided to  MPOs for metropolitan transportation planning. In addition, an MPO  serving an urbanized area with a population over 200,000, as designated  by the Bureau of the Census, may at its discretion use funds sub- allocated under 23 U.S.C. 133(d)(3)(E) for metropolitan transportation  planning activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Metropolitan transportation planning activities performed with  funds provided under title 23 U.S.C. and title 49 U.S.C.
