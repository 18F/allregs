A qualifying facility, independent power production facility, or new IPP may be regarded as having been ``selected'' in such solicitation if the utility has named the facility as a project with which the utility intends to negotiate a power sales agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Utility regulatory authority means an authority, board, commission, or other entity (limited to the local-, State-, or federal-level, whenever so specified) responsible for overseeing the business operations of utilities located within its jurisdiction, including, but not limited to, utility rates and charges to customers.</p><p class="depth0">Utility system means all interconnected units and generators operated by the same utility operating company.</p><p class="depth0">Utility unit means a unit owned or operated by a utility:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> That serves a generator in any State that produces electricity for sale, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> That during 1985, served a generator in any State that produced electricity for sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2) of this definition, a unit that was in operation during 1985, but did not serve a generator that produced electricity for sale during 1985, and did not commence commercial operation on or after November 15, 1990 is not a utility unit for purposes of the Acid Rain Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2) of this definition, a unit that cogenerates steam and electricity is not a utility unit for purposes of the Acid Rain Program, unless the unit is constructed for the purpose of supplying, or commences construction after November 15, 1990 and supplies, more than one-third of its potential electrical output capacity and more than 25 MWe output to any power distribution system for sale.</p><p class="depth0">Utilization means the heat input (expressed in mmBtu/time) for a unit.</p><p class="depth0">Very low sulfur fuel means either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A fuel with a total sulfur content no greater than 0.05 percent sulfur by weight;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Natural gas or pipeline natural gas, as defined in this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any gaseous fuel with a total sulfur content no greater than 20 grains of sulfur per 100 standard cubic feet.</p><p class="depth0">Volumetric flow means the rate of movement of a specified volume of gas past a cross-sectional area (e.g., cubic feet per hour).</p><p class="depth0">Zero air material means either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A calibration gas certified by the gas vendor not to contain concentrations of SO2, NOX, or total hydrocarbons above 0.1 parts per million (ppm), a concentration of CO above 1 ppm, or a concentration of CO2 above 400 ppm;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Ambient air conditioned and purified by a CEMS for which the CEMS manufacturer or vendor certifies that the particular CEMS model produces conditioned gas that does not contain concentrations of SO2, NOX, or total hydrocarbons above 0.1 ppm, a concentration of CO above 1 ppm, or a concentration of CO2 above 400 ppm;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For dilution-type CEMS, conditioned and purified ambient air provided by a conditioning system concurrently supplying dilution air to the CEMS; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A multicomponent mixture certified by the supplier of the mixture that the concentration of the component being zeroed is less than or equal to the applicable concentration specified in paragraph (1) of this definition, and that the mixture's other components do not interfere with the CEM readings.
