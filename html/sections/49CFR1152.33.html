                            <p class="depth0">The accounts specified under Sec.  1152.32 (a), (b), (c), and (d) as  having an assignment basis other than ``Actual'' shall be apportioned  according to the rules contained in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Maintenance of way and structures--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Roadway machines. All  accounts designated XX-13-36 shall be assigned to the branch on the  basis of the average repair costs, for each type of machine, included in  the daily rental fees charged by the operating railroad or as published  by the General Manager's Association of Chicago (GMA), based on the  actual number of days each type of machine is used on the branch.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Small tools and supplies. All accounts designated XX-13-37 shall  be assigned to the branch as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The costs of supplies, consumed in the operation of roadway  machines, shall be assigned to the branch on the basis of the average  costs of supplies per day, included in the daily rental fees charged by  the operating railroad or as published by the GMA, multiplied by the  actual number of days that the machine is used on the branch;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The costs of small tools shall be assigned to the branch on the  basis of the ratio that the branch amounts in Accounts 11-11-10 through  11-11-17 and 11-11-48, plus 11-12-10 through 11-12-17 and 11-12-48, bear  to the railroad's system total for the same accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fringe benefits. Fringe benefits shall be assigned to the branch  separated between running, switching and other, on the ratio that the  total branch salary and wages bear to the total system salaries and  wages for each activity as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Fringe benefits--Running, Account 12-11-00, total of all 11-11- XX accounts branch to system;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Fringe benefits--Switching, Account 12-12-00, total of all 11- 12-XX accounts branch to system; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Fringe benefits--Other, Account 12-13-00, total of all 11-13- XX accounts branch to system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Maintenance of equipment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Locomotive repairs and  maintenance. All accounts designated XX-21-41 shall be separated between  yard and road with a further separation between diesel and other  (electric). The costs for these accounts for yard locomotives shall be  assigned to the branch separately for diesel and electric locomotives on  the basis of the ratio of branch diesel and electric yard locomotive  unit-hours to the total system diesel and electric yard locomotive unit- hours. The costs for these accounts for road locomotives shall be  assigned to the branch separately for diesel and electric locomotives on  the basis of the ratio of   branch diesel and electric locomotive gross ton-miles in road service to  the total system diesel and electric locomotive gross ton-miles in road  service. The costs assigned under these accounts for specialized  equipment devoted exclusively to branch line service shall be the actual  costs for the specific equipment used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Locomotive depreciation. Locomotive depreciation shall be  calculated and assigned in accordance with the procedures set forth in  Sec.  1152.32(o).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fringe Benefits. Fringe benefits for locomotives and other  equipment shall be assigned to the branch on the ratio that the total  branch salary and wages bear to the system total salaries and wages for  each type of equipment as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Locomotives--Account 12-21-00, total of all 11-21-XX accounts  branch to system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Other Equipment--Account 12-23-00, total of all 11-23-XX  accounts branch to system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Fringe benefits for freight cars shall be calculated by first  estimating the total in Account 11-22-42, Freight car repairs--salaries  and wages, that is included in the total on branch costs for freight  cars as determined from the car-day and car-mile cost calculations in  Sec.  1152.32(g) of these regulations. To this amount is added the  branch totals in the balance of all 11-22-XX accounts. The ratio of this  total branch account to the system total for all 11-22-XX accounts is  applied to Account 12-22-00, Fringe Benefits--Freight Cars.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Transportation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Train operations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Engine Crews- Materials.

If the  branch is served by a local/way or through train, the costs in these  accounts shall be assigned to the branch on the weighted ratio of the  loaded freight train cars on the branch to the total system loaded  freight train cars, and the loaded and empty car-miles on the branch to  the total system loaded and empty car-miles. This shall be calculated as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> To determine the car-mile portion of these accounts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Multiply the total amounts in these accounts (from the R-1  Annual Report, Schedule 410) by 69 percent, which is the ratio of train- mile and running expenses;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Divide the amount in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A)(1) of this section  by the total system loaded and empty car-miles; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Multiply the car-mile unit cost factor from paragraph  (c)(1)(i)(A)(2) of this section by the on-branch car-miles (loaded and  empty).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> To determine the carload portion of these accounts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Multiply the total amounts in these accounts by 31 percent,  which is the ratio of terminal expenses;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Divide the amount in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B)(1) of this section  by the total system carloads; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Multiply the carload unit cost factor from paragraph  (c)(1)(i)(B)(2) of this section by the on-branch carloads.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> To determine the total costs assignable to the branch for these  accounts, add the amounts developed in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(A)(3) and  (c)(1)(i)(B)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All accounts designated xx-31-67 shall be assigned to the  branch in accordance with the following procedure. The dollar amounts  used in the determination of locomotive fuel costs shall be based on  data contained in the most recent publication issued by the General  Managers Association (GMA) relating to the rental of locomotives. The  total number of locomotive unit hours incurred by the locomotive(s)  shall then be categorized according to the applicable GMA horsepower  classification group. The fuel cost is derived from the Repairs and  Supplies Expenses element of the locomotive rental rates published by  the GMA. The fuel cost per locomotive unit hour shall be determined for  each GMA horsepower classification group by multiplying the latest GMA  fuel cost percentage by the Repairs and Supplies Expense per hour  included in each group. The fuel cost update ratio is determined by  using the indices for fuel from the Association of American Railroad's  (AAR's) Railroad Cost Recovery Index (RCR). The indices shall be taken  from the district to which the railroad is assigned by the Board. The  index for   the current period is divided by the index of the period representative  of the GMA publication to develop the fuel update ratio. The fuel cost  per locomotive unit hour developed for each GMA horsepower group shall  be multiplied by the fuel update ratio to determine the fuel cost per  locomotive hour for each horsepower group. The updated fuel cost per  locomotive unit hour for each applicable GMA group shall be multiplied  by the number of locomotive unit hours incurred in serving the branch by  locomotives of that GMA horsepower classification group. The total cost  developed under this procedure for each horsepower classification shall  be the locomotive fuel cost assignable to the branch line.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Electric power purchased or produced for motive power--All  accounts designated XX-31-68 shall be assigned to the branch on the  ratio of road electric locomotive unit hours on the branch to the total  system road electric locomotive unit hours.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Servicing locomotives--All accounts designated XX-31-69 shall  be assigned to the branch on the ratio of road locomotive unit miles on  the branch to the total system road locomotive unit miles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Yard operations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Switch Crews--Materials, Account 21-32-64,  and Servicing Locomotives, all accounts designated XX-32-69.
