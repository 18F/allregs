                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Destruction and disposal of poultry. (1) Indemnity for the destruction of poultry infected with or exposed to H5/H7 LPAI will be based on the fair market value of the poultry, as determined by an appraisal. Poultry infected with or exposed to H5/H7 LPAI that are removed by APHIS or a Cooperating State Agency from a flock will be appraised by an APHIS official appraiser and a State official appraiser jointly, or, if APHIS and State authorities agree, by either an APHIS official appraiser or a State official appraiser alone. For laying hens, the appraised value should include the hen's projected future egg production. Appraisals of poultry must be reported on forms furnished by APHIS and signed by the appraisers and must be signed by the owners of the poultry to indicate agreement with the appraisal amount. Appraisals of poultry must be signed by the owners of the poultry prior to the destruction of the poultry, unless the owners, APHIS, and the Cooperating State Agency agree that the poultry may be destroyed immediately. Reports of appraisals must show the number of birds and the value per head.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Indemnity for disposal of poultry infected with or exposed to H5/H7 LPAI will be based on receipts or other documentation maintained by the claimant verifying expenditures for disposal activities authorized by this part. Any disposal of poultry infected with or exposed to H5/H7 LPAI for which indemnity is requested must be performed under a compliance agreement between the claimant, the Cooperating State Agency, and APHIS. APHIS will review claims for indemnity for disposal to ensure that all expenditures relate directly to activities described in Sec. 56.5 and in the initial State response and containment plan described in Sec. 56.10. If disposal is performed by the Cooperating State Agency, APHIS will indemnify the Cooperating State Agency for disposal under a cooperative agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The destruction and disposal of the indemnified poultry must be conducted in accordance with the initial State response and containment plan for H5/H7 LPAI, as described in Sec. 56.10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Destruction of eggs. Indemnity for eggs destroyed during an outbreak for testing for H5/H7 LPAI will be based on the fair market value of the eggs, as determined by an appraisal. Eggs destroyed for testing for H5/H7 LPAI will be appraised by an APHIS official appraiser and a State official appraiser jointly, or, if APHIS and State authorities agree, by either an APHIS official

appraiser or a State official appraiser alone. Appraisals of eggs must be reported on forms furnished by APHIS and signed by the appraisers and must be signed by the owners of the eggs to indicate agreement with the appraisal amount. Appraisals of eggs must be signed by the owners of the eggs prior to the destruction of the poultry, unless the owners, APHIS, and the Cooperating State Agency agree that the eggs may be destroyed immediately. Reports of appraisals must show the number of eggs and the value per egg.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Cleaning and disinfection. (1) Indemnity for cleaning and disinfection of premises, conveyances, and materials that came into contact with poultry that are infected with or exposed to H5/H7 LPAI will be based on receipts or other documentation maintained by the claimant verifying expenditures for cleaning and disinfection activities authorized by this part. Any cleaning and disinfection of premises, conveyances, and materials for which indemnity is requested must be performed under a compliance agreement between the claimant, the Cooperating State Agency, and APHIS. APHIS will review claims for indemnity for cleaning and disinfection to ensure that all expenditures relate directly to activities described in Sec. 56.5 and in the initial State response and containment plan described in Sec. 56.10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of materials, if the cost of cleaning and disinfection would exceed the value of the materials or cleaning and disinfection would be impracticable for any reason, indemnity for the destruction of the materials will be based on the fair market value of those materials, as determined by an appraisal. Materials will be appraised by an APHIS official appraiser and a State official appraiser jointly, or, if APHIS and State authorities agree, by either an APHIS official appraiser or a State official appraiser alone. Indemnity for disposal of the materials will be based on receipts or other documentation maintained by the claimant verifying expenditures for disposal activities authorized by this part. Appraisals of materials must be reported on forms furnished by APHIS and signed by the appraisers and must be signed by the owners of the materials to indicate agreement with the appraisal amount. Appraisals of materials must be signed prior to the destruction of the materials, unless the owners, APHIS, and the Cooperating State Agency agree that the materials may be destroyed immediately. Any disposal of materials for which indemnity is requested must be performed under a compliance agreement between the claimant, the Cooperating State Agency, and APHIS. APHIS will review claims for compensation for disposal to ensure that all expenditures relate directly to activities described in Sec. 56.5 and in the initial State response and containment plan described in Sec. 56.10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Requirements for compliance agreements. The compliance agreement is a comprehensive document that describes the depopulation, disposal, and cleaning and disinfection plans for poultry that were infected with or exposed to H5/H7 LPAI, or a premises that contained such poultry. The compliance agreement sets out APHIS responsibilities, owner responsibilities, and Cooperating State Agency responsibilities. The compliance agreement must include the owner's name and the name and address of the affected premises. The compliance agreement must have signatories that include, but are not necessarily limited to, the owner, the grower (if applicable), the Cooperating State Agency representative, the State veterinarian, and the APHIS area supervisor. In addition, the compliance agreement must contain a flock plan with estimated cost breakdowns that include labor, materials, personal protective equipment, travel expenses for personnel involved, and any additional information deemed necessary by the Service. A signed compliance agreement is required before beginning any work for which indemnity funds will be requested. Once work associated with the compliance agreement is completed, receipts and documentation detailing the activities specified in the agreement should be forwarded to APHIS for review, approval, and final payment. This documentation should be submitted to APHIS no later than 30 days after the

quarantine release of the affected or exposed premises.
