                                Sec. 1.148-7  Spending exceptions to the rebate requirement.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope of section--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. This section provides guidance  on the spending exceptions to the arbitrage rebate requirement of  section 148(f)(2). These exceptions are the 6-month exception in section  148(f)(4)(B) (the 6-month exception), the 18-month exception under  paragraph (d) of this section (the 18-month exception), and the 2-year  construction exception under section 148(f)(4)(C) (the 2-year exception)  (collectively, the spending exceptions).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Relationship of spending exceptions. Each of the spending  exceptions is an independent exception to arbitrage rebate. For example,  a construction issue may qualify for the 6-month exception or the 18- month exception even though the issuer makes one or more elections under  the 2-year exception with respect to the issue.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Spending exceptions not mandatory. Use of the spending  exceptions is not mandatory. An issuer may apply the arbitrage rebate  requirement to an issue that otherwise satisfies a spending exception.  If an issuer elects to pay penalty in lieu of rebate under the 2-year  exception, however, the issuer must apply those penalty provisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> apply for purposes of applying each of the spending  exceptions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Special transferred proceeds rules--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Application to prior  issues. For purposes of applying the spending exceptions to a prior  issue only, proceeds of the prior issue that become transferred proceeds  of the refunding issue continue to be treated as unspent proceeds of the  prior issue. If the prior issue satisfies one of the spending  exceptions, the proceeds of the prior issue that are excepted from  rebate under that spending exception are not subject to rebate either as  proceeds of the prior issue or as transferred proceeds of the refunding  issue.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Application to refunding issues--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In general. The only  spending exception applicable to refunding issues is the 6-month  exception. For purposes of applying the 6-month exception to a refunding  issue only, proceeds of the prior issue that become transferred proceeds  of the refunding issue generally are not treated as proceeds of the  refunding issue and need not be spent for the refunding issue to satisfy  that spending exception. Even if the refunding issue qualifies for that  spending exception, those transferred proceeds are subject to rebate as  proceeds of the refunding issue unless an exception to rebate applied to  those proceeds as proceeds of the prior issue.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Exception. For purposes of applying the 6-month exception to  refunding issues, those transferred proceeds of the refunding issue  excluded from the gross proceeds of the prior issue under the special  definition of gross proceeds in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and  those that transferred from a prior taxable issue, are generally treated  as gross proceeds of the refunding issue. Thus, for the refunding issue  to qualify for the 6-month exception, those proceeds must be spent  within 6 months of the issue date of the refunding issue, unless those  amounts continue to be used in a manner that does not cause those  amounts to be gross proceeds under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Application of multipurpose issue rules. Except as otherwise  provided, if any portion of an issue is treated as a separate issue  allocable to refunding purposes under Sec. 1.148-9(h) (relating to  multipurpose issues), for purposes of this section, that portion is  treated as a separate issue.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Expenditures for governmental purposes of the issue. For  purposes of this section, expenditures for the governmental purpose of  an issue include payments for interest, but not principal, on the issue,  and for principal or interest on another issue of obligations. The  preceding sentence does not apply for purposes of the 18-month and 2- year exceptions if those payments cause the issue to be a refunding  issue.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> De minimis rule. Any failure to satisfy the final spending  requirement of the 18-month exception or the 2-year exception is  disregarded if the issuer exercises due diligence to complete the  project financed and the amount of the failure does not exceed the  lesser of 3 percent of the issue price of the issue or $250,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Special definition of reasonably required reserve or replacement  fund. For   purposes of this section only, a reasonably required reserve or  replacement fund also includes any fund to the extent described in Sec.  1.148-5(c)(3)(i)(E) or (G).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Pooled financing issue--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as otherwise  provided in this paragraph (b)(6), the spending exceptions apply to a  pooled financing issue as a whole, rather than to each loan separately.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Election to apply spending exceptions separately to each loan-- </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In general. At the election (made on or before the issue date) of  the issuer of a pooled financing issue, the spending exceptions are  applied separately to each conduit loan, and the applicable spending  requirements for a loan begin on the earlier of the date the loan is  made, or the first day following the 1-year period beginning on the  issue date of the pooled financing issue. If this election is made, the  rebate requirement applies to, and none of the spending exceptions are  available for, gross proceeds of the pooled financing bonds before the  date on which the spending requirements for those proceeds begin.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Application of spending exceptions. If the issuer makes the  election under this paragraph (b)(6)(ii), the rebate requirement is  satisfied for proceeds used to finance a particular conduit loan to the  extent that the loan satisfies a spending exception or the small issuer  exception under Sec. 1.148-8, regardless of whether any other conduit  loans allocable to the issue satisfy such an exception. A pooled  financing issue is an issue of arbitrage bonds, however, unless the  entire issue satisfies the requirements of section 148. An issuer may  pay rebate for some conduit loans and 1\1/2\ percent penalty for other  conduit loans from the same pooled financing issue. The 1\1/2\ percent  penalty is computed separately for each conduit loan.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Elections under 2-year exception. If the issuer makes the  election under this paragraph (b)(6)(ii), the issuer may make all  elections under the 2-year exception separately for each loan. Elections  regarding a loan that otherwise must be made by the issuer on or before  the issue date instead may be made on or before the date the loan is  made (but not later than 1 year after the issue date).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Example. The operation of this paragraph (b)(6) is illustrated  by the following example:</p><p class="depth5">Example. Pooled financing issue. On January 1, 1994, Authority J  issues bonds. As of the issue date, J reasonably expects to use the  proceeds of the issue to make loans to City K, County L, and City M. J  does not reasonably expect to use more than 75 percent of the available  construction proceeds of the issue for construction expenditures. On or  before the issue date, J elects to apply the spending exceptions  separately for each loan, with spending requirements beginning on the  earlier of the date the loan is made or the first day following the 1- year period beginning on the issue date. On February 1, 1994, J loans a  portion of the proceeds to K, and K reasonably expects that 45 percent  of those amounts will be used for construction expenditures. On the date  this loan is made, J elects under paragraph (j) of this section to treat  60 percent of the amount loaned to K as a separate construction issue,  and also elects the 1\1/2\ percent penalty under paragraph (k) of this  section for the separate construction issue. On March 1, 1994, J loans a  portion of the proceeds to L, and L reasonably expects that more than 75  percent of those amounts will be used for construction expenditures. On  March 1, 1995, J loans the remainder of the proceeds to M, and none of  those amounts will be used for construction expenditures. J must satisfy  the rebate requirement for all gross proceeds before those amounts are  loaned. For the loan to K, the spending periods begin on February 1,  1994, and the 1\1/2\ percent penalty must be paid for any failure to  meet a spending requirement for the portion of the loan to K that is  treated as a separate construction issue. Rebate must be paid on the  remaining portion of the loan to K, unless that portion qualifies for  the 6-month exception. For the loan to L, the spending periods begin on  March 1, 1994, and the rebate requirement must be satisfied unless the  6-month, 18-month, or the 2-year exception is satisfied with respect to  those amounts. For the loan to M, the spending periods begin on January  2, 1995, and the rebate requirement must be satisfied for those amounts  unless the 6-month or 18-month exception is satisfied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> 6-month exception--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>General rule. An issue is treated as  meeting the rebate requirement if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The gross proceeds (as modified by paragraph (c)(3) of this  section) of the issue are allocated to expenditures for the governmental  purposes of the issue within the 6-month period beginning on   the issue date (the 6-month spending period); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The rebate requirement is met for amounts not required to be  spent within the 6-month spending period (excluding earnings on a bona  fide debt service fund).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Additional period for certain bonds. The 6-month spending period  is extended for an additional 6 months in certain circumstances  specified under section 148(f)(4)(B)(ii).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Amounts not included in gross proceeds. For purposes of  paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section only, gross proceeds has the meaning  used in Sec. 1.148-1, except it does not include amounts--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In a bona fide debt service fund;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In a reasonably required reserve or replacement fund (see Sec.  1.148-7(b)(5));</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That, as of the issue date, are not reasonably expected to be  gross proceeds but that become gross proceeds after the end of the 6- month spending period;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Representing sale or investment proceeds derived from payments  under any purpose investment of the issue; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Representing repayments of grants (as defined in Sec. 1.148- 6(d)(4)) financed by the issue.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Series of refundings. If a principal purpose of a series of  refunding issues is to exploit the difference between taxable and tax- exempt interest rates by investing proceeds during the temporary periods  provided in Sec. 1.148-9(d), the 6-month spending period for all issues  in the series begins on the issue date of the first issue in the series.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> 18-month exception--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. An issue is treated as  meeting the rebate requirement if all of the following requirements are  satisfied--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 18-month expenditure schedule met. The gross proceeds (as  defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section) are allocated to  expenditures for a governmental purpose of the issue in accordance with  the following schedule (the 18-month expenditure schedule) measured from  the issue date--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> At least 15 percent within 6 months (the first spending period);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> At least 60 percent within 12 months (the second spending  period); and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> 100 percent within 18 months (the third spending period).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Rebate requirement met for amounts not required to be spent.  The rebate requirement is met for all amounts not required to be spent  in accordance with the 18-month expenditure schedule (other than  earnings on a bona fide debt service fund).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Issue qualifies for initial temporary period. All of the gross  proceeds (as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section) of the  issue qualify for the initial temporary period under Sec. 1.148- 2(e)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Extension for reasonable retainage. An issue does not fail to  satisfy the spending requirement for the third spending period as a  result of a reasonable retainage if the reasonable retainage is  allocated to expenditures within 30 months of the issue date. Reasonable  retainage has the meaning under paragraph (h) of this section, as  modified to refer to net sale proceeds on the date 18 months after the  issue date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Gross proceeds--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Definition of gross proceeds. For purposes  of paragraph (d)(1) of this section only, gross proceeds means gross  proceeds as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, as modified to  refer to ``18 months'' in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section in lieu  of ``6 months.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Estimated earnings. For purposes of determining compliance with  the first two spending periods under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this  section, the amount of investment proceeds included in gross proceeds of  the issue is determined based on the issuer's reasonable expectations on  the issue date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Application to multipurpose issues. This paragraph (d) does not  apply to an issue any portion of which is treated as meeting the rebate  requirement under paragraph (e) of this section (relating to the 2-year  exception).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> 2-year exception--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. A construction issue is  treated as meeting the rebate requirement for available construction  proceeds if those proceeds are allocated to expenditures for  governmental purposes of the issue in accordance with the following  schedule (the 2-year expenditure schedule), measured from the issue  date--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At least 10 percent within 6 months (the first spending period);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At least 45 percent within 1 year (the second spending period);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> At least 75 percent within 18 months (the third spending  period); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> 100 percent within 2 years (the fourth spending period).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Extension for reasonable retainage. An issue does not fail to  satisfy the spending requirement for the fourth spending period as a  result of unspent amounts for reasonable retainage (as defined in  paragraph (h) of this section) if those amounts are allocated to  expenditures within 3 years of the issue date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Definitions. For purposes of the 2-year exception, the following  definitions apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Real property means land and improvements to land, such as  buildings or other inherently permanent structures, including interests  in real property. For example, real property includes wiring in a  building, plumbing systems, central heating or air-conditioning systems,  pipes or ducts, elevators, escalators installed in a building, paved  parking areas, roads, wharves and docks, bridges, and sewage lines.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Tangible personal property means any tangible property other  than real property, including interests in tangible personal property.  For example, tangible personal property includes machinery that is not a  structural component of a building, subway cars, fire trucks,  automobiles, office equipment, testing equipment, and furnishings.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Substantially completed. Construction may be treated as  substantially completed when the issuer abandons construction or when at  least 90 percent of the total costs of the construction reasonably  expected, as of that date, to be financed with the available  construction proceeds have been allocated to expenditures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Construction issue--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definition. Construction issue means any  issue that is not a refunding issue if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The issuer reasonably expects, as of the issue date, that at  least 75 percent of the available construction proceeds of the issue  will be allocated to construction expenditures (as defined in paragraph  (g) of this section) for property owned by a governmental unit or a  501(c)(3) organization; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any private activity bonds that are part of the issue are  qualified 501(c)(3) bonds or private activity bonds issued to finance  property to be owned by a governmental unit or a 501(c)(3) organization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use of actual facts. For the provisions of paragraphs (e)  through (m) of this section that apply based on the issuer's reasonable  expectations, an issuer may elect on or before the issue date to apply  all of those provisions based on actual facts, except that this election  does not apply for purposes of determining whether an issue is a  construction issue under paragraph (f)(1) of this section if the 1\1/2\  percent penalty election is made under paragraph (k) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ownership requirement--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. A governmental unit or  501(c)(3) organization is treated as the owner of property if it would  be treated as the owner for Federal income tax purposes. For obligations  issued on behalf of a State or local governmental unit, the entity that  actually issues the bonds is treated as a governmental unit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Safe harbor for leases and management contracts. Property  leased by a governmental unit or a 501(c)(3) organization is treated as  owned by the governmental unit or 501(c)(3) organization if the lessee  complies with the requirements of section 142(b)(1)(B). For a bond  described in section 142(a)(6), the requirements of section 142(b)(1)(B)  apply as modified by section 146(h)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Construction expenditures--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definition. Except as otherwise  provided, construction expenditures means capital expenditures (as  defined in Sec. 1.150-1) that are allocable to the cost of real  property or constructed personal property (as defined in paragraph  (g)(3) of this section). Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this  section, construction expenditures do not include expenditures for  acquisitions of interests in land or other existing real property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certain acquisitions under turnkey contracts treated as  construction expenditures. Expenditures are not for the acquisition of  an interest in existing real property other than land if the contract  between the seller and the issuer   requires the seller to build or install the property (e.g., a turnkey  contract), but only to the extent that the property has not been built  or installed at the time the parties enter into the contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Constructed personal property. Constructed personal property  means tangible personal property (or, if acquired pursuant to a single  acquisition contract, properties) or specially developed computer  software if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A substantial portion of the property or properties is completed  more than 6 months after the earlier of the date construction or  rehabilitation commenced and the date the issuer entered into an  acquisition contract;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Based on the reasonable expectations of the issuer, if any, or  representations of the person constructing the property, with the  exercise of due diligence, completion of construction or rehabilitation  (and delivery to the issuer) could not have occurred within that 6-month  period; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the issuer itself builds or rehabilitates the property, not  more than 75 percent of the capitalizable cost is attributable to  property acquired by the issuer (e.g., components, raw materials, and  other supplies).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Specially developed computer software. Specially developed  computer software means any programs or routines used to cause a  computer to perform a desired task or set of tasks, and the  documentation required to describe and maintain those programs, provided  that the software is specially developed and is functionally related and  subordinate to real property or other constructed personal property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The operation of this paragraph (g) is illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. Purchase of construction materials. City A issues bonds  to finance a new office building. A uses proceeds of the bonds to  purchase materials to be used in constructing the building, such as  bricks, pipes, wires, lighting, carpeting, heating equipment, and  similar materials. Expenditures by A for the construction materials are  construction expenditures because those expenditures will be  capitalizable to the cost of the building upon completion, even though  they are not initially capitalizable to the cost of existing real  property. This result would be the same if A hires a third-party to  perform the construction, unless the office building is partially  constructed at the time that A contracts to purchase the building.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Turnkey contract. City B issues bonds to finance a new  office building. B enters into a turnkey contract with developer D under  which D agrees to provide B with a completed building on a specified  completion date on land currently owned by D. Under the agreement, D  holds title to the land and building and assumes any risk of loss until  the completion date, at which time title to the land and the building  will be transferred to B. No construction has been performed by the date  that B and D enter into the agreement. All payments by B to D for  construction of the building are construction expenditures because all  the payments are properly capitalized to the cost of the building, but  payments by B to D allocable to the acquisition of the land are not  construction expenditures.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. Right-of-way. P, a public agency, issues bonds to finance  the acquisition of a right-of-way and the construction of sewage lines  through numerous parcels of land. The right-of-way is acquired primarily  through P' s exercise of its powers of eminent domain. As of the issue  date, P reasonably expects that it will take approximately 2 years to  acquire the entire right-of-way because of the time normally required  for condemnation proceedings. No expenditures for the acquisition of the  right-of-way are construction expenditures because they are costs  incurred to acquire an interest in existing real property.</p><p class="depth3">Example 4. Subway cars. City C issues bonds to finance new subway  cars. C reasonably expects that it will take more than 6 months for the  subway cars to be constructed to C's specifications. The subway cars are  constructed personal property. Alternatively, if the builder of the  subway cars informs C that it will only take 3 months to build the  subway cars to C's specifications, no payments for the subway cars are  construction expenditures.</p><p class="depth3">Example 5. Fractional interest in property. U, a public agency,  issues bonds to finance an undivided fractional interest in a newly  constructed power-generating facility. U contributes its ratable share  of the cost of building the new facility to the project manager for the  facility. U's contributions are construction expenditures in the same  proportion that the total expenditures for the facility qualify as  construction expenditures.</p><p class="depth3">Example 6. Park land. City D issues bonds to finance the purchase of  unimproved land and the cost of subsequent improvements to the land,  such as grading and landscaping, necessary to transform it into a park.  The costs of the improvements are properly capitalizable to the cost of  the land, and therefore, are construction expenditures, but   expenditures for the acquisition of the land are not.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Reasonable retainage definition. Reasonable retainage means an  amount, not to exceed 5 percent of available construction proceeds as of  the end of the fourth spending period, that is retained for reasonable  business purposes relating to the property financed with the proceeds of  the issue. For example, a reasonable retainage may include a retention  to ensure or promote compliance with a construction contract in  circumstances in which the retained amount is not yet payable, or in  which the issuer reasonably determines that a dispute exists regarding  completion or payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Available construction proceeds--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definition in general.  Available construction proceeds has the meaning used in section  148(f)(4)(C)(vi). For purposes of this definition, earnings include  earnings on any tax-exempt bond. Pre-issuance accrued interest and  earnings thereon may be disregarded. Amounts that are not gross proceeds  as a result of the application of the universal cap under Sec. 1.148- 6(b)(2) are not available construction proceeds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Earnings on a reasonably required reserve or replacement fund.  Earnings on any reasonably required reserve or replacement fund are  available construction proceeds only to the extent that those earnings  accrue before the earlier of the date construction is substantially  completed or the date that is 2 years after the issue date. An issuer  may elect on or before the issue date to exclude from available  construction proceeds the earnings on such a fund. If the election is  made, the rebate requirement applies to the excluded amounts from the  issue date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reasonable expectations test for future earnings. For purposes  of determining compliance with the spending requirements as of the end  of each of the first three spending periods, available construction  proceeds include the amount of future earnings that the issuer  reasonably expected as of the issue date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Issuance costs. Available construction proceeds do not include  gross proceeds used to pay issuance costs financed by an issue, but do  include earnings on such proceeds. Thus, an expenditure of gross  proceeds of an issue for issuance costs does not count toward meeting  the spending requirements. The expenditure of earnings on gross proceeds  used to pay issuance costs does count toward meeting those requirements.  If the spending requirements are met and the proceeds used to pay  issuance costs are expended by the end of the fourth spending period,  those proceeds and the earnings thereon are treated as having satisfied  the rebate requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> One and one-half percent penalty in lieu of arbitrage rebate.  For purposes of the spending requirements of paragraph (e) of this  section, available construction proceeds as of the end of any spending  period are reduced by the amount of penalty in lieu of arbitrage rebate  (under paragraph (k) of this section) that the issuer has paid from  available construction proceeds before the last day of the spending  period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Payments on purpose investments and repayments of grants.  Available construction proceeds do not include--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Sale or investment proceeds derived from payments under any  purpose investment of the issue; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Repayments of grants (as defined in Sec. 1.148-6(d)(4))  financed by the issue.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Examples. The operation of this paragraph (i) is illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. Treatment of investment earnings. City F issues bonds  having an issue price of $10,000,000. F deposits all of the proceeds of  the issue into a construction fund to be used for expenditures other  than costs of issuance. F estimates on the issue date that, based on  reasonably expected expenditures and rates of investment, earnings on  the construction fund will be $800,000. As of the issue date and the end  of each of the first three spending periods, the amount of available  construction proceeds is $10,800,000. To qualify as a construction  issue, F must reasonably expect on the issue date that at least  $8,100,000 (75 percent of $10,800,000) will be used for construction  expenditures. In order to meet the 10 percent spending requirement at  the end of the first spending period, F must spend at least $1,080,000.  As of the end of the fourth spending period, F has received $1,100,000  in earnings. In order to meet the spending requirement at the end of the  fourth spending period, however, F must spend all of the $11,100,000 of  actual available construction proceeds (except for reasonable retainage  not exceeding $555,000).</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Treatment of investment earnings without a reserve fund.  City G issues bonds having an issue price of $11,200,000. G does not  elect to exclude earnings on the reserve fund from available  construction proceeds. G uses $200,000 of proceeds to pay issuance costs  and deposits $1,000,000 of proceeds into a reasonably required reserve  fund. G deposits the remaining $10,000,000 of proceeds into a  construction fund to be used for construction expenditures. On the issue  date, G reasonably expects that, based on the reasonably expected date  of substantial completion and rates of investment, total earnings on the  construction fund will be $800,000, and total earnings on the reserve  fund to the date of substantial completion will be $150,000. G  reasonably expects that substantial completion will occur during the  fourth spending period. As of the issue date, the amount of available  construction proceeds is $10,950,000 ($10,000,000 originally deposited  into the construction fund plus $800,000 expected earnings on the  construction fund and $150,000 expected earnings on the reserve fund).  To qualify as a construction issue, G must reasonably expect on the  issue date that at least $8,212,500 will be used for construction  expenditures.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. Election to exclude earnings on a reserve fund. The facts  are the same as Example 2, except that G elects on the issue date to  exclude earnings on the reserve fund from available construction  proceeds. The amount of available construction proceeds as of the issue  date is $10,800,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Election to treat portion of issue used for construction as  separate issue--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of paragraph (e) of this  section, if any proceeds of an issue are to be used for construction  expenditures, the issuer may elect on or before the issue date to treat  the portion of the issue that is not a refunding issue as two, and only  two, separate issues, if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> One of the separate issues is a construction issue as defined in  paragraph (f) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The issuer reasonably expects, as of the issue date, that this  construction issue will finance all of the construction expenditures to  be financed by the issue; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The issuer makes an election to apportion the issue under this  paragraph (j)(1) in which it identifies the amount of the issue price of  the issue allocable to the construction issue.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Example. The operation of this paragraph (j) is illustrated by  the following example.</p><p class="depth3">Example. City D issues bonds having an issue price of $19,000,000.  On the issue date, D reasonably expects to use $10,800,000 of bond  proceeds (including investment earnings) for construction expenditures  for the project being financed. D deposits $10,000,000 in a construction  fund to be used for construction expenditures and $9,000,000 in an  acquisition fund to be used for acquisition of equipment not qualifying  as construction expenditures. D estimates on the issue date, based on  reasonably expected expenditures and rates of investment, that total  earnings on the construction fund will be $800,000 and total earnings on  the acquisition fund will be $200,000. Because the total construction  expenditures to be financed by the issue are expected to be $10,800,000,  the maximum available construction proceeds for a construction issue is  $14,400,000 ($10,800,000 divided by 0.75). To determine the maximum  amount of the issue price allocable to a construction issue, the  estimated investment earnings allocable to the construction issue are  subtracted. The entire $800,000 of earnings on the construction fund are  allocable to the construction issue. Only a portion of the $200,000 of  earnings on the acquisition fund, however, are allocable to the  construction issue. The total amount of the available construction  proceeds that is expected to be used for acquisition is $3,600,000  ($14,400,000-$10,800,000). The portion of earnings on the acquisition  fund that is allocable to the construction issue is $78,261  ($200,000x$3,600,000/$9,200,000). Accordingly, D may elect on or before  the issue date to treat up to $13,521,739 of the issue price as a  construction issue ($14,400,000-$800,000-$78,261). D's election must  specify the amount of the issue price treated as a construction issue.  The balance of the issue price is treated as a separate nonconstruction  issue that is subject to the rebate requirement unless it meets another  exception to arbitrage rebate. Because the financing of a construction  issue is a separate governmental purpose under Sec. 1.148-9(h), the  election causes the issue to be a multipurpose issue under that section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> One and one-half percent penalty in lieu of arbitrage rebate-- </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Under section 148(f)(4)(C)(vii), an issuer of a  construction issue may elect on or before the issue date to pay a  penalty (the 1\1/2\ percent penalty) to the United States in lieu of the  obligation to pay the rebate amount on available construction proceeds  upon failure to satisfy the spending requirements of paragraph (e) of  this section. The 1\1/2\ percent penalty is calculated separately for  each spending period, including each semiannual period after the end of  the fourth spending period, and is equal   to 1.5 percent times the underexpended proceeds as of the end of the  spending period. For each spending period, underexpended proceeds equal  the amount of available construction proceeds required to be spent by  the end of the spending period, less the amount actually allocated to  expenditures for the governmental purposes of the issue by that date.  The 1\1/2\ percent penalty must be paid to the United States no later  than 90 days after the end of the spending period to which it relates.  The 1\1/2\ percent penalty continues to apply at the end of each  spending period and each semiannual period thereafter until the earliest  of the following--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The termination of the penalty under paragraph (l) of this  section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The expenditure of all of the available construction proceeds;  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The last stated final maturity date of bonds that are part of  the issue and any bonds that refund those bonds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Application to reasonable retainage. If an issue meets the  exception for reasonable retainage except that all retainage is not  spent within 3 years of the issue date, the issuer must pay the 1\1/2\  percent penalty to the United States for any reasonable retainage that  was not so spent as of the close of the 3-year period and each later  spending period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Coordination with rebate requirement. The rebate requirement is  treated as met with respect to available construction proceeds for a  period if the 1\1/2\ percent penalty is paid in accordance with this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Termination of 1\1/2\ percent penalty--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>Termination after  initial temporary period. The issuer may terminate the 1\1/2\ percent  penalty after the initial temporary period (a section 148(f)(4)(C)(viii)  penalty termination) if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Not later than 90 days after the earlier of the end of the  initial temporary period or the date construction is substantially  completed, the issuer elects to terminate the 1\1/2\ percent penalty;  provided that solely for this purpose, the initial temporary period may  be extended by the issuer to a date ending 5 years after the issue date;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Within 90 days after the end of the initial temporary period,  the issuer pays a penalty equal to 3 percent of the unexpended available  construction proceeds determined as of the end of the initial temporary  period, multiplied by the number of years (including fractions of years  computed to 2 decimal places) in the initial temporary period;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For the period beginning as of the close of the initial  temporary period, the unexpended available construction proceeds are not  invested in higher yielding investments; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> On the earliest date on which the bonds may be called or  otherwise redeemed, with or without a call premium, the unexpended  available construction proceeds as of that date (not including any  amount earned after the date on which notice of the redemption was  required to be given) must be used to redeem the bonds. Amounts used to  pay any call premium are treated as used to redeem bonds. This  redemption requirement may be met by purchases of bonds by the issuer on  the open market at prices not exceeding fair market value. A portion of  the annual principal payment due on serial bonds of a construction issue  may be paid from the unexpended amount, but only in an amount no greater  than the amount that bears the same ratio to the annual principal due  that the total unexpended amount bears to the issue price of the  construction issue.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Termination before end of initial temporary period. If the  construction to be financed by the construction issue is substantially  completed before the end of the initial temporary period, the issuer may  elect to terminate the 1\1/2\ percent penalty before the end of the  initial temporary period (a section 148(f)(4)(C)(ix) penalty  termination) if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Before the close of the initial temporary period and not later  than 90 days after the date the construction is substantially completed,  the issuer elects to terminate the 1\1/2\ percent penalty;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The election identifies the amount of available construction  proceeds that will not be spent for the governmental purposes of the  issue; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The issuer has met all of the conditions for a section  148(f)(4)(C)(viii) penalty termination, applied as if the initial  temporary period ended as of   the date the required election for a section 148(f)(4)(C)(ix) penalty  termination is made. That penalty termination election satisfies the  required election for a section 148(f)(4)(C)(viii) termination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Application to reasonable retainage. Solely for purposes of  determining whether the conditions for terminating the 1\1/2\ percent  penalty are met, reasonable retainage may be treated as spent for a  governmental purpose of the construction issue. Reasonable retainage  that is so treated continues to be subject to the 1\1/2\ percent  penalty.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Example. The operation of this paragraph (l) is illustrated by  the following example.</p><p class="depth3">Example. City I issues a construction issue having a 20-year  maturity and qualifying for a 3-year initial temporary period. The bonds  are first subject to optional redemption 10 years after the issue date  at a premium of 3 percent. I elects, on or before the issue date, to pay  the 1\1/2\ percent penalty in lieu of arbitrage rebate. At the end of  the 3-year temporary period, the project is not substantially completed,  and $1,500,000 of available construction proceeds of the issue are  unspent. At that time, I reasonably expects to need $500,000 to complete  the project. I may terminate the 1\1/2\ percent penalty in lieu of  arbitrage rebate with respect to the excess $1,500,000 by electing to  terminate within 90 days of the end of the initial temporary period;  paying a penalty to the United States of $135,000 (3 percent of  $1,500,000 multiplied by 3 years); restricting the yield on the  investment of unspent available construction proceeds for 7 years until  the first call date, although any portion of these proceeds may still be  spent on the project prior to that call date; and using the available  construction proceeds that, as of the first call date, have not been  allocated to expenditures for the governmental purposes of the issue to  redeem bonds on that call date. If I fails to make the termination  election, I is required to pay the 1\1/2\ percent penalty on unspent  available construction proceeds every 6 months until the latest maturity  date of bonds of the issue (or any bonds of another issue that refund  such bonds).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Payment of penalties. Each penalty payment under this section  must be paid in the manner provided in Sec. 1.148-3(g). See Sec.  1.148-3(h) for rules on failures to pay penalties under this section.
