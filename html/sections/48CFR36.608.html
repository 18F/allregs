                            <p class="depth0">Architect-engineer contractors shall be responsible for the  professional quality, technical accuracy, and coordination of all  services required under their contracts. A firm may be liable for  Government costs resulting from errors or deficiencies in designs  furnished under its contract. Therefore, when a modification to a  construction contract is required because of an error or deficiency in  the services provided under an architect-engineer contract, the  contracting officer (with the advice of technical personnel and legal  counsel) shall consider the extent to which the architect-engineer  contractor may be reasonably liable. The contracting officer shall  enforce the liability and issue a demand for payment of the amount due,  if the recoverable cost will exceed the administrative cost involved or  is otherwise in the Government's interest. The contracting officer shall  include in the contract file a written statement of the reasons for the  decision to recover or not to recover the costs from the firm.  [48 FR 42356, Sept. 19, 1983, as amended at 73 FR 54005, Sept. 17, 2008]</p>
