                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Backcountry camping. For purposes of clarification at Shenandoah National Park, ``backcountry camping'' is defined as any use of portable shelter or sleeping equipment in the backcountry. ``Backcountry'' is defined as those areas of the park which are more than 250 yards from a paved road, and more than one-half mile from any park facilities other than trails, unpaved roads and trail shelters. The Superintendent may designate areas where backcountry camping is prohibited if there would be potential damage to park resources or disruption to other park uses. Such areas will be

marked on maps available in the Superintendent's office, visitor centers and ranger stations. A person or group of persons may camp overnight at any other backcountry location within the park, except:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No person or group of persons traveling together may camp without a valid backcountry camping permit.
