However, an STL station (and any TV microwave booster station) associated with a TV broadcast station operated by remote control may be observed by monitoring the TV station's transmitted signal at the remote control point. Additionally, a TV translator relay station (and any associated TV microwave booster station) may be observed by monitoring the associated TV translator station's transmitted signal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The FCC may notify the licensee to cease or modify operation in the case of frequency usage disputes, interference or similar situations where such action appears to be in the public interest, convenience and necessity.
