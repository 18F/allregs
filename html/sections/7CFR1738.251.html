                            <p class="depth0">The Agency will notify the applicant of the loan offer, in writing, and the applicant will typically have 10 working days to accept the offer. If the applicant accepts the loan offer, a loan contract will be executed and sent to the applicant. The applicant must execute the loan contract and satisfy all conditions precedent to loan closing within the timeframe specified by the Agency which is typically 120 days from the date of the loan contract. If the conditions are not met within this timeframe, the loan offer will be terminated, unless the applicant requests and the Agency approves an extension. The Agency may approve such a request if the applicant has diligently sought to meet the conditions required for loan closing and has been unable to do so for reasons outside its control.</p>
