                                Sec. 416.1246  Disposal of resources at less than fair market value.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An individual (or eligible spouse) who gives away  or sells a nonexcluded resource for less than fair market value for the  purpose of establishing SSI or Medicaid eligibility will be charged with  the difference between the fair market value of the resource and the  amount of compensation received. The difference is referred to as  uncompensated value and is counted toward the resource limit (see  Sec. 416.1205) for a period of 24 months from the date of transfer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the transferred resource (asset) is returned to the  individual, the uncompensated value is no longer counted as of the date  of return. If the transferred asset is cash, the uncompensated value is  reduced as of the date of return by the amount of cash that is returned.  No income will be charged as a result of such returns. The returned  asset will be evaluated as a resource according to the rules described  in Secs. 416.1201 through 416.1230 as of the first day of the following  month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the individual receives additional compensation in the form  of cash for the transferred asset the uncompensated value is reduced, as  of the date the additional cash compensation is received, by the amount  of that additional compensation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Fair market value. Fair market value is equal to the current  market value of a resource at the time of transfer or contract of sale,  if earlier. See Sec. 416.1101 for definition of current market value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Compensation. The compensation for a resource includes all  money, real or personal property, food, shelter, or services received by  the individual (or eligible spouse) at or after the time of transfer in  exchange for the resource if the compensation was provided pursuant to a  binding (legally enforceable) agreement in effect at the time of  transfer. Compensation also includes all money, real or personal  property, food, shelter, or services received prior to the actual  transfer if they were provided pursuant to a binding (legally  enforceable) agreement whereby the eligible individual would transfer  the resource or otherwise pay for such items. In addition, payment or  assumption of a legal debt owed by the eligible individual in exchange  for the asset is considered compensation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Uncompensated value--General. The uncompensated value is the  fair market value of a resource at the time of transfer minus the amount  of compensation received by the individual (or eligible spouse) in  exchange for the resource. However, if the transferred resource was  partially excluded, we will not count uncompensated value in an amount  greater than the countable value of the resources at the time of  transfer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Suspension of counting as a resource the uncompensated value  where necessary   to avoid undue hardship. We will suspend counting as a resource the  uncompensated value of the transferred asset for any month in the 24- month period if such counting will result in undue hardship. We will  resume counting the uncompensated value as a resource for any month of  the 24-month period in which counting will not result in undue hardship.  We will treat as part of the 24-month period any months during which we  suspend the counting of uncompensated value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When undue hardship exists. Undue hardship exists when:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An individual alleges that failure to receive SSI benefits would  deprive the individual of food or shelter; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The applicable Federal benefit rate (plus the federally- administered State supplementary payment level) exceeds the sum of: The  individual's monthly countable and excludable income and monthly  countable and excludable liquid resources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Presumption that resource was transferred to establish SSI or  Medicaid eligibility. Transfer of a resource for less than fair market  value is presumed to have been made for the purpose of establishing SSI  or Medicaid eligibility unless the individual (or eligible spouse)  furnishes convincing evidence that the resource was transferred  exclusively for some other reason. Convincing evidence may be pertinent  documentary or non-documentary evidence which shows, for example, that  the transfer was ordered by a court, or that at the time of transfer the  individual could not have anticipated becoming eligible due to the  existence of other circumstances which would have precluded eligibility.  The burden of rebutting the presumption that a resource was transferred  to establish SSI or Medicaid eligibility rests with the individual (or  eligible spouse).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Applicability. This section applies only to transfers of  resources that occurred before July 1, 1988. Paragraphs (d)(2) and  (d)(3) of this section, regarding undue hardship, are effective for such  transfers on or after April 1, 1988.  [48 FR 40885, Sept. 12, 1983, as amended at 50 FR 38982, Sept. 26, 1985;  53 FR 13257, Apr. 22, 1988; 55 FR 10419, Mar. 21, 1990]</p>
