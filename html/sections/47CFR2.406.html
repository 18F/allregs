                            <p class="depth0">Any common carrier subject to the Communications Act may render to any agency of the United States Government free service in connection with the preparation for the national defense. Every such carrier rendering any such free service shall make and file, in duplicate, with the Commission, on or before the 31st day of July and on or before the 31st day of January in each year, reports covering the periods of 6 months ending on the 30th day of June and the 31st day of December, respectively, next prior to said dates. These reports shall show the names of the agencies to which free service was rendered pursuant to this rule, the general character of the communications handled for each agency, and the charges in dollars which would have accrued to the carrier for such service rendered to each agency if charges for all such communications had been collected at the published tariff rates.</p>
