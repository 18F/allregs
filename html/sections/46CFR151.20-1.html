                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Cargo piping systems shall be arranged and fabricated in  accordance with this section and Subchapter F. The class of piping  system required for a specific cargo shall be as listed in Table 151.05  as a minimum; however, a   higher class may be required when the actual service temperature or  pressure so dictates. See Table 56.04-2 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Piping system components shall be suitable for use with the  cargoes for which the barge is certificated, and shall be of materials  listed in Subchapter F of this chapter, or such other material as the  Commandant may specifically approve. All piping materials shall be  tested in accordance with the requirements of Subchapter F of this  chapter. The valve seat material, packing, gaskets, and all other  material which comes into contact with the cargo shall be resistant to  the chemical action of the cargoes for which the barge is certificated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cargo piping systems, when subject to corrosive attack of the  cargo, and when serving cargo tanks which are required by this  subchapter to be lined or coated, shall be constructed of, lined or  coated with corrosion-resistant material. Vent systems shall be  similarly constructed, lined, or coated up to and including the vent  control device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All piping systems components shall have a pressure rating at  operating temperature (according to the applicable American National  Standards Institute, Inc., pressure/temperature relations) not less than  the maximum pressure to which the system may be subjected. Piping which  is not protected by a relief valve, or which can be isolated from its  relief valve, shall be designed for the greatest of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The cargo vapor pressure at 115 [deg]F.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The maximum allowable working pressure of the cargo tank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The pressure of the associated pump or compressor relief valve.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The total discharge head of the associated pump or compressor  where a discharge relief valve is not used.  The escape from cargo piping system relief valves shall be run to  venting system or to a suitable recovery system. Provisions shall be  made for pressure relief of all piping, valves, fittings, etc., in which  excessive pressure build-up may occur because of an increase in product  temperature.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Provisions shall be made by the use of offsets, loops, bends,  expansion joints, etc., to protect the piping and tank from excessive  stress due to thermal movement and/or movements of the tank and hull  structure. Expansion joints shall be held to a minimum and where used  shall be subject to individual approval by the Commandant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Low temperature piping shall be isolated from the hull  structure. Where necessary, arrangements to provide for the protection  of the hull structure from leaks in low temperature systems in way of  pumps, flanges, etc., shall be provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Connections to tanks shall be protected against mechanical  damage and tampering. Underdeck cargo piping shall not be installed  between the outboard side of cargo containment spaces and the skin of  the barge, unless provision is made to maintain the minimum inspection  and collision protection clearances (where required) between the piping  and the skin. Cargo piping which is external to tanks, and is installed  below the weather deck shall be joined by welding, except for flanged  connections to shutoff valves and expansion joints.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Piping shall enter independent cargo tanks above the  weatherdeck, either through or as close to the tank dome as possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Horizontal runs of cargo piping on integral tank barges may be  run above or below the weatherdeck. When run below the weatherdeck, the  following are applicable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Horizontal runs located entirely within integral cargo tanks  shall be fitted with a stop valve, located inside the tank that is being  serviced and operable from the weatherdeck. There shall be cargo  compatibility in the event of a piping failure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Horizontal runs of cargo piping installed in pipe tunnels may  penetrate gravity type tanks below the weatherdeck: Provided, That each  penetration is fitted with a stop valve operable from the weatherdeck.  If the tunnel is directly accessible from the weatherdeck without  penetrating the cargo tank, the stop valve shall be located on the  tunnel side. If the tunnel is not accessible from the weatherdeck, the  valve shall be located on the tank side of the penetration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The tunnel shall comply with all tank requirements for  construction, location, ventilation, and electrical hazard. There shall  be cargo compatibility in the event of a piping failure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The tunnel shall have no other openings except to the  weatherdeck or a cargo pumproom.</p>
