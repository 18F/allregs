(i) The term deposit broker means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any person engaged in the business of placing deposits, or facilitating the placement of deposits, of third parties with insured depository institutions, or the business of placing deposits with insured depository institutions for the purpose of selling interests in those deposits to third parties; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An agent or trustee who establishes a deposit account to facilitate a business arrangement with an insured depository institution to use the proceeds of the account to fund a prearranged loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The term deposit broker does not include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An insured depository institution, with respect to funds placed with that depository institution;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An employee of an insured depository institution, with respect to funds placed with the employing depository institution;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A trust department of an insured depository institution, if the trust or other fiduciary relationship in question has not been established for the primary purpose of placing funds with insured depository institutions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The trustee of a pension or other employee benefit plan, with respect to funds of the plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> A person acting as a plan administrator or an investment adviser in

(1) A well capitalized insured depository institution may solicit and accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit without restriction by this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> An adequately capitalized insured depository institution may not accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless it has applied for and been granted a waiver of this prohibition by the FDIC in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An adequately capitalized insured depository institution may not accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless it has applied for and been granted a waiver of this prohibition by the FDIC in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any adequately capitalized insured depository institution that has been granted a waiver to accept, renew or roll over a brokered deposit may not pay an effective yield on any such deposit which, at the time that such deposit is accepted, renewed or rolled over, exceeds by more than 75 basis points:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The effective yield paid on deposits of comparable size and maturity in such institution's normal market area for deposits accepted from within its normal market area; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The national rate paid on deposits of comparable size and maturity for deposits accepted outside the institution's normal market area. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B), the national rate shall be a simple average of rates paid by all insured depository institutions and branches for which data are available. This rate shall be determined by the FDIC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(i)</em> An undercapitalized insured depository institution may not accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An undercapitalized insured depository institution may not accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An undercapitalized insured depository institution may not solicit deposits by offering an effective yield that exceeds by more than 75 basis points the prevailing effective yields on insured deposits of comparable maturity in such institution's normal market area or in the market area in which such deposits are being solicited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Waiver. The FDIC may, on a case-by-case basis and upon application by

an adequately capitalized insured depository institution, waive the prohibition on the acceptance, renewal or rollover of brokered deposits upon a finding that such acceptance, renewal or rollover does not constitute an unsafe or unsound practice with respect to such institution. The FDIC may conclude that it is not unsafe or unsound and may grant a waiver when the acceptance, renewal or rollover of brokered deposits is determined to pose no undue risk to the institution. Any waiver granted may be revoked at any time by written notice to the institution. For filing requirements, consult 12 CFR 303.243.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Exclusion for institutions in FDIC conservatorship. No insured depository institution for which the FDIC has been appointed conservator shall be subject to the prohibition on the acceptance, renewal or rollover of brokered deposits contained in this Sec. 337.6 or section 29 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act for 90 days after the date on which the institution was placed in conservatorship. During this 90-day period, the institution shall, nevertheless, be subject to the restriction on the payment of interest contained in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of the section. After such 90-day period, the institution may not accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> A market is any readily defined geographical area in which the rates offered by any one insured depository institution soliciting deposits in that area may affect the rates offered by other insured depository institutions operating in the same area. The effective yield on a deposit with an odd maturity shall be determined by interpolating between the yields offered by other insured depository institutions on deposits of the next longer and shorter maturities offered in the market. For purposes of this Sec. 337.6, a presumption shall exist that the prevailing rate or effective yield in the relevant market is the national rate as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section unless the FDIC determines, in its sole discretion based on available evidence, that the effective yield in that market differs from the national rate. Evidence of the effective yield in a particular market may include (but is not limited to) the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Evidence as to the rates paid by other insured depository institutions in the same State, county or metropolitan statistical area (though the FDIC shall not be obligated to recognize each State, county or metropolitan statistical area as a separate market area);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Evidence as to the rates paid by credit unions in the same market area if the FDIC determines that the insured depository institution competes directly with these credit unions; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Evidence as to the different rates paid on different deposit products in the same market area (though the FDIC shall not be obligated to recognize all alleged distinctions among various deposit products). (Example: For a particular market, evidence exists that the rates on money market deposit accounts (MMDAs) differ from the rates on negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts. MMDAs are distinguishable from NOW accounts in that the two types of accounts are subject to different legal requirements. Under these circumstances, for this market, the FDIC could recognize that the prevailing rate on MMDAs is different than the prevailing rate on NOW accounts.)
