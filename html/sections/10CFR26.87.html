                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each FFD program must have one or more designated collection sites that have all necessary personnel, materials, equipment, facilities, and supervision to collect specimens for drug testing and to perform alcohol testing. Each collection site must provide for the collection, security, temporary storage, and shipping or transportation of urine specimens to a drug testing laboratory; the collection of oral fluids or breath specimens; and the security of alcohol testing devices and test results. A properly equipped mobile facility that meets the requirements of this section is an acceptable collection site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The collection site must provide for the donor's visual privacy while the donor and collector are viewing the results of an alcohol test, and for individual privacy while the donor is submitting a urine specimen, except if a directly observed urine specimen collection is required. Unauthorized personnel may not be present for the specimen collection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contracts for collection site services must permit representatives of the NRC, licensee, or other entity to conduct unannounced inspections and audits and to obtain all information and documentation that is reasonably relevant to the inspections and audits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Licensees and other entities shall take the following measures to prevent unauthorized access to the collection site that could compromise the integrity of the collection process or the specimens.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unauthorized personnel may not be permitted in any part of the designated collection site where specimens are collected or stored;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A designated collection site must be secure. If a collection site is dedicated solely to specimen collection, it must be secure at all times. Methods of assuring security may include, but are not limited to, physical measures to control access, such as locked doors, alarms, or visual monitoring of the collection site when it is not occupied; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a collection site cannot be dedicated solely to collecting specimens, the portion of the facility that is used for specimen collection must be secured and, during the time period during which a specimen is being collected, a sign must be posted to indicate that access is permitted only for authorized personnel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The following steps must be taken to deter the dilution and adulteration of urine specimens at the collection site:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Agents that color any source of standing water in the stall or room in which the donor will provide a specimen, including, but not limited to, the toilet bowl or tank, must be placed in the source of standing water, so that the reservoirs of water are neither yellow nor colorless;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There must be no other source of water (e.g., no shower or sink) in the enclosure where urination occurs, or the source of water must be rendered unusable; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Chemicals or products that could be used to contaminate or otherwise alter the specimen must be removed from the collection site or secured. The collector shall inspect the enclosure in which urination will occur before each collection to ensure that no materials are available that could be used to subvert the testing process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In the exceptional event that a designated collection site is inaccessible and there is an immediate requirement to collect a urine specimen, including, but not limited to, an event investigation, then the licensee or other entity may use a public rest room, onsite rest room, or hospital examining room according to the following procedures:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The facility must be secured by visual inspection to ensure that no unauthorized persons are present, and that undetected access (e.g., through a rear door not in the view of the collector) is impossible. Security during the collection may be maintained by restricting access to collection materials and specimens. In the case of a public rest room, a sign must be posted or an individual assigned to ensure that no unauthorized personnel are present during the entire collection procedure to avoid embarrassment of the donor and distraction of the collector.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If practical, a water coloring agent that meets the requirements of Sec. 26.87(e)(1) must be placed in the toilet

bowl to be used by the donor and in any other accessible source of standing water, including, but not limited to, the toilet tank. The collector shall instruct the donor not to flush the toilet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A collector of the same gender as the donor shall accompany the donor into the area that will be used for specimen collection, but remain outside of the stall, if it is a multi-stalled rest room, or outside of the door to the room, if it is a single rest room, in which the donor will provide the specimen. If a collector of the same gender is not available, the collector shall select a same-gender person to accompany the donor. This person shall be instructed on the collection procedures specified in this subpart and his or her identity must be documented on the custody-and-control form.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> After the collector has possession of the specimen, the collector shall inspect the toilet bowl and area to ensure that there is no evidence of a subversion attempt and shall then flush the toilet. The collector shall instruct the donor to participate with the collector in completing the chain-of-custody procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If it is impractical to maintain continuous physical security of a collection site from the time a urine specimen is presented until the sealed container is transferred for shipment, the specimen must remain under the direct control of an individual who is authorized by the licensee or other entity until the specimen is prepared for transfer, storage, or shipping, as required by Sec. 26.117. The authorized individual shall be instructed on his or her responsibilities for maintaining custody and control of the specimen and his or her custody of the specimen must be documented on the custody-and-control form.</p>
