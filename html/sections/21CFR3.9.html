A  sponsor shall be given 30 days written notice of any proposed  nonconsensual change in designated agency component. The sponsor may  request an additional 30 days to submit written objections, not to  exceed 15 pages, to the proposed change, and shall be granted, upon  request, a timely meeting with the product jurisdiction officer and  appropriate center officials. Within 30 days of receipt of the sponsor's  written objections, the product jurisdiction officer shall issue to the  sponsor, with copies to appropriate center officials, a written  determination setting forth a statement of reasons for the proposed  change in designated agency component. A nonconsensual change in the  designated   agency component requires the concurrence of the Principal Associate  Commissioner.
