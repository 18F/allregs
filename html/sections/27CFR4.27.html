In no event  may the quantity of wine removed from the producing winery, under labels  bearing a vintage date, exceed the volume of vintage wine produced in  that winery during the year indicated by the vintage date. The following  additional rules apply to vintage labeling:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an American or imported wine is labeled with a viticultural  area appellation of origin (or its foreign equivalent), at least 95  percent of the wine must have been derived from grapes harvested in the  labeled calendar year; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an American or imported wine is labeled with an appellation  of origin other than a viticultural area (or its foreign equivalent), at  least 85 percent of the wine must have been derived from grapes  harvested in the labeled calendar year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> American wine. A permittee who produced and bottled or packed  the wine, or a person other than the producer who repackaged the wine in  containers of 5 liters or less may show the year of vintage upon the  label if the person possesses appropriate records from the producer  substantiating the year of vintage and the appellation of origin; and if  the wine is made in compliance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Imported wine. Imported wine may bear a vintage date if all of  the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is made in compliance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of  this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is bottled in containers of 5 liters or less prior to  importation, or it is bottled in the United States from the original  container of the product (showing a vintage date); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The invoice is accompanied by, or the American bottler  possesses, a certificate issued by a duly authorized official of the  country of origin (if the country of origin authorizes the issuance of  such certificates) certifying that the wine is of the vintage shown,  that the laws of the country regulate the appearance of vintage dates  upon the labels of wine produced for consumption within the country of  origin, that the wine has been produced in conformity with those laws,  and that the wine would be entitled to bear the vintage date if it had  been sold within the country of origin.
