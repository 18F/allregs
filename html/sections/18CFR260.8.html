                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each Major natural gas pipeline company, having a system  delivery capacity in excess of 100,000 Mcf per day (measured at 14.73  p.s.i.a. and 60 [deg]F.), shall file with the Commission by June 1 of  each year five (5) copies of a diagram or diagrams reflecting operating  conditions on its main transmission system during the previous twelve  months ended December 31. For purposes of system peak deliveries, the  heating season overlapping the year's end shall be used. Facilities  shall be those installed and in operation on December 31 of the  reporting year. All volumes shall be reported on a uniform stated  pressure and temperature base.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The diagram or diagrams shall include the following items of  information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Nominal diameter (inches) of each pipeline.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Miles of pipeline (to nearest 0.1 mile) between points of  intake, delivery, river crossings, storage fields, crossovers,  compressor stations and connections with other pipeline companies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Direction of flow in the pipelines. If direction of flow can be  reversed at compressor stations, so indicate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Maximum permissible operating pressure for each pipeline at  discharge side of each compressor station or other critical point,  determined by the Department of Transportation's safety standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Total horsepower of compressor engines installed at each  compressor station.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Designed suction pressure for each compressor station, p.s.i.g.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Designed discharge pressure for each station, p.s.i.g.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Maximum volume, Mcf per day that can be compressed at each  compressor station under conditions of suction and discharge set forth  in paragraphs (b) (6) and (7) of this section. If direction of flow  affects these factors provide the information for each direction of  flow.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The fuel requirement at each compressor station under conditions  described in paragraph (b)(8) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Pressure in the pipeline at points of emergency interconnection  with other pipeline companies which can normally be expected to exist,  and the volume which could be delivered or received at such emergency  interconnection points at such pressures. Give the name of the  interconnecting company.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> For each storage field, connected to the system and operated by  the respondent pipeline company, the maximum dependable daily and  seasonal withdrawal volumes available under normal conditions of  operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Volumes delivered: (i) The average daily volumes delivered at  each takeoff point, (ii) the volumes delivered at each takeoff point on  the day of maximum coincidental delivery, and (iii) the maximum daily  volumes (noncoincidental) delivered to each customer under rates subject  to FERC jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> The average daily volume received at each intake point to the  transmission pipeline system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> The volume received into the transmission pipeline system at  each intake point on the day of maximum coincidental delivery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> The information required by paragraphs (b)(12), (13) and (14),  of this section may be furnished in tabular form, or by reference to  FERC Form No. 2, providing, that the information is suitably keyed to  the diagram by appropriate identifying symbol or number.
