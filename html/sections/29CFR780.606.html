                                Sec. 780.606  Interpretation of term ``agriculture.''
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Section 3(f) of the Act, which defines ``agriculture,'' has been  extensively interpreted by the Department of Labor and the courts.  Subpart B of this part 780 contains those interpretations which have  full application in construing the term ``agriculture'' as used in the  13(b)(13) exemption.    Sec. 780.607  ``Primarily employed'' in agriculture.</p><p class="depth0">Not only must the employee be employed in agriculture, but he must  be ``primarily'' so employed during the particular workweek or weeks in  which the 13(b)(13) exemption is to be applied. The word ``primarily''  may be considered to mean chiefly or principally (Agnew v. Board of  Governors, 153 F. 2d 785). This interpretation is consistent with the  view, expressed by the sponsor of the exemption at the time of its  adoption on the floor of the Senate (107 Cong. Rec. (daily ed., April  19, 1961), p. 5879), that the word means ``most of his time.'' The  Department of Labor will consider that an employee who spends more than  one-half of his hours worked in the particular workweek in agriculture,  as defined in the Act, is ``primarily'' employed in agriculture during  that week.    Sec. 780.608  ``During his workweek.''</p><p class="depth0">Section 13(b)(13) specifically requires that the unit of time to be  used in determining whether an employee is primarily employed in  agriculture is ``during his workweek.'' The employee's own workweek, and  not that of any other person, is to be used in applying the exemption.  The employee's employment must meet the ``primarily'' test in each  workweek in which the exemption is applied to him.</p>
