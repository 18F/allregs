                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided in this part, a person  must provide to a consumer a notice (``risk-based pricing notice'') in  the form and manner required by this part if the person both--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Uses a consumer report in connection with an application for, or  a grant, extension, or other provision of, credit to that consumer that  is primarily for personal, family, or household purposes; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Based in whole or in part on the consumer report, grants,  extends, or otherwise provides credit to that consumer on material terms  that are materially less favorable than the most favorable material  terms available to a substantial proportion of consumers from or through  that person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determining which consumers must receive a notice. A person may  determine whether paragraph (a) of this section applies by directly  comparing the material terms offered to each consumer and the material  terms offered to other consumers for a specific type of credit product.  For purposes of this section, a ``specific type of credit product''  means one or more credit products with similar features that are  designed for similar purposes. Examples of a specific type of credit  product include student loans, unsecured credit cards, secured credit  cards, new automobile loans, used automobile loans, fixed-rate mortgage  loans, and variable-rate mortgage loans. As an alternative to making  this direct comparison, a person may make the determination by using one  of the following methods:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Credit score proxy method--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. A person that sets  the material terms of credit granted, extended, or otherwise provided to  a consumer, based in whole or in part on a credit score, may comply with  the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section by--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Determining the credit score (hereafter referred to as the  ``cutoff score'') that represents the point at which approximately 40  percent of the consumers to whom it grants, extends, or provides credit  have higher credit scores and approximately 60 percent of the consumers  to whom it grants, extends, or provides credit have lower credit scores;  and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Providing a risk-based pricing notice to each consumer to whom  it grants, extends, or provides credit whose credit score is lower than  the cutoff score.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Alternative to the 40/60 cutoff score determination. In the  case of credit that has been granted, extended, or provided on the most  favorable material terms to more than 40 percent of consumers, a person  may, at its option, set its cutoff score at a point at which the  approximate percentage of consumers who historically have been granted,  extended, or provided credit on material terms other than the most  favorable terms would receive risk-based pricing notices under this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Determining the cutoff score--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Sampling approach. A person  that currently uses risk-based pricing with respect to the credit  products it offers must calculate the cutoff score by considering the  credit scores of all or a representative sample of the consumers to whom  it has granted, extended, or provided credit for a specific type of  credit product.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Secondary source approach in limited circumstances. A person  that is a new entrant into the credit business, introduces new credit  products, or starts to use risk-based pricing with respect to the credit  products it currently offers may initially determine the cutoff score  based on information   derived from appropriate market research or relevant third-party sources  for a specific type of credit product, such as research or data from  companies that develop credit scores. A person that acquires a credit  portfolio as a result of a merger or acquisition may determine the  cutoff score based on information from the party which it acquired, with  which it merged, or from which it acquired the portfolio.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Recalculation of cutoff scores. A person using the credit score  proxy method must recalculate its cutoff score(s) no less than every two  years in the manner described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this  section. A person using the credit score proxy method using market  research, third-party data, or information from a party which it  acquired, with which it merged, or from which it acquired the portfolio  as permitted by paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(B) of this section generally must  calculate a cutoff score(s) based on the scores of its own consumers in  the manner described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section within  one year after it begins using a cutoff score derived from market  research, third-party data, or information from a party which it  acquired, with which it merged, or from which it acquired the portfolio.  If such a person does not grant, extend, or provide credit to new  consumers during that one-year period such that it lacks sufficient data  with which to recalculate a cutoff score based on the credit scores of  its own consumers, the person may continue to use a cutoff score derived  from market research, third-party data, or information from a party  which it acquired, with which it merged, or from which it acquired the  portfolio as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(B) until it obtains  sufficient data on which to base the recalculation. However, the person  must recalculate its cutoff score(s) in the manner described in  paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section within two years, if it has  granted, extended, or provided credit to some new consumers during that  two-year period.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Use of two or more credit scores. A person that generally uses  two or more credit scores in setting the material terms of credit  granted, extended, or provided to a consumer must determine the cutoff  score using the same method the person uses to evaluate multiple scores  when making credit decisions. These evaluation methods may include, but  are not limited to, selecting the low, median, high, most recent, or  average credit score of each consumer to whom it grants, extends, or  provides credit. If a person that uses two or more credit scores does  not consistently use the same method for evaluating multiple credit  scores (e.g., if the person sometimes chooses the median score and other  times calculates the average score), the person must determine the  cutoff score using a reasonable means. In such cases, use of any one of  the methods that the person regularly uses or the average credit score  of each consumer to whom it grants, extends, or provides credit is  deemed to be a reasonable means of calculating the cutoff score.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Credit score not available. For purposes of this section, a  person using the credit score proxy method who grants, extends, or  provides credit to a consumer for whom a credit score is not available  must assume that the consumer receives credit on material terms that are  materially less favorable than the most favorable credit terms offered  to a substantial proportion of consumers from or through that person and  must provide a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Examples. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A credit card issuer engages in risk-based pricing  and the annual percentage rates it offers to consumers are based in  whole or in part on a credit score. The credit card issuer takes a  representative sample of the credit scores of consumers to whom it  issued credit cards within the preceding three months. The credit card  issuer determines that approximately 40 percent of the sampled consumers  have a credit score at or above 720 (on a scale of 350 to 850) and  approximately 60 percent of the sampled consumers have a credit score  below 720. Thus, the card issuer selects 720 as its cutoff score. A  consumer applies to the credit card issuer for a credit card. The card  issuer obtains a credit score for the consumer. The consumer's credit  score is 700. Since the consumer's 700 credit score falls below the 720  cutoff score, the credit card issuer must provide a   risk-based pricing notice to the consumer.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A credit card issuer engages in risk-based pricing, and the  annual percentage rates it offers to consumers are based in whole or in  part on a credit score. The credit card issuer takes a representative  sample of the consumers to whom it issued credit cards over the  preceding six months. The credit card issuer determines that  approximately 80 percent of the sampled consumers received credit at its  lowest annual percentage rate, and 20 percent received credit at a  higher annual percentage rate. Approximately 80 percent of the sampled  consumers have a credit score at or above 750 (on a scale of 350 to  850), and 20 percent have a credit score below 750. Thus, the card  issuer selects 750 as its cutoff score. A consumer applies to the credit  card issuer for a credit card. The card issuer obtains a credit score  for the consumer. The consumer's credit score is 740. Since the  consumer's 740 credit score falls below the 750 cutoff score, the credit  card issuer must provide a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> An auto lender engages in risk-based pricing, obtains credit  scores from one of the nationwide consumer reporting agencies, and uses  the credit score proxy method to determine which consumers must receive  a risk-based pricing notice. A consumer applies to the auto lender for  credit to finance the purchase of an automobile. A credit score about  that consumer is not available from the consumer reporting agency from  which the lender obtains credit scores. The lender nevertheless grants,  extends, or provides credit to the consumer. The lender must provide a  risk-based pricing notice to the consumer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Tiered pricing method--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. A person that sets the  material terms of credit granted, extended, or provided to a consumer by  placing the consumer within one of a discrete number of pricing tiers  for a specific type of credit product, based in whole or in part on a  consumer report, may comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of  this section by providing a risk-based pricing notice to each consumer  who is not placed within the top pricing tier or tiers, as described  below.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Four or fewer pricing tiers. If a person using the tiered  pricing method has four or fewer pricing tiers, the person complies with  the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section by providing a risk- based pricing notice to each consumer to whom it grants, extends, or  provides credit who does not qualify for the top tier (that is, the  lowest-priced tier). For example, a person that uses a tiered pricing  structure with annual percentage rates of 8, 10, 12, and 14 percent  would provide the risk-based pricing notice to each consumer to whom it  grants, extends, or provides credit at annual percentage rates of 10,  12, and 14 percent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Five or more pricing tiers. If a person using the tiered  pricing method has five or more pricing tiers, the person complies with  the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section by providing a risk- based pricing notice to each consumer to whom it grants, extends, or  provides credit who does not qualify for the top two tiers (that is, the  two lowest-priced tiers) and any other tier that, together with the top  tiers, comprise no less than the top 30 percent but no more than the top  40 percent of the total number of tiers. Each consumer placed within the  remaining tiers must receive a risk-based pricing notice. For example,  if a person has nine pricing tiers, the top three tiers (that is, the  three lowest-priced tiers) comprise no less than the top 30 percent but  no more than the top 40 percent of the tiers. Therefore, a person using  this method would provide a risk-based pricing notice to each consumer  to whom it grants, extends, or provides credit who is placed within the  bottom six tiers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Application to credit card issuers--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A credit  card issuer subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section  may use one of the methods set forth in paragraph (b) of this section to  identify consumers to whom it must provide a risk-based pricing notice.  Alternatively, a credit card issuer may satisfy its obligations under  paragraph (a) of this section by providing a risk-based pricing notice  to a consumer when--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A consumer applies for a credit card either in connection with  an application program, such as a direct-   mail offer or a take-one application, or in response to a solicitation  under 12 CFR 226.5a, and more than a single possible purchase annual  percentage rate may apply under the program or solicitation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> available in  connection with the application or solicitation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No requirement to compare different offers. A credit card issuer  is not subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and  is not required to provide a risk-based pricing notice to a consumer  if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The consumer applies for a credit card for which the card issuer  provides a single annual percentage rate referenced in Sec.  640.2(n)(1)(ii), excluding a temporary initial rate that is lower than  the rate that will apply after the temporary rate expires and a penalty  rate that will apply upon the occurrence of one or more specific events,  such as a late payment or an extension of credit that exceeds the credit  limit; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> is available under a  different credit card offer issued by the card issuer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Examples. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A credit card issuer sends a solicitation to the  consumer that discloses several possible purchase annual percentage  rates that may apply, such as 10, 12, or 14 percent, or a range of  purchase annual percentage rates from 10 to 14 percent. The consumer  applies for a credit card in response to the solicitation. The card  issuer provides a credit card to the consumer with a purchase annual  percentage rate of 12 percent based in whole or in part on a consumer  report. Unless an exception applies under Sec. 640.5, the card issuer  may satisfy its obligations under paragraph (a) of this section by  providing a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer because the  consumer received credit at a purchase annual percentage rate greater  than the lowest purchase annual percentage rate available under that  solicitation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The same facts as in the example in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this  section, except that the card issuer provides a credit card to the  consumer at a purchase annual percentage rate of 10 percent. The card  issuer is not required to provide a risk-based pricing notice to the  consumer even if, under a different credit card solicitation, that  consumer or other consumers might qualify for a purchase annual  percentage rate of 8 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Account review--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided in  this part, a person is subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of  this section and must provide a risk-based pricing notice to a consumer  in the form and manner required by this part if the person--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Uses a consumer report in connection with a review of credit  that has been extended to the consumer; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> in the case of a credit card).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Example. A credit card issuer periodically obtains consumer  reports for the purpose of reviewing the terms of credit it has extended  to consumers in connection with credit cards. As a result of this  review, the credit card issuer increases the purchase annual percentage  rate applicable to a consumer's credit card based in whole or in part on  information in a consumer report. The credit card issuer is subject to  the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and must provide a  risk-based pricing notice to the consumer.</p>
