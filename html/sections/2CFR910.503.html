To  the extent that such audit provides DOE with the information it requires  to carry out its responsibilities under Federal statute or regulation,  DOE must rely upon and use that information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, DOE, Inspectors  General, or GAO may conduct or arrange for additional audits which are  necessary to carry out its responsibilities under Federal statute or  regulation. The provisions of this Part do not authorize any for-profit  entity to constrain, in any manner, DOE from carrying out or arranging  for such additional audits, except that DOE must plan such audits to not  be duplicative of other audits of DOE. Any additional audits must be  planned and performed in such a way as to build upon work performed,  including the audit documentation, sampling, and testing already  performed, by other auditors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The provisions of this Part do not limit the authority of DOE to  conduct, or arrange for the conduct of, audits and evaluations of DOE  awards, nor limit the authority of any Federal agency Inspector General  or other Federal official.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> DOE to pay for additional audits. If DOE conducts or arranges  for additional audits it must, consistent with other applicable Federal  statutes and regulations, arrange for funding the full cost of such  additional audits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Not applicable.</p>
