                            <p class="depth0">Under the Caribbean Basin Trade Initiative, the United States Trade  Representative has determined that, for acquisitions covered by the WTO  GPA, Caribbean Basin country end products, construction material, and  services must be treated as eligible products. In accordance with  Section 201 (a)(3) of the Dominican Republic--Central America--United  States Free Trade Implementation Act (Pub. L. 109-53) (19 U.S.C. 4031),  when the CAFTA-DR agreement enters into force with respect to a country,  that country is no longer designated as a beneficiary country for  purposes of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act, and is therefore  no longer included in the definition of ``Caribbean Basin country'' for  purposes of the Caribbean Basin Trade Initiative.
