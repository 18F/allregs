                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This section describes the accounting treatment of activities  classified for accounting purposes as ``nonregulated.'' Preemptively  deregulated activities and activities (other than incidental activities)  never subject to regulation will be classified for accounting purposes  as ``nonregulated.'' Activities that qualify for incidental treatment  under the policies of this Commission will be classified for accounting  purposes as regulated activities. Activities that have been deregulated  by a state will be classified for accounting purposes as regulated  activities. Activities that have been deregulated at the interstate  level, but not preemptively deregulated, will be classified for  accounting purposes as regulated activities until such time as this  Commission decides otherwise. The treatment of nonregulated activities  shall differ depending on the extent of the common or joint use of  assets and resources in the provision of both regulated and nonregulated  products and services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When a nonregulated activity does not involve the joint or  common use of assets and resources in the provision of both regulated  and nonregulated products and services, carriers shall account for these  activities on a separate set of books consistent with instructions set  forth in Sec. Sec. 32.1406 and 32.7990. Transfers of assets, and sales  of products and services between the regulated activity and a  nonregulated activity for which a separate set of books is maintained,  shall be accounted for in accordance with the rules presented in Sec.  32.27, Transactions with Affiliates. In the separate set of books,  carriers may establish whatever detail they deem appropriate beyond what  is necessary to provide this Commission with the information required in  Sec. Sec. 32.1406 and 32.7990.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When a nonregulated activity does involve the joint or common  use of assets and resources in the provision of regulated and  nonregulated products and services, carriers shall account for these  activities within accounts prescribed in this system for telephone  company operations. Assets and expenses shall be subdivided in  subsidiary records among amounts solely assignable to nonregulated  activities, amounts solely assignable to regulated activities, and  amounts related to assets and expenses incurred jointly or in common,  which will be allocated between regulated and nonregulated activities.  Carriers shall submit reports identifying regulated and nonregulated  amounts in the manner and at the times prescribed by this Commission.  Nonregulated revenue items not qualifying for incidental treatment as  provided in Sec. 32.4999(l) of this part, shall be recorded in separate  subsidiary record categories of Account 5280, Nonregulated operating  revenue. Amounts assigned or allocated to regulated products or services  shall be subject to part 36 of this chapter.
