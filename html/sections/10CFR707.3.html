This policy is advanced in this rule by requiring  contractors and subcontractors within its scope to adopt procedures  consistent with the baseline requirements of this part, and to impose  significant sanctions on individuals in testing designated positions or  with unescorted access to the control areas of certain DOE reactors, who  use or are involved with illegal drugs.</p>
