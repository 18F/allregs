                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determining Federal awards expended. The determination of when a  Federal award is expended must be based on when the activity related to  the Federal award occurs. Generally, the activity pertains to events  that require the non-Federal entity to comply with Federal statutes,  regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards, such as:  expenditure/expense transactions associated with awards including  grants, cost-reimbursement contracts under the FAR, compacts with Indian  Tribes, cooperative agreements, and direct appropriations; the  disbursement of funds to subrecipients; the use of loan proceeds under  loan and loan guarantee programs; the receipt of property; the receipt  of surplus property; the receipt or use of program income; the  distribution or use of food commodities; the disbursement of amounts  entitling the non-Federal entity to an interest subsidy; and the period  when insurance is in force.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Loan and loan guarantees (loans). Since the Federal Government  is at risk for loans until the debt is repaid, the following guidelines  must be used to calculate the value of Federal awards expended under  loan programs, except as noted in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this  section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Value of new loans made or received during the audit period;  plus</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Beginning of the audit period balance of loans from previous  years for which the Federal Government imposes continuing compliance  requirements; plus</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any interest subsidy, cash, or administrative cost allowance  received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Loan and loan guarantees (loans) at IHEs. When loans are made to  students of an IHE but the IHE does not make the loans, then only the  value of loans made during the audit period must be considered Federal  awards expended in that audit period. The balance of loans for previous  audit periods is not included as Federal awards expended because the  lender accounts for the prior balances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Prior loan and loan guarantees (loans). Loans, the proceeds of  which were received and expended in prior years, are not considered  Federal awards expended under this part when the Federal statutes,  regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards pertaining  to such loans impose no continuing compliance requirements other than to  repay the loans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Endowment funds. The cumulative balance of Federal awards for  endowment funds that are federally restricted are considered Federal  awards expended in each audit period in which the funds are still  restricted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Free rent. Free rent received by itself is not considered a  Federal award expended under this part. However, free rent received as  part of a Federal award to carry out a Federal program must be included  in determining Federal awards expended and subject to audit under this  part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Valuing non-cash assistance. Federal non-cash assistance, such  as free rent, food commodities, donated property, or donated surplus  property, must be valued at fair market value at the time of receipt or  the assessed value provided by the Federal agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Medicare. Medicare payments to a non-Federal entity for  providing patient care services to Medicare-eligible individuals are not  considered Federal awards expended under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Medicaid. Medicaid payments to a subrecipient for providing  patient care services to Medicaid-eligible individuals are not  considered Federal awards expended under this part unless a state  requires the funds to be treated as Federal awards expended because  reimbursement is on a cost-reimbursement basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Certain loans provided by the National Credit Union  Administration. For purposes of this part, loans made from the National  Credit Union Share Insurance Fund and the Central Liquidity Facility  that are funded by contributions from insured non-Federal entities are  not considered Federal awards expended.
