                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 1219.55, the initial rate of assessment shall be 2.5 cents per pound on fresh Hass avocados produced and handled in the United States and on fresh Hass avocados imported into the United States. An equivalent rate shall be assessed on processed and frozen Hass avocados on which an assessment has not been paid. Such equivalent rate will be assessed on processed or frozen Hass avocados upon the recommendation of the Board with the approval of the Secretary. The rate of assessment may be increased or decreased as recommended by the Board and approved by the Secretary. Such an increase or decrease may occur not more than once annually. Any change in the assessment rate

shall be announced by the Board at least 30 days prior to going into effect and shall not be subject to a vote in a referendum. The maximum assessment rate authorized is 5 cents per pound. No more than one assessment shall be made on any Hass avocados.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Domestic assessments. The collection of assessments on domestic Hass avocados will be the responsibility of the first handler.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of a producer acting as the producer's own first handler, the producer will be required to collect and remit the assessments due to the Board.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each first handler shall collect from the producer and pay to the Board an assessment of 2.5 cents per pound in accordance with this subpart. Assessments shall be remitted by each first handler to the Board or its agent within 30 days after the end of the month in which the sale or non-sale transfer subject to assessment under this subpart took place.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The first handler shall maintain a separate record of the domestic Hass avocados of each producer whose domestic Hass avocados are handled, including the domestic Hass avocados owned by the handler and domestic Hass avocados that are exported.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Assessment of other types of fresh avocados may be added at the recommendation of the Board with the approval of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Import assessments. Each importer of fresh Hass avocados shall pay an assessment to the Board through Customs on fresh Hass avocados imported for marketing in the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The assessment rate for imported fresh Hass avocados shall be the same or equivalent to the rate for fresh Hass avocados produced and handled in the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The import assessment shall be uniformly applied to imported fresh Hass avocados that are identified by the number 0804.40.00.10 in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States or any other numbers to identify fresh Hass avocados. Assessments on other types of imported fresh avocados or on processed Hass avocados, such as prepared, preserved, or frozen Hass avocados or Hass avocado paste, puree, and oil will be added at the recommendation of the Board with the approval of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The assessments due on imported Hass avocados shall be paid when they are released from custody by Customs and introduced into the stream of commerce in the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All assessment payments and reports will be submitted to the Board's office. All final payments for a crop year are to be received no later than November 30 of that year, unless the Board determines that assessments due from the first handler shall be paid to the Board at a different time and manner, with approval of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A late payment charge prescribed by the Secretary shall be imposed on any first handler who fails to remit to the Board the total amount for which any such handler is liable on or before the due date. In addition to the late payment charge, an interest charge shall be imposed on the outstanding amount for which the handler is liable. The rate of interest shall be prescribed by the Secretary. The timeliness of a payment to the Board shall be based on the date the payment is actually received by the Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Regulations issued by the Secretary may provide for different first handler payment schedules of assessments on domestic Hass avocados, so as to recognize differences in marketing or purchasing practices and procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Persons failing to remit total assessments due in a timely manner may also be subject to actions under federal debt collection procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The Board may authorize other organizations to collect assessments on its behalf with approval of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The collection of assessments shall commence on or after a date established by the Secretary and shall continue until terminated by the Secretary. If the Board is not constituted on the date the first assessments are to be remitted, the Secretary shall have the authority to receive assessments on behalf of the Board and may hold such assessments in an interest-bearing account until the Board is constituted and the funds are transferred to the Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> To facilitate the payment of assessments under this section, the Board shall publish lists of first handlers required to remit assessments under this subpart and exempt handlers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The Association shall receive an amount of assessment funds equal to 85 percent of the assessments paid on Hass avocados produced in such State. Such funds shall be remitted to such State organization no later than 30 days after such funds are received by the Board. In addition, such funds and any proceeds from the investment of such funds shall be used by the Association to finance promotion, research, consumer information, and industry information programs, plans, and projects in the United States. However, no such funds shall be used for any administrative expenses incurred by the Association.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> An association of Hass avocado importers established pursuant to Sec. 1219.58 shall receive an amount of assessment funds equal to 85 percent of the assessments paid on Hass avocados imported by its members. Such funds shall be remitted to such importer association no later than 30 days after such funds are received by the Board. In addition, such funds and any proceeds from the investment of such funds shall be used by the importer association to finance promotion, research, consumer information, and industry information programs, plans, and projects in the United States. However, no such funds shall be used for any administrative expenses incurred by the importer association.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> In general, assessment funds received by the Board shall be used:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For payment of costs incurred in implementing and administering this subpart;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To provide for a reasonable reserve to be maintained from assessments to be available for contingencies; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To cover the administrative costs incurred by the Secretary in implementing and administering this Act, as set forth in Sec. 1219.53(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> The Board may establish an operating monetary reserve which may carry over to subsequent fiscal periods: Provided that, the funds in the reserve do not exceed one fiscal period's budget.
