                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. An individual who is required to file an individual income tax return will be allowed an automatic 6-month extension of time to file the return after the date prescribed for filing the return if the individual files an application under this section in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. In the case of an individual described in Sec. 1.6081-5(a)(5) or (6), the automatic 6-month extension will run concurrently with the extension of time to file granted pursuant to Sec. 1.6081-5.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requirements. To satisfy this paragraph (b), an individual must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Submit a complete application on Form 4868, ``Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return,'' or in any other manner prescribed by the Commissioner;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> File the application on or before the later of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date prescribed for filing the return; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The expiration of any extension of time to file granted pursuant to Sec. 1.6081-5;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> File the application with the Internal Revenue Service office designated in the application's instructions; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Show the full amount properly estimated as tax for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No extension of time for the payment of tax.
