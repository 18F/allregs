                            <p class="depth0">Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Act, in subpart A of  this part, or in this section as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Administrator means the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency, or any official designee of the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0">Affected source means all HAP emission points within a facility that  are related to the production of BLR or WSR, including process vents,  storage tanks, wastewater systems, and equipment leaks.</p><p class="depth0">Basic liquid epoxy resins (BLR) means resins made by reacting  epichlorohydrin and bisphenol A to form diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A  (DGEBPA).</p><p class="depth0">Batch emission episode means a discrete venting episode that may be  associated with a single unit operation. For example, a displacement of  vapor resulting from the charging of a vessel with HAP will result in a  discrete emission episode that will last through the duration of the  charge and will have an average flow rate equal to the rate of the  charge. If the vessel is then heated, there will also be another  discrete emission episode resulting from the expulsion of expanded  vessel vapor space. Both emission episodes may occur in the same vessel  or unit operation. There are possibly other emission episodes that may  occur from the vessel or other process equipment, depending on process  operations.</p><p class="depth0">Batch process refers to a discontinuous process involving the bulk  movement of material through sequential manufacturing steps. Mass,  temperature, concentration, and other properties of a system vary with  time. Addition of raw material and withdrawal of product do not  typically occur simultaneously in a batch process.</p><p class="depth0">Closed-vent system means a system that is not open to the atmosphere  and is composed of piping, ductwork, connections, and, if necessary,  flow-inducing devices that transport gas or vapor from an emission point  to a control device or back into the process.</p><p class="depth0">Continuous process means a process where the inputs and outputs flow  continuously throughout the duration of the process. Continuous  processes are typically steady-state.</p><p class="depth0">Drain system means the system used to convey wastewater streams from  a process unit, product storage tank, or feed storage tank to a waste  management unit. The term includes all process drains and junction  boxes, together with their associated sewer lines and other junction  boxes, manholes, sumps, and lift stations, down to the receiving waste  management unit. A segregated stormwater sewer system, which is a drain  and collection system designed and operated for the sole purpose of  collecting rainfall-runoff at a facility, and which is segregated from  all other drain systems, is excluded from this definition.</p><p class="depth0">Equipment leaks means emissions of hazardous air pollutants from a  connector, pump, compressor, agitator, pressure relief device, sampling  connection system, open-ended valve or line, or instrumentation system  in organic hazardous air pollutant service.</p><p class="depth0">Process vent means a point of emission from a unit operation.  Typical process vents include condenser vents, vacuum pumps, steam  ejectors, and atmospheric vents from reactors and other process vessels.</p><p class="depth0">Production-based emission rate means a ratio of the amount of HAP  emitted to the amount of BLR or WSR produced.</p><p class="depth0">Research and development facility means laboratory operations whose  primary purpose is to conduct research and development into new  processes and products, where the operations are under the close  supervision of technically trained personnel, and is not engaged in the  manufacture of products for commercial sale, except in a de minimis  manner.</p><p class="depth0">Storage tank means a tank or other vessel that is used to store  liquids that contain one or more HAP compounds.</p><p class="depth0">Unit operation means those processing steps that occur within  distinct equipment that are used, among other things, to prepare  reactants, facilitate reactions, separate and purify products, and  recycle materials. There may be several emission episodes within a  single unit operation.</p><p class="depth0">Waste management unit means any component, piece of equipment,  structure, or transport mechanism used in   storing, treating, or disposing of wastewater streams, or conveying  wastewater between storage, treatment, or disposal operations.</p><p class="depth0">Wastewater means aqueous liquid waste streams exiting equipment at  an affected source.</p><p class="depth0">Wastewater system means a system made up of a drain system and one  or more waste management units.</p><p class="depth0">Wet strength resins (WSR) means polyamide/ epichlorohydrin  condensates which are used to increase the tensile strength of paper  products.
