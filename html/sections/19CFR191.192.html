Certification requirements shall take into account the size and nature of the party's drawback program, the type of drawback claims filed, and the volume of claims filed. Whether the party is a drawback claimant, a broker, or one that provides data and documentation on which a drawback claim is based, will also be considered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Core requirements of program. In order to be certified as a participant in the drawback compliance program or negotiated alternative drawback compliance program, the party must be able to demonstrate that it:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Understands the legal requirements for filing claims, including the nature of the records that are required to be maintained and produced and the time periods involved;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Has in place procedures that explain the Customs requirements to those employees involved in the preparation of claims, and the maintenance and production of required records;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Has in place procedures regarding the preparation of claims and maintenance of required records, and the production of such records to Customs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Has designated a dependable individual or individuals who will be responsible for compliance under the program, and maintenance and production of required records;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Has in place a record maintenance program approved by Customs regarding original records, or if approved by Customs, alternative records or recordkeeping formats for other than the original records; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Has procedures for notifying Customs of variances in, or violations of, the drawback compliance or other alternative negotiated drawback compliance program, and for taking corrective action when notified by Customs of violations and problems regarding such program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Broker certification.
