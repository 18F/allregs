Sec. 4.13, 4.14, and 4.15).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> This subpart also sets forth predisclosure notice procedures that the OCC follows, in accordance with Executive Order 12600 (3 CFR, 1987 Comp., p. 235), when the OCC receives a request under Sec. 4.15 for disclosure of records that arguably are exempt from disclosure as confidential commercial information (Sec. 4.16). Finally, this subpart describes the fees that the OCC assesses for the services it renders in providing information under the FOIA (Sec. 4.17).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> This subpart does not apply to a request for records pursuant to the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a). A person requesting records from the OCC pursuant to the Privacy Act should refer to 31 CFR part 1, subpart C, and appendix J of subpart C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> This subpart does not apply to FOIA requests filed with the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) before July 21, 2011. These requests are subject to the rules of the OTS in effect on July 20, 2011.
