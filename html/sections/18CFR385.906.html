Rule 715 (interlocutory appeals to the Commission from rulings of presiding officers) contesting denial, in whole or in part, of that person's motion to intervene.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A person filing a motion to intervene, may request therein the permission of the presiding officer to raise new facts or issues not raised in the prior proceedings on the contested order, if the new facts or issues meet the criteria set forth in Rule 903(c) (request for nondisclosure of information).
