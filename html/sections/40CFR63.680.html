Distillation means a process, either batch or continuous, separating one or more off-site material feed streams into two or more exit streams having different component concentrations from those in the feed stream or streams. The separation is achieved by the redistribution of the components between the liquid and vapor phases as they approach equilibrium within the distillation unit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Fractionation process used for the treatment, recycling, or recovery of off-site material. Fractionation means a liquid mixture separation process or method used to separate a mixture of several volatile components of different boiling points in successive stages, each stage removing from the mixture some proportion of one of the components.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Thin-film evaporation process used for the treatment, recycling, or recovery of off-site material. Thin-film evaporation means a liquid mixture separation process or method that uses a heating surface consisting of a large diameter tube that may be either straight or tapered, horizontal or vertical. Liquid is spread on the tube wall by a rotating assembly of blades that maintain a close clearance from the wall or actually ride on the film of liquid on the wall.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Solvent extraction process used for the treatment, recycling, or recovery of off-site material. Solvent extraction means a separation process or method in which a solid or a solution is contacted with a liquid solvent (the material and the solvent being relatively insoluble in each other) to preferentially dissolve and transfer one or more components into the solvent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Steam stripping process used for the treatment, recycling, or recovery of off-site material. Steam stripping means a liquid mixture separation process or method in which vaporization of the volatile components of a liquid mixture occurs by the introduction of steam directly into the process.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Gas stripping process used for the treatment, recycling, or recovery of off-site material. Gas stripping means a desorption process or method used to transfer one or more volatile components from a liquid mixture into a gas stream either with or without the application of heat to the liquid. Packed towers, spray towers, and bubble-cap, sieve, or valve-type plate towers are examples of the process configurations used for contacting the gas and a liquid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Equipment leaks. For each operation specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(vi) of this section that is located at the plant site, the affected source is the entire group of equipment components for which each component meets all of the conditions specified in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (c)(3)(iii) of this section. If any one of these conditions do not apply to an equipment component, then that component is not part of the affected source for equipment leaks.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The equipment component is a pump, compressor, agitator, pressure

relief device, sampling connection system, open-ended valve or line, valve, connector, or instrumentation system;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The equipment component contains or contacts off-site material having a total HAP concentration equal to or greater than 10 percent by weight; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The equipment component is intended to operate for 300 hours or more during a calendar year in off-site material service, as defined in Sec.  63.681 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Facility-wide exemption. The owner or operator of affected sources subject to this subpart is exempted from the requirements of Sec. Sec.  63.682 through 63.699 of this subpart in situations when the total annual quantity of the HAP that is contained in the off-site material received at the plant site is less than 1 megagram per year. For a plant site to be exempted under the provisions of this paragraph (d), the owner or operator must meet the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator must prepare an initial determination of the total annual HAP quantity in the off-site material received at the plant site. This determination is based on the total quantity of the HAP listed in Table 1 of this subpart as determined at the point-of-delivery for each off-site material stream.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator must prepare a new determination whenever the extent of changes to the quantity or composition of the off-site material received at the plant site could cause the total annual HAP quantity in the off-site material received at the plant site to exceed the limit of 1 megagram per year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator must maintain documentation to support the owner's or operator's determination of the total annual HAP quantity in the off-site material received at the plant site.
