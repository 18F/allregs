                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Each Institution shall:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Maintain an up-to-date, written, enforced policy on financial  conflicts of interest that complies with this subpart, and make such  policy available via a publicly accessible Web site. If the Institution  does not have any current presence on a publicly accessible Web site  (and only in those cases), the Institution shall make its written policy  available to any requestor within five business days of a request. If,  however, the Institution acquires a presence on a publicly accessible  Web site during the time of the PHS award, the requirement to post the  information on that Web site will apply within 30 calendar days. If an  Institution maintains a policy on financial conflicts of interest that  includes standards that are more stringent than this subpart (e.g., that  require a more extensive disclosure of financial interests), the  Institution shall adhere to its policy and shall provide FCOI reports  regarding identified financial conflicts of interest to the PHS Awarding  Component in accordance with the Institution's own standards and within  the timeframe prescribed by this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Inform each Investigator of the Institution's policy on  financial conflicts of interest, the Investigator's responsibilities  regarding disclosure of significant financial interests, and of these  regulations, and require each Investigator to complete training  regarding the same prior to engaging in research related to any PHS- funded grant and at least every four years, and immediately when any of  the following circumstances apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Institution revises its financial conflict of interest  policies or procedures in any manner that affects the requirements of  Investigators;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An Investigator is new to an Institution; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An Institution finds that an Investigator is not in compliance  with the Institution's financial conflict of interest policy or  management plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the Institution carries out the PHS-funded research through a  subrecipient (e.g., subcontractors or consortium members), the  Institution (awardee Institution) must take reasonable steps to ensure  that any subrecipient Investigator complies with this subpart by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Incorporating as part of a written agreement with the  subrecipient terms that establish whether the financial conflicts of  interest policy of the awardee Institution or that of the subrecipient  will apply to the subrecipient's Investigators.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the subrecipient's Investigators must comply with the  subrecipient's financial conflicts of interest policy, the subrecipient  shall certify as part of the agreement referenced above that its policy  complies with this subpart. If the subrecipient cannot provide such  certification, the agreement shall state that subrecipient Investigators  are subject to the financial conflicts of interest policy of the awardee  Institution for disclosing significant financial interests that are  directly related to the subrecipient's work for the awardee Institution;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Additionally, if the subrecipient's Investigators must comply  with the subrecipient's financial conflicts of interest policy, the  agreement referenced above shall specify time period(s) for the  subrecipient to report all identified financial conflicts of interest to  the awardee Institution. Such time period(s) shall be sufficient to  enable the awardee Institution to provide timely FCOI reports, as  necessary, to the PHS as required by this subpart;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Alternatively, if the subrecipient's Investigators must comply  with the awardee Institution's financial conflicts of interest policy,  the agreement referenced above shall specify time period(s) for the  subrecipient to submit all Investigator disclosures of significant  financial interests to the awardee Institution. Such time period(s)  shall be sufficient to enable the awardee Institution to comply timely  with its review, management, and reporting obligations under this  subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Providing FCOI reports to the PHS Awarding Component regarding  all financial conflicts of interest of all subrecipient Investigators  consistent with this subpart, i.e., prior to the expenditure of funds  and within 60 days of any subsequently identified FCOI.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Designate an institutional official(s) to solicit and review  disclosures of significant financial interests from each Investigator  who is planning to participate in, or is participating in, the PHS- funded research.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Require that each Investigator who is planning to participate  in the PHS-funded research disclose to the Institution's designated  official(s) the Investigator's significant financial interests (and  those of the Investigator's spouse and dependent children) no later than  the time of application for PHS-funded research.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Require each Investigator who is participating in the PHS-funded  research to submit an updated disclosure of significant financial  interests at least annually, in accordance with the specific time period  prescribed by the Institution, during the period of the award. Such  disclosure shall include any information that was not disclosed  initially to the Institution pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this  section, or in a subsequent disclosure of significant financial  interests (e.g., any financial conflict of interest identified on a PHS- funded project that was transferred from another Institution), and shall  include updated information regarding any previously disclosed  significant financial interest (e.g., the updated value of a previously  disclosed equity interest).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Require each Investigator who is participating in the PHS-funded  research to submit an updated disclosure of significant financial  interests within thirty days of discovering or acquiring (e.g., through  purchase, marriage, or inheritance) a new significant financial  interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Provide guidelines consistent with this subpart for the  designated institutional official(s) to determine whether an  Investigator's significant financial interest is related to PHS-funded  research and, if so related, whether the significant financial interest  is a financial conflict of interest. An Investigator's significant  financial interest is related to PHS-funded research when the  Institution, through its designated official(s), reasonably determines  that   the significant financial interest: could be affected by the PHS-funded  research; or is in an entity whose financial interest could be affected  by the research. The Institution may involve the Investigator in the  designated official(s)'s determination of whether a significant  financial interest is related to the PHS-funded research. A financial  conflict of interest exists when the Institution, through its designated  official(s), reasonably determines that the significant financial  interest could directly and significantly affect the design, conduct, or  reporting of the PHS-funded research.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Take such actions as necessary to manage financial conflicts of  interest, including any financial conflicts of a subrecipient  Investigator pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. Management of an  identified financial conflict of interest requires development and  implementation of a management plan and, if necessary, a retrospective  review and a mitigation report pursuant to Sec.  50.605(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Provide initial and ongoing FCOI reports to the PHS as required  pursuant to Sec.  50.605(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Maintain records relating to all Investigator disclosures of  financial interests and the Institution's review of, and response to,  such disclosures (whether or not a disclosure resulted in the  Institution's determination of a financial conflict of interest) and all  actions under the Institution's policy or retrospective review, if  applicable, for at least three years from the date the final  expenditures report is submitted to the PHS or, where applicable, from  other dates specified in 45 CFR 74.53(b) and 92.42 (b) for different  situations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Establish adequate enforcement mechanisms and provide for  employee sanctions or other administrative actions to ensure  Investigator compliance as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Certify, in each application for funding to which this subpart  applies, that the Institution:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Has in effect at that Institution an up-to-date, written, and  enforced administrative process to identify and manage financial  conflicts of interest with respect to all research projects for which  funding is sought or received from the PHS;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Shall promote and enforce Investigator compliance with this  subpart's requirements including those pertaining to disclosure of  significant financial interests;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Shall manage financial conflicts of interest and provide initial  and ongoing FCOI reports to the PHS Awarding Component consistent with  this subpart;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Agrees to make information available, promptly upon request, to  the HHS relating to any Investigator disclosure of financial interests  and the Institution's review of, and response to, such disclosure,  whether or not the disclosure resulted in the Institution's  determination of a financial conflict of interest; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Shall fully comply with the requirements of this subpart.</p>
