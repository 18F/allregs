                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions and procedures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The complete and unrestricted  ownership of all the rights to the full use and enjoyment of a parcel of  real estate is called the ``fee simple estate.'' An appraisal of this  interest is referred to as ``Fee Value.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Most fee appraisals require the use of all three of the standard  appraisal approaches.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applicability. Appraisals of the fair market value of the free  and clear fee title to the subject property is necessary in the greatest  majority of the Corps of Engineers' real estate responsibilities be it  acquisition (full or partial), disposal, inleasing, outleasing, rentals,  etc. In almost every case the monetary value of the required estate and  interest is based on the fee value of the property; therefore, the  Corps' greatest appraisal requirement is for fee appraisals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Approaches. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is recommended that whenever possible all  three of the standard appraisal approaches, Cost-Market-Income, be used  in a fee appraisal. However, if due to the type of property, is is not  practical, beneficial, or necessary to use a particular approach, the  appraiser is required to indicate in his report that consideration was  given to its use and discuss why it was not used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the Cost Approach it is extremely important that the  appraiser document all items of costs for development, construction,  utilities, etc. It also is extremely important that he fully consider  all forms of depreciation such as physical deterioration, functional  obsolescence, economic obsolescence, etc., and justify his methods and  factors used in developing his depreciation factors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Market Approach or Comparative method of appraisal is the  most direct approach to a market value estimate and is preferred above  all others. It is basically an application of the principle of  substitution wherein the sales of similar type properties are analyzed  to develop a price at which an equally desirable and similar property  can be obtained. It involves the collection and analyzing of current  sales of comparable properties and comparing these sales to the subject  property. Since no two properties are identical, the appraiser must make  adjustments for differences between the two. Adjustments may be by a  dollar amount (per unit, per acre, or lump sum) or on a percentage  basis. Full support and justification must be given for each amount.  Adjustments may be shown either by a tabular analysis or by a narrative  discussion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The market value of an income-producing property is quite often  governed by the net income it will produce. The fair market value may be  estimated by developing the expected net income and processing it into a  value estimate by use of an appropriate capitalization rate. The keynote  of this approach lies in the sound development of a proper rate. The  appraiser must have a basic knowledge of the principle and techniques  involved and must be certain that he has adequate data to develop this  rate and properly process the income into a fair market value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> It is most important that the valuation estimates developed by  all of the approaches used are correlated into one conclusive value. In  those cases where there is a substantial spread among values, the  appraiser is cautioned to recheck all his data and figures for accuracy.  The cost figures and   depreciation factors should be checked in the Cost Approach; the sales  data should be further documented and analyzed in the Market Approach;  and the Income Method may require a recheck of the soundness of the  capitalization rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Partial takings. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A substantial number of acquisitions  require only portions of an ownership necessitating a ``partial  taking.'' In these cases the appraiser is required to estimate the value  of the whole ownership before the taking; the value of the remainder-- the difference being the value of the part taken. Many times the  remainder is of less value after the taking, indicating a ``severance  damage.'' The appraiser is usually required to allocate the total taking  value between the value of the part acquired and the severance damage to  the remainder by reason of the taking.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In order to promote uniformity in the reporting format, the  following example of the ``before'' and ``after'' method is presented  for guidance:  A 220-acre parcel of land is to be acquired from a 420-acre</p><p class="depth3">farm: Value ``before'' the taking ($300 p/ac).....................    $126,000 Value of remainder ``after'' taking ($200 p/ac).............      40,000</p><p class="depth3">----------- Total Value of part taken, including severance damage to         $86,000</p><p class="depth3">remainder.................................................. Value of 220 acres taken ($300 p/ac)........................      66,000</p><p class="depth3">----------- Severance Damage to Remainder...............................     $20,000</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The appraisal of the property before the taking must be a  complete narrative-type appraisal containing adequate market data to  support the total value. The report then must also include a full  appraisal on the remainder portion of the property consisting of a full  description of the residue immediately after the taking and a complete  set of market data and sales other than those used in the ``before''  evaluation. If the remainder parcel has diminished in value as a result  of the taking, the appraiser must have adequate support and  justification for the reduction in value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In the case of partial takings, consideration must also be given  to offsetting benefits applicable to the remaining property. A  combination of legal interpretation of the law and judicial decisions  with regard to such benefits must be used in determining whether  offsetting benefits are applicable. Reference is made to paragraph A-9  and A-10 in the ``Uniform Appraisal Standards For Federal Land  Acquisitions.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Paragraph A-13 of the ``Uniform Appraisal Standards'' is also  referenced in connection with guidance regarding ``navigation  servitude.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Appraisal Certificate. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No appraisal report will be  considered acceptable without appropriate certification by the appraiser  responsible for the contents of the report and the conclusion of values.  The certification can be in the front or the back of the report,  consistent with Division or District policy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An appropriate certification shall be substantially in  accordance with the following: I certify that I have carefully examined  the property described herein and that the estimates as developed in the  report represent my unbiased opinion and judgment. I further certify  that I have no interest, past, present or prospective, in the subject  property which would affect my opinion and that the present fair market  value of the (insert estate appraisal) is subject only to all the  assumptions and limitations as specifically set forth. (Date and  signature of appraiser.)</p>
