                            <p class="depth0">These procedures only apply to participating states. An authorized employer may obtain a State and national criminal history record check as authorized by section 6402 of Public Law 105-458 as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An authorized employer is required to execute a certification to the State, developed by the SIB or the relevant state agency for purposes of accepting requests for these background checks, declaring that it is an authorized employer that employs private security officers; that all fingerprints and requests for criminal history background checks are being submitted for private security officers; that it will use the information obtained as a result of the state and national criminal history record checks solely for the purpose of screening its private security officers; and that it will abide by other regulatory obligations. To help ensure that only legitimate use is made of this authority, the certification shall be executed under penalties of perjury, false statement, or other applicable state laws.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An authorized employer must obtain a set of fingerprints and the written consent of its employee to submit those prints for a state and national criminal history record check. An authorized employer must submit the fingerprints and appropriate state and federal fees to the SIB in the manner specified by the SIB.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon receipt of an employee's fingerprints, the SIB shall perform a fingerprint-based search of its criminal records. If no relevant criminal record is found, the SIB shall submit the fingerprints to the FBI for a national search.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Upon the conclusion of the national search, the FBI will disseminate the results to the SIB.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Based upon the results of the state check and, if necessary, the national check:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the State has standards for qualifying a private security officer, the SIB or other designated state agency shall apply those standards to the CHRI and notify the authorized employer of the results of the application of the state standards; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the State does not have standards for qualifying a private security officer, the SIB or other designated state agency shall notify an authorized employer as to the fact of whether an applicant has been:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Convicted of a felony;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Convicted of a lesser offense involving dishonesty or false statement if occurring within the previous ten years;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Convicted of a lesser offense involving the use or attempted use of physical force against the person of another if occurring within the previous ten years; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Charged with a felony during the previous 365 days for which there has been no resolution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The limitation periods set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be determined using the date the employee's fingerprints were submitted. An employee shall be considered charged with a criminal felony for which there has been no resolution during the preceding 365 days if the individual is the subject of a complaint, indictment, or information, issued within 365 days of the date that the fingerprints were taken, for a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year. The effect of various forms of post-conviction relief shall be determined by the law of the convicting jurisdiction.</p>
