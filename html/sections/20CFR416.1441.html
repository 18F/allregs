                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. After a hearing is requested but before it is held, we may, for the purposes of a prehearing case review, forward the case to the component of our office (including a State agency) that issued the determination being reviewed. That component will decide whether it should revise the determination based on the preponderance of the evidence. A revised determination may be fully or partially favorable to you. A prehearing case review will not delay the scheduling of a hearing unless you agree to continue the review and delay the hearing. If the prehearing case review is not completed before the date of the hearing, the case will be sent to the administrative law judge unless a favorable revised determination is in process or you and the other parties to the hearing agree in writing to delay the hearing until the review is completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When a prehearing case review may be conducted. We may conduct a prehearing case review if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Additional evidence is submitted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There is an indication that additional evidence is available;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> There is a change in the law or regulation; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> There is an error in the file or some other indication that the prior determination may be revised.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice of a prehearing revised determination. If we revise the determination in a prehearing case review, we will mail a written notice of the revised determination to all parties at their last known addresses. We will state the basis for the revised determination and advise all parties of the effect of the revised determination on the request for a hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effect of a fully favorable revised determination. If the revised determination is fully favorable to you, we will tell you in the notice that an administrative law judge will dismiss the request for a hearing. We will also tell you that you or another party to the hearing may request that the administrative law judge vacate the dismissal and reinstate the request for a hearing if you or another party to the hearing disagrees with the revised determination for any reason. If you wish to make this request, you must do so in writing and send it to us within 60 days of the date you receive notice of the dismissal. If the request is timely, an administrative law judge will vacate the dismissal, reinstate the request for a hearing, and offer you and all parties an opportunity for a hearing. The administrative law judge will extend the time limit if you show that you had good cause for missing the deadline. The administrative law judge will use the standards in Sec. 416.1411 to determine whether you had good cause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effect of a partially favorable revised determination. If the revised determination is partially favorable to you, we will tell you in the notice what was not favorable. We will also tell you that an administrative law judge will hold the hearing you requested unless you and all other parties to the hearing agree in writing to dismiss the request for a hearing. An administrative law judge will dismiss the request for a hearing if we receive the written statement(s) agreeing to dismiss the request for a hearing before an administrative law judge mails a notice of his or her hearing decision.
