                            <p class="depth0">Also see Sec. 622.9 for additional prohibited gear and methods that apply more broadly to multiple fisheries or in some cases all fisheries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Poisons. A poison may not be used to fish for South Atlantic snapper-grouper in the South Atlantic EEZ.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Rebreathers and spearfishing gear. In the South Atlantic EEZ, a person using a rebreather may not harvest South Atlantic snapper-grouper with spearfishing gear. The possession of such snapper-grouper while in the water with a rebreather is prima facie evidence that such fish was harvested with spearfishing gear while using a rebreather.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Longlines for wreckfish. A bottom longline may not be used to fish for wreckfish in the South Atlantic EEZ. A person aboard a vessel that has a longline on board may not retain a wreckfish in or from the South Atlantic EEZ. For the purposes of this paragraph, a vessel is considered to have a longline on board when a power-operated longline hauler, a cable of diameter suitable for use in the longline fishery longer than 1.5 mi (2.4 km) on any reel, and gangions are on board. Removal of any one of these three elements constitutes removal of a longline.</p>
