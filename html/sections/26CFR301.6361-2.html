                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Civil proceedings--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Any person shall have the  same right to bring or contest a civil action, and to obtain a review  thereof, with respect to a qualified tax (including the current  collection thereof) in the same court or courts which would be available  to him, and pursuant to the same requirements and procedures to which he  would be subject, under chapter 76 (relating to judicial proceedings),  and under title 28 of the United States Code (relating to the judiciary  and judicial procedure), if the tax were imposed by section 1 or chapter  24 of the Internal Revenue Code. For purposes of this section, the term  ``person'' includes the Federal Government. Except as provided in  subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (a), to the extent that the preceding  sentence provides judicial procedures (including review procedures) with  respect to any matter, such procedures shall replace civil judicial  procedures under State law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exception. The right or power of the courts of any State to pass  on matters involving the constitution of such State is unaffected by any  provision of this paragraph; however, the jurisdiction of a State court  in such matters shall not extend beyond the issue of constitutionality.  Thus, if in a case involving the validity of a qualified tax statute  under the State constitution, the State court holds such statute  constitutional, such court shall not proceed to decide the amount of the  tax liability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Criminal proceedings. Only the Federal Government shall have the  right to bring a criminal action with respect to a qualified tax  (including the current collection thereof). Such an action shall be  brought in the same court or courts which would be available to the  Federal Government, and pursuant to the same requirements and procedures  to which the Federal Government would be subject, if the tax were  imposed by section 1 or chapter 24 of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Administrative proceedings. Any person shall have the same  rights in administrative proceedings of the Internal Revenue Service  with respect to a qualified tax (including the current collection  thereof) which would be available to him, and shall be subject to the  same administrative requirements and procedures to which he would be  subject, if the tax were imposed by section 1 or chapter 24 of the  Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> United States representation of State interests--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General  rule. Except as provided in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph  (d), the Federal Government shall appear on behalf of any State the  qualified tax of which it collects (or did collect for the year in  issue), and shall represent such State's interests in any administrative  or judicial proceeding, either civil or criminal in nature, which  relates to the administration and collection of such qualified tax, in  the same manner as it represents the interests of the United States in  corresponding proceedings involving Federal income tax matters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions. The Federal Government shall not so represent a  State's interests either--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In proceedings in a State court involving the constitution of  such State, to the extent of such constitutional issue, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In proceedings in any court involving the relationship between  the United States and the State, to the extent of the issue pertaining  to such relationship, if either:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The proceeding is one which is initiated by the United States  against the State, or by the State against the United States, and no  individual (except in his official capacity as a governmental official)  is an original party to the proceeding, or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The proceeding is not one described in (A), but the State elects  to represent its own interests to the extent permissible under this  subdivision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Finality of Federal administrative determinations. State and  local government officials and employees may not review Federal  administrative determinations concerning tax liabilities of, refunds  owed to, or criminal prosecutions of, individuals with respect to  qualified taxes. See, however, Sec. 301.6363-3 relating to State  administration of a qualified tax with respect to transition years. If  requested by an electing State, the Commissioner or his delegate may,  under terms and conditions set forth in an agreement with such State,  permit such State to carry on operations supplementary to the Federal  administration of the State's qualified tax (including supplemental  audits or examinations of tax returns by State audit personnel), but all  administrative determinations shall be made by the Federal Government  without review by the State. An agreement which permits supplemental  audits or examinations of tax returns by State audit personnel shall  provide that the audits and examinations shall be conducted under the  supervision and control of the Commissioner or his delegate, who shall  have the authority to determine which returns shall be audited and when  the audits shall occur. Also, such agreements shall provide that the  results of any such supplemental audit shall be referred to the  Commissioner or his delegate for final administrative determination. The  Commissioner or his delegate shall, to the extent permitted by law,  allow an   electing State reasonable access to tax returns and other appropriate  records and information relating to its qualified tax for the purpose of  conducting any such supplemental operations. In addition, the Secretary  or his delegate shall permit an electing State to inspect the workpapers  which are compiled in the course of verification by the Treasury  Department of the correctness of the accounting by which the amounts of  the actual net collections attributable to the electing State's  qualified taxes are determined.
