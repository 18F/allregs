                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Specific powers of attorney. Any check may be negotiated under a  specific power of attorney executed in accordance with applicable State  or Federal law after the issuance of the check and describing the check  in full (check serial and symbol numbers, date of issue, amount, and  name of payee).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General powers of attorney. Checks may be negotiated under a  general power of attorney executed, in accordance with applicable State  or Federal law, in favor of a person for the following classes of  payments:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Payments for the redemption of currencies or for principal and/ or interest on U.S. securities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Payments for tax refunds, but subject to the limitations  concerning the mailing of Internal Revenue refund checks contained in 26  CFR 601.506(c); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Payments for goods and services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special powers of attorney. Checks issued for classes of  payments other than those specified in paragraph (b) of this section,  such as a recurring benefit payment, may be negotiated under a special  power of attorney executed in accordance with applicable State or  Federal law, which describes the purpose for which the checks are  issued, names a person as attorney-in-fact, and recites that the special  power of attorney is not given to carry into effect an assignment of the  right to receive such payment, either to the attorney-in-fact or to any  other person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Durable special powers of attorney. A durable special power of  attorney is a special power of attorney that continues despite the  principal's later incompetency, and is created by the principal's use of  words explicitly stating such intent. Classes of checks other than those  specified in paragraph (b) of this section may be negotiated under a  durable special power of attorney executed in accordance with applicable  State or Federal law, which describes the purpose for which the checks  are issued, names a person as attorney-in-fact, and recites that the  special power of attorney is not given to carry into effect an  assignment of the right to receive such payment, either to the attorney- in-fact or to any other person. For the purpose of negotiating Treasury  checks, durable special powers of attorney are effective only during the  six-month period following a determination that the named payee is  incompetent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Springing durable special powers of attorney. A springing  durable special power of attorney is similar to a durable power of  attorney except that its terms do not become effective until the  principal's subsequent incompetence. As with a durable special power of  attorney, a springing durable special power of attorney is created by  the principal's use of language explicitly stating that its terms become  effective at such time as the principal is determined to be incompetent.  Classes of checks other than those specified in paragraph (b) of this  section may be negotiated under a springing durable special power of  attorney executed in accordance with applicable State or Federal law,  which describes the purpose for which the checks are issued, names a  person as attorney-in-fact, and recites that the springing durable  special power of attorney is not given to carry into effect an  assignment of the right to receive payment, either to the attorney-in- fact or to any other person. For the purpose of negotiating Treasury  checks, springing durable special powers of attorney are effective only  during the six-month period following a determination that the named  payee is incompetent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Proof of authority. Checks indorsed by an attorney-in-fact must  include, as part of the indorsement, an indication of the capacity in  which the attorney-in-fact is indorsing. An example would be: ``John  Jones by Paul Smith, attorney-in-fact for John Jones.'' Such checks when  presented for payment by a financial institution, will be paid by  Treasury without the submission of documentary proof of the claimed  authority, with the understanding that evidence of such claimed  authority to indorse may be required by Treasury in the event of a  dispute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Revocation of powers of attorney. Notwithstanding any other law,  for purposes of negotiating Treasury checks, all powers of attorney are  deemed revoked by the death of the principal and may also be deemed  revoked by notice from the principal to the parties known, or reasonably  expected, to be acting on the power of attorney.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Optional use forms. Optional use power of attorney forms are  listed in the appendix to this part. These forms are available on the  Fiscal Service website at: http://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/ checkclaims/  regulations.html.</p>
