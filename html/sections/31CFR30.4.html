To comply with the standards established under sections 111(b)(3)(A), 111(b)(3)(E), 111(b)(3)(F) and 111(c) of EESA, a TARP recipient must establish a compensation committee by the later of ninety days after the closing date of the agreement between the TARP recipient and Treasury or September 14, 2009, and maintain a compensation committee during the remainder of the TARP period. If a compensation committee is already established before the later of the closing date or September 14, 2009, the TARP recipient must maintain its compensation committee.
