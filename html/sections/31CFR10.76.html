                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Hearings. Within 180 days after the conclusion  of a hearing and the receipt of any proposed findings and conclusions  timely submitted by the parties, the Administrative Law Judge should  enter a decision in the case. The decision must include a statement of  findings and conclusions, as well as the reasons or basis for making  such findings and conclusions, and an order of censure, suspension,  disbarment, monetary penalty, disqualification, or dismissal of the  complaint.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Summary adjudication. In the event that a motion for summary  adjudication is filed, the Administrative Law Judge should rule on the  motion for summary adjudication within 60 days after the party in  opposition files a written response, or if no written response is filed,  within 90 days after the motion for summary adjudication is filed. A  decision shall thereafter be rendered if the pleadings, depositions,  admissions, and any other admissible evidence show that there is no  genuine issue of material fact and that a decision may be rendered as a  matter of law. The decision must include a statement of conclusions, as  well as the reasons or basis for making such conclusions, and an order  of censure, suspension, disbarment, monetary penalty, disqualification,  or dismissal of the complaint.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Returns and return information. In the decision, the  Administrative Law Judge should use the code assigned to third party  taxpayers (described in Sec. 10.72(d)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Standard of proof. If the sanction is censure or a suspension of  less than six months' duration, the Administrative Law Judge, in  rendering findings and conclusions, will consider an allegation of fact  to be proven if it is established by the party who is alleging the fact  by a preponderance of the evidence in the record. If the sanction is a  monetary penalty, disbarment or a suspension of six months or longer  duration, an allegation of fact that is necessary for a finding against  the practitioner must be proven by clear and convincing evidence in the  record. An allegation of fact that is necessary for a finding of  disqualification against an appraiser must be proven by clear and  convincing evidence in the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Copy of decision. The Administrative Law Judge will provide the  decision to the Internal Revenue Service's authorized representative,  and a copy of the decision to the respondent or the respondent's  authorized representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When final. In the absence of an appeal to the Secretary of the  Treasury or delegate, the decision of the Administrative Law Judge will,  without further proceedings, become the decision of the agency 30 days  after the date of the Administrative Law Judge's decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section is applicable  beginning August 2, 2011.  [T.D. 9359, 72 FR 54554, Sept. 26, 2007, as amended by T.D. 9527, 76 FR  32310, June 3, 2011]</p>
