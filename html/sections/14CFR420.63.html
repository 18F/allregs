                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as otherwise provided by paragraph (b) of this section, a licensee must ensure the configuration of the launch site follows its explosive site plan, and the licensee's explosive site plan complies with the requirements of Sec. Sec. 420.65 through 420.70. The explosive site plan must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A scaled map that shows the location of all explosive hazard facilities at the launch site and that shows actual and minimal allowable distances between each explosive hazard facility and all other explosive hazard facilities, each public traffic route, and each public area, including the launch site boundary;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A list of the maximum quantity of energetic liquids, solid propellants and other explosives to be located at each explosive hazard facility, including explosive class and division;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of each activity to be conducted at each explosive hazard facility; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An explosive site map using a scale sufficient to show whether distances and structural relationships satisfy the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A licensee operating a launch site located on a federal launch range does not have to comply with the requirements in Sec. Sec. 420.65 through 420.70 if the licensee complies with the federal launch range's explosive safety requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For explosive siting issues not addressed by the requirements of Sec. Sec. 420.65 through 420.70, a launch site operator must clearly and convincingly demonstrate a level of safety equivalent to that otherwise required by this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A launch site operator may separate an explosive hazard facility from another explosive hazard facility, public area, or public traffic route by a distance different from one required by this part only if the launch site operator clearly and convincingly demonstrates a level of safety equivalent to that required by this part.
