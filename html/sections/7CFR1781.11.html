                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Technical assistance. When pipelines from reservoirs to  treatment plants are included in watershed work   plans, NRCS will not furnish engineering services for their design or  installation. When such pipelines are to be financed by WS or RCD loans,  RUS will supervise the activities of the private engineers retained for  the purpose. Such RUS supervision will include, among other things,  approval of private engineer's contracts, approval of plans and  specifications, authorization of contract awards, spot checks of  engineering inspection, and final inspection and acceptance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Professional services. Applicants will be responsible for  providing the services necessary to plan projects including design of  facilities, preparation of cost and income estimates, development of  proposals for organization and financing, and overall operation and  maintenance of the facility. Necessary professional services may include  such as that of an engineer, architect, attorney, bond counsel,  accountant, auditor, and financial advisor or fiscal agent. Form RD 442- 19, ``Agreement for Engineering Services,'' may be used when  appropriate. RUS Bulletin 1780-7, ``Legal Service Agreement'' may be  used to prepare the agreement for legal services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other services. Contracts for other services such as management,  operation, and maintenance will be developed by the applicant and  presented to the RUS official developing the docket for review and  approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Fees for services. Fees provided for in contracts, agreements or  services will not be more than those ordinarily charged by the  profession for similar work when RUS financing is not involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> State pollution control or Environmental Protection Agency  standards. Facilities will be designed, installed and operated to  prevent pollution of water in excess of established standards. Effluent  disposal will conform with appropriate State and Federal Water Pollution  Control Standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Water pollution. When repayment of a WS loan, WS advance, or RCD  loan will be dependent upon income from the use or sale of water, RUS  approval will be contingent upon a determination that the proposed use  of stored water for recreation or municipal supply might not be  permitted by a State health department because the water is being  polluted from an upstream or other source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Environmental requirements. Actions will be taken to comply with  the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) in  accordance with subpart G of part 1940 of this title. When environmental  assessments and environmental impact statements have been prepared on WS  plans or RCD area plans by NRCS, a separate environmental impact  statement or assessment on WS works of improvement or RCD measures for  which a WS loan, WS advance, or RCD loan is requested will not be  necessary unless the NRCS environmental review fails to meet the  requirements of subpart G of part 1940 of this title. The Rural  Development State Director should document the action taken by NRCS in  compliance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy  Act and formally adopt the impact statement or assessment if  satisfactory. If a determination is made that a further analysis of the  environmental impact is needed, the Rural Development State Director  will make necessary arrangements with the State NRCS conservationist for  such action to be taken before a loan is made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> National Historic Preservation Act. All projects will comply  with the provisions of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966  (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.) in accordance with RD Instruction 1901-F.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Civil Rights Act of 1964. Recipients of WS loans, WS advances,  or RCD loans are subject to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42  U.S.C. 2000d et seq.), which prohibits discrimination because of race,  color, or national origin. Borrowers must agree not to discriminate in  their operations by signing Form RD 400-4, ``Nondiscrimination  Agreement,'' before loan closing. This requirement should be discussed  with the applicant as early in the negotiations as possible. Necessary  actions will be taken in accordance with RD Instruction 1901-E.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Appraisals. When required by the Rural Development State  Director, appraisals will be made by an Rural Development official  designated or an independent appraiser. Form RD 442-10,   ``Appraisal Report--Water and Waste Disposal Systems,'' with appropriate  supplements, may be modified as needed for use with the type of  facilities being appraised.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Architectural Barriers Act of 1968. All facilities financed with  RUS loans and grants which are accessible to the public or in which  physically handicapped persons may be employed or reside must be  developed in compliance with this act (42 U.S.C. 4151 et seq.).</p>
