                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A VE analysis should be conducted as early as practicable in the  planning or development of a project, preferably before the completion  of the project's preliminary design. At a minimum, the VE analysis shall  be conducted prior to completing the project's final design.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The VE analysis should be closely coordinated with other project  development activities to minimize the impact approved recommendations  might have on previous agency, community, or environmental commitments;  the project's scope or schedule; and the use of innovative technologies,  materials, methods, plans or construction provisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When the STA or local public agency chooses to conduct a VE  analysis for a project utilizing the design-build project delivery  method, the VE analysis should be performed prior to the release of the  final Request for Proposals or other applicable solicitation documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For projects delivered using the CM/GC contracting method, a VE  analysis is not required prior to the preparation and release of the RFP  for the CM/GC contract. The VE analysis is required to be completed and  approved recommendations incorporated into the project plans prior to  requesting a construction price proposal from the CM/GC contractor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> STAs shall ensure the VE analysis meets the following  requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Uses a multidisciplinary team not directly involved in the  planning or design of the project, with at least one individual who has  training and experience with leading VE analyses;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Develops and implements the VE Job Plan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Produces a formal written report outlining, at a minimum:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Project information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Identification of the VE analysis team;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Background and supporting documentation, such as information  obtained from other analyses conducted on the project (e.g.,  environmental, safety, traffic operations, constructability);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Documentation of the stages of the VE Job Plan which would  include documentation of the life-cycle costs that were analyzed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Summarization of the analysis conducted;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Documentation of the proposed recommendations and approvals  received at the time the report is finalized; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The formal written report shall be retained for at least 3  years after the completion of the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For bridge projects, in addition to the requirements in  subsection (e), the VE analyses shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Include bridge substructure and superstructure requirements that  consider alternative construction materials; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be conducted based on:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An engineering and economic assessment, taking into  consideration acceptable designs for bridges; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An analysis of life-cycle costs and duration of project  construction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> STAs and local public agencies may employ qualified consultants  (as defined in 23 CFR 172.3) to conduct a VE analysis. The consultant  shall possess training and experience with leading VE analyses. A  consulting firm or individual shall not be used to conduct or support a  VE analysis if they have a conflict of interest (as specified in 23 CFR  1.33).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> STAs, and local public agencies are encouraged to use a VECP  clause (or other such clauses under a different name) in an applicable  project's contract, allowing the construction contractor to propose  changes to the project's plans, specifications, or other contract  documents. Whenever such clauses are used, the STA and local authority  will consider changes that could improve the project's performance,  value and quality, shorten the delivery time, or lower construction  costs, while considering impacts on the   project's overall life-cycle cost and other applicable factors. The  basis for a STA or local authority to consider a VECP is the analysis  and documentation supporting the proposed benefits that would result  from implementing the proposed change in the project's contract or  project plans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Proposals to accelerate construction after the award of the  contract will not be considered a VECP and will not be eligible for  Federal-aid highway program funding participation. Where it is necessary  to accelerate construction, STAs and local public agencies are  encouraged to use the appropriate incentive or disincentive clauses so  that all proposers will take this into account when preparing their bids  or price proposals.</p>
