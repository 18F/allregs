                            <p class="depth0">If we make an income-related monthly adjustment amount determination  for you for the effective year under subpart B of this part (Medicare  Part B Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount), we will apply that  income-related monthly adjustment amount determination under this  subpart to determine your Part D income-related monthly adjustment  amount for the same effective year. Therefore, if you obtain Medicare  prescription drug coverage in the effective year after we make an  income-related monthly adjustment amount determination about your  Medicare Part B, the income-related monthly adjustment amount  determination we made for your Medicare Part B will also apply to your  Medicare prescription drug coverage. Any change in your net benefit due  will be accompanied by a letter explaining the change in your net  benefit and your right to appeal the change.</p>
