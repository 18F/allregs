The Contractor shall not acquire or  construct items of property to which the Government will have title  under the provisions of this contract without the Contracting Officer's  written authorization. Property which will be acquired as a deliverable  end item as material or as a component for incorporation into a  deliverable end item is exempt from this requirement. Property approved  as part of the contract award or specifically required within the  statement of work is exempt from this requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the event the Contractor is unable to provide the property  necessary for performance, and the Contractor requests provision of  property by the Government, the Contractor's request shall--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Justify the need for the property;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provide the reasons why contractor-owned property cannot be  used;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Describe the property in sufficient detail to enable the  Government to screen its inventories for available property or to  otherwise acquire property, including applicable manufacturer, model,  part, catalog, National Stock Number or other pertinent identifiers;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Combine requests for quantities of items with identical  descriptions and estimated values when the estimated values do not  exceed $500,000 per unit; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Include only a single unit when the acquisition or construction  value equals or exceeds $500,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Contracting Officer authorization is required for items the  Contractor intends to manufacture as well as those it intends to  purchase.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Contractor shall submit requests to the Contracting Officer  no less than 30 days in advance of the date the Contractor would, should  it receive authorization, acquire or begin fabrication of the item.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Contractor shall maintain copies of Contracting Officer  authorizations, appropriately cross-referenced to the individual  property record, within its property management system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Property furnished from Government excess sources is provided  as-is, where-is. The Government makes no warranty regarding its  applicability for performance of the contract or its ability to operate.

If the required property is  available, but unsuitable for use, the contractor shall document the  rationale for rejection of available property. The Contractor shall  retain appropriate cross-referenced documentary evidence of the outcome  of those screening efforts as part of its property records system.
