A particular vehicle need not meet further requirements after having been subjected to a single barrier crash test.</p><p class="depth0">S6.1 Frontal barrier crash. When the vehicle traveling longitudinally forward at any speed up to and including 30 mph impacts a fixed collision barrier that is perpendicular to the line of travel of the vehicle, or at any angle up to 30 degrees in either direction from the perpendicular to the line of travel of the vehicle, with 50th percentile test dummies as specified in part 572 of this chapter at each front outboard designated seating position and at any other position whose protection system is required to be tested by a dummy under the provisions of Standard No. 208, under the applicable conditions of S7, the fuel pressure drop shall not exceed the limits of S5.2.</p><p class="depth0">S6.2 Rear moving barrier crash. When the vehicle is impacted from the rear by a barrier moving at any speed up to and including 30 mph, with test dummies as specified in part 572 of this chapter at each front outboard designated seating position, under the applicable conditions of S7, the fuel pressure drop shall not exceed the limits of S5.2.</p><p class="depth0">S6.3 Lateral moving barrier crash.
