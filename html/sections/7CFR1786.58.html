providing security for loans the proceeds of which were used to prepay RUS Notes. Such lien accommodations shall be limited in amount to the Discounted Present Value of the RUS Notes plus such costs, as the Administrator shall determine to be reasonable, incurred by the borrower in obtaining such loans.</p>
