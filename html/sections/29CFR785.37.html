                                Sec. 785.37  Home to work on special one-day assignment in another city.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">A problem arises when an employee who regularly works at a fixed location in one city is given a special 1-day work assignment in another city. For example, an employee who works in Washington, DC, with regular working hours from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. may be given a special assignment in New York City, with instructions to leave Washington at 8 a.m. He arrives in New York at 12 noon, ready for work. The special assignment is completed at 3

p.m., and the employee arrives back in Washington at 7 p.m. Such travel cannot be regarded as ordinary home-to-work travel occasioned merely by the fact of employment. It was performed for the employer's benefit and at his special request to meet the needs of the particular and unusual assignment. It would thus qualify as an integral part of the ``principal'' activity which the employee was hired to perform on the workday in question; it is like travel involved in an emergency call (described in Sec. 785.36), or like travel that is all in the day's work (see Sec. 785.38). All the time involved, however, need not be counted. Since, except for the special assignment, the employee would have had to report to his regular work site, the travel between his home and the railroad depot may be deducted, it being in the ``home-to-work'' category. Also, of course, the usual meal time would be deductible.</p>
