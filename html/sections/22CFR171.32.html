                                Sec. 171.32  Request for access to records.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Description of records sought. All requests for access to a record must reasonably describe the System of Records and the individual's record within the system in sufficient detail to permit identification of the requested record. At a minimum, requests should include the individual's full name (including maiden name, if appropriate) and any other names used, present mailing address and ZIP Code, date and place of birth, and any other information that might help in identifying the record. Helpful data includes the approximate time period of the

record and the circumstances that give the individual reason to believe that the Department of State maintains a record under the individual's name or personal identifier. In certain instances, it may be necessary for the Department to request additional information from the requester, either to ensure a full search, or to ensure that a record retrieved does in fact pertain to the individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Verification of personal identity. The Department will require reasonable identification of individuals requesting records under the Privacy Act to ensure that records are disclosed only to the proper persons. Requesters must state their full name, current address, date and place of birth, and, at the requester's option, social security number. The request must be signed, and the requester's signature must be either notarized or submitted under penalty of perjury (28 U.S.C. 1746) as a substitute for notarization. If the requester seeks records under another name the requester has used, a statement, under penalty of perjury, that the requester has also used the other name must be included.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Third party access. The Department shall allow third party access to records under certain conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Parents. Upon presentation of documentation of the parental relationship, a parent of a minor (an unmarried person under the age of 18) may, on behalf of the minor, request records pertaining to the minor and the Department may, in its discretion, disclose such records to the parent to the extent determined by the Department to be appropriate in the circumstances of the case. In any case, minors may request such records on their own behalf.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Guardians. A guardian of a minor or of an individual who has been declared by a court to be incompetent may act for and on behalf of the minor or the incompetent individual upon presentation of appropriate documentation of the guardian relationship.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Authorized representatives or designees. When an individual wishes to authorize another person or persons access to his or her records, the individual shall submit, in addition to the identifying information described in paragraph (b) of this section, a signed statement, either notarized or made under penalty of perjury, authorizing and consenting to access by a designated person or persons. Such requests shall be processed under the FOIA (see Sec. 171.12).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Records relating to civil actions. Nothing in this subpart entitles an individual to access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Time limits. The Department will acknowledge the request promptly and furnish the requested information as soon as possible thereafter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Information on amending records. At the time the Department grants access to a record, it will also furnish guidelines for requesting amendment of a record. These guidelines may also be obtained by writing to the Information and Privacy Coordinator at the address given in Sec. 171.5. The guidelines are also available in the reading room described in Sec. 171.3 and in the electronic reading room described in Sec. 171.4.</p>
