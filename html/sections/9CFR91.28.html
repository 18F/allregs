Welding shall be used for such attachment to be exposed in the finished work. Pins, plates, and parts other than pipe shall be made of galvanized steel. All areas where galvanizing of the steel has eroded or has been damaged shall be finished with a rust preventative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Pipe rails shall be placed in proper alignment with tops of all gates at the same height.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All gates of animal pens aboard an ocean vessel shall have smooth finished surfaces and the pivot-pins shall have a minimum diameter of \3/4\ inch.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Animals may be carried on upper decks of an ocean vessel in space abutting the outside rails or bulwarks only if such rails or bulwarks are 3 feet or more in height from the deck and are of sufficient strength to hold the necessary fittings securely or if the space available is sufficient to permit securing the required fittings to provide the necessary strength. When animals are carried on upper decks, bulkheads shall be erected at all unprotected ends of stalls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> Cattle and horses. Rail stanchions for pens aboard an ocean vessel for cattle or horses shall be constructed of not less that 4 or 6 lumber set 5 feet apart on centers secured to the ship's rail or bulwark with \5/8\ inch or larger bolts or collars and with heels raced to the sheer streak or waterway. Inboard stanchions of 4x6 lumber shall be set in line with the rail stanchions and properly braced: Provided, however, That the method of securing and bracing of stanchions may be modified as approved by the underwriter of the cargo bureau, and the inspector. Information concerning the modifications shall be made available to APHIS, at its request. On open rail ships, spaces between the rails shall be blocked out to permit the affixing of outside planking. If supplementary stanchions are required for rump boards, these shall not be less than 3x4 in size and shall be secured to beams and decks as outlined above. On upper deck fittings at ends of unprotected stalls, a stanchion not less than 3x4 in size shall be similarly spaced and secured to beams and decks and properly braced. Stanchions on underdecks shall be constructed, spaced, and secured in the same manner as upper deck fittings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cattle and horses.

Stanchions for single or double tier pens for sheep, goats, and swine shall be constructed of not less 3x4 lumber set at not greater distance than 5 feet on centers and secured as outlined in paragraph (d)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For all animals, two beams of 2x6 lumber shall be bolted on each side of the stanchions using \5/8\ inch bolts, nuts, and washers. Beams shall extend from outside planking to at least 2 feet beyond the line of the breast boards unless the beams butt on the ship's deck fittings. Two beams of 2x6 lumber shall be used to support the roof of single tier pens on exposed decks and the floor of double tier pens on all decks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> All pens for carrying animals on exposed decks aboard an ocean vessel shall be roofed with not less than 1 inch thick, watertight lumber extending from outside planking to at least 2 feet beyond the line of breast boards: Provided, That, if tongue and grooved lumber is used, it must be caulked or covered so that it is watertight or if square edged lumber is used it shall be covered with a saturated roofing paper known to the trade as 30 pound roofing paper and shall be securely battened.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> All pens for carrying animals on exposed decks shall be provided with outside planking of not less than 1\1/2\ inch tongue and groove lumber, laid fore and aft of ship, driven tightly together and securely nailed to backs of stanchions in a manner to cover all open spaces properly. However, during warm weather the top course planking

may be left off in order to allow a free circulation of air. On vessels with closed bulwarks, the outside planking shall extend not less than 6 inches below the upper edge of the bulwark.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)(1)</em> Horses. All stalls and pens for horses shall be equipped with breast boards of no less than 2x10 dressed lumber with the top edge placed 3 feet 10 inches from the floor and securely nailed to the stanchions. Where butting occurs, the joints are to be on the stanchions and shall be covered with metal plates 3 inches square or 5 inches in diameter and not less than \1/4\ inch in thickness. A \5/8\ inch bolt shall then be passed through the plate, joint, and stanchion and securely fastened with a nut. All breast boards shall have 1 inch holes bored through them at proper distances for tying animals. An occasional pen shall be provided with a removable breast board in order that animals may be loaded into and removed from the stalls and pens. All stalls and pens shall be provided with foot boards of not less than 2x10 lumber securely nailed or bolted to the stanchions. At the discretion of the inspector, small ponies, asses, small mules, mares with foal at foot, young unbroken horses or gentle horses of any size may be stowed loose in pens. In these cases, a sufficient number of finished 2x10 lumber shall be placed between the breast and foot boards to effectively contain the animals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Horses.

All stalls and pens for cattle shall be provided with boards as required for horses in paragraph (a), except that the front or breast boards shall be constructed in sets of three or more boards of 2x10 dressed lumber separated by 3 inch spacers and placed on the foot board so that the front of the pen extends 48 inches or more in height from the floor. One or more of the breast boards may be left off if feed or water troughs are to be mounted externally.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sheep, goats, and swine. Front boards in pens for sheep, goats, and swine shall be of not less than 1x6 pieces of lumber approximately spaced and extending to the proper height for these species of animals. Provision shall be made for removing a section of front boards to allow entry of animals into pens or removal therefrom and for feeding or watering.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)(1)</em> Horses and cattle. Rump boards in pens for horses or cattle shall form a solid wall at least 4 feet high for cattle and 4 feet 6 inches high for horses and shall be of lumber not less than 1\1/2\ inches thick if tongued and grooved or 2 inches thick if square edged or of plywood of the same strength. Where the deck is clear of obstructions, rump boards may be set on the inside of the rail stanchions. When this is not possible, sections so affected may be brought forward to clear such obstructions and shall be fastened by stanchions provided for this purpose. On lower decks where the ship's construction so justifies, rump boards may be affixed to 2x6 wooden pieces set the same as prescribed for stanchions. Rump boards may be formed by filling spaces between cargo battens. Rump boards in stalls or pens built alongside hatches need be carried down only to the coaming line.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Horses and cattle.
