ONRR shall maintain records of civil penalties collected and distributed to the States and tribes involved in cooperative agreements. Each quarterly payment of the Federal share of a cooperative agreement will be reduced by the amount of the civil penalties paid to the State or tribe during the prior quarter.</p>
