                            <p class="depth0">The Recent Graduates Program provides an entry-level developmental  experience designed to lead to a civil service career in the Federal  Government after successfully completing 1 year under the Program,  unless the training requirements of the position warrant a longer and  more structured training program. Employment under the Recent Graduates  Program may not exceed 2 years plus any agency approved extension of up  to an additional 120 days. Individuals appointed under this authority  are referred to as Recent Graduates. An agency wishing to participate in  the Recent Graduates Program must:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identify in the MOU the duration of its Recent Graduates  Program, including any criteria used to determine   the need for a longer and more structured training program that exceeds  1 year;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Ensure, within 90 days of appointment, that each Recent Graduate  is assigned a mentor who is an employee outside the Recent Graduates'  chain of command;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Ensure, within 45 days of appointment, that each Recent Graduate  has an Individual Development Plan (IDP) that is approved by his or her  supervisor; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Provide at least 40 hours of formal interactive training per  year that advances the goals and competencies outlined in each Recent  Graduate's IDP. Mandatory annual training, such as information security  and ethics training, does not count towards the 40-hour requirement.</p>
