If an application modification substantially changes  the original demonstration design, CMS may, at its discretion, direct an  additional 30-day public comment period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> This section does not preclude a State from submitting to CMS a  pre-application concept paper or from conferring with CMS about its  intent to seek a demonstration prior to submitting a completed  application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Demonstration application procedures. A State application for  approval of a new demonstration project or an extension of an existing  demonstration project must be submitted to CMS as both printed and  electronic documents. Electronic documents must be submitted in a format  that will be accessible to individuals with disabilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Consistent with Sec.  431.416(a) of this subpart, within 15 days  of receipt of a complete application, CMS will send the State a written  notice informing the State of receipt of the submitted application, the  date in which the Secretary received the State's demonstration  application and the start date of the 30-day Federal public notice  process set forth in Sec.  431.416 of this subpart. The written notice--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is provided for purposes of initiating the Federal-level public  comment period and does not preclude a determination that, based on  further review, further information is required to supplement or support  the application, or that the application cannot be approved because a  required element is missing or insufficient.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Does not prevent a State from modifying its application or  submitting any supplementary information it determines necessary to  support CMS' review of its application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Within 15 days of receipt of a demonstration application that  CMS determines is incomplete, CMS will send the State a written notice  of the elements missing from the application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> CMS will publish on its Web site at regular intervals the status  of all State submissions, including information received from the State  while the State works with CMS to meet the demonstration application  process set forth in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Demonstration extension request. A request to extend an existing  demonstration under sections 1115(a), (e), and (f) of the Act will be  considered only if it is submitted at least 12 months prior to the  expiration date of the demonstration when requesting an extension under  section 1115(e) of the Act or 6 months prior to the expiration date of  the demonstration when requesting an extension under section 1115(a) or  (f) of the Act, unless a longer time frame is specified in the Special  Terms and Conditions for the original demonstration. An extension  application, including an extension for the purpose of phasing out a  demonstration, must be sent from the Governor of the State to the  Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Changes to existing demonstration. If an extension application  includes substantial changes to the existing demonstration, CMS may, at  its discretion, treat the application as an application for a new  demonstration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Demonstration extension application.

This  includes a financial analysis of changes to the demonstration requested  by the State.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> An evaluation report of the demonstration, inclusive of  evaluation activities and findings to date, plans for evaluation  activities during the extension period, and if changes are requested,  identification of research hypotheses related to the changes and an  evaluation design for addressing the proposed revisions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Documentation of the State's compliance with the public notice  process set forth in Sec.  431.408 of this subpart, including the post- award public input process described in Sec.  431.420(c) of this  subpart, with a report of the issues raised by the public during the  comment period and how the State considered the comments when developing  the demonstration extension application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> CMS may request, or the State may propose application  modifications, as well as additional information to aid in the review of  an application to extend a demonstration.
