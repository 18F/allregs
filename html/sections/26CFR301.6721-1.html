                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of Sec. 301.6724-1 for waiver  of the penalty for a failure that is due to reasonable cause.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Failures subject to the penalty. The failures to which section  6721(a) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section apply are--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A failure to file an information return on or before the  required filing date (``failure to file timely''), and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A failure to include all of the information required to be  shown on the return or the inclusion of incorrect information (``failure  to include correct information''). A failure to file timely includes a  failure to file in the required manner, for example, on magnetic media  or in other machine-readable form as provided under section 6011(e).  However, no penalty is imposed under   paragraph (a)(1) of this section solely by reason of any failure to  comply with the requirements of section 6011(e)(2), except to the extent  that such a failure occurs with respect to more than 250 information  returns (the 250-threshold requirement) or in the case of a partnership  with more than 100 partners, more than 100 information returns (the 100- threshold requirement) (collectively, the threshold requirements). Each  Schedule K-1 considered in applying the 100-threshold requirement will  be treated as a separate information return. These threshold  requirements apply separately to each type of information return  required to be filed. Further, these threshold requirements apply  separately to original and corrected returns. Thus, for example, if a  filer files 300 returns on Form 1099-DIV and later files 70 corrected  returns on Form 1099-DIV, the corrected returns may be filed either on  the prescribed paper form (because they fall below the 250-threshold  requirement) or on magnetic media or other machine-readable form. Filers  who are required to file information returns on magnetic media and who  file such information returns electronically are considered to have  satisfied the magnetic media filing requirement. Except as provided in  paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a failure to include correct  information encompasses a failure to include the information required by  applicable information reporting statutes or by any administrative  pronouncements issued thereunder (such as regulations, revenue rulings,  revenue procedures, or information reporting forms and form  instructions). A failure to include information in the correct format  may be either a failure to file timely an information return or a  failure to include correct information on an information return. For  example, an error on a magnetic media submission to the Internal Revenue  Service that prevents processing by the Internal Revenue Service may  constitute a failure to file timely. However, if information is set  forth on the wrong field of the magnetic media submission, such an error  may constitute a failure to file timely or a failure to include correct  information, depending upon the extent of the failure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reduction in the penalty when a correction is made within  specified periods--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Correction within 30 days. The penalty imposed  under section 6721(a) for a failure to file timely or for a failure to  include correct information shall be $15 in lieu of $50 if the failure  is corrected on or before the 30th day after the required filing date  (``within 30 days''). The total amount imposed on a person for all  failures during any calendar year that are corrected within 30 days  shall not exceed $75,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> for returns that are not due on  February 28 or March 15.) The total amount imposed on a person for all  failures during any calendar year corrected after 30 days but on or  before August 1 shall not exceed $150,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Required filing date defined. The term ``required filing date''  means the date prescribed for filing an information return with the  Internal Revenue Service (or the Social Security Administration in the  case of Forms W-2) determined with regard to any extension of time for  filing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Penalty amount for return with multiple failures. If a return is  subject to a penalty for more than one failure, and the penalty amounts  for the failures differ, the higher penalty amount will be imposed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) (1) through  (4) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples. These  examples do not take into account any possible application of the de  minimis exception under paragraph (d) of this section, the lower small  business limitations under paragraph (e) of this section, the penalty  for intentional disregard under   paragraph (f) of this section, or the reasonable cause waiver under  paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6724-1:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. Corporation R fails to file timely 11,000 Forms 1099-MISC  (relating to miscellaneous income) for the 1990 calendar year. Five  thousand of these returns are filed with correct information within 30  days, and 6,000 after 30 days but on or before August 1, 1991. For the  same year R fails to file timely 400 Forms 1099-INT (relating to  payments of interest) which R eventually files on September 28, 1991,  after the period for reduction of the penalty has elapsed. R is subject  to a penalty of $20,000 for the 400 forms which were not filed by August  1 ($50 x 400 =$20,000), $150,000 for the 6,000 forms filed after 30 days  ($30 x 6,000 =$180,000, limited to $150,000 under paragraph (b)(2) of  this section), and $75,000 for the 5,000 forms filed within 30 days ($15  x 5,000 =$75,000), for a total penalty of $245,000.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Corporation T fails to file timely 6,000 Forms 1099-MISC  for the 1990 calendar year. T files the 6000 Forms 1099-MISC on  September 1, 1991. Because T does not correct the failure by August 1,  1991, T is subject to a penalty of $250,000, the maximum penalty under  paragraph (a) of this section. Without the limitation of paragraph (a),  T would be subject to a $300,000 penalty ($50 x 6,000 =$300,000).</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. Corporation U files timely 300 Forms 1099-MISC on paper  for the 1990 calendar year with correct information. Under section  6011(e)(2) a person required to file at least 250 returns during a  calendar year must file those returns on magnetic media. U does not  correct its failures to file these returns on magnetic media by August  1, 1991. It is therefore subject to a penalty for a failure to file  timely under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. However, pursuant to  section 6724(c) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the penalty for a  failure to file timely on magnetic media applies only to the extent the  number of returns exceeds 250. As U was required to file 300 returns on  magnetic media, U is subject to a penalty of $2,500 for 50 returns ($50  x 50 =$2,500).</p><p class="depth3">Example 4. Corporation V files 300 Forms 1099-MISC on paper for the  1990 calendar year. The forms were filed on March 15, 1991, rather than  on the required filing date of February 28, 1991. Under section  6011(e)(2), a person required to file at least 250 returns during a  calendar year must file those returns on magnetic media. V does not  correctly file these returns on magnetic media by August 1, 1991. V is  subject to a penalty of $3,750 for filing 250 of the returns late ($15 x  250) and $2,500 for failing to file 50 returns on magnetic media ($50 x  50) for a total penalty of $6,250.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Application to returns not due on February 28, or March 15. For  returns that are not due on February 28 or March 15 (for example, Forms  8300 reporting certain cash payments of $10,000 or more), the penalty is  $15 if the failure is corrected within 30 days. If the failure is  corrected after 30 days, the penalty is $50 rather than $30. There is no  period during which the penalty is reduced to $30 under paragraph (b)(2)  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, the term ``inconsequential error or omission'' means any failure  that does not prevent or hinder the Internal Revenue Service from  processing the return, from correlating the information required to be  shown on the return with the information shown on the payee's tax  return, or from otherwise putting the return to its intended use. See  paragraph (g)(5) of this section for the definition of ``payee.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Errors or omissions that are never inconsequential. Errors or  omissions relating to the following are never inconsequential--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A taxpayer identification number;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A surname of a payee (i.e., the person required to be furnished  a copy of the information set forth on an information return); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any monetary amounts. The Internal Revenue Service may, by  administrative pronouncement, specify other types of errors or omissions  that are never inconsequential.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (c) may be  illustrated by the following examples, which do not take into account  any possible application of the penalty for intentional disregard under  paragraph (f) of this section or the reasonable cause waiver under  paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6724-1:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. A filer files a Form 1099-MISC (relating to miscellaneous  income) with the Internal Revenue Service. The Form 1099-MISC is  complete and correct except that the word ``street'' is misspelled in  the payee's address. The error does not prevent or hinder the Internal  Revenue Service from processing the return, from correlating the  information required to be shown on the return with the information  shown on the payee's tax return, or from otherwise putting the return to  its intended use. Therefore, no   penalty is imposed under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. A filer files a Form 1099-MISC with the Internal Revenue  Service. The Form 1099-MISC is complete and correct except that the  payee's first name, William, is misspelled as ``Willaim.'' the error  does not prevent or hinder the Internal Revenue Service from processing  the return, from correlating the information required to be shown on the  return with the information shown on the payee's tax return, or from  otherwise putting the return to its intended use. See paragraph (c)(2)  of this section. Therefore, no penalty is imposed under paragraph (a) of  this section.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. A filer files a Form 1099-MISC with the Internal Revenue  Service. The Form 1099-MISC is complete and correct except that the  payee's name, ``John Doe,'' is misspelled as ``John Ode.'' Under  paragraph (c)(2) of this section, supplying an incorrect surname for a  payee is never considered an inconsequential error. Therefore, a penalty  is imposed under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exception for a de minimis number of failures--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requirements.  The penalty under paragraph (a) of this section is not imposed for a de  minimis number of failures to include correct information if the filer  corrects such failures on or before August 1 of the year in which the  required filing date occurs. (See paragraph (d)(4) of this section for  special rules relating to returns that are not due on February 28 or  March 15.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Calculation of the de minimis exception. The number of returns  to which the de minimis exception applies for any calendar year shall  not exceed the greater of 10 or one-half of one percent of the total  number of all information returns the filer is required to file during  the year. If the number of returns on which the filer fails to include  correct information exceeds the number of returns to which the de  minimis exception applies, the de minimis exception applies to those  returns that will afford the filer the greatest reduction in penalty.  The de minimis exception applies to failures to include correct  information that exist after the application (if any) of the waiver for  reasonable cause under section 6724(a) and Sec. 301.6724-1. Returns to  which the de minimis exception applies are treated as having been  originally filed with correct information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (d) may be  illustrated by the following examples. In each of the examples, the  failures to file and to include correct information are subject to  penalty under paragraph (a) of this section. The examples do not take  into account any possible application of paragraph (f) of this section  or the reasonable cause waiver under paragraph (a) of Sec. 301.6724-1  of this section.</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. Corporation T files timely 10,000 Forms 1099-INT  (relating to payments of interest) for 1990 by February 28, 1991. The  10,000 returns are all the information returns that T is required to  file during the 1991 calendar year. Of the returns filed, 70 contained  incorrect information. T corrects the failures on July 12, 1991. No  penalty is imposed for 50 of the failures (i.e., the greater of 10 or  .005 x 10,000 =50) even though the total failures, 70, exceed the number  to which the de minimis exception may apply. The $30 penalty under  paragraph (b)(2) of this section is imposed, in lieu of $50, for the  remaining 20 failures, which were corrected after 30 days but on or  before August 1, resulting in a total penalty of $600 ($30 x 20 =$600).</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Corporation U files timely 9,500 Forms 1099-INT for 1990  by February 28, 1991, the required filing date. Fifty of these returns  contain incorrect information with respect to which U files correct  information on August 1, 1991. U also files 500 Forms 1099-INT for 1990  on August 30, 1991, after the required filing date. The 10,000 returns  are all the information returns that U is required to file during the  1991 calendar year. The calculation of the de minimis exception is based  on the 10,000 returns required to be filed during the 1991 calendar year  even though 500 of the returns filed during the year were not filed  timely. Therefore, the number of failures for which the de minimis  exception applies is 50, and accordingly no penalty is imposed for the  50 Forms 1099-INT that were corrected on August 1, 1991. However, the  $50 penalty under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is imposed for each  failure to file timely, resulting in a total penalty of $25,000 ($50 x  500 =$25,000).</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. Corporation V files timely 9,950 Forms 1099-INT for 1990  by February 28, 1991. However, V fails to file timely 50 of its Forms  1099-INT. The 10,000 returns are all the information returns that V is  required to file during the 1991 calendar year. Upon discovering the  error, V files the 50 returns within 30 days of February 28, 1991. The  50 returns are complete and correct except that V fails to include the  taxpayer identification numbers of the payees on the returns. V files  corrected returns on August 1, 1991. Absent application of the de  minimis exception, the penalty imposed for the failure to include   correct information would be $1,500 ($30 x 50 =$1,500). Because the  incorrect returns are corrected on August 1, the 50 forms are treated  under the de minimis exception as originally filed with correct  information, and therefore no penalty is imposed under paragraph (a) of  this section for the failure to include correct information.  Nevertheless, the penalty under paragraph (a) of this section is imposed  for the failure to file timely the 50 returns because the de minimis  exception does not apply to the penalty for the failure to file timely.  Hence, a penalty of $750 ($15 x 50 =$750) is imposed.</p><p class="depth3">Example 4. Corporation W files timely 100 Forms 1099-DIV and files  an additional 50 Forms 1099-DIV late, but within 30 days of February 28,  1991. These are all the information returns that W was required to file  during the 1991 calendar year. W discovers errors on 10 of the returns  that were filed timely, and on 5 of the returns that were filed late. W  corrects all the errors on August 1. The de minimis exception applies to  10 of the corrected returns. The exception will be allocated to the 10  returns that were filed timely with incorrect information, because that  allocation is most favorable to W (i.e., applying the exception to a  return filed late with incorrect information would save W $15, by  reducing the penalty on that return from $30 to $15, but applying the  exception to a return filed timely would save W $30, by reducing the  penalty on that return from $30 to $0). (See paragraph (b)(4) of this  section.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Nonapplication to returns not due on February 28 or March 15.  The exception for a de minimis number of failures provided in paragraph  (d)(1) of this section does not apply to failures with respect to  returns that are not due on February 28 or March 15 (for example, Forms  8300 reporting certain cash payments of $10,000 or more). Nevertheless,  the returns that are not due on February 28 or March 15 are included in  the total number of all information returns that the filer is required  to file during a year for purposes of calculating the number of the  returns subject to the de minimis exception under paragraph (d)(2) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(2)</em> of this section) for any calendar year, the total  amount of the penalty imposed on such person for all failures described  in section 6721(a)(2) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section during such  calendar year shall not exceed $100,000. The total amount of the penalty  imposed under paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section for failures corrected  within 30 days shall not exceed $25,000 for such calendar year. The  total amount of the penalty imposed under paragraph (b)(2) of this  section for failures corrected after 30 days but on or before August 1  shall not exceed $50,000 for such calendar year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> and (3) shall apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Higher penalty for intentional disregard of requirement to file  timely correct information returns--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Application of section 6721(e).  If a failure is due to intentional disregard of the requirement to file  timely or to include correct information on a return as described in  paragraph (g) of this section, the amount of the penalty imposed under  paragraph (a) of this section shall be determined under paragraph (f)(4)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Meaning of ``intentional disregard.'' A failure is due to  intentional disregard if it is a knowing or willful--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Failure to file timely, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Failure to include correct information. Whether a person  knowingly or willfully fails to file timely or fails to include correct  information is determined on the basis of all the facts and  circumstances in the particular case.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Facts and circumstances considered. The facts and circumstances  that are considered in determining whether a failure is due to  intentional disregard include, but are not limited to--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether the failure to file timely or the failure to include  correct information is part of a pattern of conduct by the person who  filed the return of repeatedly failing to file timely or repeatedly  failing to include correct information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whether correction was promptly made upon discovery of the  failure;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Whether the filer corrects a failure to file or a failure to  include correct information within 30 days after the date of any written  request from the Internal Revenue Service to file or to correct; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Whether the amount of the information reporting penalties is  less than the cost of complying with the requirement to file timely or  to include correct information on an information return.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Amount of the penalty. If one or more failures to file timely or  to include correct information are due to intentional disregard of the  requirement to file timely or to include correct information, then, with  respect to each such failure determined under this paragraph (f)--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Paragraphs (b), (d), and (e) of this section shall not apply;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The $250,000 limitation under paragraph (a) of this section  shall not apply, and the penalty under this paragraph (f) shall not be  taken into account in applying the $250,000 limitation (or any similar  limitation under paragraph (b) or (e) of this section) to penalties not  determined under this paragraph (f);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The penalty imposed under paragraph (a) of this section shall  be $100 or, if greater, the statutory percentage; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The term ``statutory percentage'' means--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In the case of a return other than a return required under  section 6045(a), 6041A(b), 6050H, 6050I (for amounts received after  November 5, 1990), 6050J, 6050K, or 6050L, 10 percent of the aggregate  dollar amount of the items required to be reported correctly,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In the case of a return required to be filed by section 6045(a),  6050K, or 6050L, 5 percent of the aggregate dollar amount of the items  required to be reported correctly, or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> In the case of a return required to be filed under section  6050I(a) with respect to amounts received after November 5, 1990, for  any transaction (or related transactions), the greater of $25,000 or the  amount of cash (within the meaning of section 6050I(d)) received in such  transaction to the extent the amount of such cash does not exceed  $100,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Computation of the penalty; aggregate dollar amount of the items  required to be reported correctly. The aggregate dollar amount used in  computing the penalty under this paragraph (f) is the amount that is not  reported or is reported incorrectly. If the intentional disregard  relates to a dollar amount, the statutory percentage is applied to the  difference between the dollar amount reported and the amount required to  be reported correctly. If the intentional disregard relates to any other  item on the return, the statutory percentage is applied to the aggregate  amount of items required to be reported correctly. In determining the  aggregate amount of items required to be reported correctly, no item  shall be taken into account more than once. For example, if a filer  willfully fails to file a Form 1099-INT on which $800 of interest and  $160 of Federal income tax withheld (i.e., backup withholding) is  required to be reported, only the $800 amount is taken into account in  computing the penalty.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (f) may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. On December 1, 1990, Automobile dealer P receives $55,000  from an individual for the purchase of an automobile in a transaction  subject to reporting under section 6050I. The individual presents  documents to P that identify him as ``John Doe.'' However, P completes  the Form 8300 (relating to cash received in a trade or business) and  reflects the name of a cartoon character as the payor. Because P knew at  the time of filing the Form 8300 that the payor's name was not the name  of the cartoon character, he willfully failed to include correct  information as described under paragraph (f)(2) of this section.  Therefore, the penalty under paragraph (f)(4) of this section is imposed  for the intentional disregard of the requirement to include correct  information. The amount used in computing the penalty under paragraph  (f)(5) of this section is $55,000 (i.e., the amount required to be  reported on the return with respect to which the payee is not correctly  identified). The amount of the penalty determined under paragraph  (f)(4)(ii)(C) of this section is $55,000 (i.e., the greater of $25,000  or the amount of cash received in the transaction up to $100,000).</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. On December 1, 1990, Individual B contacts his agent, F,  to act as his intermediary in the purchase of an automobile. B gives F  $20,000 and requests F to purchase the automobile in F's name, which F  does. F   prepares the Form 8300 as required under section 6050I, but in the area  designated for the name of the payor, F writes ``confidential.'' Because  F knew at the time the return was filed that it contained incomplete  information, the penalty under paragraph (f)(4) of this section is  imposed for the intentional disregard of the requirement to include  correct information. The amount used in computing the penalty under  paragraph (f)(5) of this section is $20,000 (i.e., the amount required  to be reported on the return with respect to which the payee is not  correctly identified). The amount of the penalty determined under  paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(C) of this section is $25,000 (i.e., the greater of  $25,000 or the amount of cash received in the transaction up to  $100,000).</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. Corporation M deliberately does not include $5,000 of  dividends on a Form 1099-DIV (relating to payments of dividends) on  which a total of $200,000 (including the $5,000 dividends) is required  to be reported under section 6042(a). Because the failure was  deliberate, Corporation M's failure is due to intentional disregard of  the requirement to include correct information. Accordingly, the amount  of the penalty imposed under paragraph (a) is determined under paragraph  (f)(4) of this section. Because the Form 1099-DIV is required to be  filed under section 6042(a), under paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(A) the amount of  the penalty with respect to such failure is 10 percent of the aggregate  dollar amount of the items that were required to be but that were not  reported correctly. Under paragraph (f)(5) of this section, $5,000 is  the difference between the dollar amount reported and the amount  required to be reported correctly. Therefore, the amount of the penalty  is $500 ($5,000 x .10 =$500).</p><p class="depth3">Example 4. Form 8027 requires certain large food and beverage  establishments to report certain information with respect to tips. The  form requires (among other things) that the establishment report its  gross receipts from food and beverage operations. Establishment A, in  intentional disregard of the information reporting requirement, reported  gross receipts of $1,000,000, when the correct amount was $1,500,000.  The significance of the gross receipts reporting requirement is that  section 6053(c)(3)(A) requires an establishment to allocate as tips  among its employees the excess of 8 percent of its gross receipts over  the aggregate amount reported by employees to the establishment as tips  under section 6053(a). A's misstatement of its gross receipts caused A  to show $80,000 on the Form 8027 as 8 percent of its gross receipts,  rather than the correct amount of $120,000. A correctly reported the  amount of tips reported to it by employees under section 6053(a) as  $80,000. Thus A reported the excess of 8 percent of its gross receipts  over tips reported to it as zero, rather than as the correct amount of  $40,000. The requirement of reporting gross receipts is considered  merely a step in the computation of the excess of 8 percent of gross  receipts over tips reported to A under section 6053(a), so that the  penalty for intentional disregard will be $4,000 (i.e., 10 percent of  the difference between the $40,000 required to be reported as the excess  of 8 percent of gross receipts over tips reported under section 6053(a),  and the zero amount actually reported).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Definitions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Information return.
