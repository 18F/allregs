The system must monitor the parameters necessary  to determine the total inactivation ratio, using analytical methods in  Sec.  141.74(a), as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The temperature of the disinfected water must be measured once  per day at each residual disinfectant concentration sampling point  during peak hourly flow.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the system uses chlorine, the pH of the disinfected water  must be measured once per day at each chlorine residual disinfectant  concentration sampling point during peak hourly flow.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The disinfectant contact time(s) (``T'') must be determined  for each day during peak hourly flow.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The residual disinfectant concentration(s) (``C'') of the water  before or at the first customer and prior to each additional point of  disinfection must be measured each day during peak hourly flow.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A PWS that has three years of existing operational data may  submit those data, a profile generated using those data, and a request  that the State approve use of those data in lieu of monitoring under the  provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section not later than March 31,  2000. The State must determine whether these operational data are  substantially equivalent to data collected under the provisions of  paragraph (b)(2) of this section. These data must also be representative  of Giardia lamblia inactivation through the entire treatment plant and  not just of certain treatment segments. Until the State approves this  request, the   system is required to conduct monitoring under the provisions of  paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In addition to the disinfection profile generated under  paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a PWS that has existing operational  data may use those data to develop a disinfection profile for additional  years. Such systems may use these additional yearly disinfection  profiles to develop a benchmark under the provisions of paragraph (c) of  this section. The State must determine whether these operational data  are substantially equivalent to data collected under the provisions of  paragraph (b)(2) of this section. These data must also be representative  of inactivation through the entire treatment plant and not just of  certain treatment segments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The system must calculate the total inactivation ratio as  follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)(B)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Determine one inactivation ratio (CTcalc/CT99.9)  before or at the first customer during peak hourly flow.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Determine successive CTcalc/CT99.9 values,  representing sequential inactivation ratios, between the point of  disinfectant application and a point before or at the first customer  during peak hourly flow. Under this alternative, the system must  calculate the total inactivation ratio by determining (CTcalc/ CT99.9) for each sequence and then adding the (CTcalc/ CT99.9) values together to determine ([Sigma] (CTcalc/ CT99.9)).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the system uses more than one point of disinfectant  application before the first customer, the system must determine the CT  value of each disinfection segment immediately prior to the next point  of disinfectant application, or for the final segment, before or at the  first customer, during peak hourly flow. The (CTcalc/CT99.9)  value of each segment and ([Sigma](CTcalc/CT99.9)) must be  calculated using the method in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The system must determine the total logs of inactivation by  multiplying the value calculated in paragraph (b)(4)(i) or (ii) of this  section by 3.0.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A system that uses either chloramines or ozone for primary  disinfection must also calculate the logs of inactivation for viruses  using a method approved by the State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The system must retain disinfection profile data in graphic  form, as a spreadsheet, or in some other format acceptable to the State  for review as part of sanitary surveys conducted by the State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Disinfection benchmarking. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any system required to develop a  disinfection profile under the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of  this section and that decides to make a significant change to its  disinfection practice must consult with the State prior to making such  change. Significant changes to disinfection practice are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Changes to the point of disinfection;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Changes to the disinfectant(s) used in the treatment plant;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Changes to the disinfection process; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Any other modification identified by the State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> through (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For each year of profiling data collected and calculated under  paragraph (b) of this section, the system must determine the lowest  average monthly Giardia lamblia inactivation in each year of profiling  data. The system must determine the average Giardia lamblia inactivation  for each calendar month for each year of profiling data by dividing the  sum of daily Giardia lamblia of inactivation by the number of values  calculated for that month.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The disinfection benchmark is the lowest monthly average value  (for systems with one year of profiling data) or average of lowest  monthly average values (for systems with more than one year of profiling  data) of the monthly logs of Giardia lamblia inactivation in each year  of profiling data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A system that uses either chloramines or ozone for primary  disinfection must also calculate the disinfection benchmark for viruses  using a method approved by the State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(i)</em>  through (iii) of this section to the State as part of its consultation  process.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A description of the proposed change;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The disinfection profile for Giardia lamblia (and, if  necessary, viruses) under paragraph (b) of this section and benchmark as  required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An analysis of how the proposed change will affect the current  levels of disinfection.
