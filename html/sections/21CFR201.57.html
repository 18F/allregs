Certain contraindications or serious warnings, particularly those that may lead to death or serious injury, may be required by the FDA to be presented in a box. The boxed warning ordinarily must be based on clinical data, but serious animal toxicity may also be the basis of a boxed warning in the absence of clinical data. The box must contain, in uppercase letters, a heading inside the box that includes the word ``WARNING'' and conveys the general focus of the information in the box. The box must briefly explain the risk and refer to more detailed information in the ``Contraindications'' or ``Warnings and Precautions'' section, accompanied by the identifying number for the section or subsection containing the detailed information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> 1 Indications and usage. This section must state that the drug is indicated for the treatment, prevention, mitigation, cure, or diagnosis of a recognized disease or condition, or of a manifestation of a recognized disease or condition, or for the relief of symptoms associated with a recognized disease or condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> This section must include the following information when the conditions listed are applicable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the drug is used for an indication only in conjunction with a primary mode of therapy (e.g., diet, surgery, behavior changes, or some other drug), a statement that the drug is indicated as an adjunct to that mode of therapy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If evidence is available to support the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biological product only in selected subgroups of the larger population (e.g., patients with mild disease or patients in a special age group), or if the indication is approved based on a surrogate endpoint under Sec.  314.510 or Sec.  601.41 of this chapter, a succinct description of the limitations of usefulness of the drug and any uncertainty about anticipated clinical benefits, with reference to the ``Clinical Studies'' section for a discussion of the available evidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If specific tests are necessary for selection or monitoring of the patients who need the drug (e.g., microbe susceptibility tests), the identity of such tests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If information on limitations of use or uncertainty about anticipated clinical benefits is relevant to the recommended intervals between doses, to the appropriate duration of treatment when such treatment should be limited, or to any modification of dosage, a concise description of the information with reference to the more detailed information in the ``Dosage and Administration'' section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> If safety considerations are such that the drug should be reserved for specific situations (e.g., cases refractory to other drugs), a statement of the information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> If there are specific conditions that should be met before the drug is used on a long term basis (e.g., demonstration of responsiveness to the drug in a short term trial in a given patient), a statement of the conditions; or, if the indications for long term use are different from those for short term use, a statement of the specific indications for each use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If there is a common belief that the drug may be effective for a certain use or if there is a common use of the drug for a condition, but the preponderance of evidence related to the use or condition shows that the drug is ineffective or that the therapeutic benefits of the product do not generally outweigh its risks, FDA may require that this section state that there is a lack of evidence that the drug is effective or safe for that use or condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any statements comparing the safety or effectiveness of the drug with other agents for the same indication must, except for biological products, be supported by substantial evidence derived from adequate and well-controlled studies as defined in Sec.  314.126(b) of this chapter unless this requirement is waived under Sec.  201.58 or Sec.  314.126(c) of this chapter. For biological products, such statements must be supported by substantial evidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For drug products other than biological products, all indications listed in this section must be supported by substantial evidence of effectiveness based on adequate and well-controlled studies as defined in Sec.  314.126(b) of this chapter unless the requirement is waived under Sec.  201.58 or Sec.  314.126(c) of this chapter. Indications or uses must not be implied or suggested in other sections of the labeling if not included in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For biological products, all indications listed in this section must be supported by substantial evidence of effectiveness. Indications or uses must not be implied or suggested in other sections of the labeling if not included in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> 2 Dosage and administration. (i) This section must state the recommended dose and, as appropriate:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The dosage range,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An upper limit beyond which safety and effectiveness have not been established, or beyond which increasing the dose does not result in increasing effectiveness,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Dosages for each indication and subpopulation,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The intervals recommended between doses,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The optimal method of titrating dosage,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The usual duration of treatment when treatment duration should be limited,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Dosing recommendations based on clinical pharmacologic data (e.g., clinically significant food effects),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Modification of dosage needed because of drug interactions or in special patient populations (e.g., in children, in geriatric age groups, in groups defined by genetic characteristics, or in patients with renal or hepatic disease),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Important considerations concerning compliance with the dosage regimen,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(J)</em> Efficacious or toxic concentration ranges and therapeutic concentration windows of the drug or its metabolites, if established and clinically significant. Information on therapeutic drug concentration monitoring (TDM) must also be included in this section when TDM is necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Dosing regimens must not be implied or suggested in other sections of the labeling if not included in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Radiation dosimetry information must be stated for both the patient receiving a radioactive drug and the person administering it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> This section must also contain specific direction on dilution, preparation (including the strength of the final dosage solution, when prepared according to instructions, in terms of milligrams of active ingredient per milliliter of reconstituted solution, unless another measure of the strength is more appropriate), and administration of the dosage form, if needed (e.g., the rate of administration of parenteral drug in milligrams per minute; storage conditions for stability of the reconstituted drug, when important; essential information on drug incompatibilities if the drug is mixed in vitro with other drugs or diluents; and the following verbatim statement for parenterals: ``Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.'')</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> 3 Dosage forms and strengths. This section must contain information on the available dosage forms to which the labeling applies and for which the manufacturer or distributor is responsible, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The strength or potency of the dosage form in metric system (e.g., 10 milligram tablets), and, if the apothecary system is used, a statement of the strength in parentheses after the metric designation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A description of the identifying characteristics of the dosage forms, including shape, color, coating, scoring, and imprinting, when applicable. The National Drug Code number(s) for the drug product must not be included in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> 4 Contraindications. This section must describe any situations in which the drug should not be used because the risk of use (e.g., certain potentially fatal adverse reactions) clearly outweighs any possible therapeutic benefit. Those situations include use of the drug in patients who, because of their particular age, sex, concomitant therapy, disease state, or other condition, have a substantial risk of being harmed by the drug and for whom no potential benefit makes the risk acceptable. Known hazards and not theoretical possibilities must be listed (e.g., if severe hypersensitivity to the drug has not been demonstrated, it should not be listed as a contraindication). If no contraindications are known, this section must state ``None.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> 5 Warnings and precautions. (i) General. This section must describe clinically significant adverse reactions (including any that are potentially fatal, are serious even if infrequent, or can be prevented or mitigated through appropriate use of the drug), other potential safety hazards (including those that are expected for the pharmacological class or those resulting from drug/drug interactions), limitations in use imposed by them (e.g., avoiding certain concomitant therapy), and steps that should be taken if they occur (e.g., dosage modification). The frequency of all clinically significant adverse reactions and the approximate

mortality and morbidity rates for patients experiencing the reaction, if known and necessary for the safe and effective use of the drug, must be expressed as provided under paragraph (c)(7) of this section. In accordance with Sec. Sec.  314.70 and 601.12 of this chapter, the labeling must be revised to include a warning about a clinically significant hazard as soon as there is reasonable evidence of a causal association with a drug; a causal relationship need not have been definitely established. A specific warning relating to a use not provided for under the ``Indications and Usage'' section may be required by FDA in accordance with sections 201(n) and 502(a) of the act if the drug is commonly prescribed for a disease or condition and such usage is associated with a clinically significant risk or hazard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Other special care precautions. This section must contain information regarding any special care to be exercised by the practitioner for safe and effective use of the drug (e.g., precautions not required under any other specific section or subsection).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Monitoring: Laboratory tests. This section must identify any laboratory tests helpful in following the patient's response or in identifying possible adverse reactions. If appropriate, information must be provided on such factors as the range of normal and abnormal values expected in the particular situation and the recommended frequency with which tests should be performed before, during, and after therapy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Interference with laboratory tests. This section must briefly note information on any known interference by the product with laboratory tests and reference the section where the detailed information is presented (e.g., ``Drug Interactions'' section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> 6 Adverse reactions. This section must describe the overall adverse reaction profile of the drug based on the entire safety database. For purposes of prescription drug labeling, an adverse reaction is an undesirable effect, reasonably associated with use of a drug, that may occur as part of the pharmacological action of the drug or may be unpredictable in its occurrence. This definition does not include all adverse events observed during use of a drug, only those adverse events for which there is some basis to believe there is a causal relationship between the drug and the occurrence of the adverse event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Listing of adverse reactions. This section must list the adverse reactions that occur with the drug and with drugs in the same pharmacologically active and chemically related class, if applicable. The list or lists must be preceded by the information necessary to interpret the adverse reactions (e.g., for clinical trials, total number exposed, extent and nature of exposure).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Categorization of adverse reactions. Within a listing, adverse reactions must be categorized by body system, by severity of the reaction, or in order of decreasing frequency, or by a combination of these, as appropriate. Within a category, adverse reactions must be listed in decreasing order of frequency. If frequency information cannot be reliably determined, adverse reactions must be listed in decreasing order of severity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Clinical trials experience. This section must list the adverse reactions identified in clinical trials that occurred at or above a specified rate appropriate to the safety database. The rate of occurrence of an adverse reaction for the drug and comparators (e.g., placebo) must be presented, unless such data cannot be determined or presentation of comparator rates would be misleading. If adverse reactions that occurred below the specified rate are included, they must be included in a separate listing. If comparative rates of occurrence cannot be reliably determined (e.g., adverse reactions were observed only in the uncontrolled trial portion of the overall safety database), adverse reactions must be grouped within specified frequency ranges as appropriate to the safety database for the drug (e.g., adverse reactions occurring at a rate of less than 1/100, adverse reactions occurring at a rate of less than 1/500) or descriptively identified,

if frequency ranges cannot be determined. For adverse reactions with significant clinical implications, the listings must be supplemented with additional detail about the nature, frequency, and severity of the adverse reaction and the relationship of the adverse reaction to drug dose and demographic characteristics, if data are available and important.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Postmarketing experience. This section of the labeling must list the adverse reactions, as defined in paragraph (c)(7) of this section, that are identified from domestic and foreign spontaneous reports. This listing must be separate from the listing of adverse reactions identified in clinical trials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Comparisons of adverse reactions between drugs. For drug products other than biological products, any claim comparing the drug to which the labeling applies with other drugs in terms of frequency, severity, or character of adverse reactions must be based on adequate and well-controlled studies as defined in Sec.  314.126(b) of this chapter unless this requirement is waived under Sec.  201.58 or Sec.  314.126(c) of this chapter. For biological products, any such claim must be based on substantial evidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> 7 Drug interactions. (i) This section must contain a description of clinically significant interactions, either observed or predicted, with other prescription or over-the-counter drugs, classes of drugs, or foods (e.g., dietary supplements, grapefruit juice), and specific practical instructions for preventing or managing them. The mechanism(s) of the interaction, if known, must be briefly described. Interactions that are described in the ``Contraindications'' or ``Warnings and Precautions'' sections must be discussed in more detail under this section. Details of drug interaction pharmacokinetic studies that are included in the ``Clinical Pharmacology'' section that are pertinent to clinical use of the drug must not be repeated in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> This section must also contain practical guidance on known interference of the drug with laboratory tests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> 8 Use in specific populations. This section must contain the following subsections:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 8.1 Pregnancy. This subsection of the labeling must contain the following information in the following order under the subheadings ``Pregnancy Exposure Registry,'' ``Risk Summary,'' ``Clinical Considerations,'' and ``Data'':</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Pregnancy exposure registry. If there is a scientifically acceptable pregnancy exposure registry for the drug, contact information needed to enroll in the registry or to obtain information about the registry must be provided following the statement: ``There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to (name of drug) during pregnancy.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Risk summary. The Risk Summary must contain risk statement(s) based on data from all relevant sources (human, animal, and/or pharmacologic) that describe, for the drug, the risk of adverse developmental outcomes (i.e., structural abnormalities, embryo-fetal and/or infant mortality, functional impairment, alterations to growth). When multiple data sources are available, the statements must be presented in the following order: Human, animal, pharmacologic. The source(s) of the data must be stated. The labeling must state the percentage range of live births in the United States with a major birth defect and the percentage range of pregnancies in the United States that end in miscarriage, regardless of drug exposure. If such information is available for the population(s) for which the drug is labeled, it must also be included. When use of a drug is contraindicated during pregnancy, this information must be stated first in the Risk Summary. When applicable, risk statements as described in paragraphs (c)(9)(i)(B)(1) and (2) of this section must include a cross-reference to additional details in the relevant portion of the ``Data'' subheading in the ``Pregnancy'' subsection of the labeling. If data demonstrate that a drug is not systemically absorbed following a particular route of administration, the Risk Summary must contain only the following statement: ``(Name of drug) is not absorbed systemically following (route of administration), and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Risk statement based on human data. When human data are available that establish the presence or absence of any adverse developmental outcome(s) associated with maternal use of the drug, the Risk Summary must summarize the specific developmental outcome(s); their incidence; and the effects of dose, duration of exposure, and gestational timing of exposure. If human data indicate that there is an increased risk for a specific adverse developmental outcome in infants born to women exposed to the drug during pregnancy, this risk must be quantitatively compared to the risk for the same outcome in infants born to women who were not exposed to the drug but who have the disease or condition for which the drug is indicated to be used. When risk information is not available for women with the disease or condition for which the drug is indicated, the risk for the specific outcome must be compared to the rate at which the outcome occurs in the general population. The Risk Summary must state when there are no human data or when available human data do not establish the presence or absence of drug-associated risk.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Risk statement based on animal data. When animal data are available, the Risk Summary must summarize the findings in animals and based on these findings, describe, for the drug, the potential risk of any adverse developmental outcome(s) in humans. This statement must include: The number and type(s) of species affected, timing of exposure, animal doses expressed in terms of human dose or exposure equivalents, and outcomes for pregnant animals and offspring. When animal studies do not meet current standards for nonclinical developmental toxicity studies, the Risk Summary must so state. When there are no animal data, the Risk Summary must so state.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Risk statement based on pharmacology. When the drug has a well-understood mechanism of action that may result in adverse developmental outcome(s), the Risk Summary must explain the mechanism of action and the potential associated risks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Clinical considerations. Under the subheading ``Clinical Considerations,'' the labeling must provide relevant information, to the extent it is available, under the headings ``Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk,'' ``Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period,'' ``Maternal adverse reactions,'' ``Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions,'' and ``Labor or delivery'':</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk. If there is a serious known or potential risk to the pregnant woman and/or the embryo/fetus associated with the disease or condition for which the drug is indicated to be used, the labeling must describe the risk.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period. If there are pharmacokinetic data that support dose adjustment(s) during pregnancy and the postpartum period, a summary of this information must be provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Maternal adverse reactions. If use of the drug is associated with a maternal adverse reaction that is unique to pregnancy or if a known adverse reaction occurs with increased frequency or severity in pregnant women, the labeling must describe the adverse reaction and available intervention(s) for monitoring or mitigating the reaction. The labeling must describe, if known, the effect of dose, timing, and duration of exposure on the risk to the pregnant woman of experiencing the adverse reaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions. If it is known or anticipated that treatment of the pregnant woman increases or may increase the risk of an adverse reaction in the fetus or neonate, the labeling must describe the adverse reaction, the potential severity and reversibility of the adverse reaction, and available intervention(s) for monitoring or mitigating the reaction. The labeling must describe, if known, the effect of dose, timing, and duration of exposure on the risk.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Labor or delivery. If the drug is expected to affect labor or delivery, the labeling must provide information about the effect of the drug on the pregnant woman and the fetus or neonate; the effect of the drug on the

duration of labor and delivery; any increased risk of adverse reactions, including their potential severity and reversibility; and must provide information about available intervention(s) that can mitigate these effects and/or adverse reactions. The information described under this heading is not required for drugs approved for use only during labor and delivery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Data--(1) ``Data'' subheading. Under the subheading ``Data,'' the labeling must describe the data that are the basis for the Risk Summary and Clinical Considerations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Human and animal data headings. Human and animal data must be presented separately, beneath the headings ``Human Data'' and ``Animal Data,'' and human data must be presented first.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Description of human data. For human data, the labeling must describe adverse developmental outcomes, adverse reactions, and other adverse effects. To the extent applicable, the labeling must describe the types of studies or reports, number of subjects and the duration of each study, exposure information, and limitations of the data. Both positive and negative study findings must be included.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Description of animal data. For animal data, the labeling must describe the following: Types of studies, animal species, dose, duration and timing of exposure, study findings, presence or absence of maternal toxicity, and limitations of the data. Description of maternal and offspring findings must include dose-response and severity of adverse developmental outcomes. Animal doses or exposures must be described in terms of human dose or exposure equivalents and the basis for those calculations must be included.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 8.2 Lactation. This subsection of the labeling must contain the following information in the following order under the subheadings ``Risk Summary,'' ``Clinical Considerations,'' and ``Data'':</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Risk summary. When relevant human and/or animal lactation data are available, the Risk Summary must include a cross-reference to the ``Data'' subheading in the ``Lactation'' subsection of the labeling. When human data are available, animal data must not be included unless the animal model is specifically known to be predictive for humans. When use of a drug is contraindicated during breastfeeding, this information must be stated first in the Risk Summary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Drug not absorbed systemically. If data demonstrate that the drug is not systemically absorbed by the mother, the Risk Summary must contain only the following statement: ``(Name of drug) is not absorbed systemically by the mother following (route of administration), and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to (name of drug).''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Drug absorbed systemically.

The ``Pediatric use'' subsection must cite any limitations on the pediatric indication, need for specific monitoring, specific hazards associated with use of the drug in any subsets of the pediatric population (e.g., neonates), differences between pediatric and adult responses to the drug, and other information related to the safe and effective pediatric use of the drug. Data summarized in this subsection should be discussed in more detail, if appropriate, under the ``Clinical Pharmacology'' or ``Clinical Studies'' section. As appropriate, this information must also be contained in the ``Contraindications'' and/or ``Warnings and Precautions'' section(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If there are specific statements on pediatric use of the drug for an indication also approved for adults that are based on adequate and well-controlled studies in the pediatric population, they must be summarized in the ``Pediatric use'' subsection and discussed in more detail, if appropriate, under the ``Clinical Pharmacology'' and

``Clinical Studies'' sections. Appropriate pediatric dosage must be given under the ``Dosage and Administration'' section. The ``Pediatric use'' subsection of the labeling must also cite any limitations on the pediatric use statement, need for specific monitoring, specific hazards associated with use of the drug in any subsets of the pediatric population (e.g., neonates), differences between pediatric and adult responses to the drug, and other information related to the safe and effective pediatric use of the drug. As appropriate, this information must also be contained in the ``Contraindications'' and/or ``Warnings and Precautions'' section(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)(1)</em> When a drug is approved for pediatric use based on adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with other information supporting pediatric use, the ``Pediatric use'' subsection of the labeling must contain either the following statement or a reasonable alternative:</p><p class="depth0">The safety and effectiveness of (drug name) have been established in the age groups ------ to ------ (note any limitations, e.g., no data for pediatric patients under 2, or only applicable to certain indications approved in adults). Use of (drug name) in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of (drug name) in adults with additional data (insert wording that accurately describes the data submitted to support a finding of substantial evidence of effectiveness in the pediatric population).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Data summarized in the preceding prescribed statement in this subsection must be discussed in more detail, if appropriate, under the ``Clinical Pharmacology'' or the ``Clinical Studies'' section. For example, pediatric pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies and dose response information should be described in the ``Clinical Pharmacology'' section. Pediatric dosing instructions must be included in the ``Dosage and Administration'' section. Any differences between pediatric and adult responses, need for specific monitoring, dosing adjustments, and any other information related to safe and effective use of the drug in pediatric patients must be cited briefly in the ``Pediatric use'' subsection and, as appropriate, in the ``Contraindications,'' ``Warnings and Precautions,'' and ``Dosage and Administration'' sections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> If the requirements for a finding of substantial evidence to support a pediatric indication or a pediatric use statement have not been met for a particular pediatric population, the ``Pediatric use'' subsection must contain an appropriate statement such as ``Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of (----) have not been established.'' If use of the drug in this pediatric population is associated with a specific hazard, the hazard must be described in this subsection, or, if appropriate, the hazard must be stated in the ``Contraindications'' or ``Warnings and Precautions'' section and this subsection must refer to it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> If the requirements for a finding of substantial evidence to support a pediatric indication or a pediatric use statement have not been met for any pediatric population, this subsection must contain the following statement: ``Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.'' If use of the drug in premature or neonatal infants, or other pediatric subgroups, is associated with a specific hazard, the hazard must be described in this subsection, or, if appropriate, the hazard must be stated in the ``Contraindications'' or ``Warnings and Precautions'' section and this subsection must refer to it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> If the sponsor believes that none of the statements described in paragraphs (c)(9)(iv)(B) through (c)(9)(iv)(F) of this section are appropriate or relevant to the labeling of a particular drug, the sponsor must provide reasons for omission of the statements and may propose alternative statement(s). FDA may permit use of an alternative statement if FDA determines that no statement described in those paragraphs is appropriate or relevant to the drug's labeling and that the alternative statement is accurate and appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> If the drug product contains one or more inactive ingredients that present an increased risk of toxic effects to neonates or other pediatric subgroups, a special note of this risk must be made, generally in the ``Contraindications'' or ``Warnings and Precautions'' section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> 8.5 Geriatric use. (A) A specific geriatric indication, if any, that is supported by adequate and well-controlled studies in the geriatric population must be described under the ``Indications and Usage'' section, and appropriate geriatric dosage must be stated under the ``Dosage and Administration'' section. The ``Geriatric use'' subsection must cite any limitations on the geriatric indication, need for specific monitoring, specific hazards associated with the geriatric indication, and other information related to the safe and effective use of the drug in the geriatric population. Unless otherwise noted, information contained in the ``Geriatric use'' subsection must pertain to use of the drug in persons 65 years of age and older. Data summarized in this subsection must be discussed in more detail, if appropriate, under ``Clinical Pharmacology'' or the ``Clinical Studies'' section.

This information includes detailed results from controlled studies that are available to the sponsor and pertinent information from well-documented studies obtained from a literature search. Controlled studies include those that are part of the marketing application and other relevant studies available to the sponsor that have not been previously submitted in the investigational new drug application, new drug application, biologics license application, or a supplement or amendment to one of these applications (e.g., postmarketing studies or adverse drug reaction reports). The ``Geriatric use'' subsection must contain the following statement(s) or reasonable alternative, as applicable, taking into account available information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified such differences, the ``Geriatric use'' subsection must include the following statement:</p><p class="depth0">Clinical studies of (name of drug) did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If clinical studies (including studies that are part of marketing applications and other relevant studies available to the sponsor that have not been submitted in the sponsor's applications) included enough elderly subjects to make it likely that differences in safety or effectiveness between elderly and younger subjects would have been detected, but no such differences (in safety or effectiveness) were observed, and other reported clinical experience has not identified such differences, the ``Geriatric use'' subsection must contain the following statement:</p><p class="depth0">Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of (name of drug), ---- percent were 65 and over, while ---- percent were 75 and over. (Alternatively, the labeling may state the total number of subjects included in the studies who were 65 and over and 75 and over.) No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If evidence from clinical studies and other reported clinical experience available to the sponsor indicates that use of the drug in elderly patients is associated with differences in safety or effectiveness, or requires specific monitoring or dosage adjustment, the

``Geriatric use'' subsection must contain a brief description of observed differences or specific monitoring or dosage requirements and, as appropriate, must refer to more detailed discussions in the ``Contraindications,'' ``Warnings and Precautions,'' ``Dosage and Administration,'' or other sections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)(1)</em> If specific pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies have been carried out in the elderly, they must be described briefly in the ``Geriatric use'' subsection and in detail under the ``Clinical Pharmacology'' section. The ``Clinical Pharmacology'' and ``Drug Interactions'' sections ordinarily contain information on drug/disease and drug/drug interactions that is particularly relevant to the elderly, who are more likely to have concomitant illness and to use concomitant drugs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If a drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, the ``Geriatric use'' subsection must include the statement:</p><p class="depth0">This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If use of the drug in the elderly appears to cause a specific hazard, the hazard must be described in the ``Geriatric use'' subsection, or, if appropriate, the hazard must be stated in the ``Contraindications'' or ``Warnings and Precautions'' section, and the ``Geriatric use'' subsection must refer to those sections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Labeling under paragraphs (c)(9)(v)(A) through (c)(9)(v)(C) of this section may include statements, if they are necessary for safe and effective use of the drug, and reflect good clinical practice or past experience in a particular situation, e.g., for a sedating drug, it could be stated that:</p><p class="depth0">Sedating drugs may cause confusion and over-sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of (name of drug) and observed closely.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> If the sponsor believes that none of the requirements described in paragraphs (c)(9)(v)(A) through (c)(9)(v)(E) of this section are appropriate or relevant to the labeling of a particular drug, the sponsor must provide reasons for omission of the statements and may propose an alternative statement. FDA may permit omission of the statements if FDA determines that no statement described in those paragraphs is appropriate or relevant to the drug's labeling. FDA may permit use of an alternative statement if the agency determines that such statement is accurate and appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Additional subsections. Additional subsections may be included, as appropriate, if sufficient data are available concerning the use of the drug in other specified subpopulations (e.g., renal or hepatic impairment).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> 9 Drug abuse and dependence. This section must contain the following information, as appropriate:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 9.1 Controlled substance. If the drug is controlled by the Drug Enforcement Administration, the schedule in which it is controlled must be stated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 9.2 Abuse. This subsection must state the types of abuse that can occur with the drug and the adverse reactions pertinent to them, and must identify particularly susceptible patient populations.
