(See subparts 2621 and 2622)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The filing of an application and publication of the notice of the filing of an application in the Federal Register for the purchase of Federally-owned mineral interests under section 209 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1719) segregates the lands for a period of 2 years from the date of the publication of the notice of filing of the application with the authorized officer. (See part 2720)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The filing of an application for an airport lease under the Act of May 24, 1928, as amended (49 U.S.C. Appendix 211-213), or the filing of a request for an airport conveyance under the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 (49 U.S.C. 2215), segregates the lands as of the date of filing with the authorized officer.

In addition, the Bureau of Land Management may also segregate lands that it identifies for potential rights-of-way for electricity generation from wind or solar sources when initiating a competitive process for solar or wind development on particular lands. Upon segregation, such lands will not be subject to appropriation under the public land laws, including location under the Mining Law of 1872, (30 U.S.C. 22 et seq.), but would remain open under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.) or the Materials Act of 1947 (30 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). The BLM will effect a segregation by publishing a Federal Register notice that includes a description of the lands being segregated. The BLM may effect segregation in this way for both pending and new right-of-way applications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Bureau of Land Management may segregate, if it finds it necessary for the orderly administration of the public lands, lands included in a right-of-way application under 43 CFR subpart 2804 for the generation of electrical energy from wind or solar sources.

If the State Director determines an extension is necessary, the Bureau of Land Management will extend the segregation for up to 2 years by publishing a notice in the Federal Register, prior to the expiration of the

initial segregation period. Segregations under this part may only be extended once and the total segregation period may not exceed 4 years.
