The notice must set forth the reason for the  denial and give the employee a reasonable amount of time to respond. The  notice must be made no later than the date of separation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the employee is being removed under the authority of part 752  of this chapter (or other law, Executive Order, or regulation that  prescribes procedures for removing employees because of misconduct), the  notification requirement of paragraph (a)(1) of this section may be  combined with the notification requirement of such authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Employee's response. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employee must be allowed a  reasonable time for response, but not less than 7 days. The employee may  respond orally or in writing and is entitled to be represented by an  attorney or other representative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The agency must designate an official to hear the employee's  oral answer who has the authority either to make or recommend a final  decision on the denial. The right to answer orally does not include the  right to a formal hearing with examination of witnesses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Final decision. If the employee responds to the notice of  denial, the employing office must issue a final decision in writing that  fully sets forth its findings and conclusions.
