The Panel shall decide mandatory declassification review appeals as promptly as possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notification to appellant. The Chairman of the Appeals Review Panel shall notify the appellant in writing of the Panel's decision on the appeal. When the decision is to uphold the denial, the Chairman shall include in his notification the reasons therefore. The appellant shall be advised that the decision of the Panel represents the final decision of the Department and of the right to seek judicial review of the Panel's decision, when applicable. In mandatory declassification review appeals, the Panel shall advise the requester of the right to appeal the decision to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel under Sec. 3.5(d) of E.O. 12958.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Procedures in Privacy Act amendment cases.

When information that is the subject of a statement of dispute filed by an individual is subsequently disclosed, the Department will note that the information is disputed and provide a copy of the individual's statement. The Department may also include a brief summary of reasons for not amending the record when disclosing disputed information. Copies of the Department's statement shall be treated as part of the individual's record for granting access; however, it will not be subject to amendment by an individual under these regulations.</p>
