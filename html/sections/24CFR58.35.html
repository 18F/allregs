required, except in extraordinary circumstances (see Sec. 58.2(a)(3)) in which a normally excluded activity may have a significant impact. Compliance with the other applicable Federal environmental laws and authorities listed in Sec. 58.5 is required for any categorical exclusion listed in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Categorical exclusions subject to Sec. 58.5.

The Department has determined that the following categorically excluded activities would not alter any conditions that would require a review or compliance determination under the Federal laws and authorities cited in Sec. 58.5. When the following kinds of activities are undertaken, the responsible entity does not have to publish a NOI/RROF or execute a certification and the recipient does not have to submit a RROF to HUD (or the State) except in the circumstances described in paragraph (c) of this section. Following the award of the assistance, no further approval from HUD or the State will be needed with respect to environmental requirements, except where paragraph (c) of this section applies.

If a responsible entity determines that an activity or project identified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, because of extraordinary circumstances and conditions at or affecting the location of the activity or project, may have a significant environmental effect, it shall comply with all the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Environmental Review Record (ERR) must contain a well organized written record of the process and determinations made under this section.
