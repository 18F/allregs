You may certify hand-startable, air-cooled, direct injection engines below 8 kW to an optional Tier 4 PM standard of 0.60 g/kW-hr. The term hand-startable generally refers to engines that are started using a hand crank or pull cord. This PM standard applies to both steady-state and transient testing, as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. Engines certified under this paragraph (c) may not be used to generate PM or NOX+NMHC emission credits under the provisions of subpart H of this part. These engines may use PM or NOX+NMHC emission credits, subject to the FEL caps in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Averaging, banking, and trading. You may generate or use emission credits under the averaging, banking, and trading (ABT) program, as described in subpart H of this part. This requires that you specify a family emission limit (FEL) for each pollutant you include in the ABT program for each engine family. These FELs serve as the emission standards for the engine family with respect to all required testing instead of the standards specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. The FELs determine the not-to-exceed standards for your engine family, as specified in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Primary FEL caps.

You must choose one set for each engine family

and must identify your choice of ambient operating regions in each application for certification for an engine family. You may choose separately for each engine family. Choose one of the following ambient operating regions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All altitudes less than or equal to 5,500 feet above sea level during all ambient temperature and humidity conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All altitudes less than or equal to 5,500 feet above sea level, for temperatures less than or equal to the temperature determined by the following equation at the specified altitude:

The exhaust emission standards in this section apply for engines using the fuel type on which the engines in the engine family are designed to operate, except for engines certified under Sec.  1039.615. For engines certified under Sec.  1039.615, the standards of this section apply to emissions measured using the specified test fuel. You must meet the numerical emission standards for NMHC in this section based on the following types of hydrocarbon emissions for engines powered by the following fuels:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Alcohol-fueled engines: THCE emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Other engines: NMHC emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Useful life.

We may approve a shorter useful life, in hours of engine operation but not in years, if we determine that these engines will rarely operate longer than the shorter useful life. If engines identical to those in the engine family have already been produced and are in use, your demonstration must include documentation from such in-use engines. In other cases, your demonstration must include an engineering analysis of information equivalent to such in-use data, such as data from research engines or similar engine models that are

already in production. Your demonstration must also include any overhaul interval that you recommend, any mechanical warranty that you offer for the engine or its components, and any relevant customer design specifications. Your demonstration may include any other relevant information. The useful life value may not be shorter than any of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 1,000 hours of operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Your recommended overhaul interval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Your mechanical warranty for the engine.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Applicability for testing. The emission standards in this subpart apply to all testing, including certification, selective enforcement audits, and in-use testing. For selective enforcement audits, we will require you to perform duty-cycle testing as specified in Sec. Sec.  1039.505 and 1039.510. The NTE standards of this section apply for those tests. We will not direct you to do additional testing under a selective enforcement audit to show that your engines meet the NTE standards.
