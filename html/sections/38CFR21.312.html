                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. VA will consider that a veteran with reduced work tolerance is pursuing a rehabilitation program full-time when the amount of time the veteran is devoting to his or her program is as great as the effects of his or her disability (service and nonservice-connected) will permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Pursuit of a program. A veteran with reduced work tolerance may pursue a rehabilitation program when the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reduced work tolerance has been determined.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Achievement of the goals of the program are reasonably feasible;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The IWRP (Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan) or other plan provides for completion of the program under Chapter 31.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Redetermination of work tolerance. As necessary, but not less than once yearly, the veteran's work tolerance will be reevaluated. The rate of pursuit required to meet the standard of full-time pursuit will be modified if there is either an increase or decrease in the work tolerance of the veteran.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Payment of allowance. A veteran with a reduced work tolerance will be paid a subsistence allowance, at the full-time rate for the type of program being pursued, when the veteran meets the standard for full-time pursuit established for him or her in the Plan. A veteran with reduced work tolerance, who elects benefits at the Chapter 34 rate, will have to meet normal attendance requirements for that chapter, however.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Determining work tolerance. A VA physician will make all determinations and redeterminations of work tolerance.
