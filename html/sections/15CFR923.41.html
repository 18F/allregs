These are the means by which the state   will enforce its coastal management policies. (See section 304(6a) of  the Act.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The state chosen agency or agencies (including local  governments, area-wide agencies, regional agencies, or interstate  agencies) must have the authority for the management of the coastal  zone. Such authority includes the following powers:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To administer land use and water use regulations to control  development to ensure compliance with the management program, and to  resolve conflicts among competing uses; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To acquire fee simple and less than fee simple interests in  land, waters, and other property through condemnation or other means  when necessary to achieve conformance with the management program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In order to meet these requirements, the program must identify  relevant state constitutional provisions, statutes, regulations, case  law and such other legal instruments (including executive orders and  interagency agreements) that will be used to carry out the state's  management program, including the authorities pursuant to sections  306(d)(10) and 306(d)(11) of the Act which require a state to have the  ability to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Administer land and water use regulations in conformance with  the policies of the management program;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Control such development as is necessary to ensure compliance  with the management program;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Resolve conflicts among competing uses; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Acquire appropriate interest in lands, waters or other property  as necessary to achieve management objectives. Where acquisition will be  a necessary technique for accomplishing particular program policies and  objectives, the management program must indicate for what purpose  acquisition will be used (i.e., what policies or objectives will be  accomplished); the type of acquisition (e.g., fee simple, purchase of  easements, condemnation); and what agency (or agencies) of government  have the authority for the specified type of acquisition.</p>
