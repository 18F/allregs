                                Sec.  1515.5  Appeal of Initial Determination of Threat Assessment
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section applies to applicants appealing from an Initial Determination of Threat Assessment that was based on one or more of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> TSA has determined that an applicant for an HME or a TWIC has a disqualifying criminal offense described in 49 CFR 1572.103.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> TSA has determined that an applicant for an HME or a TWIC does not meet the immigration status requirements as described in 49 CFR 1572.105.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> TSA has determined that an applicant for an HME or a TWIC is lacking mental capacity as described in 49 CFR 1572.109.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Grounds for appeal. An applicant may appeal an Initial Determination of

Threat Assessment if the applicant is asserting that he or she meets the standards for the security threat assessment for which he or she is applying.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Initiating an appeal. An applicant initiates an appeal by submitting a written reply to TSA, a written request for materials from TSA, or by requesting an extension of time in accordance with Sec.  1515.5(f). If the applicant does not initiate an appeal within 60 days of receipt, the Initial Determination of Threat Assessment becomes a Final Determination of Threat Assessment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of an HME, TSA also serves a Final Determination of Threat Assessment on the licensing State.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a mariner applying for TWIC, TSA also serves a Final Determination of Threat Assessment on the Coast Guard.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of a TWIC, TSA serves a Final Determination of Threat Assessment on the appropriate Federal Maritime Security Coordinator (FMSC).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Request for materials. Within 60 days of the date of service of the Initial Determination of Threat Assessment, the applicant may serve upon TSA a written request for copies of the materials upon which the Initial Determination was based.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> TSA response. (i) Within 60 days of receiving the applicant's request for materials, TSA serves the applicant with copies of the releasable materials upon the applicant on which the Initial Determination was based. TSA will not include any classified information or other protected information described in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Within 60 days of receiving the applicant's request for materials, TSA serves the applicant with copies of the releasable materials upon the applicant on which the Initial Determination was based. TSA will not include any classified information or other protected information described in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Within 60 days of receiving the applicant's request for materials or written reply, TSA may request additional information or documents from the applicant that TSA believes are necessary to make a Final Determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Correction of records. If the Initial Determination of Threat Assessment was based on a record that the applicant believes is erroneous, the applicant may correct the record, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The applicant contacts the jurisdiction or entity responsible for the information and attempts to correct or complete information contained in his or her record.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The applicant provides TSA with the revised record, or a certified true copy of the information from the appropriate entity, before TSA determines that the applicant meets the standards for the security threat assessment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Reply. (i) The applicant may serve upon TSA a written reply to the Initial Determination of Threat Assessment within 60 days of service of the Initial Determination, or 60 days after the date of service of TSA's response to the applicant's request for materials under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if the applicant served such request. The reply must include the rationale and information on which the applicant disputes TSA's Initial Determination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The applicant may serve upon TSA a written reply to the Initial Determination of Threat Assessment within 60 days of service of the Initial Determination, or 60 days after the date of service of TSA's response to the applicant's request for materials under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if the applicant served such request. The reply must include the rationale and information on which the applicant disputes TSA's Initial Determination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In an applicant's reply, TSA will consider only material that is relevant to whether the applicant meets the standards applicable for the security threat assessment for which the applicant is applying.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Final determination. Within 60 days after TSA receives the applicant's reply, TSA serves a Final Determination of Threat Assessment or a Withdrawal of the Initial Determination as provided in paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Final Determination of Threat Assessment. (1) If the Assistant Administrator concludes that an HME or TWIC applicant does not meet the standards described in 49 CFR 1572.103, 1572.105, or 1572.109, TSA serves a Final Determination of Threat Assessment upon the applicant. In addition--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the Assistant Administrator concludes that an HME or TWIC applicant does not meet the standards described in 49 CFR 1572.103, 1572.105, or 1572.109, TSA serves a Final Determination of Threat Assessment upon the applicant. In addition--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of an HME, TSA serves a Final Determination of Threat Assessment on the licensing State.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a TWIC, TSA serves a Final Determination of Threat Assessment on the Coast Guard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Final Determination includes a statement that the Assistant Administrator has reviewed the Initial Determination, the applicant's reply and any accompanying information, and any other materials or information available to him or her, and has determined that the applicant poses a security threat warranting denial of the security threat assessment for which the applicant has applied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Withdrawal of Initial Determination. If the Assistant Administrator or Assistant Secretary concludes that the applicant does not pose a security threat, TSA serves a Withdrawal of the Initial Determination upon the applicant, and the applicant's employer where applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Nondisclosure of certain information. In connection with the procedures under this section, TSA does not disclose classified information to the applicant, as defined in E.O. 12968 sec. 1.1(d), and reserves the right not to disclose any other information or material not warranting disclosure or protected from disclosure under law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Extension of time. TSA may grant an applicant an extension of time of the limits for good cause shown. An applicant's request for an extension of time must be in writing and be received by TSA within a reasonable time before the due date to be extended; or an applicant may request an extension after the expiration of a due date by sending a written request describing why the failure to file within the time limits was excusable. TSA may grant itself an extension of time for good cause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Judicial review. For purposes of judicial review, the Final Determination of Threat Assessment constitutes a final TSA order of the determination that the applicant does not meet the standards for a security threat assessment, in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 46110. The Final Determination is not a final TSA order to grant or deny a waiver, the procedures for which are in 49 CFR 1515.7 and 1515.11.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Appeal of immediate revocation. If TSA directs an immediate revocation, the applicant may appeal this determination by following the appeal procedures described in paragraph (b) of this section. This applies--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If TSA directs a State to revoke an HME pursuant to 49 CFR 1572.13(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If TSA invalidates a TWIC by issuing an Initial Determination of Threat Assessment and Immediate Revocation pursuant to 49 CFR 1572.21(d)(3).
