The acquisition will be conducted as a two- phased procurement using a progressive competition down-selection  technique between phases. In this technique, two or more contractors  will be selected for Phase</p><p class="depth2">1. It is expected that the single contractor for Phase 2 will be  chosen from among these contractors after a competitive down-selection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Phase 1 is for the _______________ [insert purpose of phase].  Phase 2 is for ______________ [insert general Phase 2 goals].</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The competition for Phase 2 will be based on the results of  Phase 1, and the award criteria for Phase 2 will include successful  completion of Phase 1 requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> NASA does not intend to issue a separate, formal solicitation  for Phase 2. Instead, Phase 2 proposals will be requested from the Phase  1 contractors by means of ___________________ [indicate method of  requesting proposals, e.g., by a letter]. All information required for  preparation of Phase 2 proposals, including the final evaluation  criteria and factors, will be provided at that time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Phase 2 will be synopsized in the Governmentwide Point of Entry  (GPE) in accordance with FAR 5.201 and 5.203 unless one of the  exceptions in FAR 5.202 applies. Notwithstanding NASA's expectation that  only the Phase 1 contractors will be capable of successfully competing  for Phase 2, all proposals will be considered. Any other responsible  source may indicate its desire to submit a proposal by responding to the  Phase 2 synopsis, and NASA will provide that source to all the material  furnished to the Phase 1 contractors that is necessary to submit a  proposal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> To be considered for Phase 2 award, offerors must demonstrate a  design maturity equivalent to that of the Phase 1 contractors. This,  demonstration shall include the following Phase 1 deliverables upon  which Phase 2 award will be based: ________________ [insert the specific  Phase 1 deliverables]. Failure to fully and completely demonstrate the  appropriate level of design maturity may render the proposal  unacceptable with no further consideration for contract award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The following draft Phase 2 evaluation factors are provided for  your information. Please note that these evaluation factors are not  final, and NASA reserves the right to change them at any time up to and  including the date upon which Phase 2 proposals are requested. Any such  changes in evaluation factors will not necessitate issuance of a new,  formal solicitation for Phase 2.</p><p class="depth2">[Insert draft Phase 2 evaluation factors (and subfactors, if  available), including demonstration of successful completion of Phase 1  requirements.]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Although NASA will request Phase 2 proposals from Phase 1  contractors, submission of the Phase 2 proposal is not a requirement of  the Phase 1 contract. Accordingly, the costs of preparing these  proposals shall not be a direct charge to the Phase 1 contract or any  other Government contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> The anticipated schedule for conducting this phased procurement  is provided for your information. These dates are projections only and  are not intended to commit NASA to complete a particular action at a  given time. [Insert dates below].
