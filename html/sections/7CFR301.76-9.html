                            <p class="depth0">All nursery stock intended for interstate movement for immediate export from an area quarantined for citrus greening, must be inspected by an inspector \8\ no more than 72 hours prior to movement. The person who desires to move the articles interstate must notify the inspector as far in advance of the desired interstate movement as possible. The articles must be inspected at the place and in the manner the inspector designates as necessary

to comply with this subpart. If the inspector has reason to believe that the interstate movement of the articles may lead to the artificial spread of citrus greening or Asian citrus psyllid, he or she may deny issuance of a limited permit for interstate movement of the article or take other remedial measures to prohibit such spread.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\8\ Inspectors are assigned to local offices of APHIS, which are listed in local telephone directories.
