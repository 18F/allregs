                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This subpart specifies measurement instruments and  associated system requirements related to emission testing in a  laboratory or similar environment and in the field. This includes  laboratory instruments and portable emission measurement systems (PEMS)  for measuring engine parameters, ambient conditions, flow-related  parameters, and emission concentrations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Instrument types. You may use any of the specified instruments  as described in this subpart to perform emission tests. If you want to  use one of these instruments in a way that is not specified in this  subpart, or if you want to use a different instrument, you must first  get us to approve your alternate procedure under Sec.  1065.10. Where we  specify more than one instrument for a particular measurement, we may  identify which instrument serves as the reference for comparing with an  alternate procedure. You may generally use instruments with compensation  algorithms that are functions of other gaseous measurements and the  known or assumed fuel properties for the test fuel. The target value for  any compensation algorithm is 0% (that is, no bias high and no bias  low), regardless of the uncompensated signal's bias.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Measurement systems. Assemble a system of measurement  instruments that allows you to show that your engines comply with the  applicable emission standards, using good engineering judgment. When  selecting instruments, consider how conditions such as vibration,  temperature, pressure, humidity, viscosity, specific heat, and exhaust  composition (including trace concentrations) may affect instrument  compatibility and performance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Redundant systems. For all measurement instruments described in  this subpart, you may use data from multiple instruments to calculate  test results for a single test. If you use redundant systems, use good  engineering judgment to use multiple measured values in calculations or  to disregard individual measurements. Note that you must keep your  results from all measurements. This requirement applies whether or not  you actually use the measurements in your calculations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Range. You may use an instrument's response above 100% of its  operating range if this does not affect your ability to show that your  engines comply with the applicable emission standards. Note that we  require additional testing and reporting if an analyzer responds above  100% of its range. Auto-ranging analyzers do not require additional  testing or reporting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Related subparts for laboratory testing. Subpart D of this part  describes how to evaluate the performance of the measurement instruments  in this subpart. In general, if an instrument is specified in a specific  section of this subpart, its calibration and verifications are typically  specified in a similarly numbered section in subpart D of this part. For  example, Sec.  1065.290 gives instrument specifications for PM balances  and Sec.  1065.390 describes the corresponding calibrations and  verifications. Note that some instruments also have other requirements  in other sections of subpart D of this part. Subpart B of this part  identifies specifications for other types of equipment, and subpart H of  this part specifies engine fluids and analytical gases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Field testing and testing with PEMS. Subpart J of this part  describes how to use these and other measurement instruments for field  testing and other PEMS testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Recommended practices. This subpart identifies a variety of  recommended but not required practices for proper measurements. We  believe in most cases it is necessary to follow these recommended  practices for accurate and repeatable measurements. However, we do not  specifically require you to follow these recommended practices to  perform a valid test, as long as you meet the required calibrations and  verifications of measurement systems specified in subpart D of this  part. Similarly, we are not required to follow all recommended  practices, as long as we meet the required calibrations and  verifications. Our decision to follow or not follow a given  recommendation when we perform a test does not depend on whether you  followed it during your testing.
