This paragraph (a) does not supersede  Sec. 80.1141.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A refiner owning a small refinery must submit a verification  letter to EPA containing all of the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The annual average aggregate daily crude oil throughput for the  period January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006 (as determined by  dividing the aggregate throughput for the calendar year by the number  365).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A letter signed by the president, chief operating or chief  executive officer of the company, or his/her designee, stating that the  information contained in the letter is true to the best of his/her  knowledge, and that the refinery was small as of December 31, 2006.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Name, address, phone number, facsimile number, and e-mail  address of a corporate contact person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Verification letters must be submitted by July 1, 2010 to one of  the addresses listed in paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For foreign refiners the small refinery exemption shall be  effective   upon approval, by EPA, of a small refinery application. The application  must contain all of the elements required for small refinery  verification letters (as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section),  must satisfy the provisions of Sec. 80.1465(f) through (i) and (o), and  must be submitted by July 1, 2010 to one of the addresses listed in  paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Small refinery verification letters are not required for those  refiners who have already submitted a complete verification letter under  subpart K of this part 80.

Failure to meet the definition of small refinery for any  calendar year for which an exemption was granted would invalidate the  exemption for that calendar year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> At any time, a refiner with a small refinery exemption under  paragraph (a) of this section may waive that exemption upon notification  to EPA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A refiner's notice to EPA that it intends to waive its small  refinery exemption must be received by November 1 to be effective in the  next compliance year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The waiver will be effective beginning on January 1 of the  following calendar year, at which point the transportation fuel produced  at that refinery will be subject to the renewable fuels standard of  Sec. 80.1405 and the owner or operator of the refinery shall be subject  to all other requirements that apply to obligated parties under this  Subpart M.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The waiver notice must be sent to EPA at one of the addresses  listed in paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A refiner that acquires a refinery from either an approved small  refiner (as defined under Sec. 80.1442(a)) or another refiner with an  approved small refinery exemption under paragraph (a) of this section  shall notify EPA in writing no later than 20 days following the  acquisition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Verification letters under paragraph (b) of this section,  petitions for small refinery hardship extensions under paragraph (e) of  this section, and small refinery exemption waiver notices under  paragraph (f) of this section shall be sent to one of the following  addresses:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For US mail: U.S. EPA, Attn: RFS Program, 6406J, 1200  Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20460.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For overnight or courier services: U.S. EPA, Attn: RFS Program,  6406J, 1310 L Street, NW., 6th floor, Washington, DC 20005.
