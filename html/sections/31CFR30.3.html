                                Sec. 30.3  Q-3: How are the SEOs and most highly compensated employees
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. The SEOs for a year are the ``named executive officers'' who are employees and are identified in the TARP recipient's annual report on Form 10-K or annual meeting proxy statement for that year (reporting the SEOs' compensation for the immediately preceding year). These employees are considered the SEOs throughout that entire year. For purposes of the standards in this part applicable to the most highly compensated employees, the determination of whether an employee is a most highly compensated employee in a current fiscal year looks back to the annual compensation for the last completed fiscal year without regard to whether the compensation is includible in the employee's gross income for Federal income tax purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Compliance. Regardless of when during the current fiscal year the TARP recipient determines the SEOs or the most highly compensated employees, the TARP recipient must ensure that any of the SEOs or employees potentially subject to the requirements in this part for the current fiscal year complies with the requirements in this part as applicable.</p>
