                            <p class="depth0">Institutions conducting research misconduct investigations must:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Time. Begin the investigation within 30 days after determining that an investigation is warranted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice to ORI. Notify the ORI Director of the decision to begin an investigation on or before the date the investigation begins and provide an inquiry report that meets the requirements of Sec.  93.307 and Sec.  93.309.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice to the respondent. Notify the respondent in writing of the allegations within a reasonable amount of time after determining that an investigation is warranted, but before the investigation begins. The institution must give the respondent written notice of any new allegations of research misconduct within a reasonable amount of time of deciding to pursue allegations not addressed during the inquiry or in the initial notice of investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Custody of the records. To the extent they have not already done so at the allegation or inquiry stages, take all reasonable and practical steps to obtain custody of all the research records and evidence needed to conduct the research misconduct proceeding, inventory the records and evidence, and sequester them in a secure manner, except that where the research records or evidence encompass scientific instruments shared by a number of users, custody may be limited to copies of the data or evidence on such instruments, so long as those copies are substantially equivalent to the evidentiary value of the instruments. Whenever possible, the institution must take custody of the records--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Before or at the time the institution notifies the respondent; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whenever additional items become known or relevant to the investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Documentation. Use diligent efforts to ensure that the investigation is thorough and sufficiently documented and includes examination of all research records and evidence relevant to reaching a decision on the merits of the allegations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Ensuring a fair investigation. Take reasonable steps to ensure an impartial and unbiased investigation to the maximum extent practicable, including participation of persons with appropriate scientific expertise who do not have unresolved personal, professional, or financial conflicts of interest with those involved with the inquiry or investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Interviews. Interview each respondent, complainant, and any other available person who has been reasonably identified as having information regarding any relevant aspects of the investigation, including witnesses identified by the respondent, and record or transcribe each interview, provide the recording or transcript to the interviewee for correction, and include the recording or transcript in the record of the investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Pursue leads. Pursue diligently all significant issues and leads discovered

that are determined relevant to the investigation, including any evidence of additional instances of possible research misconduct, and continue the investigation to completion.</p>
