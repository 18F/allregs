                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Allowed net equity shall be computed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Allowed claim. The allowed net equity claim of a customer shall be equal to the aggregate of the funded balances of such customer's net equity claim for each account class plus or minus the adjustments specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Net equity. Net equity means the total claim of a customer against the estate of the debtor based on the commodity contracts held by the debtor for

or on behalf of such customer less any indebtedness of the customer to the debtor. Net equity shall be calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Step 1--Equity determination. Determine the equity balance of each customer account by computing, with respect to such account, the sum of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The ledger balance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The open trade balance; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The current realizable market value, determined as of the close of the market on the last preceding market day, of any securities or other property held by or for the debtor from or for such account, plus accrued interest, if any.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For the purposes of this paragraph (b)(1), the ledger balance of a customer account shall be calculated by adding:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Cash deposited to purchase, margin, guarantee, secure, or settle a commodity contract;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Except as is otherwise provided in this chapter, the cash proceeds of such cash, or of securities or other property referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section held from or for the customer by or for the account of the commodity broker; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Gains realized on trades, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Subtracting from the result:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Losses realized on trades;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Disbursements to or on behalf of the customer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The normal costs attributable to the payment of commissions, brokerage, interest, taxes, storage, transaction fees, insurance and other costs and charges lawfully incurred in connection with the purchase, sale, exercise, or liquidation of any commodity contract in such account. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1), the open trade balance of a customer's account shall be computed by subtracting the unrealized loss in value of the open commodity contracts held by or for such account from the unrealized gain in value of the open commodity contracts held by or for such account. In calculating the ledger balance or open trade balance of any customer, exclude any security futures products, any gains or losses realized on trades in such products, any property received to margin, guarantee or secure such products (including interest thereon or the proceeds thereof), to the extent any of the foregoing are held in a securities account, and any disbursements to or on behalf of such customer in connection with such products or such property held in a securities account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Step 2--Customer determination (aggregation). Aggregate the credit and debit equity balances of all accounts of the same class held by a customer in the same capacity. Paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(xiii) of this section prescribe which accounts must be treated as being held in the same capacity and which accounts must be treated as being held in a separate capacity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(2), all accounts which are maintained with a debtor in a person's name and which, under this paragraph (b)(2), are deemed to be held by that person in its individual capacity shall be deemed to be held in the same capacity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An account maintained with a debtor by a guardian, custodian, or conservator for the benefit of a ward, or for the benefit of a minor under the Uniform Gift to Minors Act, shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from accounts held by such guardian, custodian or conservator in its individual capacity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An account maintained with a debtor in the name of an executor or administrator of an estate shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from accounts held by such executor or administrator in its individual capacity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Subject to paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, an account maintained with a debtor in the name of a decedent, in the name of the decedent's estate, or in the name of the executor or administrator of such estate shall be deemed to be accounts held in the same capacity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> An account maintained with a debtor by a trustee shall be deemed to be held in the individual capacity of the grantor of the trust unless the trust is created by a valid written instrument for a purpose other than avoidance of an offset under the regulations contained in this part. A trust account which is not deemed to be held in the individual capacity of its grantor under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section

shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from accounts held in an individual capacity by the trustee, by the grantor or any successor in interest of the grantor, or by any trust beneficiary, and from accounts held by any other trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> An account maintained with a debtor by a corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from accounts held by the shareholders, partners or members of such corporation, partnership or unincorporated association, if such entity was created for purposes other than avoidance of an offset under the regulations contained in this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> A hedging account of a person shall be deemed to be held in the same capacity as a speculative account of such person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Subject to paragraph (b)(2)(ix) of this section, the futures accounts, leverage accounts, options accounts, foreign futures accounts, delivery accounts (as defined in Sec. 190.05(a)(2)), and cleared swaps accounts of the same person shall not be deemed to be held in separate capacities: Provided, however, that such accounts may be aggregated only in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> An omnibus customer account of a futures commission merchant maintained with a debtor shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from the house account and any other omnibus customer account of such futures commission merchant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> A joint account maintained with the debtor shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from any account held in an individual capacity by the participants in such account, from any account held in an individual capacity by a commodity pool operator or commodity trading advisor for such account, and from any other joint account: Provided, however, That if such account is not transferred in accordance with Sec. 190.06, it shall be deemed to be held in the same capacity as any other joint account held by identical participants and a participant's percentage interest therein shall be deemed to be held in the same capacity as any account held in an individual capacity by such participant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> An account maintained with a debtor in the name of a plan which, on the filing date, has in effect a registration statement in accordance with the requirements of section 1031 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the regulations thereunder shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from an account held in an individual capacity by the plan administrator, any employer, employee, participant, or beneficiary with respect to such plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Except as otherwise provided in this section, an account maintained with a debtor by an agent or nominee for a principal or a beneficial owner shall be deemed to be an account held in the individual capacity of such principal or beneficial owner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> With respect to the cleared swaps account class, each individual customer account within each omnibus customer account referred to in paragraph (ix) of this section shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from each other such individual customer account; subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (xii) of this paragraph (b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiv)</em> Accounts held by a customer in separate capacities shall be deemed to be accounts of different customers. The burden of proving that an account is held in a separate capacity shall be upon the customer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Step 3--Setoffs. (i) The net equity of one customer account may not be offset against the net equity of any other customer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The net equity of one customer account may not be offset against the net equity of any other customer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any obligation which is not required to be included in computing the equity of a customer under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but which is owed by such customer to the debtor must be deducted from any obligation not required to be included in computing the equity of a customer which is owed by such debtor to the customer. If the former amount exceeds the latter, the excess must be deducted from the equity balance of the customer obtained after performing the preceding calculations required by paragraph (b) of this section: Provided, That if the customer owns more than two classes of accounts the excess must be offset against each positive equity balance in the same proportion as that positive

equity balance bears to the total of all positive equity balances of accounts of different classes held by such customer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A negative equity balance obtained with respect to one customer account class must be set off against a positive equity balance in any other account class of such customer held in the same capacity: Provided, That if a customer owns more than two classes of accounts such balance must be offset against each positive equity balance in the same proportion as that positive equity balance bears to the total of all positive equity balances in accounts of different classes held by such customer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> To the extent any indebtedness of the debtor to the customer which is not required to be included in computing the equity of such customer under paragraph (b)(1) of this section exceeds such indebtedness of the customer to the debtor, the customer claim therefor will constitute a general creditor's claim rather than a customer property claim, and the net equity therefor shall be separately calculated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The rules pertaining to separate capacities and permitted setoffs contained in this section must be applied subsequent to the entry of an order for relief; prior to the filing date, the provisions of Sec. 1.22 of this chapter and of sections 4d(a)(2) and 4d(f) of the Act (and, in each case, the regulations promulgated thereunder) shall govern what setoffs are permitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Step 4--Correction for distributions. The value on the date of transfer or distribution of any property transferred or distributed subsequent to the filing date and prior to the primary liquidation data with respect to each class of account held by a customer must be added to the equity obtained for that customer for accounts of that class after performing the steps contained in paragraphs (b)(1)-(3) of this section: Provided, however, That if all accounts for which there are customer claims of record and 100% of the equity pertaining thereto are transferred in accordance with Sec. 190.06 and section 764(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, net equity shall be computed based solely upon those customer claims, if any, filed subsequent to bankruptcy which are not claims of record on the filing date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Step 5--Correction for subsequent events. Compute any adjustments to Steps 1 through 4 of this paragraph (b) required to correct misestimates or errors including, without limitation, corrections for subsequent events such as the liquidation of unliquidated claims at a value different from the estimated value previously used in computing net equity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Step 6--Net equity of accounts which remain open subsequent to the primary liquidation date. If the accounts of a customer contain commodity contracts which remain open subsequent to the primary liquidation date, the trustee must adjust the net equity obtained for that customer pursuant to the steps contained in paragraphs (b) (1) through (5) of this section as provided in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Calculation of funded balance. ``Funded balance'' means a customer's pro rata share of the customer estate with respect to each account class available as of the primary liquidation date for distribution to customers of the same class.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The funded balance of any customer claim shall be computed by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Multiplying the ratio of the amount of the net equity claim less the amounts referred to in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section of such customer for any account class bears to the sum of the net equity claims less the amounts referred to in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section of all customers for accounts of that class by the sum of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The value of the money, securities or property segregated on behalf of all accounts of the same class less the amounts referred to in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The value of any money, securities or property which must be allocated under Sec. 190.08 to customer accounts of the same class; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The amount of any add-back required under paragraph (b)(4) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Then adding 100% of any margin payment made between the entry of the order for relief and the primary liquidation date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Corrections to funded balance. The funded balance must be adjusted, as of the primary liquidation date, to correct for subsequent events including, without limitation:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Added claimants;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Disallowed claims;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Liquidation of unliquidated claims at a value other than their estimated value;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Recovery of property; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Deficits generated by the continued operation of accounts after the primary liquidation date which cannot be fully adjusted under paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Adjustments to funded balance for operations subsequent to the primary liquidation date. If accounts of a customer contain commodity contracts which remain open subsequent to the primary liquidation date, the funded balance for each class must be adjusted until liquidation or transfer of all such open commodity contracts of that customer of the same class, as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Unrealized and realized gains and any receipts of margin with respect thereto must be added to the funded balance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Unrealized and realized losses, and the normal costs attributable to the payment of commissions, brokerage, interest, taxes, storage, transaction fees and other costs and charges lawfully incurred with respect to the maintenance or liquidation of such open commodity contracts, and any distributions must be subtracted from the funded balance; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Subject to claims against the trustee for failure to liquidate, any deficit which is not recovered from the customer on whose behalf it is incurred must be charged against the funded balance of each account which remained open on the date the deficit occurred in the same proportion as the funded balance of each account bears to all the funded balances of all accounts which remained open on that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Valuation. In computing net equity, commodity contracts and other property held by or for a commodity broker must be valued as provided in this paragraph (e): Provided, however, that for all commodity contracts other than those listed in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, if identical commodity contracts, securities, or other property are liquidated on the same date, but cannot be liquidated at the same price, the trustee may use the weighted average of the liquidation prices in computing the net equity of each customer holding such contracts, securities, or property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Commodity Contracts. Unless otherwise specified in this paragraph (e), the value of an open commodity contract shall be equal to the settlement price as calculated by the clearing organization pursuant to its rules: Provided, that such rules must either be submitted to the Commission, pursuant to section 5c(c)(4) of the Act and be approved by the Commission, or such rules must be otherwise approved by the Commission (or its delegate pursuant to Sec. 190.10(d) of this part) prior to their application; Provided, further, that if such contract is transferred its value shall be determined as of the end of the settlement cycle in which it is transferred; and Provided, finally, that if such contract is liquidated, its value shall be equal to the net proceeds of liquidation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Principal contracts. The valuation date of principal contracts which are not transferred shall be the date of the order for relief unless there is specific property which constitutes cover by the principal for the principal contract in which case it shall be the date of liquidation of the cover. For purposes of valuing contracts for which there is no established secondary market:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Cash price series approved by Commission. The market value of the physical commodity which is the subject of a principal contract shall be computed using a cash price series approved by the Commission for use by the dealer option grantor, in the case of dealer options, and by the leverage transaction merchant, in the case of leverage contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> No cash price series approved by Commission. If no applicable cash price series has been submitted to the Commission, or if such a cash price series has been submitted, but has not been approved by the Commission, the market value of the physical commodity which is the subject of a principal contract shall be equal to the lesser of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The market value of the physical commodity as of the close of business on the local cash market most proximate to the debtor's principal place of business; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The spot month settlement price on a designated contract market which trades contracts in that physical commodity most proximate to the debtor's principal place of business: Provided, That where there is more than one local market as described in paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) (A) or (B) of this section, the trustee should use the most active market.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special rule for valuing dealer options. A dealer option which is in-the-money will be deemed to have been exercised for purposes of determining its value which shall be equal to the greater of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The in-the-money amount; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The premium paid for such option divided by the number of days contained in the option period and multiplied by the number of days remaining in such period on the liquidation date: Provided, That in the trustee's sole discretion, the trustee may reduce such value to an amount which does not exceed the average of the premiums recently paid for similar options granted by the same grantor.
Any time value not reflected in this computation claimed by a customer must be treated as a general creditor's claim.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Special rule for valuing leverage contracts. Notwithstanding paragraphs (e)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section, if the records of the debtor are not sufficient to substantiate customer claims for profits and to identify the owners of contracts with losses, the liquidation value of a leverage contract shall be deemed to be an amount equal to the total deposit made by a customer in respect to such contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Bucketed contracts. The value of a commodity contract which has not been established in fact shall be deemed to be equal to the value of the total deposit made by a customer in respect to such contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Securities. The value of a listed security shall be equal to the closing price for such security on the exchange upon which it is traded. The value of all securities not traded on an exchange shall be equal in the case of a long position, to the average of the bid prices for long positions, and in the case of a short position, to the average of the asking prices for the short positions. If liquidated prior to the primary liquidation date, the value of such security shall be equal to the net proceeds of its liquidation. Securities which are not publicly traded shall be valued by the trustee, subject to approval of the court, using such professional assistance as the trustee deems necessary in its sole discretion under the circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Property. Cash commodities held in inventory, as collateral or otherwise, shall be valued at their fair market value. Subject to the other provisions of this paragraph (e), all other property shall be valued by the trustee subject to approval by the court, using such professional assistance as the trustee deems necessary in its sole discretion under the circumstances: Provided, however, That if such property is sold, its value for purposes of the calculations required by this part shall be the net proceeds of such sale: Provided further, That the sale is made in compliance with all applicable statutes, rules and orders of any court or governmental entity with jurisdiction thereover.
