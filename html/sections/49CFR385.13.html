                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Generally, a motor carrier rated ``unsatisfactory'' is  prohibited from operating a CMV. Information on motor carriers,  including their most current safety rating, is available from the FMCSA  on the Internet at http://www.safersys.org, or by telephone at (800)  832-5660.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Motor carriers transporting hazardous materials in quantities  requiring placarding, and motor carriers transporting passengers in a  CMV, are prohibited from operating a CMV in motor carrier operations in  commerce beginning on the 46th day after the date of the FMCSA notice of  proposed ``unsatisfactory'' rating.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All other motor carriers rated as a result of reviews completed  on or after November 20, 2000, are prohibited from operating a CMV in  motor carrier operations in commerce beginning on the 61st day after the  date of the FMCSA notice of proposed ``unsatisfactory'' rating. If FMCSA  determines that the motor carrier is making a good-faith effort to  improve its safety fitness, FMCSA may allow the motor carrier to operate  for up to 60 additional days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A Federal agency must not use a motor carrier that holds an  ``unsatisfactory'' rating to transport passengers in a CMV or to  transport hazardous   materials in quantities requiring placarding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A Federal agency must not use a motor carrier for other CMV  transportation if that carrier holds an ``unsatisfactory'' rating which  became effective on or after January 22, 2001.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Penalties. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a proposed ``unsatisfactory'' safety rating  becomes final, FMCSA will issue an order placing out of service the  motor carrier's operations in commerce. The out-of-service order shall  apply both to the motor carrier's operations in interstate commerce and  to its operations affecting interstate commerce.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a motor carrier's intrastate operations are declared out of  service by a State, FMCSA must issue an order placing out of service the  carrier's operations in interstate commerce. The following conditions  apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The State that issued the intrastate out-of-service order  participates in the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program and uses the  FMCSA safety rating methodology provided in this part; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The motor carrier has its principal place of business in the  State that issued the out-of-service order.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The order prohibiting the motor carrier from operating a CMV  in interstate commerce shall remain in effect until the State determines  that the carrier is fit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any motor carrier that operates CMVs in violation of this  section is subject to the penalty provisions of 49 U.S.C. 521(b) and  appendix B to part 386 of the FMCSRs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Revocation of operating authority. If a proposed  ``unsatisfactory'' safety rating or a proposed determination of  unfitness becomes final, FMCSA will, following notice, issue an order  revoking the operating authority of the owner or operator. For purposes  of this section, the term ``operating authority'' means the registration  required under 49 U.S.C. 13902 and Sec. 392.9a of this subchapter. Any  motor carrier that operates CMVs after revocation of its operating  authority will be subject to the penalty provisions listed in 49 U.S.C.  14901.
