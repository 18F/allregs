If so, state its materials(s).</p><p class="depth0">Does the sole overlap the upper other than just at the front of the toe and/or at the back of the heel?</p><p class="depth0">Definitions for some of the terms used in questions A to Z above: For the purpose of this section, the following terms have the approximate definitions below. If either a more complete definition or a decision as to its application to a particular article is needed, the maker or importer of record (or the agent of either) should contact Customs prior to entry of the article.</p><p class="depth0">a. In an exclusively adhesive construction, all of the piece(s) of the bottom would separate from the upper or from each other if all adhesives, cements, and glues were dissolved. It includes shoes in which the pieces of the upper are stitched to each other, but not to any part of the bottom. Examples include:</p><p class="depth0">1. Vulcanized construction footwear;</p><p class="depth0">2. Simultaneous molded construction footwear;</p><p class="depth0">3. Molded footwear in which the upper and the bottom are one piece of molded rubber or plastic, and</p><p class="depth0">4. Footwear in which staples, rivets, stitching, or any of the methods above are either primary or just extra or auxiliary, even though adhesive is a major part of the reason the bottom will not separate from the upper.</p><p class="depth0">b. Composition leather is made by binding together leather fibers or small pieces of natural leather. It does not include imitation leathers not based on natural leather.</p><p class="depth0">c. Leather is the tanned skin of any animal from which the fur or hair has been removed. Tanned skins coated or laminated with rubber and/or plastics are ``leather'' only if the leather gives the material its essential character.</p><p class="depth0">d. A line of demarcation exists if one can indicate where the sole ends and the upper begins. For example, knit booties do not normally have a line of demarcation.</p><p class="depth0">e. Men's, boys' and youths' sizes cover footwear of American youths sizes 11\1/2\ and larger for males, and do not include footwear commonly worn by both sexes. If more than 4% of the shoes sold in a given size will be worn by females, that size is ``commonly worn by both sexes.''</p><p class="depth0">f. Footwear is designed to protect against water, oil or cold or inclement weather only if it is substantially more of a protection against those items than the usual shoes of that type. For example, leather oxfords will clearly keep one's feet warmer and drier than going barefoot, but they are not a protection in this sense. On the other hand the snow-jobber is the protective version of the nonprotective jogging shoe.</p><p class="depth0">g. Rubber and/or plastics includes any textile material visibly coated (or covered) externally with one or both of those materials.</p><p class="depth0">h. Slip-on includes:</p><p class="depth0">1. A boot which must be pulled on.</p><p class="depth0">2. Footwear with elastic cores which must be stretched to get it on, but not bootwear having a separate piece of elasticized fabric

which forms a full circle around the foot or ankle.</p><p class="depth0">i. Sports footwear includes only:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Footwear which is designed for a sporting activity and has, or has provision for, the attachment of spikes, sprigs, cleats, stops, clips, bars or the like;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Skating boots (without skates attached), ski boots and cross-country ski footwear, wrestling boots, boxing boots and cycling shoes.</p><p class="depth0">j. Tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like covers athletic footwear other than sports footwear, whether or not principally used for such athletic games or purposes.</p><p class="depth0">k. Textile materials are made from cotton, other vegetable fibers, wool, hair, silk or man-made fibers. Note: Cork, wood carboard and leather are not textile materials.</p><p class="depth0">l. In turned construction, the upper is stitched to the leather sole wrong side out and the shoe is then turned right side out.</p><p class="depth0">m. Vegetable fibers include cotton, flax and ramie, but do not include either rayon or plaiting materials such as rattan or wood strips.</p><p class="depth0">n. Waterproof footwear includes footwear designed to protect against penetration by water or other liquids, whether or not such footwear is primarily designed for such purposes.</p><p class="depth0">o. Welt footwear means footwear constructed with a welt, which extends around the edge of the outer sole, and in which the welt and shoe upper are sewed to a lip on the surface of the insole, and the outer sole is sewed or cemented to the welt.</p><p class="depth0">p.
