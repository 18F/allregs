                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The Board uses several guides to decide whether the  work the claimant has done shows that he or she is able to do  substantial gainful activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The claimant's earnings may show the claimant has done  substantial gainful activity. The amount of the claimant's earnings from  work the claimant has done may show that he or she has engaged in  substantial gainful activity. Generally, if the claimant worked for  substantial earnings, this will show that he or she is able to do  substantial gainful activity. On the other hand, the fact that the  claimant's earnings are not substantial will not necessarily show that  the claimant is not able to do substantial gainful activity. The Board  will generally consider work that the claimant is forced to stop after a  short time because of his or her impairment(s) as an unsuccessful work  attempt and the claimant's earnings from that work will not show that  the claimant is able to do substantial gainful activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Board considers only the amount the claimant earns. The  Board does not consider any income not directly related to the  claimant's productivity when the Board decides whether the claimant has  done substantial   gainful activity. If the claimant's earnings are subsidized, the amount  of the subsidy is not counted when the Board determines whether or not  the claimant's work is substantial gainful activity. Thus, where work is  done under special conditions, the Board only considers the part of the  claimant's pay which the claimant actually ``earns.'' For example, where  a handicapped person does simple tasks under close and continuous  supervision, the Board would not determine that the person worked at the  substantial gainful activity level only on the basis of the amount of  pay. A railroad or non-railroad employer may set a specific amount as a  subsidy after figuring the reasonable value of the employee's services.  If the claimant's work is subsidized and the claimant's railroad and  non-railroad employer does not set the amount of the subsidy or does not  adequately explain how the subsidy was figured, the Board will  investigate to see how much the claimant's work is worth.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the claimant is working in a sheltered or special  environment. If the claimant is working in a sheltered workshop, the  claimant may or may not be earning the amounts he or she is being paid.  The fact that the sheltered workshop or similar facility is operating at  a loss or is receiving some charitable contributions or governmental aid  does not establish that the claimant is not earning all he or she is  being paid. Since persons in military service being treated for a severe  impairment usually continue to receive full pay, the Board evaluates  work activity in a therapy program or while on limited duty by comparing  it with similar work in the civilian work force or on the basis of  reasonable worth of the work, rather than on the actual amount of the  earnings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Earnings guidelines--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. If the claimant is employed,  the Board first considers the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section  and Sec. 220.145, and then the guides in paragraphs (b)(2), (3), (4),  (5), and (6) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Earnings that will ordinarily show that the claimant has engaged  in substantial gainful activity. The Board will consider that the  earnings from the employed claimant (including earnings from sheltered  work, see paragraph (b)(4) of this section) show that the claimant  engaged in substantial gainful activity if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Before January 1, 2001, the earnings averaged more than the  amount(s) in Table 1 of this section for the time(s) in which the  claimant worked.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Beginning January 1, 2001, the earnings are more than an amount  determined for each calendar year to be the larger of:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The amount for the previous year, or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The amount established by the Social Security Administration to  constitute substantial gainful activity for such year.</p><p class="depth5">Table 1--Amounts Indicating Substantial Gainful Activity Performed ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth5">Monthly</p><p class="depth5">earnings</p><p class="depth5">For months                            averaged</p><p class="depth5">more than ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In calendar years before 1976...............................        $200 In calendar year 1976.......................................         230 In calendar year 1977.......................................         240 In calendar year 1978.......................................         260 In calendar year 1979.......................................         280 In calendar years 1980-1989.................................         300 January 1990-June 1999......................................         500 July 1999-December 2000.....................................         700 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Earnings that will ordinarily show that the claimant has not  engaged in substantial gainful activity. Beginning January 1, 2001, if  the claimant's earnings are equal to or less than the amount(s)  determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section for the year(s) in  which the claimant works, the Board will generally consider that the  earnings from the claimant's work as an employee will show the claimant  has not engaged in substantial gainful activity. Before January 1, 2001,  if the claimant's earnings were less than the amount(s) in Table 2 of  this section for the year(s) in which the claimant worked, the Board  will generally consider that the earnings from the claimant's work as an  employee will show that the claimant has not engaged in substantial  gainful activity.</p><p class="depth3">Table 2--Amounts Indicating Substantial Gainful Activity Not Performed ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Monthly</p><p class="depth3">earnings</p><p class="depth3">For months                            averaged</p><p class="depth3">less than ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In calendar years before 1976...............................        $130 In calendar year 1976.......................................         150 In calendar year 1977.......................................         160 In calendar year 1978.......................................         170 In calendar year 1979.......................................         180 In calendar years 1980-1989.................................         190 In calendar years 1990-2000.................................         300 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the claimant worked in a sheltered workshop. Before January  1, 2001 if the claimant worked in a sheltered workshop or a comparable  facility especially set up for severely impaired persons, the Board will  ordinarily consider that the claimant's earnings from this work show  that the claimant has engaged in substantial gainful activity if the  claimant's earnings average more than the amounts in Table 1 of this  section. Average monthly earnings from a sheltered workshop or a  comparable facility that are equal to or less than those indicated in  Table 1 of this section will ordinarily show that the claimant has not  engaged in substantial gainful activity without the need to consider the  other information, as described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section,  regardless of whether they are more or less than those indicated in  paragraph (b)(3) of this section. When the claimant's earnings from a  sheltered workshop or comparable facility are equal to or less than  those amounts indicated in Table 1 of this section, the Board will  consider the provisions of paragraph (b)(6) of this section only if  there is evidence that the claimant may have done substantial gainful  activity. For work performed in a sheltered workshop or comparable  facility beginning January 1, 2001, the rules of paragraph (b)(2), (3),  and (6) apply the same as they do to any other work done by an employee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If there is evidence showing that the claimant may have done  substantial gainful activity. If there is evidence showing that the  claimant may have done substantial gainful activity, the Board will  apply the criteria in paragraph (b)(6) of this section regarding  comparability and value of services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Earnings that are not high enough to ordinarily show that the  claimant engaged in substantial gainful activity. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Before January 1,  2001, if the claimant's average monthly earnings were between the  amounts shown in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section, the Board  will generally consider other information in addition to the claimant's  earnings (see paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this section). This rule  generally applies to employees who did not work in a sheltered workshop  or a comparable facility, although the Board may apply it to some people  who work in sheltered workshops or comparable facilities (see paragraph  (b)(4) of this section).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Beginning January 1, 2001, if the claimant's average monthly  earnings are equal to or less than the amounts determined under  paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Board will generally not consider  other information in addition to the claimant's earnings unless there is  evidence indicating that the claimant may be engaging in substantial  gainful activity or that the claimant is in a position to defer or  suppress his or her earnings.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Examples of other information the Board may consider include,  whether--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The claimant's work is comparable to that of unimpaired people  in the claimant's community who are doing the same or similar  occupations as their means of livelihood, taking into account the time,  energy, skill, and responsibility involved in the work, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The claimant's work, although significantly less than that done  by unimpaired people, is clearly worth the amounts shown in paragraph  (b)(2) of   this section, according to pay scales in the claimant's community.
