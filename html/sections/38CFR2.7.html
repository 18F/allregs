The Secretary is also required to  submit an annual report to the Congress, containing a brief summary of  each recommendation for relief and its disposition. Preparation of the  report shall be the responsibility of the General Counsel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The authority to grant the equitable relief, referred to in  paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, has not been delegated and is  reserved to the Secretary. Recommendation for the correction of  administrative error and for appropriate equitable relief therefrom will  be submitted to the Secretary, through the General Counsel. Such  recommendation may be initiated by the head of the administration having  responsibility for the benefit, or of any concerned staff office, or by  the Chairman, Board of Veterans Appeals. When a recommendation for  relief under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section is initiated by the  head of a staff office, or the Chairman, Board of Veterans Appeals, the  views of the head of the administration having responsibility for the  benefit will be obtained and transmitted with the recommendation of the  initiating office.
