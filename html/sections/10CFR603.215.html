                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The contracting officer should evaluate whether the recipient has a strong commitment to and self-interest in the success of the project and incorporating the technology into products and processes for the commercial marketplace. Evidence of that commitment and interest should be found in the proposal, in the recipient's management plan, or through other means.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The contracting officer must seek cost sharing. The purpose of cost sharing is to ensure that the recipient incurs real risk that gives it a vested interest in the project's success; the willingness to commit to meaningful cost sharing is a good indicator of a recipient's self-interest. The requirements are that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To the maximum extent practicable, the non-Federal parties carrying out a RD&D; project under a TIA are to provide at least half of the costs of the project; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The parties must provide the cost sharing from non-Federal resources unless otherwise provided by law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The contracting officer may consider whether cost sharing is impracticable in a given case, unless there is a statutory requirement for cost sharing that applies to the particular program under which the award is to be made. Before deciding that cost sharing is impracticable, the contracting officer should carefully consider if there are other factors that demonstrate the recipient's self-interest in the success of the current project.</p>
