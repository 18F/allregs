                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Use of full absorption method of inventory costing. In order to  conform as nearly as may be possible to the best accounting practices  and to clearly reflect income (as required by section 471 of the Code),  both direct and indirect production costs must be taken into account in  the computation of inventoriable costs in accordance with the ``full  absorption'' method of inventory costing. Under the full absorption  method of inventory costing production costs must be allocated to goods  produced during the taxable year, whether sold during the taxable year  or in inventory at the close of the taxable year determined in  accordance with the taxpayer's method of identifying goods in inventory.  Thus, the taxpayer must include as inventoriable costs all direct  production costs and, to the extent provided by paragraphs (c) and (d)  of this section, all indirect production costs. For purposes of this  section, the term ``financial reports'' means financial reports  (including consolidated financial statements) to shareholders, partners,  beneficiaries or other proprietors and for credit purposes. See also  Sec. 1.263A-1T with respect to the treatment of production costs  incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, and before  January 1, 1994. See also Secs. 1.263A-1 and 1.263A-2 with respect to  the treatment of production costs incurred in taxable years beginning  after December 31, 1993.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Production costs--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Costs are considered to be  production costs to the extent that they are incident to and necessary  for production or manufacturing operations or processes. Production  costs include direct production costs and fixed and variable indirect  production costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Direct production costs. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Costs classified as ``direct  production costs'' are generally those costs which are incident to and  necessary for production or manufacturing operations or processes and  are components of the cost of either direct material or direct labor.  Direct material costs include the cost of those materials which become  an integral part of the specific product and those materials which are  consumed in the ordinary course of manufacturing and can be identified  or associated with particular units or groups of units of that product.  See Sec. 1.471-3 for the elements of direct material costs. Direct labor  costs include the cost of labor which can be identified or associated  with particular units or groups of units of a specific product. The  elements of direct labor costs include such items as basic compensation,  overtime pay, vacation and holiday pay, sick leave pay (other than  payments pursuant to a wage continuation plan under section 105(d)),  shift differential, payroll taxes and payments to a supplemental  unemployment benefit plan paid or incurred on behalf of employees  engaged in direct labor. For the treatment of rework labor, scrap,  spoilage costs, and any other costs not specifically described as direct  production costs see Sec. 1.471-11(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under the full absorption method, a taxpayer must take into  account all items of direct production cost in his inventoriable costs.  Nevertheless, a taxpayer will not be treated as using an incorrect  method of inventory costing if he treats any direct production costs as  indirect production costs, provided such costs are allocated to the  taxpayer's ending inventory to the extent provided by paragraph (d) of  this section. Thus, for example, a taxpayer may treat direct labor costs  as part of indirect production costs (for example, by use of the  conversion cost method), provided all such costs are allocated to ending  inventory to the extent provided by paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Indirect production costs--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The term ``indirect  production costs'' includes all costs which are incident to and  necessary for production or manufacturing operations or processes other  than direct production costs (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this  paragraph). Indirect production costs may be classified as to kind or  type in accordance with acceptable accounting principles so as to enable  convenient identification with various production or manufacturing  activities or functions and to facilitate reasonable groupings of such  costs for purposes of determining unit product costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Fixed and variable classifications. For purposes of this  section, fixed indirect production costs are generally those costs which  do not vary significantly with changes in the amount of goods produced  at any given level of production capacity. These fixed costs may  include, among other costs, rent and property taxes on buildings and  machinery incident to and necessary for manufacturing operations or  processes. On the other hand, variable indirect production costs are  generally those costs which do vary significantly with changes in the  amount of goods produced at any given level of production capacity.  These variable costs may include, among other costs, indirect materials,  factory janitorial supplies, and utilities. Where a particular cost  contains both fixed and variable elements, these elements should be  segregated into fixed and variable classifications to the extent  necessary under the taxpayer's method of allocation, such as for the  application of the practical capacity concept (as described in paragraph  (d) (4) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Certain indirect and production costs--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Except  as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section and in paragraph  (d)(6)(v) of Sec. 1.451-3, in order to determine whether indirect  production costs referred to in paragraph (b) of this section must be  included in a taxpayer's computation of the amount of inventoriable  costs, three categories of costs have been provided in subparagraph (2)  of this paragraph. Costs described in subparagraph (2)(i) of this  paragraph must be included in the taxpayer's computation of the amount  of inventoriable costs, regardless of their treatment by the taxpayer in  his financial reports. Costs described in subparagraph (2)(ii) of this  paragraph need not enter into the taxpayer's computation of the amount  of inventoriable costs, regardless of their treatment by the taxpayer in  his financial reports. Costs described in subparagraph (2)(iii) of this  paragraph must be included in or excluded from the taxpayer's  computation of the amount inventoriable costs in accordance with the  treatment of such costs by the taxpayer in his financial reports and  generally accepted accounting principles. For the treatment of indirect  production costs described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph in the  case of a taxpayer who is not using comparable methods of accounting for  such costs for tax and financial reporting see paragraph (c)(3) of this  section. For contracts entered into after December 31, 1982,  notwithstanding this section, taxpayers who use an inventory method of  accounting for extended period long-term contracts (as defined in  paragraph (b)(3) of Sec. 1.451-3) for tax purposes may be required to  use the cost allocation rules provided in paragraph (d)(6) of  Sec. 1.451-3 rather than the cost allocation rules provided in this  section. See paragraph (d)(6)(v) of Sec. 1.451-3. After a taxpayer has  determined which costs must be treated as indirect production costs  includible in the computation of the amount of inventoriable costs, such  costs must be allocated to a taxpayer's ending inventory in a manner  prescribed by paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Includibility of certain indirect production costs--(i) Indirect  production costs included in inventoriable costs. Indirect production  costs which must enter into the computation of the amount of  inventoriable costs (regardless of their treatment by a taxpayer in his  financial reports) include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Repair expenses,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Maintenance,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Utilities, such as heat, power and light,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Rent,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Indirect labor and production supervisory wages, including basic  compensation, overtime pay, vacation and holiday pay, sick leave pay  (other than   payments pursuant to a wage continuation plan under section 105(d),  shift differential, payroll taxes and contributions to a supplemental  unemployment benefit plan,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Indirect materials and supplies,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Tools and equipment not capitalized, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Costs of quality control and inspection,   to the extent, and only to the extent, such costs are incident to and  necessary for production or manufacturing operations or processes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Costs not included in inventoriable costs. Costs which are not  required to be included for tax purposes in the computation of the  amount of inventoriable costs (regardless of their treatment by a  taxpayer in his financial reports) include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Marketing expenses,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Advertising expenses,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Selling expenses,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Other distribution expenses,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Interest,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Research and experimental expenses including engineering and  product development expenses,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Losses under section 165 and the regulations thereunder,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Percentage depletion in excess of cost depletion,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Depreciation and amortization reported for Federal income tax  purposes in excess of depreciation reported by the taxpayer in his  financial reports,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Income taxes attributable to income received on the sale of  inventory,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Pension contributions to the extent that they represent past  services cost,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> General and administrative expenses incident to and necessary  for the taxpayer's activities as a whole rather than to production or  manufacturing operations or processes, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Salaries paid to officers attributable to the performance of  services which are incident to and necessary for the taxpayer's  activities taken as a whole rather than to production or manufacturing  operations or processes.   Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if a taxpayer consistently  includes in his computation of the amount of inventoriable costs any of  the costs described in the preceding sentence, a change in such method  of inclusion shall be considered a change in method of accounting within  the meaning of sections 446, 481, and paragraph (e)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Indirect production costs includible in inventoriable costs  depending upon treatment in taxpayer's financial reports. In the case of  costs listed in this subdivision, the inclusion or exclusion of such  costs from the amount of inventoriable costs for purposes of a  taxpayer's financial reports shall determine whether such costs must be  included in or excluded from the computation of inventoriable costs for  tax purposes, but only if such treatment is not inconsistent with  generally accepted accounting principles. In the case of costs which are  not included in subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph, nor listed  in this subdivision, whether such costs must be included in or excluded  from the computation of inventoriable costs for tax purposes depends  upon the extent to which such costs are similar to costs included in  subdivision (i) or (ii), and if such costs are dissimilar to costs in  subdivision (i) or (ii), such costs shall be treated as included in or  excludable from the amount of inventoriable costs in accordance with  this subdivision. The costs listed in this subdivision are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Taxes. Taxes otherwise allowable as a deduction under section  164 (other than State and local and foreign income taxes) attributable  to assets incident to and necessary for production or manufacturing  operations or processes. Thus, for example, the cost of State and local  property taxes imposed on a factory or other production facility and any  State and local taxes imposed on inventory must be included in or  excluded from the computation of the amount of inventoriable costs for  tax purposes depending upon their treatment by a taxpayer in his  financial reports.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Depreciation and depletion. Depreciation reported in financial  reports and cost depletion on assets incident to and necessary for  production or manufacturing operations or processes. In computing cost  depletion under this section, the adjusted basis of such assets shall be  reduced by cost depletion   and not by percentage depletion taken thereon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Employee benefits. Pension and profit-sharing contributions  representing current service costs otherwise allowable as a deduction  under section 404, and other employee benefits incurred on behalf of  labor incident to and necessary for production or manufacturing  operations or processes. These other benefits include workmen's  compensation expenses, payments under a wage continuation plan described  in section 105(d), amounts of a type which would be includible in the  gross income of employees under non-qualified pension, profit-sharing  and stock bonus plans, premiums on life and health insurance and  miscellaneous benefits provided for employees such as safety, medical  treatment, cafeteria, recreational facilities, membership dues, etc.,  which are otherwise allowable as deductions under chapter 1 of the Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Costs attributable to strikes, rework labor, scrap and spoilage.  Costs attributable to rework labor, scrap and spoilage which are  incident to and necessary for production or manufacturing operations or  processes and costs attributable to strikes incident to production or  manufacturing operation or processes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Factory administrative expenses. Administrative costs of  production (but not including any cost of selling or any return on  capital) incident to and necessary for production or manufacturing  operations or processes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Officers' salaries. Salaries paid to officers attributable to  services performed incident to and necessary for production or  manufacturing operations or processes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Insurance costs. Insurance costs incident to and necessary for  production or manufacturing operations or processes such as insurance on  production machinery and equipment. A change in the taxpayer's treatment  in his financial reports of costs described in this subdivision which  results in a change in treatment of such costs for tax purposes shall  constitute a change in method of accounting within the meaning of  sections 446 and 481 to which paragraph (e) applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exception. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(6) of Sec. 1.451- 3, in the case of a taxpayer whose method of accounting for production  costs in his financial reports is not comparable to his method of  accounting for such costs for tax purposes (such as a taxpayer using the  prime cost method for purposes of financial reports), the following  rules apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Indirect production costs included in inventoriable costs.  Indirect production costs which must enter into the computation of the  amount of inventoriable costs (to the extent, and only to the extent,  such costs are incident to and necessary for production or manufacturing  operations or processes) include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Repair expenses,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Maintenance,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Utilities, such as heat, power and light,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Rent,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Indirect labor and production supervisory wages, including basic  compensation, overtime pay, vacation and holiday pay, sick leave pay  (other than payments pursuant to a wage continuation plan under section  105(d)), shift differential, payroll taxes and contributions to a  supplemental unemployment benefit plan,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Indirect materials and supplies,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Tools and equipment not capitalized,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Costs of quality control and inspection,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Taxes otherwise allowable as a deduction under section 164  (other than State and local and foreign income taxes),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Depreciation and amortization reported for financial purposes  and cost depletion,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Administrative costs of production (but not including any cost  of selling or any return on capital) incident to and necessary for  production or manufacturing operations or processes,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Salaries paid to officers attributable to services performed  incident to and necessary for production or manufacturing operations or  processes, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Insurance costs incident to and necessary for production or  manufacturing operations or processes such as   insurance on production machinery and equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Costs not included in inventoriable costs. Costs which are not  required to be included in the computation of the amount of  inventoriable costs include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Marketing expenses,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Advertising expenses,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Selling expenses,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Other distribution expenses,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Interest,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Research and experimental expenses including engineering and  product development expenses,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Losses under section 165 and the regulations thereunder,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Percentage depletion in excess of cost depletion,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Depreciation reported for Federal income tax purposes in excess  of depreciation reported by the taxpayer in his financial reports,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Income taxes attributable to income received on the sale of  inventory,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Pension and profit-sharing contributions representing either  past service costs or representing current service costs otherwise  allowable as a deduction under section 404, and other employee benefits  incurred on behalf of labor. These other benefits include workmen's  compensation expenses, payments under a wage continuation plan described  in section 105(d), amounts of a type which would be includible in the  gross income of employees under nonqualified pension, profit-sharing and  stock bonus plans, premiums on life and health insurance and  miscellaneous benefits provided for employees such as safety, medical  treatment, cafeteria, recreational facilities, membership dues, etc.,  which are otherwise allowable as deductions under chapter 1 of the Code,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Cost attributable to strikes, rework labor, scrap and spoilage,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> General and administrative expenses incident to and necessary  for the taxpayer's activities as a whole rather than to production or  manufacturing operations or processes, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Salaries paid to officers attributable to the performance of  services which are incident to and necessary for the taxpayer's  activities as a whole rather than to production or manufacturing  operations or processes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Allocation methods--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Indirect production costs  required to be included in the computation of the amount of  inventoriable costs pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this paragraph  must be allocated to goods in a taxpayer's ending inventory (determined  in accordance with the taxpayer's method of identification) by the use  of a method of allocation which fairly apportions such costs among the  various items produced. Acceptable methods for allocating indirect  production costs to the cost of goods in the ending inventory include  the manufacturing burden rate method and the standard cost method. In  addition, the practical capacity concept can be used in conjunction with  either the manufacturing burden rate or standard cost method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Manufacturing burden rate method--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Manufacturing  burden rates may be developed in accordance with acceptable accounting  principles and applied in a reasonable manner. In developing a  manufacturing burden rate, the factors described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)  of this section may be taken into account. Furthermore, if the taxpayer  chooses, he may allocate different indirect production costs on the  basis of different manufacturing burden rates. Thus, for example, the  taxpayer may use one burden rate for allocating rent and another burden  rate for allocating utilities. The method used by the taxpayer in  allocating such costs in his financial reports shall be given great  weight in determining whether the taxpayer's method employed for tax  purposes fairly allocates indirect production costs to the ending  inventory. Any change in a manufacturing burden rate which is merely a  periodic adjustment to reflect current operating conditions, such as  increases in automation or changes in operation, does not constitute a  change in method of accounting under section 446. However, a change in  the concept upon which such rates are developed does constitute a change  in method of accounting requiring the consent of the Commissioner. The  taxpayer shall maintain adequate records and working papers to support  all manufacturing burden rate calculations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Development of manufacturing burden rate. The following  factors, among others, may be taken into account in developing  manufacturing burden rates:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The selection of an appropriate level of activity and period of  time upon which to base the calculation of rates which will reflect  operating conditions for purposes of the unit costs being determined;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The selection of an appropriate statistical base such as direct  labor hours, direct labor dollars, or machine hours, or a combination  thereof, upon which to apply the overhead rate to determine production  costs; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The appropriate budgeting, classification and analysis of  expenses (for example, the analysis of fixed and variable costs).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Operation of the manufacturing burden rate method. (a) The  purpose of the manufacturing burden rate method used in conjunction with  the full absorption method of inventory costing is to allocate an  appropriate amount of indirect production costs to a taxpayer's goods in  ending inventory by the use of predetermined rates intended to  approximate the actual amount of indirect production costs incurred.  Accordingly, the proper use of the manufacturing burden rate method  under this section requires that any net negative or net positive  difference between the total predetermined amount of indirect production  costs allocated to the goods in ending inventory and the total amount of  indirect production costs actually incurred and required to be allocated  to such goods (i.e., the under or over-applied burden) must be treated  as an adjustment to the taxpayer's ending inventory in the taxable year  in which such difference arises. However, if such adjustment is not  significant in amount in relation to the taxpayer's total actual  indirect production costs for the year then such adjustment need not be  allocated to the taxpayer's goods in ending inventory unless such  allocation is made in the taxpayer's financial reports. The taxpayer  must treat both positive and negative adjustments consistently.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Notwithstanding subdivision (a), the practical capacity concept  may be used to determine the total amount of fixed indirect production  costs which must be allocated to goods in ending inventory. See  subparagraph (4) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Standard cost method--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A taxpayer may use the so- called ``standard cost'' method of allocating inventoriable costs to the  goods in ending inventory, provided he treats variances in accordance  with the procedures prescribed in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section.  The method used by the taxpayer in allocating such costs in his  financial reports shall be given great weight in determining whether the  taxpayer's method employed for tax purposes fairly allocates indirect  production costs to the ending inventory. For purposes of this  subparagraph, a ``net positive overhead variance'' shall mean the excess  of total standard (or estimated) indirect production costs over total  actual indirect production costs and a ``net negative overhead  variance'' shall mean the excess of total actual indirect production  costs over total standard (or estimated) indirect production costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Treatment of variances. (a) The proper use of the standard cost  method pursuant to this subparagraph requires that a taxpayer must  reallocate to the goods in ending inventory a pro rata portion of any  net negative or net positive overhead variances and any net negative or  net positive direct production cost variances. The taxpayer must  apportion such variances among his various items in ending inventory.  However, if such variances are not significant in amount in relation to  the taxpayer's total actual indirect production costs for the year then  such variances need not be allocated to the taxpayer's goods in ending  inventory unless such allocation is made in the taxpayer's financial  reports. The taxpayer must treat both positive and negative variances  consistently.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Notwithstanding subdivision (a), the practical capacity concept  may be used to determine the total amount of fixed indirect production  costs which must be allocated to goods in ending inventory. See  subparagraph (4) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Practical capacity concept--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Under the practical  capacity   concept, the percentage of practical capacity represented by actual  production (not greater than 100 percent), as calculated under  subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, is used to determine the total  amount of fixed indirect production costs which must be included in the  taxpayer's computation of the amount of inventoriable costs. The portion  of such costs to be included in the taxpayer's computation of the amount  of inventoriable costs is then combined with variable indirect  production costs and both are allocated to the goods in ending inventory  in accordance with this paragraph. See the example in subdivision  (ii)(d) of this subparagraph. The difference (if any) between the amount  of all fixed indirect production costs and the fixed indirect production  costs which are included in the computation of the amount of  inventoriable costs under the practical capacity concept is allowable as  a deduction for the taxable year in which such difference occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Calculation of practical capacity--(a) In general. Practical  capacity and theoretical capacity (as described in (c) of this  subdivision) may be computed in terms of tons, pounds, yards, labor  hours, machine hours, or any other unit of production appropriate to the  cost accounting system used by a particular taxpayer. The determination  of practical capacity and theoretical capacity should be modified from  time to time to reflect a change in underlying facts and conditions such  as increased output due to automation or other changes in plant  operation. Such a change does not constitute a change in method of  accounting under sections 446 and 481.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Based upon taxpayer's experience. In selecting an appropriate  level of production activity upon which to base the calculation of  practical capacity, the taxpayer shall establish the production  operating conditions expected during the period for which the costs are  being determined, assuming that the utilization of production facilities  during operations will be approximately at capacity. This level of  production activity is frequently described as practical capacity for  the period and is ordinarily based upon the historical experience of the  taxpayer. For example, a taxpayer operating on a 5-day, 8-hour basis may  have a ``normal'' production of 100,000 units a year based upon three  years of experience.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Based upon theoretical capacity. Practical capacity may also be  established by the use of ``theoretical'' capacity, adjusted for  allowances for estimated inability to achieve maximum production, such  as machine breakdown, idle time, and other normal work stoppages.  Theoretical capacity is the level of production the manufacturer could  reach if all machines and departments were operated continously at peak  efficiency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Example. The provisions of (c) of this subdivision may be  illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Corporation X operates a stamping plant with a theoretical capacity  of 50 units per hour. The plant actually operates 1960 hours per year  based on an 8-hour day, 5 day week basis and 15 shutdown days for  vacations and holidays. A reasonable allowance for down time (the time  allowed for ordinary and necessary repairs and maintenance) is 5 percent  of practical capacity before reduction for down time. Assuming no loss  of production during starting up, closing down, or employee work breaks,  under these facts and circumstances X may properly make a practical  capacity computation as follows:  Practical capacity without allowance for down time based on       98,000</p><p class="depth0">theoretical capacity per hour is (1960x50).................... Reduction for down time (98,000x5 percent).....................    4,900 Practical capacity.............................................   93,100</p><p class="depth0">The 93,100 unit level of activity (i.e., practical capacity) would,  therefore, constitute an appropriate base for calculating the amount of  fixed indirect production costs to be included in the computation of the  amount of inventoriable costs for the period under review. On this basis  if only 76,000 units were produced for the period, the effect would be  that approximately 81.6 percent (76,000, the actual number of units  produced, divided by 93,100, the maximum number of units producible at  practical capacity) of the fixed indirect production costs would be  included in the computation of the amount of inventoriable costs during  the year. The portion of the fixed indirect production costs not so  included in the computation of the amount of inventoriable costs would  be deductible in the year in which paid or incurred. Assume further that  7,600 units were on hand at the end of the taxable year and the 7,600  units were in the same proportion to the total units produced. Thus, 10  percent (7,600 units in inventory at the end of the taxable year,  divided by 76,000, the actual   number of units produced) of the fixed indirect production costs  included in the computation of the amount of inventoriable costs (the  above-mentioned 81.6 percent) and 10 percent of the variable indirect  production costs would be included in the cost of the goods in the  ending inventory, in accordance with a method of allocation provided by  this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Transition to full absorption method of inventory costing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Mandatory requirement. A taxpayer not using the full  absorption method of inventory costing, as prescribed by paragraph (a)  of this section, must change to that method. Any change to the full  absorption method must be made by the taxpayer with respect to all  trades or businesses of the taxpayer to which this section applies. A  taxpayer not using the full absorption method of inventory costing, as  prescribed by paragraph (a) of this section, who makes the special  election provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph during the  transition period described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph  need not change to the full absorption method of inventory costing for  taxable years prior to the year for which such election is made. In  determining whether the taxpayer is changing to a more or less inclusive  method of inventory costing, all positive and negative adjustments for  all items and all trades or businesses of the taxpayer shall be  aggregated. If the net adjustment is positive, paragraph (e)(3) shall  apply, and if the net adjustment is negative, paragraph (e)(4) shall  apply to the change. The rules otherwise prescribed in sections 446 and  481 and the regulations thereunder shall apply to any taxpayer who fails  to make the special election in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.  The transition rules of this paragraph are available only to those  taxpayers who change their method of inventory costing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special election during two-year-transition period. If a  taxpayer elects to change to the full absorption method of inventory  costing during the transition period provided herein, he may elect on  Form 3115 to change to such full absorption method of inventory costing  and, in so doing, employ the transition procedures and adopt any of the  transition methods prescribed in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.  Such election shall be made during the first 180 days of any taxable  year beginning on or after September 19, 1973 and before September 19,  1975 (i.e., the ``transition period'') and the change in inventory  costing method shall be made for the taxable year in which the election  is made. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence if the taxpayer's prior  returns have been examined by the Service prior to Sept. 19, 1973, and  there is a pending issue involving the taxpayer's method of inventory  costing, the taxpayer may request the application of this regulation by  agreeing and filing a letter to that effect with the district director,  within 90 days after September 19, 1973 to change to the full absorption  method for the first taxable year of the taxpayer beginning after Sept.  19, 1973 and subsequently filing Form 3115 within the first 180 days of  such taxable year of change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Change initiated by the Commissioner. A taxpayer who properly  makes an election under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph shall be  considered to have made a change in method of accounting not initiated  by the taxpayer, notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 1.481-1(c)(5).  Thus, any of the taxpayer's ``pre-1954 inventory balances'' with respect  to such inventory shall not be taken into account as an adjustment under  section 481. For purposes of this paragraph, a ``pre-1954 inventory  balance'' is the net amount of the adjustments which would have been  required if the taxpayer had made such change in his method of  accounting with respect to his inventory in his first taxable year which  began after December 31, 1953, and ended after August 16, 1954. See  section 481(a)(2) and Sec. 1.481-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Procedural rules for change. If a taxpayer makes an election  pursuant to subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, the Commissioner's  consent will be evidenced by a letter of consent to the taxpayer,  setting forth the values of inventory, as provided by the taxpayer,  determined under the full absorption method of inventory costing, except  to the extent that no determination of such values is necessary under  subparagraph (3)(ii)(B) of this paragraph (the cut off method), the   amount of the adjustments (if any) required to be taken into account by  section 481, and the treatment to be accorded to any such adjustments.  Such full absorption values shall be subject to verification on  examination by the district director. The taxpayer shall preserve at his  principal place of business all records, data, and other evidence  relating to the full absorption values of inventory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Transition methods. In the case of a taxpayer who properly makes  an election under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph during the  transition period--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 10-year adjustment period. Such taxpayer may elect to take any  adjustment required by section 481 with respect to any inventory being  revalued under the full absorption method into account ratably over a  period designated by the taxpayer at the time of such election, not to  exceed the lesser of 10 taxable years commencing with the year of  transition or the number of years the taxpayer has been on the inventory  method from which he is changing. If the taxpayer dies or ceases to  exist in a transaction other than one to which section 381(a) of the  Code applies or if the taxpayer's inventory (determined under the full  absorption method) on the last day of any taxable year is reduced (by  other than a strike or involuntary conversion) by more than an amount  equal to 33\1/3\ percent of the taxpayer's inventory (determined under  the full absorption method) as of the beginning of the year of change,  the entire amount of the section 481 adjustment not previously taken  into account in computing income shall be taken into account in  computing income for the taxable year in which such taxpayer so ceases  to exist or such taxpayer's inventory is so reduced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Additional rules for LIFO taxpayers. A taxpayer who uses the  LIFO method of inventory identification may either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Employ the special transition rules described in subdivision (i)  of this subparagraph. Accordingly, all LIFO layers must be revalued  under the full absorption method and the section 481 adjustment must be  computed for all items in all layers in inventory, but no pre-1954  inventory balances shall be taken into account as adjustments under  section 481; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> Employ a cut-off method whereby the full absorption method is  only applied in costing layers of inventory acquired during all taxable  years beginning with the year for which an election is made under  subparagraph (e)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(ii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a taxpayer using dollar value LIFO, employ a cut- off method whereby the taxpayer must use, for the year of change, the  full absorption method in computing the base year cost and current cost  of a dollar value inventory pool for the beginning of such year. The  taxpayer shall not be required to recompute his LIFO inventories based  on the full absorption method for a taxable year beginning prior to the  year of change to the full absorption method. The base cost and layers  of increment previously computed shall be retained and treated as if  such base cost and layers of increment had been computed under the  method authorized by this section. The taxpayer shall use the year of  change as the base year in applying the double extension method or other  method approved by the Commissioner, instead of the earliest year for  which he adopted the LIFO method for any items in the pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Transition to full absorption method of inventory costing from a  method more inclusive of indirect production costs--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Taxpayer has not  previously changed to his present method pursuant to subparagraphs (1),  (2), and (3) of this paragraph. If a taxpayer wishes to change to the  full absorption method of inventory costing (as prescribed by paragraph  (a) of this section) from a method of inventory costing which is more  inclusive of indirect production costs and he has not previously changed  to his present method by use of the special transition rules provided by  subparagraphs (1), (2) and (3) of this paragraph, he may elect on Form  3115 to change to the full absorption method of inventory costing and,  in so doing, take into account any resulting section 481 adjustment  generally over 10 taxable years commencing with the year of transition.  The Commissioner's consent to such election will be evidenced   by a letter of consent to the taxpayer setting forth the values of  inventory, as provided by the taxpayer determined under the full  absorption method of inventory costing, except to the extent that no  determination of such values is necessary under subparagraph (3)(ii)(b)  of this paragraph, the amount of the adjustments (if any) required to be  taken into account by section 481, and the treatment to be accorded such  adjustments, subject to terms and conditions specified by the  Commissioner to prevent distortions of income. Such election must be  made within the transition period described in subparagraph (1)(ii) of  this paragraph. A change pursuant to this subparagraph shall be a change  initiated by the taxpayer as provided by Sec. 1.481-1(c)(5). Thus, any  of the taxpayers ``pre-1954 inventory balances'' will be taken into  account as an adjustment under section 481.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Taxpayer has previously changed to his present method pursuant  to subparagraph (1), (2), and (3) of this paragraph or would satisfy all  the requirements of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph but fails to  elect within the transition period. If a taxpayer wishes to change to  the full absorption method of inventory costing (as prescribed by  paragraph (a) of this section) from a method of inventory costing which  is more inclusive of indirect production costs and he has previously  changed to his present method pursuant to subparagraphs (1), (2), and  (3) of this paragraph or he would satisfy the requirements of  subdivision (i) of this subparagraph but he fails to elect within the  transition period, he must secure the consent of the Commissioner prior  to making such change.
