The election must be  completed by the MA eligible individual (or the individual who will soon  become eligible to elect an MA plan) and include authorization for  disclosure and exchange of necessary information between the U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services and its designees and the MA  organization. Persons who assist beneficiaries in completing forms must  sign the form, or through other approved mechanisms, indicate their  relationship to the beneficiary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The MA organization must file and retain election forms for the  period specified in CMS instructions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When an election is considered to have been made. An election in  an MA plan is considered to have been made on the date the completed  election is received by the MA organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Handling of elections. The MA organization must have an  effective system for receiving, controlling, and processing elections.  The system must meet the following conditions and requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each election is dated as of the day it is received in a manner  acceptable to CMS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Elections are processed in chronological order, by date of  receipt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The MA organization gives the beneficiary prompt notice of  acceptance or denial in a format specified by CMS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the MA plan is enrolled to capacity, it explains the  procedures that will be followed when vacancies occur.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Upon receipt of the election, or for an individual who was  accepted for future enrollment from the date a vacancy occurs, the MA  organization transmits, within the timeframes specified by CMS, the  information necessary for CMS to add the beneficiary to its records as  an enrollee of the MA organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Exception for employer group health plans. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In cases in which  an MA organization has both a Medicare contract and a contract with an  employer group health plan, and in which the MA organization arranges  for the employer to process elections for Medicare-entitled group  members who wish to enroll under the Medicare contract, the effective  date of the election may be retroactive. Consistent with  Sec. 422.308(f)(2), payment adjustments based on a retroactive effective  date may be made for up to a 90-day period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In order to obtain the effective date described in paragraph  (f)(1) of this section, the beneficiary must certify that, at the time  of enrollment in the MA organization, he or she received the disclosure  statement specified in Sec. 422.111.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon receipt of the election from the employer, the MA  organization must submit the enrollment within timeframes specified by  CMS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Passive enrollment by CMS. In situations involving either  immediate terminations as provided in Sec. 422.510(a)(5) or other  situations in which CMS determines that remaining enrolled in a plan  poses potential harm to the members, CMS may implement passive  enrollment procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Passive enrollment procedures.

The organization that receives the  enrollment must provide notification that describes the costs and  benefits of the plan and the process for accessing care under the plan  and clearly explains the beneficiary's ability to decline the enrollment  or choose another plan. Such notification must be provided to all  potential enrollees prior to the enrollment effective date (or as soon  as possible after the effective date if prior notice is not practical),  in a form and manner determined by CMS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Special election period.
