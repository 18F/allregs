                            <p class="depth0">The Veterans Service Center Manager will review and to the extent  possible determine the legality and prudence of investments involving  Department of Veterans Affairs income or estate. It is Department of  Veterans Affairs policy to invest income or estate derived from  Department of Veterans Affairs benefits only in legal investments which  have safety, assured income, stability of principal and ready  convertibility for the requirements of the beneficiary and his or her  dependents. When notice of a contemplated or actual illegal or imprudent  investment comes to the attention of the Veterans Service Center  Manager, he or she will take remedial action to protect the  beneficiary's estate. Cases in which it becomes necessary to institute  court action will be referred to the Regional Counsel.  (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)  [40 FR 54250, Nov. 21, 1975]</p>
