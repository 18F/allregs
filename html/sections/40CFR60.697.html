This documentation is to include a general description of the gas streams that enter the control device, including flow and volatile organic compound content under varying liquid level conditions (dynamic and static) and manufacturer's design specifications for the control device. If an enclosed combustion device with a minimum residence time of 0.75 seconds and a minimum temperature of 816 [deg]C (1,500 [deg]F) is used to meet the 95-percent requirement, documentation that those conditions exist is sufficient to meet the requirements of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For a carbon adsorption system that does not regenerate the carbon

bed directly onsite in the control device such as a carbon canister, the design analysis shall consider the vent stream composition, constituent concentrations, flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature. The design analysis shall also establish the design exhaust vent stream organic compound concentration level, capacity of carbon bed, type and working capacity of activated carbon used for carbon bed, and design carbon replacement interval based on the total carbon working capacity of the control device and source operating schedule.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Periods when the closed vent systems and control devices required in Sec. 60.692 are not operated as designed, including periods when a flare pilot does not have a flame shall be recorded and kept for 2 years after the information is recorded.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Dates of startup and shutdown of the closed vent system and control devices required in Sec. 60.692 shall be recorded and kept for 2 years after the information is recorded.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The dates of each measurement of detectable emissions required in Sec.
