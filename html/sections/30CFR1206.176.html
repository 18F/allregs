                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This section applies if the gas produced from your Indian lease  is processed and that Indian lease requires accounting for comparison  (also referred to as actual dual accounting). Except as provided in  paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the actual dual accounting  value, for royalty purposes, is the greater of the following two values:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The combined value of the following products:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The residue gas and gas plant products resulting from processing  the gas determined under either Sec. 1206.172   or Sec. 1206.174, less any applicable allowances; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any drip condensate associated with the processed gas recovered  downstream of the point of royalty settlement without resorting to  processing determined under Sec. 1206.52, less applicable allowances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The value of the gas prior to processing determined under either  Sec. 1206.172 or Sec. 1206.174, including any applicable allowances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you are required to account for comparison, you may elect to  use the alternative dual accounting methodology provided for in Sec.  1206.173 instead of the provisions in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Accounting for comparison is not required for gas if no gas from  the lease is processed until after the gas flows into a pipeline with an  index located in an index zone or into a mainline pipeline not in an  index zone. If you do not perform dual accounting, you must certify to  ONRR that gas flows into such a pipeline before it is processed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, if you  value any gas production from a lease for a month using the dual  accounting provisions of this section or the alternative dual accounting  methodology of Sec. 1206.173, then the value of that gas is the minimum  value for any other gas production from that lease for that month  flowing through the same facility measurement point.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the weighted-average Btu quality for your lease is less than  1,000 Btu's per cubic foot, see Sec. 1206.173(b)(4)(ii) to determine if  you must perform a dual accounting calculation.</p><p class="depth2">Transportation Allowances</p>
