                            <p class="depth0">Claims personnel will acknowledge all claims immediately upon  receipt, in writing, by telephone, or in person. A defective claim will  be acknowledged in writing, pointing out its defects. Where the defects  render the submission jurisdictionally deficient based on the  requirements discussed in DA Pam 27-162, paragraphs 2-5 and 2-6, the  claimant or attorney will be informed in writing of the need to present  a proper claim no later than two years from the date of accrual. Suit  must be filed in maritime claims not later than two years from the date  of accrual. See Sec. 536.122. In any claim for personal injury or  wrongful death, an authorization signed by the patient, natural or legal  guardian or estate representative will be obtained authorizing the use  of medical information, including medical records, in order to use  sources other than claims personnel to evaluate the claim as required by  the Health Care Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), 42 U.S.C.  1320d-1320d-8. See the parallel discussion at DA Pam 27-162, paragraph  2-7.</p>
