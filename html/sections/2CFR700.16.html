                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> USAID policy is that all programs, projects, activities, public  communications, and commodities, specified further at paragraphs (c)-(f)  of this section, partially or fully funded by a USAID grant or  cooperative agreement or other assistance award or subaward must be  marked appropriately overseas with the USAID Identity, of a size and  prominence equivalent to or greater than the recipient's, other donor's  or any other third party's identity or logo.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> USAID reserves the right to require the USAID Identity to be  larger and more prominent if it is the majority donor, or to require  that a cooperating country government's identity be larger and more  prominent if circumstances warrant; any such requirement will be on a  case-by-case basis depending on the audience, program goals and  materials produced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> USAID reserves the right to request pre-production review of  USAID funded public communications and program materials for compliance  with the approved Marking Plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> USAID reserves the right to require marking with the USAID  Identity in the event the recipient does not choose to mark with its own  identity or logo.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> To ensure that the marking requirements ``flow down'' to  subrecipients of subawards, recipients of USAID funded grants and  cooperative agreements or other assistance awards are required to  include a USAID-approved marking provision in any USAID funded subaward,  as follows: As a condition of receipt of this subaward, marking with the  USAID Identity of a size and prominence equivalent to or greater than  the recipient's, subrecipient's, other donor's or third party's is  required. In the event the recipient chooses not to require marking with  its own identity or logo by the subrecipient, USAID may, at its  discretion, require marking by the subrecipient with the USAID Identity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Subject to Sec. 700.15 (a), (h), and (j), program, project, or  activity sites funded by USAID, including visible infrastructure  projects (for example, roads, bridges, buildings) or other programs,  projects, or activities that are physical in nature (for example,  agriculture, forestry, water management), must be marked with the USAID  Identity. Temporary signs or plaques   should be erected early in the construction or implementation phase.  When construction or implementation is complete, a permanent, durable  sign, plaque or other marking must be installed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Subject to Sec. 700.15 (a), (h), and (j), technical assistance,  studies, reports, papers, publications, audio-visual productions, public  service announcements, Web sites/Internet activities and other  promotional, informational, media, or communications products funded by  USAID must be marked with the USAID Identity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any ``public communications'' as defined in Sec. 700.1, funded  by USAID, in which the content has not been approved by USAID, must  contain the following disclaimer:</p><p class="depth0">This study/report/audio/visual/other information/media product  (specify) is made possible by the generous support of the American  people through the United States Agency for International Development  (USAID). The contents are the responsibility of [insert recipient name]  and do not necessarily reflect the views of USAID or the United States  Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The recipient must provide the Agreement Officer's  Representative (AOR) or other USAID personnel designated in the grant or  cooperative agreement with at least two copies of all program and  communications materials produced under the award. In addition, the  recipient must submit one electronic and/or one hard copy of all final  documents to USAID's Development Experience Clearinghouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Subject to Sec. 700.15(a), (h), and (j), events financed by  USAID such as training courses, conferences, seminars, exhibitions,  fairs, workshops, press conferences and other public activities, must be  marked appropriately with the USAID Identity. Unless directly prohibited  and as appropriate to the surroundings, recipients should display  additional materials such as signs and banners with the USAID Identity.  In circumstances in which the USAID Identity cannot be displayed  visually, recipients are encouraged otherwise to acknowledge USAID and  the American people's support.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Subject to Sec. 700.15(a), (h), and (j), all commodities  financed by USAID, including commodities or equipment provided under  humanitarian assistance or disaster relief programs, and all other  equipment, supplies and other materials funded by USAID, and their  export packaging, must be marked with the USAID Identity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> After technical evaluation of applications for USAID funding,  USAID Agreement Officers will request apparently successful applicants  to submit a Branding Strategy, defined in Sec. 700.1. The proposed  Branding Strategy will not be evaluated competitively. The Agreement  Officer will review for adequacy the proposed Branding Strategy, and  will negotiate, approve and include the Branding Strategy in the award.  Failure to submit or negotiate a Branding Strategy within the time  specified by the Agreement Officer will make the apparently successful  applicant ineligible for award.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> After technical evaluation of applications for USAID funding,  USAID Agreement Officers will request apparently successful applicants  to submit a Marking Plan, defined in Sec. 700.1. The Marking Plan may  include requests for approval of Presumptive Exceptions, paragraph (h)  of this section. All estimated costs associated with branding and  marking USAID programs, such as plaques, labels, banners, press events,  promotional materials, and the like, must be included in the total cost  estimate of the grant or cooperative agreement or other assistance  award, and are subject to revision and negotiation with the Agreement  Officer upon submission of the Marking Plan. The Marking Plan will not  be evaluated competitively. The Agreement Officer will review for  adequacy the proposed Marking Plan, and will negotiate, approve and  include the Marking Plan in the award. Failure to submit or negotiate a  Marking Plan within the time specified by the Agreement Officer will  make the apparently successful applicant ineligible for award. Agreement  Officers have the discretion to suspend the implementation requirements  of the Marking Plan if circumstances warrant. Recipients of USAID funded  grant or cooperative agreement or other assistance award or subaward  should retain copies of any specific marking instructions or waivers in  their project, program or activity files.   Agreement Officer's Representatives will be assigned responsibility to  monitor marking requirements on the basis of the approved Marking Plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Presumptive exceptions: (1) The above marking requirements in  Sec. 700.15(a) through (e) may not apply if marking would:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Compromise the intrinsic independence or neutrality of a program  or materials where independence or neutrality is an inherent aspect of  the program and materials, such as election monitoring or ballots, and  voter information literature; political party support or public policy  advocacy or reform; independent media, such as television and radio  broadcasts, newspaper articles and editorials; public service  announcements or public opinion polls and surveys.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Diminish the credibility of audits, reports, analyses, studies,  or policy recommendations whose data or findings must be seen as  independent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Undercut host-country government ``ownership'' of  constitutions, laws, regulations, policies, studies, assessments,  reports, publications, surveys or audits, public service announcements,  or other communications better positioned as ``by'' or ``from'' a  cooperating country ministry or government official.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Impair the functionality of an item, such as sterilized  equipment or spare parts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Incur substantial costs or be impractical, such as items too  small or other otherwise unsuited for individual marking, such as food  in bulk.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Offend local cultural or social norms, or be considered  inappropriate on such items as condoms, toilets, bed pans, or similar  commodities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Conflict with international law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> These exceptions are presumptive, not automatic and must be  approved by the Agreement Officer. Apparently successful applicants may  request approval of one or more of the presumptive exceptions, depending  on the circumstances, in their Marking Plan. The Agreement Officer will  review requests for presumptive exceptions for adequacy, along with the  rest of the Marking Plan. When reviewing a request for approval of a  presumptive exception, the Agreement Officer may review how program  materials will be marked (if at all) if the USAID identity is removed.  Exceptions approved will apply to subrecipients unless otherwise  provided by USAID.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In cases where the Marking Plan has not been complied with, the  Agreement Officer will initiate corrective action. Such action may  involve informing the recipient of a USAID grant or cooperative  agreement or other assistance award or subaward of instances of  noncompliance and requesting that the recipient carry out its  responsibilities as set forth in the Marking Plan and award. Major or  repeated non-compliance with the Marking Plan will be governed by the  uniform suspension and termination procedures set forth at 2 CFR 200.338  through 2 CFR 200.342, and 2 CFR 700.13.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> USAID Principal Officers, defined for purposes of this  provision at Sec. 700.1, may at any time after award waive in whole or  in part the USAID approved Marking Plan, including USAID marking  requirements for each USAID funded program, project, activity, public  communication or commodity, or in exceptional circumstances may make a  waiver by region or country, if the Principal Officer determines that  otherwise USAID required marking would pose compelling political,  safety, or security concerns, or marking would have an adverse impact in  the cooperating country. USAID recipients may request waivers of the  Marking Plan in whole or in part, through the AOR. No marking is  required while a waiver determination is pending. The waiver  determination on safety or security grounds must be made in consultation  with U.S. Government security personnel if available, and must consider  the same information that applies to determinations of the safety and  security of U.S. Government employees in the cooperating country, as  well as any information supplied by the AOR or the recipient for whom  the waiver is sought. When reviewing a request for approval of a waiver,  the Principal Officer may review how program materials will be marked  (if at all) if the USAID Identity is removed. Approved waivers are not  limited in duration but are subject to Principal Officer review at any  time   due to changed circumstances. Approved waivers ``flow down'' to  recipients of subawards unless specified otherwise. Principal Officers  may also authorize the removal of USAID markings already affixed if  circumstances warrant. Principal Officers' determinations regarding  waiver requests are subject to appeal to the Principal Officer's  cognizant Assistant Administrator. Recipients may appeal by submitting a  written request to reconsider the Principal Officer's waiver  determination to the cognizant Assistant Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Non-retroactivity. Marking requirements apply to any obligation  of USAID funds for new awards as of January 2, 2006. Marking  requirements also will apply to new obligations under existing awards,  such as incremental funding actions, as of January 2, 2006, when the  total estimated cost of the existing award has been increased by USAID  or the scope of effort is changed to accommodate any costs associated  with marking. In the event a waiver is rescinded, the marking  requirements will apply from the date forward that the waiver is  rescinded. In the event a waiver is rescinded after the period of  performance as defined in 2 CFR 200.77 but before closeout as defined in  2 CFR 200.16., the USAID mission or operating unit with initial  responsibility to administer the marking requirements must make a cost  benefit analysis as to requiring USAID marking requirements after the  date of completion of the affected programs, projects, activities,  public communications or commodities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> The USAID Identity and other guidance will be provided at no  cost or fee to recipients of USAID grants, cooperative agreements or  other assistance awards or subawards. Additional costs associated with  marking requirements will be met by USAID if reasonable, allowable, and  allocable under 2 CFR part 200, subpart E. The standard cost  reimbursement provisions of the grant, cooperative agreement, other  assistance award or subaward must be followed when applying for  reimbursement of additional marking costs.</p><p class="depth0">PARTS 701	779 [RESERVED]</p>
