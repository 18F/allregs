That Article provides as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No State party shall expel, return (``refouler'') or extradite a  person to another State where there are substantial grounds for  believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds,  the competent authorities shall take into account all relevant  considerations including, where applicable, the existence in the State  concerned of a consistent pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violations  of human rights.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Pursuant to sections 3184 and 3186 of Title 18 of the United  States Criminal Code, the Secretary is the U.S. official responsible for  determining whether to surrender a fugitive to a foreign country by  means of extradition. In order to implement the obligation assumed by  the United States pursuant to Article 3 of the Convention, the  Department considers the question of whether a person facing extradition  from the U.S. ``is more likely than not'' to be tortured in the State  requesting extradition when appropriate in making this determination.</p>
