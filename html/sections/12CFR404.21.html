                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Policy. Ex-Im Bank recognizes the importance of assessing, to the extent reasonably possible, the risks associated with transactions supported by Ex-Im Bank. It is often difficult to assess risks related to individuals and non-publicly trade entities. Therefore, when an individual or a non-publicly traded entity applies for participation in an Ex-Im Bank program or is proposed as a guarantor for an Ex-Im Bank transaction, Ex-Im Bank may request social security and/or U.S. passport numbers from such individual or from the principals of such entity. Ex-Im Bank shall not require submission of this information, and unwillingness or inability to provide a social security or passport number shall not affect Ex-Im Bank's decision on an application for Ex-Im Bank assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Use. Ex-Im Bank shall use social security and passport numbers to assess the creditworthiness of Ex-Im Bank program participants and as a mechanism for enforcing agreements with Ex-Im Bank. Such information shall not be disclosed, except as warranted by law and regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice. Whenever Ex-Im Bank requests a social security or passport number, Ex-Im Bank shall place an appropriate Privacy Act notification on the form used to collect the information.</p>
