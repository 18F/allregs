Sec. 1.381(c)(1)-1  Net operating loss carryovers in certain corporate acquisitions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Carryover requirement. (1) Section 381(c)(1) requires the acquiring corporation to succeed to, and take into account, the net operating loss carryovers of the distributor or transferor corporation. To determine the amount of these carryovers as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer, and to integrate them with any carryovers and carrybacks of the acquiring corporation for purposes of determining the taxable income of the acquiring corporation for taxable years ending after the date of distribution or transfer, it is necessary to apply the provisions of section 172 in accordance with the conditions and limitations of section 381(c)(1) and this section. See also section 382(b) and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Section 381(c)(1) requires the acquiring corporation to succeed to, and take into account, the net operating loss carryovers of the distributor or transferor corporation.

The net operating loss carryovers of a distributor or transferor corporation as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer shall be determined without reference to any net operating loss of the acquiring corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of the tax imposed under section 56, the acquiring corporation succeeding to and taking into account any net operating loss carryovers of the distributor or transferor corporation shall also succeed to and take into account along with such net operating loss carryforward any deferred tax liability under section 56(b) and the regulations thereunder attributable to such net operating loss carryover.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Carryback of net operating losses. A net operating loss of the acquiring corporation for any taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer shall not be carried back in computing the taxable income of a distributor or transferor corporation. However, a net operating loss of the acquiring corporation for any such taxable year shall be carried back in accordance with section 172(b) in computing the taxable income of the acquiring corporation for a taxable year ending on or before the date of distribution or transfer. If a distributor or transferor corporation remains in existence after the date of distribution or transfer, a net operating loss sustained by it for any taxable year beginning after such date shall be carried back in accordance with section 172(b) in computing the taxable income of such corporation for a taxable year ending on or before that date, but may not be carried back or over in computing the taxable income of the acquiring corporation. This paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On December 31, 1954, X Corporation merged into Y Corporation in a statutory merger to which section 361 applies, and the charter of Y Corporation continued after the merger. Y Corporation sustained a net operating loss for the calendar year 1955. Y Corporation's net operating loss for 1955 may not be carried back in computing the taxable income of X Corporation but shall be carried back in computing the taxable income of Y Corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. On December 31, 1954, X Corporation and Y Corporation transferred all their assets to Z Corporation in a statutory consolidation to which section 361 applies. Z Corporation sustained a net operating loss for the calendar year 1955. Z Corporation's net operating loss for 1955 may not be carried back in computing the taxable income of X Corporation or Y Corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. On December 31, 1954, X Corporation ceased all operations (other than liquidating activities) and transferred substantially all its properties to Y Corporation in a reorganization qualifying under section 368(a)(1)(C). Such properties comprised all of X Corporation's properties which were to be transferred pursuant to the reorganization. In the process of liquidating its assets and winding up its affairs, X Corporation sustained a net operating loss for its taxable year beginning on January 1, 1955. This net operating loss of X Corporation shall be carried back in computing the taxable income of that corporation but may not be carried back or over in computing the taxable income of Y Corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> First taxable year to which carryovers apply. (1) The net operating loss carryovers available to the distributor or transferor corporation as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer shall first be carried to the first taxable year of the acquiring corporation ending after that date. This rule applies irrespective of whether the date of distribution or transfer is on the last day, or any other day, of the acquiring corporation's taxable year. Thus, such net operating loss carryovers shall first be used by the acquiring corporation with respect to the computation of its net operating loss deduction under section 172(a), and its taxable income determined under the provisions of section 172(b)(2), for such first taxable year. However, see paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The net operating loss carryovers available to the distributor or transferor corporation as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer shall first be carried to the first taxable year of the acquiring corporation ending after that date. This rule applies irrespective of whether the date of distribution or transfer is on the last day, or any other day, of the acquiring corporation's taxable year. Thus, such net operating loss carryovers shall first be used by the acquiring corporation with respect to the computation of its net operating loss deduction under section 172(a), and its taxable income determined under the provisions of section 172(b)(2), for such first taxable year. However, see paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The net operating loss carryovers available to the distributor or transferor corporation as of the close of the date of distribution or transfer shall be carried to the acquiring corporation without diminution by reason of the fact that the acquiring corporation does not acquire 100 percent of the assets of the distributor or transferor corporation. Thus, if a parent corporation owning 80 percent of all classes of stock of its subsidiary corporation were to acquire its share of the assets of the subsidiary corporation upon a complete liquidation described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of Sec. 1.381(a)-1, then, subject to the conditions and limitations of this section, 100 percent of the net operating loss carryovers available to the subsidiary corporation as of the close of the date of distribution would be carried over to the parent corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Limitation on net operating loss deduction for first taxable year ending after date of distribution or transfer. (1) That part of the acquiring corporation's net operating loss deduction, determined in accordance with sections 172(a) and 381(c)(1), for its first taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer which is attributable to the net operating loss carryovers of the distributor or transferor corporation, is limited by section 381(c)(1)(B) and this paragraph to an amount equal to

the acquiring corporation's postacquisition part year taxable income.

Section 1212 provides that a net capital loss sustained in any taxable year (hereinafter referred to as the ``loss year'') shall be carried over to each of the five succeeding taxable years and treated in each of such succeeding years as a short-term capital loss to the extent not allowed as a deduction against any capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) of any taxable years intervening between the loss year and the taxable year to which such loss is carried. For this purpose, the capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) of any intervening taxable year is determined without regard to the net capital loss for the loss year or for any taxable year thereafter, and the various capital loss carryovers from taxable years preceding the loss year to any such intervening taxable year are considered to be applied in reduction of the capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) for such year in the order of the taxable years in which the losses were sustained, beginning with the loss for the earliest preceding taxable year.

For this purpose, the capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) of any intervening taxable year is determined without regard to the net capital loss for the loss year or for any taxable year thereafter, and the various capital loss carryovers from taxable years preceding the loss year to any such intervening taxable year are considered to be applied in reduction of the capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) for such year in the order of the taxable years in which the losses were sustained, beginning with the loss for the earliest preceding taxable year. The application of these rules to the capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) of the acquiring corporation for any taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer involves the use of carryovers of the distributor or transferor corporation and of the acquiring corporation. In determining the order in which the capital loss carryovers of the distributor or transferor and acquiring corporations from taxable years ending on or before the date of distribution or transfer are considered to be applied in reduction of the capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) of the acquiring corporation for any intervening taxable year ending after such date, the following rules shall apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Each taxable year of the distributor or transferor and acquiring corporations which, with respect to the first taxable year of the acquiring corporation ending after the date of distribution or transfer, constitutes a first preceding taxable year, shall be treated as if each such year ended on the same day, whether or not such taxable years actually end on the same day.

The taxable years to which a net capital loss shall be carried are prescribed by section 1212. Since the taxable year of a distributor or transferor corporation ends with the close of the date of distribution or transfer, such taxable year and the first taxable year of the acquiring corporation which ends after that date are considered two separate taxable years to which a net capital loss of the distributor or transferor corporation for any taxable year ending before that date shall be carried. This rule applies even though the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation which ends on the date of distribution or transfer is a period of less than twelve months. However, the distribution or transfer has no effect in determining under section 1212 the taxable years to which a net capital loss of the acquiring corporation is carried. For this purpose, the first taxable year of the acquiring corporation which ends after the date of distribution or transfer constitutes only one taxable year even though such taxable year is considered under paragraph (e) of this section as two taxable years for certain purposes.

Sec. 1.381(c)(4)-1  Method of accounting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Introduction--(1) Purpose. This section provides guidance regarding the method of accounting or combination of methods (other than inventory and depreciation methods) an acquiring corporation must use following a distribution or transfer to which sections 381(a) and 381(c)(4) apply and how to implement any associated change in method of accounting. See Sec. 1.381(c)(5)-1 for guidance regarding the inventory method an acquiring corporation must use following a distribution or transfer to which sections 381(a) and 381(c)(5) apply. See Sec. 1.381(c)(6)-1 for guidance regarding the depreciation method an acquiring corporation must use following a distribution or transfer to which sections 381(a) and 381(c)(6) apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Purpose. This section provides guidance regarding the method of accounting or combination of methods (other than inventory and depreciation methods) an acquiring corporation must use following a distribution or transfer to which sections 381(a) and 381(c)(4) apply and how to implement any associated change in method of accounting. See Sec. 1.381(c)(5)-1 for guidance regarding the inventory method an acquiring corporation must use following a distribution or transfer to which sections 381(a) and 381(c)(5) apply. See Sec. 1.381(c)(6)-1 for guidance regarding the depreciation method an acquiring corporation must use following a distribution or transfer to which sections 381(a) and 381(c)(6) apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Carryover method requirement for separate and distinct trades or businesses. In a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, if an acquiring corporation continues to operate a trade or business of the parties to the section 381(a) transaction as a separate and distinct trade or business after the date of distribution or transfer, the acquiring corporation must use a carryover method as defined in paragraph (b)(5) of this section for each continuing trade or business, unless either the carryover method is impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or the acquiring corporation changes the carryover method in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The carryover method requirement applies to the overall method of accounting (for example, an accrual method of accounting) and any special method of accounting (for example, the percentage of completion method of accounting described in section 460) as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section used by each trade or business after the date of distribution or transfer. The acquiring corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to continue a carryover method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Principal method requirement for trades or businesses not operated as separate and distinct trades or businesses. In a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, if an acquiring corporation does not operate the trades or businesses of the parties to the section 381(a) transaction as separate and distinct trades or businesses after the date of distribution or transfer, the acquiring corporation must use a principal method determined under paragraph (c) of this section, unless either the principal method is impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or the acquiring corporation changes the principal method in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The principal method requirement applies to the overall method of accounting (for example, the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting) and any special method of accounting (for example, the installment method under section 453) as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section used by each integrated trade or business after the date of distribution or transfer. The acquiring corporation must change to a principal method in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section for each integrated trade or business and need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use a principal method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Carryover method or principal method not a permissible method. If a carryover method or principal method is not a permissible method of accounting, the acquiring corporation must secure the Commissioner's consent to change to a permissible method of accounting as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. If the acquiring corporation must use a single method of accounting for a particular item after the date of distribution or transfer regardless of the number of separate and distinct trades or businesses operated on that date, the acquiring corporation must use the principal method for that item as determined under paragraph (c) of this section, unless either the principal method is impermissible and must be changed under this paragraph (a)(4) or the acquiring corporation changes the

principal method in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Voluntary change. Any party to a section 381(a) transaction may request permission under section 446(e) to change a method of accounting for the taxable year in which the transaction occurs or is expected to occur. For trades or businesses that will not operate as separate and distinct trades or businesses after the date of distribution or transfer, a change in method of accounting for the taxable year that includes that date will be granted only if the requested method is the method that the acquiring corporation must use after the date of distribution or transfer. The time and manner of obtaining the Commissioner's consent to change to a different method of accounting is described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (a). Unless otherwise noted, the carryover method is a permissible method of accounting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. X Corporation operates an employment agency that uses the overall cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting. T Corporation operates an educational institution that uses an overall accrual method of accounting. X Corporation acquires the assets of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation operates the employment agency as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from the educational institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation operates the employment agency as a separate and distinct trade or business, under paragraph (a)(2) of this section X Corporation must use the carryover method for each continuing trade or business, unless either the carryover method is impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or X Corporation changes the carryover method in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. As defined in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the carryover method for the employment agency is the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting and the carryover method for the educational institution is the accrual method of accounting used by T Corporation immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. There is no change in method of accounting, and X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use either carryover method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. X Corporation provides personal grooming consulting and T Corporation provides weight management consulting. Both X Corporation and T Corporation use the same overall accrual method of accounting. X Corporation has elected to use the recurring item exception under Sec. 1.461-5. T Corporation does not use the recurring item exception. X Corporation acquires the assets of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation operates the personal grooming consulting business as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from the weight management consulting business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because after the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation operates the personal grooming consulting business as a separate and distinct trade or business, under paragraph (a)(2) of this section X Corporation must use a carryover method for each continuing trade or business, unless either the carryover method is impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or X Corporation changes the carryover method in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. As defined in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the carryover method for the overall method of accounting for each trade or business is the accrual method used immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. The carryover method for the special method of accounting for the personal grooming consulting business is the recurring item exception under Sec. 1.461-5 while the carryover method for the weight management consulting business is not to use the recurring item exception under Sec. 1.461-5. There is no change in method of accounting, and X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use the carryover methods of accounting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. X Corporation is an engineering firm that uses the overall cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting and has elected under section 171 to amortize bond premium with respect to its taxable bonds acquired at a premium. T Corporation is a manufacturer that uses an overall accrual method of accounting and has not made a section 171 election to amortize bond premium with respect to its taxable bonds acquired at a premium. X Corporation acquires the assets of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation operates the engineering firm as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from the manufacturing business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation operates the engineering firm as a separate and distinct trade or business, under paragraph (a)(2) of this section X Corporation must use a carryover method for each continuing trade or business, unless either the carryover method is impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or X Corporation changes the carryover method in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. As defined in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the carryover method for the overall method of accounting for the engineering firm is the cash receipts and disbursements method used by X Corporation immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer, and the carryover method for the overall method of accounting for the manufacturing business is the accrual method used by T Corporation immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. There is no change in method of accounting, and X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use either carryover method. Notwithstanding that after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation has two separate and distinct trades or businesses, X Corporation is permitted only one method of accounting for amortizable bond premium under section 171. Because after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation must use a single method of accounting for bond premium for all trades or businesses, X Corporation must use the principal method for that item as determined under paragraph (c) of this section, unless either the principal method is impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or X Corporation changes that method in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. X Corporation must change to the principal method in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section. If amortizing bond premium is not the principal method, X Corporation may make an election to amortize bond premium to the extent permitted by section 171. See paragraph (e)(2) of this section for rules on making elections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions.

For each integrated trade or business, the principal method is generally the method of accounting used by the component trade or business of the acquiring corporation immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. If, however, the component trade or business of the distributor or transferor corporation is larger than the component trade or business of the acquiring corporation on the date of distribution or transfer, the principal method is the method used by the component trade or business of the distributor or transferor corporation immediately prior to that date. If the larger component trade or business does not have a special method of accounting for a particular item immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer, the principal method for that item is the method of accounting used by the component trade or business that does have a special method of accounting for that

For each integrated trade or business, the component trade or business of the distributor or transferor corporation is larger than the component trade or business of the acquiring corporation on the date of distribution or transfer if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The aggregate of the adjusted bases of the assets held by each component trade or business of the distributor or transferor corporation (determined under section 1011 and any applicable Income Tax Regulations) exceeds the aggregate of the adjusted bases of the assets of each component trade or business of the acquiring corporation immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The aggregate of the gross receipts for a representative period of each component trade or business of the distributor or transferor corporation exceeds the aggregate of the gross receipts for the same period of each component trade or business of the acquiring corporation. See paragraph (e)(5) of this section for rules on determining the representative period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Multiple component trades or businesses with different principal methods. If a party to the section 381(a) transaction has multiple component trades or businesses and more than one principal overall method of accounting or more than one principal special method of accounting for an item, then the acquiring corporation may choose which of the principal methods of accounting used by such component trades or businesses will be the principal methods of the integrated trade or business. The acquiring corporation must choose a principal method that is a permissible method of accounting. In general, a change to a principal method in a transaction to which section 381(a) and paragraph (a)(3) of this section applies is made under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (c). Unless otherwise noted, the principal method is a permissible method of accounting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. X Corporation and T Corporation each operate an employment agency. X Corporation uses the overall cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, and T Corporation uses an overall accrual method of accounting. X Corporation acquires the assets of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. The adjusted bases of the assets in X Corporation's employment agency immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer exceed the adjusted bases of the assets in T Corporation's employment agency, and the gross receipts in X Corporation's employment agency for the representative period exceed the gross receipts of T Corporation's employment agency for the period. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation's employment agency will not be operated as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from T Corporation's employment agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation will not operate its employment agency as a separate and distinct trade or business, X Corporation must use a principal method under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, unless either the principal method is impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or X Corporation changes the principal method in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. Because on the date of distribution or transfer T Corporation's employment agency is not larger than X Corporation's employment agency, the principal method for the overall method of accounting is the cash receipts and disbursements method used by X Corporation's employment agency. X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use this method of accounting. However, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change the method of accounting for the employment agency acquired from T Corporation to the cash receipts and disbursements method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example (1), except that the gross receipts of T Corporation's employment agency for the representative period exceed the gross receipts of X Corporation's employment agency for the period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The result is the same as in Example (1). Although the gross receipts of T Corporation's employment agency exceed the gross receipts of X Corporation's employment agency, T Corporation's employment agency is not larger than X Corporation's employment agency because the adjusted bases of the assets of T Corporation's employment agency do not exceed the adjusted

bases of the assets of X Corporation's employment agency. Thus, the principal method for the overall method of accounting is the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting used by X Corporation's employment agency immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use this method of accounting. However, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change the method of accounting for the employment agency business acquired from T Corporation to the cash receipts and disbursements method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example (2), except that the adjusted bases of the assets held by T Corporation's employment agency immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer exceed the adjusted bases of the assets held by X Corporation's employment agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The principal method for the overall method of accounting is the accrual method of accounting used by T Corporation's employment agency immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer because on the date of distribution or transfer T Corporation's employment agency is larger than X Corporation's employment agency. The adjusted bases of the assets of T Corporation's employment agency exceed the adjusted bases of the assets of X Corporation's employment agency, and the gross receipts of T Corporation's employment agency exceed the gross receipts of X Corporation's employment agency. X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use this method of accounting. However, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change the method of accounting for the employment agency business it operated prior to the date of distribution or transfer to the accrual method of accounting used by T Corporation's employment agency immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example (1), except that X Corporation is prohibited under section 448 from using the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting after the date of distribution or transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because section 448 prohibits X Corporation from using the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, X Corporation is not permitted to use the principal method for the overall method of accounting as determined in Example (1). Because after the date of distribution or transfer that method is not a permissible method, under paragraph (a)(4) of this section X Corporation must secure the Commissioner's consent to change to a permissible method in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example (4), except that T Corporation wants to discontinue using the overall accrual method of accounting for its employment agency and change to the cash receipts and disbursements method for the taxable year in which the section 381(a) transaction occurs or is expected to occur.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Under paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the Commissioner will grant a request to change a method of accounting for the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer only if the requested method is the method that the acquiring corporation must use after the date of distribution or transfer. The Commissioner will not consent to a request by T Corporation to change to the cash receipts and disbursements method for the taxable year in which the section 381(a) transaction occurs or is expected to occur because X Corporation cannot use the cash receipts and disbursements method after the date of distribution or transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. X Corporation and T Corporation each publishes magazines. X Corporation acquires the assets of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. Both X Corporation and T Corporation use an overall accrual method of accounting. X Corporation has elected to defer income from its subscription sales under section 455. T Corporation has not elected to defer income from its subscription sales under section 455 and instead has recognized the income from these sales in accordance with section 451. The adjusted bases of the assets in X Corporation's publication business immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer exceed the adjusted bases of the assets in T Corporation's publication business, and the gross receipts in X Corporation's publication business for the representative period exceed the gross receipts in T Corporation's publication business for the representative period. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation will not operate its publication business as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from T Corporation's publication business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation will not operate its publication business as a separate and distinct trade or business, X Corporation must use the principal method under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, unless either the principal method is impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or X Corporation changes the principal method in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The adjusted

bases of the assets in T Corporation's publication business do not exceed the adjusted bases of the assets in X Corporation's publication business, and the gross receipts in T Corporation's publication business do not exceed the gross receipts in X Corporation's publication business. Because on the date of distribution or transfer T Corporation's publication business is not larger than X Corporation's publication business, the principal method for the overall method of accounting is the accrual method used by X Corporation's publication business immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. The principal method for subscription sales is the section 455 deferral method used by X Corporation immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use the principal method for either the overall method of accounting or the special method of accounting. However, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change both the overall method of accounting and the special method of accounting for the publication business acquired from T Corporation to the accrual method and the section 455 deferral method used by X Corporation immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example (6), except that the adjusted bases of the assets in T Corporation's publication business immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer exceed the adjusted bases of the assets in X Corporation's business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The result is the same as in Example (6). Because on the date of distribution or transfer T Corporation's publication business is not larger than X Corporation's publication business, the principal method for the overall method of accounting is the accrual method used by X Corporation's publication business immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. The principal method for subscription sales is the section 455 deferral method used by X Corporation immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use the principal method for either the overall method of accounting or the special method of accounting. However, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change both the overall method of accounting and the special method of accounting for the publication business acquired from T Corporation to the accrual method and the section 455 deferral method used by X Corporation immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. X Corporation and T Corporation both install ice skating rinks. Both X Corporation and T Corporation use an overall accrual method of accounting for their respective businesses. X Corporation completes its installation contracts within the contracting year and uses an accrual method of accounting to recognize the revenue from its installation contracts. T Corporation's installation contracts are subject to section 460, and T Corporation recognizes the revenue from such contracts under the percentage-of-completion method. X Corporation acquires the assets of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. The adjusted bases of the assets in X Corporation's installation business immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer exceed the adjusted bases of the assets in T Corporation's installation business, and the gross receipts in X Corporation's installation business for the representative period exceed the gross receipts in T Corporation's installation business for the representative period. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation will not operate its installation business as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from T Corporation's installation business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation will not operate its installation business as a separate and distinct trade or business, X Corporation must use a principal method under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, unless either the principal method is impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or X Corporation changes the principal method in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The adjusted bases of the assets in T Corporation's installation business do not exceed the adjusted bases of the assets in X Corporation's installation business, and the gross receipts in T Corporation's installation business do not exceed the gross receipts in X Corporation's installation business. Because on the date of distribution or transfer T Corporation's installation business is not larger than X Corporation's installation business, the principal method for the overall method of accounting is the accrual method used by X Corporation's installation business immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use the principal method for the overall method of accounting. However, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change the overall method of accounting for the installation business acquired from T Corporation to the accrual method used by X Corporation. Under paragraph (c) of this section, the principal method for T Corporation's long-term contracts is the percentage-of-completion method used by T Corporation immediately prior to the date of distribution

or transfer because X Corporation's installation business does not have a method of accounting for long-term contracts. There is no change in method of accounting, and X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use T Corporation's percentage-of-completion method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. X Corporation operates a tennis academy as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from its trade or business of operating a golf academy. X Corporation uses the overall cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting for the tennis academy and an overall accrual method of accounting for the golf academy. T Corporation operates a tennis academy and uses an accrual method of accounting for the overall method. X Corporation acquires the assets of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation will not operate its tennis academy as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from T Corporation's tennis academy. X Corporation will continue to operate its golf academy as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from the operation of the tennis academy. The adjusted bases of the assets in T Corporation's tennis academy exceed the adjusted bases of the assets in X Corporation's tennis academy immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. The gross receipts of T Corporation's tennis academy for the representative period exceed the gross receipts of X Corporation's tennis academy for that period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation will not operate its tennis academy as a separate and distinct trade or business, X Corporation must use a principal method under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, unless either the principal method is impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or X Corporation changes the principal method in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. Because on the date of distribution or transfer the tennis academy operated by T Corporation is larger than the tennis academy operated by X Corporation, the principal method for the overall method of accounting for the combined tennis academy business is the accrual method used by T Corporation's tennis academy immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use the principal method for the overall method of accounting. However, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change the method of accounting for its tennis academy to the accrual method. Because X Corporation will operate the golf academy as a separate trade or business, under paragraph (a)(2) of this section X Corporation must continue to use the accrual method that it used immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer as the carryover method for the golf academy. There is no change in method of accounting, and X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use the carryover method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example (9), except that after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation will not operate its golf academy as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from the tennis academy. In addition, X Corporation's component trades or businesses are larger than T Corporation's component trade or business: (1) the adjusted bases of the assets of X Corporation's tennis academy and golf academy businesses, in the aggregate, exceed the adjusted bases of the assets held by T Corporation's tennis academy; and (2) the gross receipts for the representative period of X Corporation's tennis academy and golf academy businesses, in the aggregate, exceed the gross receipts in T Corporation's tennis academy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because on the date of distribution or transfer T Corporation's tennis academy is not larger than X Corporation's combined tennis academy and golf academy, the principal method for the overall method of accounting is the method of accounting used by the component trades or businesses of X Corporation that will be combined with T Corporation's component trade or business on that date. Because on the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation operates two component trades or businesses with different overall methods of accounting that will be integrated after the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation may choose under paragraph (c)(2) of this section which overall method (and any special method of accounting) used by its component trades or businesses will be the principal method. X Corporation may choose to use either the accrual method used by the golf academy or the cash receipts and disbursements method used by its tennis academy as the principal method after the date of distribution or transfer, if either method is a permissible method. In accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change T Corporation's overall method of accounting to the principal method. Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, X Corporation also must change either its golf academy business or its tennis academy business, depending on which principal method X Corporation selects, to the principal method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Procedures for changing a method of accounting--(1) Change made to principal method under paragraph (a)(3) of this section--(i) Section 481(a) adjustment--(A) In general.

The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (d)(1)(i):</p><p class="depth0">Example. X Corporation uses the overall cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, and T Corporation uses an overall accrual method of accounting. X Corporation acquires the assets of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. X Corporation determines that under the rules of paragraph (c)(1) of this section X Corporation must change the method of accounting for the business acquired from T Corporation to the cash receipts and disbursements method. X Corporation will determine the section 481(a) adjustment pertaining to the change to the cash receipts and disbursements method by consolidating the adjustments (whether the amounts thereof represent increases or decreases in items of income or deductions) arising with respect to balances in the various accounts, such as accounts receivable, as of the beginning of the day that immediately follows the day on which X Corporation acquires the assets of T Corporation. X Corporation will reflect this adjustment, or an appropriate part thereof, on its federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Audit protection. Notwithstanding any other provision in any other Income Tax Regulation or administrative procedure, no audit protection is provided for any change in method of accounting under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Other terms and conditions. Except as otherwise provided in this section, other terms and conditions provided in Sec. 1.446-1(e) and the applicable administrative procedures for voluntary changes in method of accounting under section 446(e) apply to a change in method of accounting under this section. Thus, for example, if the administrative procedures for a particular change in method of accounting have a term and condition that provides for the acceleration of the section 481(a) adjustment period, this term and condition applies to a change made under this paragraph (d)(1). However, any scope limitation in the applicable administrative procedures will not apply for purposes of making a change under this paragraph (d)(1). For example, if the administrative procedures provide as a limitation that an identical change in method of accounting is barred for a period of years, this limitation will not bar a change to the principal method made under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Change made to a method of accounting under paragraph (a)(4) or (a)(5) of this section--(i) In general. A party to

a section 381(a) transaction that changes a method of accounting under either paragraph (a)(4) or paragraph (a)(5) of this section must follow the provisions of Sec. 1.446-(1)(e) and the applicable administrative procedures, including scope limitations, for voluntary changes in method of accounting under section 446(e), except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) and (d)(2)(iii) of this section. An application on Form 3115, ``Application for Change in Accounting Method,'' filed with the IRS to change a method of accounting under this paragraph (d)(2) should be labeled ``Filed under section 381(c)(4)'' at the top.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A party to

a section 381(a) transaction that changes a method of accounting under either paragraph (a)(4) or paragraph (a)(5) of this section must follow the provisions of Sec. 1.446-(1)(e) and the applicable administrative procedures, including scope limitations, for voluntary changes in method of accounting under section 446(e), except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) and (d)(2)(iii) of this section. An application on Form 3115, ``Application for Change in Accounting Method,'' filed with the IRS to change a method of accounting under this paragraph (d)(2) should be labeled ``Filed under section 381(c)(4)'' at the top.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Final year limitation. Any scope limitation relating to the final year of a trade or business will not apply to a taxpayer that changes its method of accounting in the final year of a trade or business that is terminated as the result of a section 381(a) transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Time to file. Under the authority of Sec. 1.446-1(e)(3)(ii), for a change in method of accounting requiring advance consent, the application for a change in method of accounting (for example, Form 3115) must be filed with the IRS on or before the later of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The due date for filing a Form 3115 as specified in Sec. 1.446-1(e), for example, the last day of the taxable year in which the distribution or transfer occurred, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The earlier of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The day that is 180 days after the date of distribution or transfer, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The day on which the acquiring corporation files its federal income tax return for the taxable year in which the distribution or transfer occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Rules and procedures--(1) No method of accounting. If a party to a section 381(a) transaction is not using a method of accounting, does not have a method of accounting for a particular item, or came into existence as a result of the transaction, the party will not be treated as having a method of accounting different from that used by another party to the section 381(a) transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> No method of accounting. If a party to a section 381(a) transaction is not using a method of accounting, does not have a method of accounting for a particular item, or came into existence as a result of the transaction, the party will not be treated as having a method of accounting different from that used by another party to the section 381(a) transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Elections and adoptions allowed. If an election does not require the Commissioner's consent, an acquiring corporation or a distributor or transferor corporation is not precluded from making any election that is otherwise permissible for the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer. For purposes of this section, a corporation shall be deemed as having made any election as of the first day of the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer. Similarly, where adoption is permissible, an acquiring corporation or a distributor or transferor corporation may adopt any permissible method of accounting for the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Elections continue after section 381(a) transaction--(i) General rule. An acquiring corporation is not required to renew any election not otherwise requiring renewal and previously made by it or by a distributor or transferor corporation for a carryover method or a principal method if the acquiring corporation uses the method after the section 381(a) transaction. If the acquiring corporation uses a method after the date of distribution or transfer, an election made by the acquiring corporation or by a distributor or transferor corporation for that method that was in effect on the date of distribution or transfer continues after the section 381(a) transaction as though the distribution or transfer had not occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. An acquiring corporation is not required to renew any election not otherwise requiring renewal and previously made by it or by a distributor or transferor corporation for a carryover method or a principal method if the acquiring corporation uses the method after the section 381(a) transaction. If the acquiring corporation uses a method after the date of distribution or transfer, an election made by the acquiring corporation or by a distributor or transferor corporation for that method that was in effect on the date of distribution or transfer continues after the section 381(a) transaction as though the distribution or transfer had not occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (e)(3):</p><p class="depth0">Example. The acquiring corporation, X Corporation, previously elected to amortize bond premium under section 171. X Corporation acquires the assets of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. X Corporation determines under the rules of paragraph (c)(1) of this section that X Corporation's method of amortizing bond premium is the principal method. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation is not required to renew its bond premium amortization election and is bound by it. Additionally, X Corporation would not be required to renew its election to amortize bond premium if the method were the carryover method under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Appropriate times for certain determinations--(i) Determining the method of accounting. The method of accounting used by a party to a section 381(a) transaction on the date of distribution or transfer is the method of accounting used by that party as of the end of the

day that is immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determining the method of accounting. The method of accounting used by a party to a section 381(a) transaction on the date of distribution or transfer is the method of accounting used by that party as of the end of the

day that is immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determining whether there are separate and distinct trades or businesses after the date of distribution or transfer. Whether an acquiring corporation will operate the trades or businesses of the parties to a section 381(a) transaction as separate and distinct trades or businesses after the date of distribution or transfer will be determined as of the date of distribution or transfer based upon the facts and circumstances. Intent to combine books and records of the trades or businesses may be demonstrated by contemporaneous records and documents or by other objective evidence that reflects the acquiring corporation's ultimate plan of operation, even though the actual combination of the books and records may extend beyond the end of the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Representative period for aggregating gross receipts. The representative period for measuring gross receipts is generally the 12 consecutive months preceding the date of distribution or transfer. If a component trade or business was not in existence for the 12 consecutive months preceding the date of distribution or transfer, then all component trades or businesses of each integrated trade or business will compare their gross receipts for the period that such trade or business was in existence. For example, if the acquiring corporation's component trade or business was formed in August and the date of distribution or transfer occurred in December of the same year, the gross receipts for those five months will be compared with the gross receipts of the other component trades or businesses for the same period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Establishing a method of accounting. A method of accounting used by the distributor or transferor corporation immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer that continues to be used by the acquiring corporation after the date of distribution or transfer is an established method of accounting for purposes of section 446(e), whether or not such method is proper or is permitted under the Internal Revenue Code or any applicable Income Tax Regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Other applicable provisions. This section does not preempt any other provision of the Internal Revenue Code or the Income Tax Regulations that is applicable to the acquiring corporation's circumstances. For example, income, deductions, credits, allowances, and exclusions may be allocated among the parties to a section 381(a) transaction and other taxpayers under sections 269 and 482, if appropriate. Similarly, transfers of contracts accounted for using a long-term contract method of accounting are governed by the rules provided in Sec. 1.460-4(k). Further, if other paragraphs of section 381(c) apply for purposes of determining the methods of accounting to be used following the date of distribution or transfer, section 381(c)(4) and this Sec. 1.381(c)(4)-1 will not apply to the tax treatment of the items. For example, this section does not apply to inventories that an acquiring corporation obtains in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. Instead, the rules of section 381(c)(5) govern the inventory method to be used by the acquiring corporation after the distribution or transfer. Similarly, if the acquiring corporation assumes an obligation of the distributor or transferor corporation that gives rise to a liability after the date of distribution or transfer and to which Sec. 1.381(c)(16)-1 applies, the deductibility of the item is determined under this section only after the rules of section 381(c)(16) are applied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Character of items of income and deduction. After the date of distribution or transfer, items of income and deduction have the same character in the hands of the acquiring corporation as they would have had in the hands of the distributor or transferor corporation if no distribution or transfer had occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Method of accounting selected by project or job. If other sections of the Internal Revenue Code, Income Tax Regulations, or other administrative guidance permit an acquiring corporation to elect a method of accounting on a project-by-project, job-by-job, or other similar basis, then for purposes of this section the method elected with respect to each project or job is the established method only for that project or job. For example, the election under

section 460 to classify a contract to perform both manufacturing and construction activities as a long-term construction contract if at least 95 percent of the estimated total allocable contract costs are reasonably allocated to the construction activities is made on a contract-by-contract basis. Accordingly, the method of accounting previously elected for a project or job generally continues after the date of distribution or transfer. However, if the trades or businesses of the parties to a section 381(a) transaction are not operated as separate and distinct trades or businesses after the date of distribution or transfer, and two or more of the parties to the section 381(a) transaction previously worked on the same project or job and used different methods of accounting for the project or job immediately before the distribution or transfer, then the acquiring corporation must determine the principal method for that project or job under paragraph (c) of this section and make changes, if necessary, to the principal method in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Impermissible method of accounting. This section does not limit the Commissioner's ability under section 446(b) to determine whether a taxpayer's method of accounting is an impermissible method or otherwise fails to clearly reflect income. For example, an acquiring corporation may not use the method of accounting determined under paragraph (a)(2) of this section if the method fails to clearly reflect the acquiring corporation's income within the meaning of section 446(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section applies to corporate reorganizations and tax-free liquidations described in section 381(a) that occur on or after August 31, 2011.

Sec. 1.381(c)(5)-1  Inventory method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Introduction--(1) Purpose. This section provides guidance regarding the inventory method an acquiring corporation must use following a distribution or transfer to which sections 381(a) and 381(c)(5) apply and how to implement any associated change in method of accounting. See Sec. 1.381(c)(4)-1 for guidance regarding the method of accounting or combination of methods (other than inventory and depreciation methods) an acquiring corporation must use following a distribution or transfer to which sections 381(a) and 381(c)(4) apply. See Sec. 1.381(c)(6)-1 for guidance regarding the depreciation method an acquiring corporation must use following a distribution or transfer to which sections 381(a) and 381(c)(6) apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Purpose. This section provides guidance regarding the inventory method an acquiring corporation must use following a distribution or transfer to which sections 381(a) and 381(c)(5) apply and how to implement any associated change in method of accounting. See Sec. 1.381(c)(4)-1 for guidance regarding the method of accounting or combination of methods (other than inventory and depreciation methods) an acquiring corporation must use following a distribution or transfer to which sections 381(a) and 381(c)(4) apply. See Sec. 1.381(c)(6)-1 for guidance regarding the depreciation method an acquiring corporation must use following a distribution or transfer to which sections 381(a) and 381(c)(6) apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Carryover method requirement for separate and distinct trades or businesses. In a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, if an acquiring corporation continues to operate a trade or business of the parties to the section 381(a) transaction as a separate and distinct trade or business after the date of distribution or transfer, the acquiring corporation must use a carryover method as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section for each continuing trade or business, unless either the carryover method is impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or the acquiring corporation changes the carryover method in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The acquiring corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to continue a carryover method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Principal method requirement for trades or businesses not operated as separate and distinct trades or businesses. In a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, if an acquiring corporation does not operate the trades or businesses of the parties to the section 381(a) transaction as separate and distinct trades or businesses after the date of distribution or transfer, the acquiring corporation must use a principal method determined under paragraph (c) of this section, unless either the principal method is impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or the acquiring corporation changes the principal method in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The acquiring corporation must change to a principal method in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section for each integrated trade or business and need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use a principal method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Carryover method or principal method not a permissible method. If a carryover method or principal method is not a permissible inventory method, the acquiring corporation must secure the Commissioner's consent to change to a permissible inventory method as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. If the acquiring corporation must use a single inventory method for a particular type of goods after the date of distribution or transfer regardless of the number of separate and distinct trades or businesses operated on that date, the acquiring corporation must use the principal method for that type of goods as determined under paragraph (c) of this section, unless either the principal method is impermissible and must be changed under this paragraph (a)(4) or the acquiring corporation changes the principal method in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Voluntary change. Any party to a section 381(a) transaction may request permission under section 446(e) to change an inventory method for the taxable year in which the transaction occurs or is expected to occur. For trades or businesses that will not operate as separate and distinct trades or businesses after the date of distribution or transfer, a change in method of accounting for the taxable year that includes that date will be granted only if the requested inventory method is the method that the acquiring corporation must use after the date of distribution or transfer. The time and manner of obtaining the Commissioner's consent to change to a different inventory method is described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (a). Unless otherwise noted, the carryover method is a permissible inventory method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. X Corporation manufactures radios and television sets. X Corporation uses the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of inventory identification, the cost method of valuing its inventories, and capitalizes inventory costs in accordance with section 263A. T Corporation manufactures washing machines and dryers. T Corporation uses the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of inventory identification, the cost method of valuing its inventories, and capitalizes inventory costs under section 263A using methods other than those used by X Corporation. X Corporation acquires the inventory of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation operates its radio and television manufacturing business as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from its washing machines and dryers manufacturing business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation operates its manufacturing businesses as separate and distinct trades or businesses, under paragraph (a)(2) of this section X Corporation must use the carryover methods for each continuing trade or business, unless either the carryover methods are impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or X Corporation changes the carryover methods in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. As defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the carryover methods for the radios and television sets manufacturing business are the FIFO method, the cost basis of valuation, and X Corporation's methods of accounting for section 263A costs immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. The carryover methods for the washing machines and dryers manufacturing business are the LIFO method, the cost basis of valuation, and T Corporation's methods of accounting for section 263A costs immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. There is no change in method of accounting, and X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use any carryover method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. X Corporation manufactures food and beverages and uses the FIFO method of inventory identification, the cost method of valuing its inventories, and capitalizes costs in accordance with section 263A. T Corporation sells sporting equipment. T Corporation uses the FIFO method of inventory identification and the cost method of valuing its inventories. T Corporation does not capitalize costs under section 263A because it meets the small reseller exception under section 263A. X Corporation acquires the inventory of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation operates the food and beverages business as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from the sporting equipment business, and X Corporation does not qualify for the small reseller exception under section 263A for its sporting equipment business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation operates the food and beverages business as a

separate and distinct trade or business, under paragraph (a)(2) of this section X Corporation must use the carryover methods for each continuing trade or business, unless either the carryover methods are impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or X Corporation changes the carryover methods in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. As defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the carryover methods for the food and beverages business are the FIFO method, the cost basis of valuation, and X Corporation's methods of capitalizing costs under section 263A immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. The carryover methods for the sporting equipment business are the FIFO method and the cost basis of valuation. There is no change in method of accounting, and X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use any carryover method. However, because X Corporation does not qualify for the small reseller exception under section 263A for its sporting equipment business, X Corporation's method of not capitalizing additional section 263A costs is an impermissible carryover method under paragraph (a)(4) of this section. X Corporation must secure the Commissioner's consent to change to a permissible method of capitalizing costs under section 263A for the sporting equipment business as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Inventory method. An inventory method is a method of accounting used to account for merchandise on hand (including finished goods, work in process, and raw materials) at the beginning of a year for purposes of computing taxable income for that year. The term includes not only the method for identifying inventory, for example, the FIFO inventory method or the LIFO inventory method, but also all other methods necessary to account for merchandise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Adoption of a method of accounting. Adoption of a method of accounting has the same meaning as provided in Sec. 1.446-1(e)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Change in method of accounting. A change in method of accounting has the same meaning as provided in Sec. 1.446-1(e)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Carryover method. A carryover method is an inventory method that each party to a section 381(a) transaction uses for each separate and distinct trade or business immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Principal method. A principal method is an inventory method that is determined under paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Permissible method of accounting. A permissible method of accounting is a method of accounting that is proper or permitted under the Internal Revenue Code or any applicable Income Tax Regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Acquiring corporation. An acquiring corporation has the same meaning as provided in Sec. 1.381(a)-1(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Distributor corporation. A distributor corporation means the corporation, foreign or domestic, that distributes its assets to another corporation described in section 332(b) in a distribution to which section 332 (relating to liquidations of subsidiaries) applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Transferor corporation. A transferor corporation means the corporation, foreign or domestic, that transfers its assets to another corporation in a transfer to which section 361 (relating to nonrecognition of gain or loss to corporations) applies, but only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The transfer is in connection with a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(A), (a)(1)(C), or (a)(1)(F), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The transfer is in connection with a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D) or (a)(1)(G), provided the requirements of section 354(b) are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Parties to the section 381(a) transaction. Parties to the section 381(a) transaction means the acquiring corporation and the distributor or transferor corporation that participate in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Date of distribution or transfer. The date of distribution or transfer has the same meaning as provided in section 381(b)(2) and Sec. 1.381(b)-1(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Separate and distinct trades or businesses. Separate and distinct trades or businesses has the same meaning as provided in Sec. 1.446-1(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Audit protection. Audit protection means, for purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, that the IRS will not require an acquiring corporation that is required to change a method of accounting under paragraph (a)(3) of this section to change that method for a

taxable year ending prior to the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Section 481(a) adjustment. The section 481(a) adjustment means an adjustment that must be taken into account as required under section 481(a) to prevent amounts from being duplicated or omitted when the taxable income of an acquiring corporation is computed under a method of accounting different from the method used to compute taxable income for the preceding taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Cut-off basis. A cut-off basis means a manner in which a change in method of accounting is made without a section 481(a) adjustment and under which only the items arising after the beginning of the year of change (or, in the case of a change made under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, after the date of distribution or transfer) are accounted for under the new method of accounting. When it implements the change on a cut-off basis, a taxpayer using the LIFO inventory method to identify its inventory goods that makes a change in method of accounting within the LIFO inventory method from one LIFO method or sub-method to another LIFO method or sub-method uses the new LIFO inventory method to determine its current-year cost and base-year cost of ending inventories for the year of change, but does not recompute the cost of beginning inventories for the year of change using the new LIFO inventory method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> Adjustment period. The adjustment period means the number of taxable years for taking into account the section 481(a) adjustment required as a result of a change in method of accounting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(17)</em> Component trade or business. A component trade or business is a trade or business of a party to the section 381(a) transaction that will be combined and integrated with a trade or business of the other party to the section 381 transaction. See paragraph (e)(7)(ii) of this section for the determination of whether a trade or business is operated as a separate and distinct trade or business after the date of distribution or transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Principal method--(1) In general. For each integrated trade or business, the principal method for a particular type of goods is generally the inventory method used by the component trade or business of the acquiring corporation immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer for that type of goods. If, however, on the date of distribution or transfer the component trade or business of the distributor or transferor corporation holds more inventory of a type of goods than the component trade or business of the acquiring corporation, the principal method for such goods is the inventory method used by the component trade or business of the distributor or transferor corporation immediately prior to that date. For each integrated trade or business, the component trade or business of the distributor or transferor corporation holds more inventory if, for a particular type of goods, the aggregate of the fair market value of the goods held by each component trade or business of the distributor or transferor corporation exceeds the aggregate of the fair market value of the goods held by each component trade or business of the acquiring corporation immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer. Alternatively, as a simplifying convention, the acquiring corporation may elect to apply the preceding sentence to the aggregate fair market value of the entire inventories, held by each component trade or business of the acquiring corporation and each component trade or business of the distributor or transferor corporation, that will be integrated after the date of distribution or transfer. If the component trade or business with the larger aggregate fair market value of the entire inventories does not have an inventory method for a particular type of goods immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer, the principal method for that type of goods is the inventory method used by the component trade or business that does have an inventory method for that type of goods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For each integrated trade or business, the principal method for a particular type of goods is generally the inventory method used by the component trade or business of the acquiring corporation immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer for that type of goods. If, however, on the date of distribution or transfer the component trade or business of the distributor or transferor corporation holds more inventory of a type of goods than the component trade or business of the acquiring corporation, the principal method for such goods is the inventory method used by the component trade or business of the distributor or transferor corporation immediately prior to that date.

If a party to the section 381(a) transaction has multiple component trades or businesses and more than one principal inventory method for a particular

type of goods, then the acquiring corporation may choose which of the inventory methods used by such component trades or businesses will be the principal method of the integrated trade or business. The acquiring corporation must choose a principal method that is a permissible method of accounting. In general, a change to a principal method in a transaction to which section 381(a) and paragraph (a)(3) of this section apply is made under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples.

X Corporation and T Corporation each manufacture tennis equipment. X Corporation's manufacturing business uses the FIFO method of inventory identification, the cost method of valuing inventories, and allocates indirect costs to the property produced using the burden rate method provided in Sec. 1.263A-1(f)(3)(i). T Corporation's manufacturing business uses the LIFO method of inventory identification, the cost method of valuing its inventories, and allocates indirect costs to the property it produces using the standard cost method provided in Sec. 1.263A-1(f)(3)(ii). X Corporation acquires the inventory of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. The fair market value of each particular type of goods held by X Corporation's manufacturing business immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer exceeds the fair market value of each particular type of goods held by T Corporation's manufacturing business on that date. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation will not operate its manufacturing business as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from T Corporation's manufacturing business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation will not operate its manufacturing business as a separate and distinct trade or business, X Corporation must use the principal methods under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, unless either the principal methods are impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or X Corporation changes the principal methods in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The fair market value of each particular type of goods held by T Corporation's manufacturing business immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer does not exceed the fair market value of each particular type of goods held by X Corporation's manufacturing business on that date. Because on the date of distribution or transfer T Corporation's manufacturing business does not hold more inventory than X Corporation's manufacturing business, the principal methods are the FIFO method of inventory identification, the cost method of valuation, and X Corporation's method of allocating indirect costs under section 263A using the burden rate method. X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use these methods. However, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change the inventory methods for the manufacturing business acquired from T Corporation to the principal methods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example (1), except that the fair market value of each particular type of goods held by X Corporation's manufacturing business immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer is identical to the fair market value of each particular type of goods held by T Corporation's manufacturing business on that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The result is the same as in Example (1). The principal methods are the FIFO method of inventory identification, the cost method of valuation, and X Corporation's method of allocating indirect costs under section 263A using the burden rate method. X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use the principal methods. However, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change the inventory methods for the manufacturing business acquired from T Corporation to the principal methods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example (1), except that the fair market value of each particular type of goods held by T Corporation's manufacturing business immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer exceeds the fair market value of each particular type of goods held by X Corporation's manufacturing business on that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation will not operate its manufacturing business as a separate and distinct trade or business, X Corporation must use the principal methods under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, unless either the principal methods are impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or X Corporation changes the principal methods in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The fair market value of each particular type of goods held by T Corporation's manufacturing business immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer exceeds the fair market value of each particular type of goods

held by X Corporation's manufacturing business on that date. Because on the date of distribution or transfer T Corporation's manufacturing business holds more inventory than X Corporation's manufacturing business, the principal methods are the LIFO method of inventory identification, the cost method of valuation, and T Corporation's method of allocating indirect costs under section 263A using the standard cost method. X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use the principal methods. However, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change the inventory methods for the manufacturing business operated by X Corporation prior to the date of distribution or transfer to the principal methods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example (1), except that T Corporation wants to discontinue using the LIFO method for its manufacturing business and change to the FIFO method for the taxable year in which the section 381(a) transaction occurs or is expected to occur.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Under paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the Commissioner will grant a request to change a method of accounting for the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer only if the requested method is the method that the acquiring corporation must use after the date of distribution or transfer. The Commissioner will consent to a request by T Corporation to change to the FIFO method for the taxable year in which the section 381(a) transaction occurs or is expected to occur because X Corporation will use this method after the date of distribution or transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example (1), except that T Corporation's manufacturing business has a particular type of goods that is not held by X Corporation's manufacturing business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The result is similar to Example (1). In general, the principal methods are the FIFO method of inventory identification, the cost method of valuation, and X Corporation's method of allocating indirect costs to the property produced using the burden rate method. X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use the principal methods. However, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change the inventory methods for the manufacturing business acquired from T Corporation to the principal methods. Under paragraph (c) of this section, the principal methods for the particular type of goods held only by T Corporation's manufacturing business are the LIFO method of inventory identification, the cost method of valuation, and T Corporation's method of allocating indirect costs to the property it produces using the standard cost method. X Corporation must determine whether the principal methods for the type of goods previously held by T Corporation are permissible given that such methods are different than the principal methods that must be used by X for all other goods. If X Corporation's use of the standard cost method would be impermissible after the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation must change to a permissible method under section 263A for those goods in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. X Corporation manufactures planes and T Corporation manufactures planes and communications satellites. X Corporation's manufacturing business uses the FIFO method of inventory identification and values its inventories at cost or market, whichever is lower, while T Corporation's manufacturing business uses the LIFO method of inventory identification and values its inventories at cost. X Corporation's manufacturing business and T Corporation's manufacturing business use the same methods to capitalize costs under section 263A. X Corporation acquires the inventory of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. In lieu of determining the fair market value of each particular type of goods held on the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation elects to value the entire inventories of its manufacturing business and the entire inventories of T Corporation's manufacturing business in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The fair market value of the inventory held by T Corporation's manufacturing business immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer does not exceed the fair market value of the inventory held by X Corporation's manufacturing business on that date. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation will not operate its manufacturing business as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from T Corporation's manufacturing business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation will not operate its manufacturing business as a separate and distinct trade or business, X Corporation must use the principal methods under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, unless either the principal methods are impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or X Corporation changes the principal methods in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The fair market value of the entire inventory held by T Corporation's manufacturing business immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer does not exceed the fair market value of the entire inventory of X Corporation's manufacturing business on that date. Because on the date of distribution or transfer T Corporation's manufacturing business

does not hold more inventory than X Corporation's manufacturing business, the principal methods are the FIFO method, the cost or market, whichever is lower, method of valuation, and X Corporation's method of capitalizing costs under section 263A on the date of distribution or transfer. X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use the principal methods. However, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change the inventory methods for the manufacturing business acquired from T Corporation to the principal methods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. X Corporation manufactures tennis equipment in a trade or business that is separate and distinct from its trade or business of manufacturing golf equipment. X Corporation uses the FIFO method of inventory identification for its tennis equipment and the LIFO method of inventory identification for its golf equipment. X Corporation values the goods in both inventories at cost and allocates indirect costs to the property produced using the burden rate method provided in Sec. 1.263A-1(f)(3)(i). T Corporation manufactures tennis equipment. T Corporation's manufacturing business uses the FIFO method of inventory identification, values inventories at cost, and allocates indirect costs to the property it produces using the standard cost method provided in Sec. 1.263A-1(f)(3)(ii). X Corporation acquires the inventory of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. Immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer, the fair market value of T Corporation's inventories in the tennis equipment manufacturing business exceeds the fair market value of the inventories held by X Corporation's tennis equipment manufacturing business. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation will not operate its tennis equipment manufacturing business as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from T Corporation's tennis equipment manufacturing business, but X Corporation will operate its golf equipment manufacturing business as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from the tennis equipment manufacturing business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation will not operate its tennis equipment manufacturing business as a separate and distinct trade or business, X Corporation must use the principal methods under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, unless either the principal methods are impermissible and must be changed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or X Corporation changes the principal methods in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, X Corporation elects to compare the fair market values of the entire inventories of the component trades or businesses on the date of distribution or transfer to determine whether T Corporation holds more inventory than X Corporation. The fair market value of the inventory held by T Corporation's tennis equipment manufacturing business exceeds the fair market value of the tennis equipment held by X Corporation's tennis equipment manufacturing business. Because on the date of distribution or transfer T Corporation's tennis equipment manufacturing business holds more inventory than X Corporation's tennis equipment manufacturing business, the principal methods for the combined tennis equipment business are the FIFO method of inventory identification, the cost basis of valuation, and T Corporation's methods of allocating indirect costs under section 263A using the standard cost method provided in Sec. 1.263A-1(f)(3)(ii). X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use the principal methods. However, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change the methods of accounting for its tennis equipment manufacturing business to the principal methods. Under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, because X Corporation will operate the golf equipment manufacturing business as a separate trade or business, for the inventories held by the golf equipment manufacturing business X Corporation must continue to use the LIFO method of inventory identification, use the cost basis of valuation, and allocate indirect costs under section 263A using the burden rate method provided in Sec. 1.263A-1(f)(3)(i). There are no changes in method of accounting for the golf manufacturing business, and X Corporation need not secure the Commissioner's consent to use these carryover methods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example (7), except that after the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation will not operate the golf equipment manufacturing business as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from the tennis equipment manufacturing business. In addition, the fair market value of the inventories of X Corporation's tennis equipment manufacturing business and golf equipment manufacturing business, in the aggregate, exceed the fair market value of the inventories of T Corporation's tennis equipment manufacturing business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because on the date of distribution or transfer T Corporation's tennis equipment manufacturing business does not hold more inventory than X Corporation's tennis equipment manufacturing business and golf equipment manufacturing business, in the aggregate, the principal method for identifying inventory is the method used by X Corporation's component trade or business

on the date of distribution or transfer. However, because on the date of distribution or transfer X Corporation operates two separate and distinct trades or businesses with different inventory identification methods that will be combined after the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation may choose under paragraph (c)(2) of this section which method used by its component trades or businesses will be the principal method. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation may use either the FIFO method of inventory identification used by the tennis equipment manufacturing business or the LIFO method of inventory identification used by the golf equipment manufacturing business as the principal method of identification, if either method is a permissible method. For the integrated trade or business, X Corporation will use the cost method of valuation and allocate indirect costs under section 263A using the burden rate method provided in Sec. 1.263A-1(f)(3)(i). In accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, X Corporation must change the inventory methods of T Corporation's manufacturing business to the principal methods. Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, X Corporation also must change either its golf equipment manufacturing business or its tennis equipment manufacturing business, depending on which principal method X Corporation selects, to the principal method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Procedures for changing a method of accounting--(1) Change made to principal method under paragraph (a)(3) of this section--(i) Section 481(a) adjustment--(A) In general. An acquiring corporation that changes its method of accounting or the distributor or transferor corporation's method of accounting under paragraph (a)(3) of this section does not need to secure the Commissioner's consent to use a principal method. To the extent the use of a principal method constitutes a change in method of accounting, the change in method is treated as a change initiated by the acquiring corporation for purposes of section 481(a)(2). Any change to a principal method, whether the change relates to a trade or business of the acquiring corporation or a trade or business of the distributor or transferor corporation, must be reflected on the acquiring corporation's federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer. The amount of the section 481(a) adjustment and the adjustment period, if any, necessary to implement a change to the principal method are determined under Sec. 1.446-1(e) and the applicable administrative procedures that govern voluntary changes in methods of accounting under section 446(e). If the Internal Revenue Code, the Income Tax Regulations, or administrative procedures require that a method of accounting be implemented on a cut-off basis, the acquiring corporation must implement the change, on a cut-off basis as of the date of distribution or transfer, on its federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer. If the Internal Revenue Code, the Income Tax Regulations, or administrative procedures require a section 481(a) adjustment, the acquiring corporation must determine the section 481(a) adjustment and include the appropriate amount of the section 481(a) adjustment on its federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer and subsequent taxable year(s), as necessary. This adjustment is determined by the acquiring corporation as of the beginning of the day that is immediately after the date of distribution or transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Change made to principal method under paragraph (a)(3) of this section--(i) Section 481(a) adjustment--(A) In general.

Thus, for example, if the administrative procedures for a particular change in method of accounting have a term and condition that provides for the acceleration of the section 481(a) adjustment period, this term and condition applies to a change made under this paragraph (d)(1). However, any scope limitation in the applicable administrative procedures will not apply for purposes of making a change under this paragraph (d)(1).

If other sections of the Internal Revenue Code or Income Tax Regulations allow a taxpayer to elect an inventory method for a particular type of goods, the method elected with respect to those goods is the established inventory method only for those goods. For example, an election to use the LIFO inventory method to identify specified goods in inventory, such as certain products in finished goods, is the inventory method only for those products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Inventory method selected for a particular type of goods. If other sections of the Internal Revenue Code or Income Tax Regulations allow a taxpayer to elect an inventory method for a particular type of goods, the method elected with respect to those goods is the established inventory method only for those goods. For example, an election to use the LIFO inventory method to identify specified goods in inventory, such as certain products in finished goods, is the inventory method only for those products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No method of accounting. If a party to a section 381(a) transaction is not using an inventory method, does not have an inventory method for a particular type of goods, or came into existence as a result of the transaction, the party will not be treated as having an inventory method different from that used by another party to the section 381(a) transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Elections and adoptions allowed. If an election does not require the Commissioner's consent, an acquiring corporation or a distributor or transferor corporation is not precluded from making any election that is otherwise permissible for the taxable year that includes the date of distribution or transfer. For example, an acquiring corporation may elect to identify its inventory using the LIFO inventory method in the year of the distribution or transfer. For purposes of this section, a corporation shall be deemed as having made any election as of the first day of the

An acquiring corporation is not required to renew any election not requiring renewal and previously made by it or by a distributor or transferor corporation for a carryover method or a principal method if the acquiring corporation uses the method after the section 381(a) transaction. If the acquiring corporation uses a method after the date of distribution or transfer, an election made by the acquiring corporation or by a distributor or transferor corporation for that method that was in effect on the date of distribution or transfer continues after the section 381(a) transaction as though the distribution or transfer had not occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. An acquiring corporation is not required to renew any election not requiring renewal and previously made by it or by a distributor or transferor corporation for a carryover method or a principal method if the acquiring corporation uses the method after the section 381(a) transaction. If the acquiring corporation uses a method after the date of distribution or transfer, an election made by the acquiring corporation or by a distributor or transferor corporation for that method that was in effect on the date of distribution or transfer continues after the section 381(a) transaction as though the distribution or transfer had not occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rules of paragraph (e)(4):</p><p class="depth0">Example. Since its incorporation in 1982, X Corporation elected to use the LIFO inventory method under section 472 to identify its inventory of tennis balls. Since its incorporation in 2002, T Corporation elected to use the FIFO inventory method to identify its inventory of tennis balls. X Corporation acquires the assets of T Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. Immediately prior to the date of distribution or transfer, the fair market value of X Corporation's inventory in its tennis balls exceeds the fair market value of the tennis balls inventory held by T Corporation. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation will not operate its business as a trade or business that is separate and distinct from T Corporation's business. Because on the date of distribution or transfer T Corporation does not hold more inventory than X Corporation, the principal method for identifying inventory is the method used by X Corporation on the date of distribution or transfer. After the date of distribution or transfer, X Corporation need not renew its election to identify inventory using the LIFO inventory method, and X Corporation is bound by the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Adopting the LIFO inventory method. A party to a section 381(a) transaction will be deemed to be using the LIFO inventory method for a particular type of goods on the date of distribution or transfer if that party elects under section 472 to adopt that inventory method with respect to those goods for its taxable year within which the date of distribution or transfer occurs. See section 472 for the requirements to adopt the LIFO inventory method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Inventory layers treatment--(i) Adjustments required after a section 381(a) transaction. An acquiring corporation that determines the principal method of taking an inventory after a section 381(a) transaction under paragraphs (a)(3) and (c) of this section after the date of distribution or transfer may need to integrate inventories and make appropriate adjustments as provided in paragraphs (e)(6)(ii) and (e)(6)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Adjustments required after a section 381(a) transaction.

If pools of each corporation are permitted or required to be combined, the pools must be combined as provided in Sec. 1.472-8(g)(2). For purposes of combining pools, all base year inventories or layers of increment that occur in taxable years including the same December 31 shall be combined.

Thus, if an inventory of a particular type of goods is combined in an existing dollar-value pool, the goods shall be treated as if they were purchased by the acquiring corporation at the average unit cost on the date of the distribution or transfer with respect to such pool. Alternatively, if the goods are not combined in an existing pool, the goods will be treated as if they were purchased by the acquiring corporation at the average unit cost on the date of the distribution or transfer with respect to a new pool, with the base-year being the year of the section 381(a) transaction.

In addition to its deduction for depletion, Y Corporation is, in 1957, entitled to a deduction under sections 616(b) and 381(c)(10) of $75,000 of the development expenditures previously deferred by X Corporation, that is, $500,000 x 150,000/1,000,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If a distributor or transferor corporation has elected under section 615 or section 616 (or corresponding provisions of prior law) to defer exploration or development expenditures in respect of a mine or other natural deposit which it subsequently disposes of except for a retained economic interest therein, such as the right to royalty income or in-ore payments, and such retained economic interest is transferred to the acquiring corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, then the acquiring corporation shall be entitled to deduct such deferred expenditures attributable to the economic interest retained on a ratable basis to the same extent they would have been deductible by the distributor or transferor corporation in the absence of the distribution or transfer.

(1) If a distributor or transferor corporation transfers any mineral property to the acquiring corporation in a transaction described in section 381(a) and the acquiring corporation pays or incurs exploration expenditures in a taxable year ending after the date of the distribution or transfer, then in applying the 4-year or $400,000 limitations described in section 615(c) and paragraphs (a) and (b) of Sec. 1.615-4, whichever is applicable, the acquiring corporation shall be deemed to have been allowed any deduction which, for any taxable year ending on or before the date of distribution or transfer, was allowed to the distributor or transferor corporation under section 615(a), or under section 23(ff)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, or to have made any election which, for any such preceding year, was made by the distributor or transferor corporation under section 615(b), or under section 23(ff)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. Thus, in such instance, the acquiring corporation shall take into account the years in which the distributor or transferor corporation exercised the

election to deduct or defer exploration expenditures and any amounts so deducted or deferred.

Thus, in such instance, the acquiring corporation shall take into account the years in which the distributor or transferor corporation exercised the

election to deduct or defer exploration expenditures and any amounts so deducted or deferred. For this purpose, it is immaterial whether the deduction has been allowed to, or the election has been made by, the distributor or transferor corporation with respect to the specific mineral property transferred by that corporation to the acquiring corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Generally, for purposes of applying the 4-year limitation described in paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.615-4, if there are two or more distributor or transferor corporations that transfer any mineral property to the acquiring corporation, each taxable year of any such corporation ending on or before the date of distribution or transfer in which exploration expenditures were deducted or deferred shall be treated as a separate taxable year regardless of the fact that the taxable years of two or more such corporations normally end on the same date. However, if the date of distribution or transfer is the same with respect to more than one distributor or transferor corporation, then the taxable years of such corporations ending on the same date of distribution or transfer shall be considered as one taxable year for purposes of applying the 4-year limitation even though more than one such corporation deducted or deferred exploration expenditures for such taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of applying the $400,000 limitation described in paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.615-4, if there are two or more distributor or transferor corporations that transfer any mineral property to the acquiring corporation, any exploration expenditures which were deducted or treated as deferred expenses by such corporations for taxable years ending after December 31, 1950, shall be taken into account by the acquiring corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If a distributor or transferor corporation that transfers any mineral property to the acquiring corporation was required to take into account any taxable years or amounts of its transferor, as provided by paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.615-4, for purposes of either the 4-year limitation described in paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.615-4 or the $400,000 limitation described in paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.615-4, then the acquiring corporation shall also take these taxable years and amounts into account in applying the same limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. M and N Corporations were organized on January 1, 1956, and each corporation computes its taxable income on the basis of the calendar year. For each of its taxable years 1956 and 1957, M Corporation expended $60,000 for exploration expenditures and exercised the option to deduct such amounts under section 615(a). N Corporation made no exploration expenditures during its taxable years 1956 and 1957. On December 31, 1957, M Corporation transferred all of its assets to N Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, no gain being recognized to the transferor corporation on the transfer. N Corporation made exploration expenditures of $100,000, $120,000, $110,000, and $100,000 for the years 1958, 1959, 1960, and 1961, respectively, which expenditures it desired to deduct under section 615(a) to the extent allowable. On the basis of these facts, N Corporation may deduct up to $100,000 for each of the years 1958 and 1959. No deduction or deferral is allowable for 1960 since the benefits of section 615(c) were previously availed of for 4 taxable years. However, N Corporation may deduct $80,000 for 1961 (the 4-year limitation not applying to such year) but, if such deduction is made, N Corporation will not be allowed any further deductions or deferrals since the $400,000 limitation of paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.615-4 will have been reached.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. R and S Corporations were organized on January 1, 1955, and each corporation computes its income on the basis of the calendar year. For the 1955 taxable year neither corporation made any exploration expenditures under section 615(a). On June 30, 1956, R Corporation transferred all its assets to S Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, no gain being recognized to the transferor corporation on the transfer. During its short taxable year ending June 30, 1956, R Corporation made exploration expenditures of $60,000 which it elected to deduct under section 615. For its taxable year ending December 31, 1956, S Corporation may deduct or defer exploration expenditures up to $100,000 since this is a separate election for purposes of utilizing section 615 and is not affected by the $60,000 previously deducted by R Corporation. Assuming S Corporation exercises an election under section 615 for its taxable year ending December 31, 1956, S Corporation may elect to apply the benefits of section 615 to exploration expenditures for two more taxable years. However, for taxable years beginning after July 6, 1960 (the 4-year limitation not

applying), S Corporation is entitled under section 615 to deduct or defer exploration expenditures made in such years to the extent that the combined deductions and deferrals by R and S Corporations in prior years did not exceed $400,000.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. O and P Corporations were organized on January 1, 1955, and each corporation computes its taxable income on the basis of the calendar year. For their taxable years 1955, 1956, and 1957, each corporation deducted exploration expenditures made in such years under section 615(a). On June 30, 1958, O Corporation transferred all its assets to P Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, no gain being recognized to the transferor corporation on the transfer. If, during its short taxable year ending June 30, 1958, O Corporation made additional exploration expenditures, it may deduct or defer such expenditures (up to $100,000) under section 615 since O Corporation has utilized section 615 in only three previous taxable years. For its taxable years ending after June 30, 1958, and beginning before July 7, 1960, P Corporation may not deduct or defer exploration expenditures under section 615, since the benefits of that section were utilized by O and P Corporations for 4 taxable years. However, for taxable years beginning after July 6, 1960 (the 4-year limitation not applying), P is entitled under section 615 to deduct or defer exploration expenditures made in such years to the extent that the combined deductions and deferrals by O and P Corporations in prior years do not exceed $400,000. See paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.615-4.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. X, Y, and Z Corporations were organized on January 1, 1955, and each corporation computes its taxable income on the basis of the calendar year. For their taxable years ending December 31, 1955, X and Y Corporations each deferred $100,000 for exploration expenditures made in such taxable years under section 615(b). Z Corporation made no exploration expenditures during its taxable year ending December 31, 1955. On March 31, 1956, X and Y Corporations transferred all their assets to Z Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, no gain being recognized to the transferor corporations on the transfer. X and Y Corporations each made exploration expenditures of $75,000 during their short taxable years ending March 31, 1956, which they deducted under section 615(a). For purposes of taxable years beginning before July 7, 1960, Z Corporation must take into account the taxable years in which X and Y Corporations deducted or deferred exploration expenditures. In so doing, each taxable year in which exploration expenditures were deducted or deferred must be taken into account except that the taxable years of X and Y Corporations ending on March 31, 1956, shall be considered as one taxable year. Therefore, Z Corporation may deduct or defer exploration expenditures in accordance with section 615 for any one taxable year ending after March 31, 1956, and beginning before July 7, 1960. However, for taxable years beginning after July 6, 1960 (the 4-year limitation not applying), Z Corporation must take into account for purposes of the $400,000 limitation all of the $350,000 of exploration expenditures deducted or deferred by X, Y, and Z Corporations during taxable years ending after December 31, 1950. Therefore, Z Corporation, assuming it has not deducted or deferred any exploration expenditures, is entitled under section 615 to deduct or defer in taxable years beginning after July 6, 1960, up to $50,000 for exploration expenditures made in such years.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. For purposes of this example, assumethat each taxpayer computes taxable income on the basis of the calendar year. Taxpayer A, an individual who has deducted exploration expenditures of $75,000 under section 23(ff) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for each of his taxable years 1952 and 1953, transferred a mineral property to K Corporation on January 1, 1954, in a transaction in which the basis of the mineral property in the hands of K Corporation is determined under section 362(a). For its taxable year 1954 and pursuant to section 615(a)., K Corporation deducted exploration expenditures of $100,000 which it made in such year. K Corporation had made no exploration expenditures in any preceding taxable year. On December 31, 1954, K Corporation transferred all its assets to L Corporation in a reorganization to which section 381(a) applies, no gain being recognized to the transferor corporation on the transfer. Assuming that L Corporation has not deducted or deferred exploration expenditures in any preceding taxable year, L Corporation may deduct or defer exploration expenditures (up to $100,000) in accordance with section 615 for any one taxable year ending after December 31, 1954, and beginning before July 7, 1960, in view of the 4-year limitation. However, if L Corporation does not deduct or defer exploration expenditures in that period, then for taxable years beginning after July 6, 1960 (the 4-year limitation not applying), L Corporation is entitled to deduct or defer up to $150,000 (but not to exceed $100,000 per year) for exploration expenditures made in such years.

Sec. 1.381(c)(11)-1  Contributions to pension plan, employees' annuity plans, and stock bonus and profit-sharing plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Carryover requirement. Section 381(c)(11) provides that, for purposes of

determining amounts deductible under section 404 for any taxable year, the acquiring corporation shall be considered after the date of distribution or transfer to be the distributor or transferor corporation in respect of any pension, annuity, stock bonus, or profit-sharing plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Nature of carryover. (1) Primarily, section 381(c)(11) and this section apply to the amount of any unused deductions or excess contributions carryovers which, in the absence of the transaction causing section 381 to apply, would have been available to the distributor or transferor corporation under section 404. Thus, for example, this section applies to unused deductions under a profit-sharing or stock bonus trust which, in accordance with the second sentence of section 404(a)(3)(A) and Sec. 1.404(a)-9, would have been available in succeeding taxable years to the transferor corporation if the transfer of assets to the acquiring corporation had not occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Primarily, section 381(c)(11) and this section apply to the amount of any unused deductions or excess contributions carryovers which, in the absence of the transaction causing section 381 to apply, would have been available to the distributor or transferor corporation under section 404. Thus, for example, this section applies to unused deductions under a profit-sharing or stock bonus trust which, in accordance with the second sentence of section 404(a)(3)(A) and Sec. 1.404(a)-9, would have been available in succeeding taxable years to the transferor corporation if the transfer of assets to the acquiring corporation had not occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Section 381(c)(11) also permits or requires the acquiring corporation to be treated as though it were the distributor or transferor corporation for the purpose of satisfying any conditions which would have been required of the distributor or transferor corporation in the absence of the distribution or transfer, so that it may be determined whether the distributor or transferor corporation, or the acquiring corporation, is entitled to take a deduction under section 404 in respect of a trust or plan established by the distributor or transferor corporation. Thus, for example, in a case when the taxable year of the transferor corporation ends on the date of transfer pursuant to section 381(b)(1), that corporation is entitled, pursuant to the provisions of section 404(a)(6) and paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.404(a)-1, to a deduction in such taxable year for a payment to a qualified trust of that corporation made by the acquiring corporation after the close of such taxable year but within the time specified in section 404(a)(6). In further illustration, if the transferor corporation were to establish a qualified plan, and if the plan were maintained as a qualified plan by the acquiring corporation, then any contributions paid under the plan by the acquiring corporation (other than those which are deductible by the transferor corporation by reason of section 404(a)(6)) would be deductible under section 404 by the acquiring corporation even though the plan were exclusively for the benefit of former employees of the transferor corporation. Also, for example, if the transferor corporation were to adopt an annuity plan during its taxable year ending on the date of transfer, the acquiring corporation would be entitled, subject to the provisions of section 401(b) and Sec. 1.401-5, to amend the plan so as to make it retroactively satisfy the requirements of section 401(a)(3), (4), (5), and (6) for the period beginning with the date on which the plan was put into effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Taxable year of deduction. The first taxable year of the acquiring corporation in which any amount shall be allowed as a deduction to that corporation by reason of section 381(c)(11) and this section shall be its first taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Requirements for deductions. (1) In order for any amount paid by the acquiring corporation (other than amounts deductible under section 404(a)(5)) to be deductible by the acquiring corporation by reason of this section in respect of a trust or nontrusteed annuity plan which is established by a distributor or transferor corporation and maintained by the acquiring corporation, the contributions must be paid (or deemed to have been paid under section 404(a)(6)) by the acquiring corporation in a taxable year of that corporation which ends with or within a year of the trust for which it is exempt under section 501(a), or, in the case of a nontrusteed annuity plan, for which it meets the requirements of section 404(a)(2). See, however, section 404(a)(4) and Sec. 1.404(a)-11 for rules relating to deductions for contributions to foreign-situs trusts. The trust or plan which is established by the distributor or transferor corporation and maintained by the acquiring corporation may separately satisfy the requirements of section 401(a) or section 404(a)(2) or may, together with other trusts or plans of the acquiring corporation, constitute a single plan which qualifies under section 401(a) or

meets the requirements of section 404(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In order for any amount paid by the acquiring corporation (other than amounts deductible under section 404(a)(5)) to be deductible by the acquiring corporation by reason of this section in respect of a trust or nontrusteed annuity plan which is established by a distributor or transferor corporation and maintained by the acquiring corporation, the contributions must be paid (or deemed to have been paid under section 404(a)(6)) by the acquiring corporation in a taxable year of that corporation which ends with or within a year of the trust for which it is exempt under section 501(a), or, in the case of a nontrusteed annuity plan, for which it meets the requirements of section 404(a)(2). See, however, section 404(a)(4) and Sec. 1.404(a)-11 for rules relating to deductions for contributions to foreign-situs trusts. The trust or plan which is established by the distributor or transferor corporation and maintained by the acquiring corporation may separately satisfy the requirements of section 401(a) or section 404(a)(2) or may, together with other trusts or plans of the acquiring corporation, constitute a single plan which qualifies under section 401(a) or

meets the requirements of section 404(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Excess contributions paid under a qualified trust or plan established by the transferor or distributor corporation may be carried over and, subject to the applicable limitations, deducted by the acquiring corporation in a taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer regardless of whether the trust is exempt, or the plan meets the requirements of section 404(a)(2), during such taxable year. There are, however, special rules for computing the limitations on the amount of excess contributions which are deductible in a taxable year ending after the trust or plan has terminated (see Sec. 1.404(a)-7, paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.404(a)-9, and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.404(a)-13). For this purpose, the pension, annuity, stock bonus, or profit-sharing plan of the distributor or transferor corporation under which the excess contributions were made shall be considered continued (and not terminated) by the acquiring corporation if, after the date of distribution or transfer, the acquiring corporation continues the plan as a separate and distinct plan of its own which continues to qualify under section 401(a), or to meet the requirements of section 404(a)(2), or consolidates or replaces that plan with a comparable plan. See subparagraph (4) of this paragraph for rules relating to what constitutes a ``comparable'' plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In order for any amount paid by the acquiring corporation to be deductible by the acquiring corporation as an unused deduction carried over from a qualified profit-sharing or stock bonus trust established by a distributor or transferor corporation, the acquiring corporation must continue such trust established by the distributor or transferor corporation as a separate and distinct trust of its own which continues to qualify under section 401(a), or must consolidate or replace that trust with a comparable trust. In addition, the amount paid by the acquiring corporation will be deductible as an unused deduction carried over from the transferor or distributor corporation only if it is paid into the profit-sharing or stock bonus trust established by the transferor or distributor corporation, or the comparable trust, in a taxable year of the acquiring corporation which ends with or within a year of such trust (or such comparable trust) for which it meets the requirements of section 401(a) and is exempt under section 501(a). See subparagraph (4) of this paragraph for rules relating to what constitutes a ``comparable'' trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For purposes of subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph, a plan under which deductions are determined pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2) of section 404(a) shall be considered comparable to another plan under which deductions are determined pursuant to either of those paragraphs, and a plan under which deductions are determined pursuant to paragraph (3) of section 404(a) shall be considered comparable to another plan under which deductions are determined pursuant to such paragraph (3). Thus, a profit-sharing plan (which qualifies under section 401(a)) established by the transferor or distributor corporation shall, for purposes of subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph, be considered terminated if, after the date of distribution or transfer, the acquiring corporation transfers the funds accumulated under the profit-sharing plan into a pension plan covering the same employees. In such a case, excess contributions paid under the profit-sharing plan by the distributor or transferor corporation may be carried over and deducted by the acquiring corporation in a taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer subject to the limitations in section 404(a)(3)(A) computed in accordance with the rules in paragraph (e)(2) of Sec. 1.404(a)-9 for computing limitations when a profit-sharing plan has terminated. On the other hand, unused deductions attributable to the profit sharing plan may not be carried over and used by the acquiring corporation as a basis for deducting amounts contributed by it to the pension plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effect of consolidation or replacement of plan on prior contributions. If a pension, annuity, stock bonus, or profit-sharing plan which was established

by a distributor or transferor corporation is terminated after the date of distribution or transfer because of consolidation or replacement with a comparable plan of the acquiring corporation, then the contributions paid to or under its plan by the distributor or transferor corporation on or before the date of distribution or transfer shall not be disallowed under section 404 merely because of the termination of the plan which was established by that corporation, provided that the termination does not cause the plan to fail to qualify under section 401(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Amounts deductible under section 404. Section 381(c)(11) and this section apply only to amounts which are otherwise deductible under section 404 and the regulations thereunder. See Sec. Sec. 1.404(a)-1 through 1.404(d)-1. Thus, to be deductible by reason of this section, contributions paid by the acquiring corporation must be expenses which otherwise satisfy the conditions of section 162 (relating to trade or business expenses). No deduction shall be allowed by reason of section 381(c)(11) and this section for a contribution which is allowable under section 162 but is not allowable under section 404. Thus, the acquiring corporation shall not be allowed a deduction by reason of this section in respect of a plan established by a distributor or transferor corporation if the contribution would not otherwise be deductible under section 404 by reason of section 404(c) and Sec. 1.404(c)-1. On the other hand, any unused deductions or excess contributions of a distributor or transferor corporation which are carried over from 1939 Code years shall be deductible by the acquiring corporation if the requirements of this section, section 404(d), and Sec. 1.404(d)-1 are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Cost of past service credits. In computing the cost of past service credits under a plan with respect to employees of the distributor or transferor corporation, the acquiring corporation may include the cost of credits for periods during which the employees were in the service of the distributor or transferor corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Separate carryovers required. The excess contributions which are available to a distributor or transferor corporation under the provisions of section 404(a)(1)(D) and section 404(a)(3)(A) at the close of the date of distribution or transfer and are carried over to the acquiring corporation under this section shall be kept separate and distinct from each other and from any excess contributions which are available to the distributor or transferor corporation at that time under the provisions of section 404(a)(7) and are carried over to the acquiring corporation under this section. If there are excess contributions carried over to the acquiring corporation from more than one transferor or distributor corporation, the excess contributions of each transferor or distributor corporation shall be kept separate and distinct from those of the other transferor or distributor corporations and, with respect to each such transferor or distributor corporation, shall be kept separate and distinct as provided in the preceding sentence. See, however, paragraph (i) of this section for rules for applying the provisions of section 404(a)(3)(A) when the acquiring corporation maintains two or more profit-sharing or stock bonus trusts, one or more of which was established by a distributor or transferor corporation. The requirements in this paragraph shall apply with respect to any excess contributions which are carried over to the acquiring corporation from a distributor or transferor corporation under the provisions of section 404(d) and this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Limitations applicable to profit-sharing or stock bonus trusts. When contributions are paid by the acquiring corporation after the date of distribution or transfer to two or more profit-sharing or stock bonus trusts, and one or more of such trusts was established by a distributor or transferor corporation, such trusts shall be considered as a single trust in applying the provisions of section 404(a)(3)(A) under this section. Accordingly, in determining its secondary limitation, and its excess contributions carryover, under section 404(a)(3)(A) and Sec. 1.404(a)-9 in any taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer, the acquiring corporation shall take into accounts its primary limitations, and the deductions allowed or allowable to it, for all prior years under the limitations provided in those sections, and also the

primary limitations of, and deductions allowed or allowable to, the distributor or transferor corporation or corporations for all prior years under the limitations provided in those sections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Successive carryovers. The provisions of section 381(c)(11) and this section shall apply to an acquiring corporation which, in a distribution or transfer to which section 381(a) applies acquires the assets of a distributor or transferor corporation which has previously acquired the assets of another corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, even though, in computing an unused deductions or excess contributions carryover to the second acquiring corporation, it is necessary to take into account contributions paid by, and limitations applicable to, the first distributor or transferor corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Information to be furnished by acquiring corporation. The acquiring corporation shall furnish such information with respect to a plan established by a distributor or transferor corporation as will, consistently with the principles of section 404, establish that the provisions of such section and this section apply. For purposes of this section, the district director may require any other information that he considers necessary to determine deductions allowable under section 404 and this section or qualification under section 401. Any unused deductions or excess contributions carried over from a distributor or transferor corporation pursuant to this section shall be properly identified with the corporation which would have been permitted to use those deductions or contributions in the absence of the transaction causing section 381 to apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Illustration. The application of this section may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. In 1955, X Corporation, which makes its return on the basis of the calendar year, paid $400,000 to completely fund past service credits under a qualified pension plan and deducted 10 percent ($40,000) of that cost in each of the taxable years 1955, 1956, and 1957. The pension plan established by X Corporation had an anniversary date of January 1. On December 31, 1957, on which date the undeducted part of the cost amounted to $280,000, X Corporation transferred all its assets to Y Corporation in a statutory merger to which section 361 applies. Y Corporation, which also makes its return on the basis of the calendar year, had a qualified pension plan and trust which also had an anniversary date of January 1. Since Y Corporation had many more employees than X Corporation on the date of transfer, it covered the former employees of X Corporation under its own plan. Y Corporation is entitled to deductions under section 404(a)(1)(D) and this section in 1958 and succeeding taxable years, in order of time, with respect to the undeducted balance of $280,000, to the extent of the difference between the amount paid and deductible by that corporation in each such taxable year and the maximum amount deductible by that corporation for such taxable year in accordance with the applicable limitations of section 404(a)(1). In computing the maximum amount deductible by Y Corporation for 1958 and 1959 under section 404(a)(1)(C), that corporation may include $40,000 for each year, the amount that X Corporation could have included for each of those years in computing the maximum amount that would have been deductible by X Corporation under section 404(a)(1)(C) if the merger had not occurred. Thus, assuming that Y Corporation's appropriate limitation so computed under section 404(a)(1)(C) is $1,000,000 (including the $40,000 carried over from X Corporation under this section) for each of those taxable years, and that Y Corporation contributed $925,000 to its trust in 1958 and $975,000 in 1959, then Y Corporation is entitled under section 404(a)(1)(D) and this section to deduct in 1958 $75,000, and in 1959 $25,000, of the amount ($280,000) carried over from X Corporation. The undeducted balance of such amount ($180,000) available to Y Corporation on December 31, 1959, would be deductible by that corporation in succeeding taxable years in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(D) and this section.

Sec. 1.381(c)(12)-1  Recovery of bad debts, prior taxes, or delinquency amounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Carryover requirement. (1) If, as a result of a distribution or transfer to which section 381(a) applies, the acquiring corporation is entitled to the recovery of a bad debt, prior tax, or delinquency amount on account of which a deduction or credit was allowed to a distributor or transferor corporation for a prior taxable year, and such debt, tax, or amount is recovered by the acquiring corporation after the date of distribution or transfer, then under the

provisions of section 381(c)(12) the acquiring corporation is required to include in its gross income for the taxable year of recovery the same amount of income attributable to the recovery as the distributor or transferor corporation would have been required to include under section 111 and the regulations thereunder had the distribution or transfer not occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If, as a result of a distribution or transfer to which section 381(a) applies, the acquiring corporation is entitled to the recovery of a bad debt, prior tax, or delinquency amount on account of which a deduction or credit was allowed to a distributor or transferor corporation for a prior taxable year, and such debt, tax, or amount is recovered by the acquiring corporation after the date of distribution or transfer, then under the

provisions of section 381(c)(12) the acquiring corporation is required to include in its gross income for the taxable year of recovery the same amount of income attributable to the recovery as the distributor or transferor corporation would have been required to include under section 111 and the regulations thereunder had the distribution or transfer not occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The rule prescribed by paragraph (a)(1) of this section and by section 381(c)(12) with respect to bad debts, prior taxes, and delinquency amounts applies equally with respect to the recovery by the acquiring corporation of all other losses, expenditures, and accruals made on the basis of deductions from the gross income of a distributor or transferor corporation for prior taxable years, including war losses referred to in section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, but not including deductions with respect to depreciation, depletion, amortization, or amortizable bond premiums.

The recovery by the acquiring corporation of any section 111 item of such corporation after the date of the distribution or transfer shall be considered separately from recoveries by the acquiring corporation of any such item which was deducted or credited by a distributor or transferor corporation. Any recovery by the acquiring corporation of a section 111 item shall be excluded from the gross income of the acquiring corporation to the extent of the recovery exclusion (1) determined for the original year for which that item was deducted or credited by the specific corporation which claimed the deduction or credit and (2) reduced by the excludable recoveries (whether made by the acquiring corporation, or by the distributor or transferor corporation) in intervening years with respect to the recovery exclusion of such corporation for such original year.

Sec. 1.381(c)(13)-1  Involuntary conversions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Carryover requirement--(1) General rule. Section 381(c)(13) requires that after the date of distribution or transfer the acquiring corporation, in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, shall be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation for

purposes of applying section 1033, relating to involuntary conversions. This rule shall apply even though the property similar or related in service or use to the property converted, or the stock of a corporation owning such similar property, is purchased by the acquiring corporation after the date of distribution or transfer and is not received from the distributor or transferor corporation in the transaction to which section 381(a) applies. Accordingly, if any factor essential to the application of section 1033 occurs on or before the date of distribution or transfer and any other such factor also occurs after that date, then, in accordance with section 381(c)(13) and this section, the provisions of section 1033 shall apply to the acquiring corporation in the same manner that they would have applied to the distributor or transferor corporation in the absence of the distribution or transfer. For purposes of this section, the terms involuntary conversion and disposition of the converted property shall have the meaning ascribed to them by the regulations under section 1033.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Section 381(c)(13) requires that after the date of distribution or transfer the acquiring corporation, in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, shall be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation for

For purposes of this section, the terms involuntary conversion and disposition of the converted property shall have the meaning ascribed to them by the regulations under section 1033.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Application to other transactions. The provisions of this section shall apply to any transaction which, under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, is treated as though it were an involuntary conversion within the meaning of section 1033.

Section 1033(a)(1) provides that no gain shall be recognized if property is involuntarily converted only into property which is similar or related in service or use to the property so converted. If there is a disposition of property of a distributor or transferor corporation and, subsequent to the date of distribution or transfer, property similar or related in service or use to the property disposed of is received by the acquiring corporation as compensation for the property so disposed of, then no gain shall be recognized to the acquiring corporation, provided that no gain would have been recognized under section 1033(a)(1) if the similar property had been received directly by the distributor or transferor corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Example. Property of S Corporation with an adjusted basis of $100 is condemned by the local government. Shortly after the property is so condemned, S Corporation liquidates and distributes its assets to P Corporation in a distribution to which section 381(a) applies. Subsequent to the date of distribution, P Corporation receives from the government (in settlement of the condemnation proceedings) property with a market value of $500 which is similar or related in service or use to the property so condemned. No gain is recognized to either corporation upon P Corporation's receipt of the similar property, and the property so received has a basis of $100 in the hands of P Corporation on the date of its acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Conversion into money or dissimilar property when disposition occurs after December 31, 1950--(1) General rule. Section 1033(a)(3) and Sec. 1.1033(a)-2 provide rules for involuntary conversions of property into money or dissimilar property where the disposition of the converted property occurs after December 31, 1950. In such a case, the gain on the conversion, if any, shall be recognized, at the election of the taxpayer, only to the extent that the amount realized on the conversion exceeds the cost of other property purchased by the taxpayer which is similar or related in service or use to the property so converted, or exceeds the cost of stock purchased by the taxpayer in the acquisition of control of a corporation owning such other property, provided (i) the taxpayer purchases such other property or stock for the purpose of replacing the property so converted and (ii) the purchase occurs during the period of time specified in section 1033(a)(3)(B). The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to involuntary conversions where the disposition of the property occurs after December 31, 1950, and where the election to have section 1033(a)(3) apply to the treatment of the gain upon the conversion is contingent upon activities of both the distributor or transferor corporation and the acquiring corporation. For purposes of section 381(c)(13), the period of time specified in section 1033(a)(3)(B) shall be determined by taking into account taxable years of, and extensions of time granted to, both

Section 1033(a)(3) and Sec. 1.1033(a)-2 provide rules for involuntary conversions of property into money or dissimilar property where the disposition of the converted property occurs after December 31, 1950. In such a case, the gain on the conversion, if any, shall be recognized, at the election of the taxpayer, only to the extent that the amount realized on the conversion exceeds the cost of other property purchased by the taxpayer which is similar or related in service or use to the property so converted, or exceeds the cost of stock purchased by the taxpayer in the acquisition of control of a corporation owning such other property, provided (i) the taxpayer purchases such other property or stock for the purpose of replacing the property so converted and (ii) the purchase occurs during the period of time specified in section 1033(a)(3)(B).

For purposes of section 381(c)(13), the period of time specified in section 1033(a)(3)(B) shall be determined by taking into account taxable years of, and extensions of time granted to, both

the distributor or transferor corporation and the acquiring corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Replacement period. The period during which the purchase of similar property or stock must be made in order to prevent the recognition of gain on the involuntary conversion terminates 2 years (or, in the case of a disposition occurring before Dec. 31, 1969, 1 year) after the close of the first taxable year in which any part of the gain upon the conversion is realized, or at the close of such later date as may be designated pursuant to an application of the taxpayer. See paragraph (c)(3) of Sec. 1.1033(a)-2. Therefore, if, in a case to which this subparagraph applies, the first taxable year in which gain is realized is the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation ending with the close of the date of distribution or transfer, the acquiring corporation will have a maximum of only 2 years (or, in the case of a disposition occurring before Dec. 31, 1969, 1 year) after that date in which to purchase the similar property or stock, unless an extension of time has been granted upon application by the distributor, transferor, or acquiring corporation within the time prescribed. See paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.381(b)-1 as to the termination of the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation. See paragraph (c)(3) of Sec. 1.1033(a)-2 as to applications to extend the period within which to replace the converted property. In addition to the information otherwise required under paragraph (c)(3) of Sec. 1.1033(a)-2, the application shall contain sufficient detail in connection with the distribution or transfer to establish that section 381(c)(13) applies to the involuntary conversion involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A and B Corporations compute their taxable income on the basis of the calendar year, and both corporations use the cash method of accounting. During 1970 property of A Corporation is destroyed by fire, and in January 1971, A Corporation receives $15,000 from an insurance company as compensation for its loss of property. The adjusted basis of the property on the date of destruction is $10,000; as a consequence, A Corporation realizes a gain of $5,000 on the involuntary conversion. On June 30, 1971, B Corporation acquires all of the assets of A Corporation in a reorganization to which section 381(a) applies. In accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of Sec. 1.1033(a)-2, A Corporation reports in its return for the short taxable year ending June 30, 1971, all the details in connection with the involuntary conversion but does not include the realized gain in gross income, thereby electing to have the gain recognized only to the extent provided in section 1033(a)(3). On June 15, 1973, B Corporation purchases for $20,000 property which is similar or related in service or use to the property previously destroyed. In its return for 1973, B Corporation reports all of the details in connection with its replacement of the property, as required by paragraph (c)(2) of Sec. 1.1033(a)-2. As a result of this replacement by B Corporation, none of the gain realized by A Corporation is recognized. The replacement property which is purchased by B Corporation has a basis to that corporation of $15,000 on the date of its purchase, that is, the cost of such property ($20,000) decreased by the amount of gain not recognized to A Corporation on the involuntary conversion ($5,000).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that B Corporation does not purchase similar property on or before June 30, 1973, and does not apply on or before that date (in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of Sec. 1.1033(a)-2) for an extension of time in which to make a replacement. In such event, the gain realized by A Corporation is recognized to that corporation for its taxable year ending June 30, 1971. A Corporation's tax liability for such taxable year must be recomputed in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of Sec. 1.1033(a)-2 in order to reflect this additional income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that the property of A Corporation is destroyed in 1968, A Corporation receives the $15,000 from an insurance company in January 1969, B Corporation acquires all of the assets of A Corporation on June 30, 1969, and A Corporation's return is filed for the short taxable year ending June 30, 1969. B Corporation would have to purchase property which is similar or related in service or use to the property previously destroyed by June 30, 1970, in order to take advantage of the provisions of section 1033.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. M and N Corporations compute their taxable income on the basis of the calendar year, and both corporations use the cash method of accounting. During 1970, property of M Corporation is destroyed by fire. The adjusted basis of the property on the date of destruction is $10,000. The property is insured against loss by fire, but the insurance claim is not satisfied on or before June 30, 1971, the date on which N Corporation acquires all of the assets (including the insurance claim) of M Corporation in a reorganization to which section 381(a) applies. On

September 1, 1972, N Corporation receives $15,000 from the insurance company as compensation for the fire loss suffered by M Corporation. Upon receipt of the insurance proceeds, N Corporation realizes a gain of $5,000 upon the involuntary conversion; however, in its return for 1972, N Corporation elects under the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of Sec. 1.1033(a)-2 to have the gain recognized only to the extent provided by section 1033(a)(3). On December 30, 1974, N Corporation purchases for $20,000 property which is similar or related in service or use to the property previously destroyed in the hands of M Corporation. As a result of this replacement by N Corporation, none of the gain realized by N Corporation in 1972 is recognized. The replacement property which is purchased by N Corporation has a basis to that corporation of $15,000 on the date of its purchase, that is, the cost of such property ($20,000) decreased by the amount of gain not recognized to N Corporation on the involuntary conversion ($5,000).</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. R and S Corporations compute their taxable income on the basis of the calendar year, and both corporations use the cash method of accounting. During 1970 property of R Corporation is destroyed by fire. The adjusted basis of the property on the date of destruction is $10,000. In anticipation of taking the benefit of section 1033(a)(3), R Corporation purchases for $20,000 on June 1, 1971, property which is similar or related in service or use to the destroyed property. In its return for 1971, R Corporation reports all of the details in connection with the replacement of the property, as required by paragraph (c)(2) of Sec. 1.1033(a)-2. The property destroyed in 1970 is insured against loss by fire, but the insurance claim is not satisfied on or before March 1, 1972, the date on which S Corporation acquires all of the assets (including the insurance claim) of R Corporation in a reorganization to which section 381(a) applies. On October 1, 1972, S Corporation receives $12,000 from the insurance company as compensation for the fire loss suffered by R Corporation. Upon receipt of the insurance proceeds, S Corporation realizes a gain of $2,000 upon the involuntary conversion; however, in its return for 1972, S Corporation elects under the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of Sec. 1.1033(a)-2 to have the gain recognized only to the extent provided by section 1033(a)(3). As a result of the replacement by R Corporation, none of the gain realized by S Corporation in 1972 is recognized. Assuming there are no adjustments for depreciation, the replacement property has a basis on October 1, 1972, of $18,000, that is, the cost of such property ($20,000) decreased by the amount of gain not recognized to S Corporation on the involuntary conversion ($2,000)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Conversion into money when disposition occurs before January 1, 1951. Section 1033(a)(2) provides that, if property is disposed of in an involuntary conversion before January 1, 1951, and money is received as compensation for the conversion, no gain shall be recognized if such money is forthwith expended in the acquisition of other property similar or related in service or use to the property so converted, or in the acquisition of control of a corporation owning such other property, or in the establishment of a replacement fund. That section also provides that, if any part of the money is not so expended, the gain, if any, shall be recognized to the extent of the money which is not so expended. For example, if, pursuant to section 381(c)(13) and section 1033(a)(2), property of a distributor or transferor corporation is disposed of before January 1, 1951, in an involuntary conversion, and the proceeds from the conversion are received by the acquiring corporation so that the gain on the conversion is realized by that corporation, the acquiring corporation may avoid recognition of the gain if it complies with the provisions of section 1033(a)(2) for nonrecognition of gain. Thus, the acquiring corporation must forthwith expend the proceeds in the acquisition of similar property or stock, or in the establishment of a replacement fund, in order to avoid recognition of the gain, if the disposition occurred before January 1, 1951. See the provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.1033(a)-3 and 1.1033(a)-4 relating to involuntary conversions and replacement funds when disposition of the converted property occurred before January 1, 1951.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Successive acquiring corporations. An acquiring corporation which, in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, acquires the assets of a corporation which previously acquired the assets of another corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, shall be treated as such other corporation for purposes of applying sections 381(c)(13) and 1033 (relating to involuntary conversions). Thus, for example, if any factor essential to the application of section 1033 occurs on or before the date of distribution or transfer in one transaction to which section 381(a) applies, and any other such factor occurs

after the date of distribution or transfer in a subsequent transaction to which section 381(a) applies, then the acquiring corporation in such subsequent transaction shall be treated as the first distributor or transferor corporation subject to the rules and limitations of this section for purposes of sections 381(c)(13) and 1033.

Sec. 1.381(c)(14)-1  Dividend carryover to personal holding company.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Carryover requirement. Section 381(c)(14) provides that an acquiring corporation shall succeed to and take into account the dividend carryover (described in section 564) of a distributor or transferor corporation in computing its dividends paid deduction under section 561 for taxable years ending after the date of distribution or transfer for which the acquiring corporation is a personal holding company under section 542. To determine the amount of such dividend carryover and to integrate it with the dividend carryover of the acquiring corporation in computing the dividends paid deduction for taxable years ending after the date of distribution or transfer, it is necessary to apply the provisions of section 564 and Sec. 1.564-1 in accordance with this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Manner of computing dividend carryover--(1) Preceding taxable years. If the acquiring corporation is a personal holding company under section 542 for its first taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer, the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation ending with such date is a first preceding taxable year for purposes of section 564, and the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation immediately preceding such first preceding year is a second preceding taxable year for purposes of section 564. If the acquiring corporation is a personal holding company for its second taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer, the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation ending with such date is a second preceding taxable year for purposes of section 564.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Preceding taxable years. If the acquiring corporation is a personal holding company under section 542 for its first taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer, the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation ending with such date is a first preceding taxable year for purposes of section 564, and the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation immediately preceding such first preceding year is a second preceding taxable year for purposes of section 564. If the acquiring corporation is a personal holding company for its second taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer, the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation ending with such date is a second preceding taxable year for purposes of section 564.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determination of dividends paid deduction and taxable income.

If two or more transactions to which section 381(a) applies have the same date of distribution or transfer, or if a particular taxable year of the acquiring corporation is the first taxable year ending after the dates of distribution or transfer of two or more such transactions occurring on different dates, the amount of the dividend carryover from each distributor or transferor corporation shall be determined separately as provided in the preceding sentence. Except as provided in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph, the aggregate of the dividend carryovers from each distributor or transferor corporation and the dividend carryover of the acquiring corporation (computed without regard to this section) shall constitute the dividend carryover under section 561(a)(3) of the acquiring corporation for its first taxable year ending after the date (or dates) of distribution or transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For the purpose of determining the dividend carryover to the first taxable year of the acquiring corporation ending after the date of distribution or transfer, the amount of the dividend carryover from the distributor or transferor corporation shall be determined under section 564 without reference to the dividends paid deduction or taxable income of the acquiring corporation or any other corporation. If two or more transactions to which section 381(a) applies have the same date of distribution or transfer, or if a particular taxable year of the acquiring corporation is the first taxable year ending after the dates of distribution or transfer of two or more such transactions occurring on different dates, the amount of the dividend carryover from each distributor or transferor corporation shall be determined separately as provided in the preceding sentence. Except as provided in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph, the aggregate of the dividend carryovers from each distributor or transferor corporation and the dividend carryover of the acquiring corporation (computed without regard to this section) shall constitute the dividend carryover under section 561(a)(3) of the acquiring corporation for its first taxable year ending after the date (or dates) of distribution or transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For the purpose of determining the dividend carryover to the second

The application of the foregoing rules may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. X Corporation and Y Corporation compute their taxable income on the basis of the calendar year, and both corporations use an accrual method of accounting. On December 31, 1954, Y Corporation acquires the assets of X Corporation in a transfer to which section 381(a)(2) applies. By reason of State law, Y Corporation assumes responsibility for all of the obligations for which X Corporation is then, or may become, liable. The parties have no knowledge of any specific obligations of X Corporation which are not yet fixed and ascertainable, but it is agreed to reduce the amount of consideration that Y Corporation is to transfer in exchange for the assets of X Corporation by $5,000 to reflect any unforeseen contingent liabilities of X Corporation for which Y Corporation might subsequently become liable. After the date of the transfer, a claim for damages on account of the alleged negligence of an alleged agent of X Corporation is filed. After commencement of legal action by the claimant and in order to eliminate the possibility of injury to its business, Y Corporation settles the claim in 1955 by paying the claimant the amount of $3,000. Assuming that such sum would have been deductible under section 162 if paid by X Corporation, Y Corporation is entitled to deduct such sum in accordance with the provisions of section 381(c)(16) and this section in computing its taxable income for 1955, since the claim gave rise to a liability after the date of transfer, the parties were not aware of a specific obligation, and the specific obligation was not reflected in the consideration transferred by Y Corporation in exchange for the assets of X Corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that the claim for damages was filed prior to the transfer of X Corporation's assets to Y Corporation, but the parties considered the chances for recovery by the claimant so remote that no specific amount other than the $5,000 reduction in consideration for all contingent liabilities as a whole is reflected in the consideration transferred by Y Corporation in exchange for the assets of X Corporation. Assuming that such sum would have been deductible under section 162 if paid by X Corporation, the $3,000 paid by Y Corporation in 1955 is deductible in accordance with the provisions of section 381(c)(16) and this section in 1955.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that the parties consider the chances of recovery by the claimant of sufficient probability that Y Corporation reduces the amount of consideration it transfers in exchange for the assets of X Corporation by $1,000 in addition to the $5,000 reduction for all other contingent liabilities. The $3,000 paid by Y Corporation in 1955 is not deductible under section 381(c)(16) and this section, since the specific obligation was reflected in the consideration transferred by Y Corporation in exchange for the assets of X Corporation. The deductibility of the payment is accordingly governed by the provisions of section 381(c)(4) and the regulations thereunder. Similarly, if in this case Y Corporation had transferred $10,000 less in consideration for the assets of X Corporation because of this particular claim, Y Corporation would not be entitled to any deduction for the $3,000 paid in 1955 under section 381(c)(16) and this section, and the deductibility of the payment would be governed by the provisions of section 381(c)(4) and the regulations thereunder. If the date of transfer of X Corporation's assets had occurred prior to the effective date of subchapter C, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, applicable to a reorganization, no deduction would be allowed to Y Corporation under that section.

then in computing such tax the deduction described in section 547 shall be allowed pursuant to section 381(c)(17) to such corporation for the amount of deficiency dividends paid by the acquiring corporation with respect to the distributor or transferor corporation.

The statement required with respect to the shareholders on the date of payment of the deficiency dividend shall relate to the shareholders of the acquiring corporation, and the required certified copy of the resolution authorizing the payment of the dividend shall be that of the board of directors, or other authority, of the acquiring corporation. Necessary changes may be made in Form 976 in order to carry out the provisions of this paragraph.

On July 31, 1958, a determination (as defined in section 547(c)) establishes that M Corporation is liable for the taxable year 1955 for personal holding company tax in the amount of $35,500 based on undistributed personal holding company income of $42,000 for such taxable year. N Corporation complies with the provisions of this section and on September 30, 1958, distributes $42,000 to its shareholders as deficiency dividends with respect to M Corporation's taxable year 1955. The distribution of $42,000 by N Corporation is a taxable dividend under section 316(b)(2) regardless of whether N Corporation is a personal holding company for the taxable year 1958 or whether it had any current or accumulated earnings and profits. See Example (3) in paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.316-1. Because N Corporation has paid deficiency dividends of $42,000 in accordance with this section, M Corporation is entitled to a deficiency dividend deduction of $42,000 for the taxable year 1955 and is thus relieved of its liability for personal holding company tax of $35,500 for such taxable year. To prevent a duplication of deductions, the amount distributed by N Corporation in 1958 does not

become a part of N Corporation's dividends paid deduction under section 561 for any taxable year.

any of the four taxable years immediately preceding such taxable year but excluding any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1962 (see paragraph (c)(3) of this section). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation ending on the date of distribution or transfer begins after December 31, 1961, and before January 1, 1963, the acquiring corporation shall, in computing taxable income for its first taxable year which begins after the date of distribution or transfer, also take into account the excess contributions made by the distributor or transferor corporation in the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation ending on the date of distribution or transfer (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section).
To determine the amount of excess contributions made by a distributor or transferor corporation and to integrate them with contributions made by the acquiring corporation for the purpose of determining the charitable contributions deductible by the acquiring corporation for its taxable years beginning immediately after the date of distribution or transfer, it is necessary to apply the provisions of section 170(b)(2) and Sec. 1.170-3 (or, if applicable, section 170(b)(2) and (d)(2) and Sec. 1.170A-11) in accordance with the conditions and limitations of section 381(c)(19) and this section.

Thus, for example, all taxable years of the distributor or transferor and acquiring corporations which, with respect to the first taxable year of the acquiring corporation beginning after the date of distribution or transfer, constitutes the second preceding taxable year shall together be considered as 1 taxable year even though the taxable years involved may not end on the same date.

Accordingly, since Y Corporation made no contributions in its taxable year ending June 30, 1957, its deduction for that year on account of excess contributions carried over is $10,000, an amount equal to the 5-percent limitation of section 170(b)(2). The deduction is attributable to excess contributions made by Y Corporation in the taxable year ended June 30, 1956; thus, the excess of those contributions over $10,000, namely, $4,000, is deductible by Y Corporation in its short taxable year ending November 30, 1957, in the manner and to the extent prescribed by section 170(b)(2) and this section. With respect to the short taxable year ending November 30, 1957, the excess contributions of the second preceding year are X Corporation's excess contributions of $12,000 made in the year ending March 31, 1957, and Y Corporation's excess contributions of $4,000 made in the year ending June 30, 1956, which were not deductible by Y Corporation in the taxable year ending June 30, 1957, because of the 5-percent limitation prescribed by section 170(b)(2), an aggregate of $16,000.

The excess contributions of the first preceding taxable year, namely, X Corporation's excess contributions made in the short taxable year ending June 30, 1957, are deductible by Z Corporation in its taxable year 1958, in the manner and to the extent prescribed in section 170(b)(2) and this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Z Corporation has been in existence for 3 taxable years.

Under the provisions of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the current earnings rate of Y for the taxable year 1961 would be 3 percent, determined by dividing the investment yield of Y, $45, by the mean of the assets of Y, $1,500 ($1,250+$1,750/2). In order to determine its average earnings rate and adjusted reserves rate for the taxable year 1961, Y would make up the following schedule:

For the taxable year 1961, Y would have an average earnings rate of 3.2 percent, computed by taking into account the current earnings rates for the taxable year 1961 and each of the 4 taxable years immediately preceding such taxable year. The adjusted reserves rate for such taxable year would be 3 percent since the current earnings rate of 3 percent for 1961 is lower than the average earnings rate of 3.2 percent.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example (1), except that the taxable year in issue is 1962, and the current earnings rate of Y for such taxable year was 3.8 percent. For the taxable year 1962, Y would have an average earnings rate of 3.3 percent, computed by taking into account only the current earnings rates for the taxable year 1962 and each of the 4 taxable years immediately preceding such taxable year. The adjusted reserves rate for such taxable year would be 3.3 percent since the average earnings rate of 3.3 percent is lower than the 1962 current earnings rate of 3.8 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> To the extent there are any amounts accrued for discounts in the nature of interest which have not been included as interest paid under section 805(e)(3), the acquiring corporation shall be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation for purposes of including such amounts as interest paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any adjustment required by section 806(b) with respect to an item described in section 810(c) shall be made by the acquiring corporation in its first taxable year which begins after the date of distribution or transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The amount of the deduction provided by section 809(d)(6), as limited by section 809(f), for all taxable years of the distributor or transferor corporation which end on and before the date of distribution or transfer (irrespective of whether or not the distributor or transferor corporation claimed this deduction for such taxable years) for the purpose of determining the limitation under section 809(d)(6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)(i)</em> To the extent there are any remaining net increases or net decreases in reserves required to be taken into account by the distributor or transferor corporation under section 810(d)(1), the acquiring corporation shall be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation as of its first taxable year which begins after the date of distribution or transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To the extent there are any remaining net increases or net decreases in reserves required to be taken into account by the distributor or transferor corporation under section 810(d)(1), the acquiring corporation shall be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation as of its first taxable year which begins after the date of distribution or transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Assume that the amount of an item described in section 810(c) of X, a life insurance company, at the beginning of the taxable year 1959 is $100. Assume that at the end of the taxable year 1959, as a result of a change in the basis used in computing such item during the taxable year, the amount of the item (computed on the new basis) is $200 but computed on the old basis would have been $150. Since the amount of the item at the end of the taxable year computed on the new basis, $200, exceeds the amount of the item at the end of the taxable year computed on the old basis, $150, by $50, section 810(d)(1) provides that one-tenth of the amount of such excess, or $5, shall be taken into account by X as a net increase referred to in section 809(d)(2) and paragraph (a)(2) of

Sec. 1.809-5 in determining gain or loss from operations for each of the 10 taxable years immediately following the taxable year 1959. Assume further that on June 30, 1961, X transferred all its assets to Y, a life insurance company, in a statutory merger to which section 361 applies. Under the provisions of section 810(d)(1), X would include $5 as a net increase under section 809(d)(2) and paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 1.809-5 in determining gain or loss from operations for its taxable years 1960 and 1961. Thus, the remaining net increase to be taken into account by X under section 810(d)(1) is $40 (eight-tenths of $50). Accordingly, Y shall take into account $5 as a net increase referred to in section 809(d)(2) and paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 1.809-5 in determining gain or loss from operations for each of its 8 taxable years beginning in 1962 ($5x8=$40).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)(i)</em> The dollar balances in the shareholders surplus account, policyholders surplus account, and other accounts provided, however, that the acquiring corporation is a stock life insurance company.

The percentage of the accounts to which the acquiring corporation succeeds is determined by the ratio of the distributor's or transferor's insurance reserves for the contracts transferred to the acquiring corporation, as maintained under section 816(b), to the distributor's or transferor's reserves for all of its contracts maintained under section 816(b) immediately before the earlier of the distribution or transfer or the adoption of the plan of liquidation or reorganization. For transactions in which the distributor liquidates pursuant to an election under section 338(h)(10), see Sec. 1.338-11(f) for the treatment of its remaining policyholders surplus account.

P buys the stock of insurance company target, T, from S for $16, and P and S make a section 338(h)(10) election for T. T transfers no insurance contracts to S, or any related party, in connection with the transaction. Further, assume that T had $10 in its policyholders surplus account and no balance in its shareholders surplus account or other accounts. Immediately before the deemed asset sale, old T is required to include as ordinary income the $10 in the policyholders surplus account.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that T holds a block of life insurance contracts P does not wish to acquire, and, immediately before the sale of T stock, S causes T to distribute the unwanted block of insurance contracts to S. Further, assume that S is an insurance company, that the distribution of contracts is one of series of distributions in complete cancellation or redemption of all of its stock (the others occurring under Sec. 1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(4)(i)) that qualifies as a complete liquidation under section 332, and that old T's tax reserves with respect to the distributed contracts represent one-tenth of old T's tax reserves with respect to all of its life insurance contracts. Because T transfers less than 50 percent of its life insurance business to S in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, S succeeds to a ratable portion of old T's policyholders surplus account ($1), and old T includes as ordinary income the remaining $9 of that account.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example 2, except that 14 months after the deemed asset sale, S and X, a person related to new T under section 197(f)(9)(C), engage in an indemnity reinsurance transaction involving the contracts transferred to S from old T. Because X is related to the purchasing corporation (P) under section 197(f)(9)(C), and X receives contracts from the acquiring corporation (S) that S acquired from old T within two years of the transfer from old T to S, the contracts are presumed to have been transferred pursuant to a plan in existence at the time of old T's liquidation. If S cannot establish otherwise, old T is treated as having distributed the remainder of its policyholders surplus account. In that case, in the taxable year of the indemnity reinsurance transaction, S takes into account as ordinary income the portion of the old T's accounts ($1) that old T or S has not previously taken into account as income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> To the extent that any amount must be added to the shareholders surplus account as a result of an election made under section 815(d)(1) by the distributor or transferor corporation, the acquiring corporation shall be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation as of its first taxable year which begins after the date of distribution or transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The amount of the life insurance reserves at the end of 1958, but only for the purpose of applying the limitation provided under section 815(d)(4)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> To the extent there are amounts subject to the provisions of section 817(d), the acquiring corporation shall be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> To the extent there are any installments of tax imposed by section 818(e)(3)(A) remaining to be paid, the acquiring corporation shall be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation for the purpose of paying such installments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> The capital loss carryovers, subject to conditions and limitations consistent with the conditions and limitations prescribed in section 381(c)(3) and the regulations thereunder, except that any net capital loss of the distributor or transferor corporation for a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1959, shall not be taken into account.

A deficiency dividend paid by the acquiring corporation with respect to the distributor or transferor corporation must be a distribution that would satisfy the definition of a deficiency dividend under section 860(f) if paid by the distributor or transferor corporation to its own shareholders. The distribution, however, shall be paid by the acquiring corporation to its own shareholders. The distribution also shall be paid after the date of distribution or transfer and on, or within 90 days after, the date of the determination but before the acquiring corporation files a claim under paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Claim for deduction. A claim for deduction under this section shall be made by the acquiring corporation on

Form 976 and shall be filed within 120 days after the date of the determination. The form shall contain, or be accompanied by, the information required under Sec. 1.860-2(b)(2) in sufficient detail to properly identify the facts with respect to the distributor or transferor corporation and the acquiring corporation. The required certified copy of the resolution authorizing the payment of the dividend shall be that of the trustees, board of directors, or other authority, of the acquiring corporation. Necessary changes may be made in Form 976 in order to carry out the provisions of this paragraph. The claim shall be filed with the district director, or director of the internal revenue service center, with whom the return of the distributor or transferor corporation to which the claim relates was filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effect on dividends paid deduction. A deficiency dividend paid by the acquiring corporation that is allowable as a deduction to a distributor or transferor corporation pursuant to section 381(c)(25) shall not become a part of the dividends paid deduction of the acquiring corporation under section 561 for any taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Successive transactions to which section 381(a) applies. The provisions of this section shall apply in the case of successive transactions to which section 381(a) applies. Thus, if X corporation transfers its assets to Y corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies and if Y corporation transfers its assets to Z corporation in a subsequent transaction to which section 381(a) applies, then, subject to the provisions of this section, X corporation may take a deficiency dividend deduction for the amount of deficiency dividends paid by Z corporation with respect to X corporation.
