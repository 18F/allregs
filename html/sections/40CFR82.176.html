                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any producer of a new substitute must submit a notice of intent  to introduce a substitute into interstate commerce 90 days prior to such  introduction. Any producer of an existing substitute already in  interstate commerce must submit a notice as of July 18, 1994, if such  substitute has not already been reviewed and approved by the Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> With respect to the following substitutes, producers are exempt  from notification requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Substitutes already listed as acceptable. Producers need not  submit notices on substitutes that are already listed as acceptable  under SNAP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Small sectors. Persons using substitutes in sectors other than  the nine principal sectors reviewed under this program are exempt from  the notification requirements. This exemption shall not be construed to  nullify an unacceptability determination or to allow use of an otherwise  unacceptable substitute.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Small volume use within SNAP sectors. Within the nine principal  SNAP sectors, persons introducing a substitute whose expected volume of  use amounts to less than 10,000 lbs. per year within a SNAP sector are  exempt from notification requirements. This exemption shall not be  construed to allow use of an otherwise unacceptable substitute in any  quantity. Persons taking advantage of this exemption for small uses must  maintain documentation for each substitute describing how the substitute  meets this small use definition. This documentation must include annual  production and sales information by sector.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Research and development. Production of substitutes for the sole  purpose of research and development is exempt from reporting  requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Test marketing. Use of substitutes for the sole purpose of test  marketing is exempt from SNAP notification requirements until 90 days  prior to the introduction of such substitutes for full-scale commercial  sale in interstate commerce. Persons taking advantage of this exemption  are, however, required to notify the Agency in writing that they are  conducting test marketing 30 days prior to the commencement of such  marketing. Notification shall include the name of the substitute, the  volume used in the test marketing, intended sector end-uses,   and expected duration of the test marketing period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Formulation changes. In cases where replacement of class I or II  compounds causes formulators to change other components in a product,  formulators are exempt from reporting with respect to these auxiliary  formulation changes. However, the SNAP submitter is required to notify  the Agency if such changes are expected to significantly increase the  environmental and human health risk associated with the use of any class  I or class II substitute.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Substitutes used as feedstocks. Producers of substitutes used as  feedstocks which are largely or entirely consumed, transformed or  destroyed in the manufacturing or use process are exempt from reporting  requirements concerning such substitutes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Use of a substitute in the possession of an end-user as of March  18, 1994, listed as unacceptable or acceptable subject to narrowed use  limits may continue until the individual end-users' existing supply, as  of that date, of the substitute is exhausted. Use of substitutes  purchased after March 18, 1994, is not permitted subsequent to April 18,  1994.</p>
