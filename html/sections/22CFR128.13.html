The appeal must specify upon which of these grounds the appeal is based and must indicate from which provisions of the order the appeal is taken. An appeal from an order issued upon default will not be entertained if the respondent has failed to seek relief as provided in Sec. 128.4(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Matters considered on appeal.

The Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security may direct a rehearing and reopening of the proceedings before the Administrative Law Judge if he or she finds that the record is insufficient or that new evidence is relevant and material to the issues and was not known and was not reasonably available to the respondent at the time of the original hearings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effect of appeals.
