                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Effect on other regulations. All regulations, orders, or like  directions heretofore issued by any officer of the Foundation which  impose requirements designed to prohibit any discrimination against  individuals on the ground   of race, color, or national origin under any program to which this part  applies, and which authorize the suspension or termination of or refusal  to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance to any applicant  for or recipient of such assistance for failure to comply with such  requirements, are hereby superseded to the extent that such  discrimination is prohibited by this part, except that nothing in this  part shall be deemed to relieve any person of any obligation assumed or  imposed under any such superseded regulation, order, instruction, or  like direction prior to the effective date of this part. Nothing in this  part, however, supersedes any of the following (including future  amendments thereof): (1) Executive Order 11246 and regulation issued  thereunder, or (2) any other orders, regulations, or instructions,  insofar as such orders, regulations, or instructions prohibit  discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in any  program or situation to which this part is inapplicable, or prohibit  discrimination on any other ground.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Forms and instructions. Each responsible Foundation official  shall issue and promptly make available to interested persons forms and  detailed instructions and procedures for effectuating this part as  applied to programs to which this part applies and for which he is  responsible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Supervision and coordination. The Director may from time to time  assign to officials of other departments or agencies of the Government,  with the consent of such departments or agencies, responsibilities in  connection with the effectuation of the purposes of title VI of the Act  and this part (other than responsibility for final decision as provided  in Sec. 611.10), including the achievement of effective coordination  and maximum uniformity within the Foundation and within the Executive  Branch of the Government in the application of title VI and this  regulation to similar programs and in similar situations. Any action  taken, determination made, or requirement imposed by an official of  another Department or agency acting pursuant to an assignment of  responsibility under this subsection shall have the same effect as  though such action had been taken by the responsible official of this  agency.
