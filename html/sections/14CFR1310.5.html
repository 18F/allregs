                                Sec. 1310.5  Meetings and actions of the Board.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Place and frequency. The Board meets, on the call of the  Chairman, in order to consider matters requiring action by the Board.  The time and place for any such meeting shall be determined by the  members of the Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Quorum and voting. Two voting members of the Board constitute a  quorum for the transaction of business. All decisions and determinations  of the Board shall be made by a majority vote of the voting members. All  votes on determinations of the Board required by the Act shall be  recorded in the minutes. A Board member may request that any vote be  recorded according to individual Board members.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Agenda of meetings. As a general rule, an agenda for each  meeting shall be distributed to members of the Board at least 48 hours  in advance of the date of the meeting, together with copies of materials  relevant to the agenda items.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Minutes. The Chief Administrative Officer shall keep minutes of  each Board meeting and of action taken without a meeting, a draft of  which is to be distributed to each member of the   Board as soon as practicable after each meeting or action. To the extent  practicable, the minutes of a Board meeting shall be corrected and  approved at the next meeting of the Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Use of conference call communications equipment. Any member may  participate in a meeting of the Board through the use of conference  call, telephone or similar communications equipment, by means of which  all persons participating in the meeting can simultaneously speak to and  hear each other. Any member so participating in a meeting shall be  deemed present for all purposes, except that the Comptroller General of  the United States or the designee of the Comptroller General, who serves  as a nonvoting member, shall not participate in any of the Board's  discussions or deliberations in connection with individual loan  guarantee applications. Actions taken by the Board at meetings conducted  through the use of such equipment, including the votes of each member,  shall be recorded in the usual manner in the minutes of the meetings of  the Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Actions between meetings. When, in the judgment of the Chairman,  it is desirable for the Board to consider action without holding a  meeting, the relevant information and recommendations for action may be  transmitted to the members by the Chief Administrative Officer and the  voting members may communicate their votes to the Chairman in writing  (including an action signed in counterpart by each Board member),  electronically, or orally (including telephone communication). Any  action taken under this paragraph has the same effect as an action taken  at a meeting. Any such action shall be recorded in the minutes. If a  voting member believes the matter should be considered at a meeting, the  member may so notify the Chief Administrative Officer and the matter  will be scheduled for consideration at a meeting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Delegations of authority. The Board may delegate authority,  subject to such terms and conditions as the Board deems appropriate, to  the Executive Director, the Legal Counsel, or the Chief Administrative  Officer, to take certain actions not required by the Act to be taken by  the Board. All delegations shall be made pursuant to resolutions of the  Board and recorded in writing, whether in the minutes of a meeting or  otherwise. Any action taken pursuant to delegated authority has the  effect of an action taken by the Board.</p>
