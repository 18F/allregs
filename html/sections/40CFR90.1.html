                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This part applies to new nonroad spark-ignition engines and vehicles with gross power output at or below 19 kilowatts (kW) used for any purpose, unless we exclude them under paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In certain cases, the regulations in this part 90 also apply to new engines with a gross power output above 19 kW that would otherwise be covered by 40 CFR part 1048 or 1051. See 40 CFR 1048.615 or 1051.145(a)(3) for provisions related to this allowance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In certain cases, the regulations in this part 90 apply to new engines below 50 cc used in motorcycles that are motor vehicles. See 40 CFR 86.447-2006 for provisions related to this allowance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The following nonroad engines and vehicles are not subject to the provisions of this part:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Engines that are certified to meet the requirements of 40 CFR part 1051 or are otherwise subject to 40 CFR part 1051 (for example, engines used in snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles). This part nevertheless applies to engines used in recreational vehicles if the manufacturer uses the provisions of 40 CFR 1051.145(a)(3) to exempt them from the requirements of 40 CFR part 1051. Compliance with the provisions of this part is a required condition of that exemption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Engines used in highway motorcycles. See 40 CFR part 86, subpart E.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Propulsion marine engines. See 40 CFR part 91.

The equipment manufacturer bears the responsibility to ascertain on an annual basis and maintain documentation available to the Administrator that no appropriate certified engine is available from any source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Engines that are subject to emission standards under 40 CFR part 1054. See 40 CFR 1054.1 to determine when part 1054 applies. Note that certain requirements and prohibitions apply to engines built on or after January 1, 2010 if they are installed in equipment that will be used solely for competition, as described in 40 CFR 1054.1 and 40 CFR 1068.1; those provisions apply instead of the provisions of this part 90.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Engines subject to the provisions of this subpart are also subject to the provisions found in subparts B through N of this part, except that Subparts C, H, M and N of this part apply only to Phase 2 engines as defined in this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Certain text in this part is identified as pertaining to Phase 1 or Phase 2 engines.

If no indication of Phase is given, the text pertains to all engines, regardless of Phase.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> This part also applies to engines under 50 cc used in motorcycles that are motor vehicles if the manufacturer uses the provisions of 40 CFR 86.447-2006 to meet the emission standards in this part instead of the requirements of 40 CFR part 86. In this case, compliance with the provisions of this part is a required condition of that exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> This part applies as specified in 40 CFR part 60 subpart JJJJ, to spark-ignition engines subject to the standards of 40 CFR part 60, subpart JJJJ.
