Minor repairs and alterations may be made to the same  standards as the original installation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of Sec. 34.17-5 and Sec. 34.17-25.  A 6-inch blanket of foam in 3 minutes for machinery spaces and pumprooms  will be considered as meeting the requirements of Sec. 34.17-5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where a system is installed to protect a tank, it shall be so  designed and arranged as to spread a blanket of foam over the entire  liquid surface of the tank within the range of usual trim. The  arrangement of piping shall be such as to give a relatively uniform  distribution over the entire area protected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For tanks, the rate of discharge to foam outlets protecting the  hazard shall be as set forth in Sec. 34.17-5(b), except that the value  of 1 gallon per minute shall be substituted in both cases for the value  of 1.6 gallons per minute.

Connections for at least two fire hoses shall be provided  between the pump and the stop valve.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the foam system is of the portable or semiportable type,  the apparatus and chemicals shall be stored in a readily accessible  place protected from the weather.</p><p class="depth4">Subpart 34.20_Deck Foam System, Details</p>
