                            <p class="depth0">Special natural wine may be blended with other special natural wine  of the same class and kind, and with heavy bodied blending wine, or  natural wine of the same kind of fruit, in the further production of  special natural wine. The blending of special natural wines produced  under different formulas requires the filing and approval of a formula  authorizing a blending; however, where two or more formulas have been  approved for the production of special natural wine of the same type,  e.g.,   producing a sweet vermouth by blending sweet vermouths produced under  two or more approved formulas, the submission and approval of an  additional formula is not required.  (Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1386, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5386))  (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number  1512-0059)</p>
