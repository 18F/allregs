The Department will   issue payment within 30 days of receiving these items. The Department  may pay a participant for some or all of the costs associated with the  technical services provided by a TSP hired by the participant, or upon  receipt of an assignment of payment from the participant, make payment  directly to the TSP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Participants must authorize in writing to the Department the  disclosure of their records on file with the Department that they wish  to make available to specific TSPs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Payments for technical services will be made only one time for  the same technical service provided unless, as determined by the  Department, the emergence of new technologies or major changes in the  participant's farming or ranching operations necessitate the need for  additional technical services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The Department will not make payment for activities or services  that are customarily provided at no cost by a TSP to a participant as  determined by the State Conservationist.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Payment rates for technical services acquired by participants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> NRCS will calculate TSP payment rates for technical services  using national, regional, and locally determined price data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Establishing TSP payment rates.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> NRCS will establish guidelines to analyze the local pricing  information using a standardized method.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> NRCS will establish TSP payment rates for the various  categories of technical services. NRCS will determine the rates  according to NRCS regional and local cost data, procurement data, and  market data.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> National Headquarters will review and approve State payment  rates to ensure consistency where similar resource conditions and  agricultural operations exist. Payment rates may vary to some degree  between or within States due to differences in State laws, the cost of  doing business, competition, and other variables.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> National Headquarters and State levels will review payment  rates annually or more frequently, as needed, and adjust the rates based  upon data from existing procurement contracts, Federal cost rates, and  other appropriate sources.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> NRCS may adjust payment rates, as needed, on a case-by-case  basis in response to unusual conditions or unforeseen circumstances in  delivering technical services such as highly complex technical  situations, emergency conditions, serious threats to human health or the  environment, or major resource limitations. In these cases, NRCS will  set a case-specific TSP payment rate based on the Department's  determination of the scope, magnitude, and timeliness of the technical  services needed.
