                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An agency that has received CB funds for one to three  consecutive years may be eligible for contributions funding.  Contributions funding consists of five categories:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Complaint processing (CP) funds;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Special enforcement effort (SEE) funds (see Sec. 115.305);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Training funds (see Sec. 115.306);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Administrative cost (AC) funds; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Partnership (P) funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> CP funds. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Agencies receiving CP funds will receive such  support based solely on the number of complaints processed by the agency  and accepted for payment by the FHEO regional director during a  consecutive, specifically identified, 12-month period. The 12-month  period will be identified in the cooperative agreement between HUD and  the agency. The FHEO regional office shall determine whether or not  cases are acceptably processed   based on requirements enumerated in the cooperative agreement and its  attachments/appendices, performance standards set forth in 24 CFR  115.206, and provisions of the interim agreement or MOU.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount of funding to agencies that are new to contributions  funding will be based on the number of complaints acceptably processed  by the agency during the specifically identified 12-month period  preceding the signing of the cooperative agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> AC funds. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Agencies that acceptably process 100 or more cases  will receive no less than 10 percent of the agency's total FHAP payment  amount for the preceding year, in addition to CP funds, contingent on  fiscal year appropriations. Agencies that acceptably process fewer than  100 cases will receive a flat rate, contingent on fiscal year  appropriations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Agencies will be required to provide HUD with a statement of how  they intend to use the AC funds. HUD may require that some or all AC  funding be directed to activities designed to create, modify, or improve  local, regional, or national information systems concerning fair housing  matters (including the purchase of state-of-the-art computer systems,  obtaining and maintaining Internet access, etc.).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> P funds. The purpose of P funds is for an agency participating  in the FHAP to utilize the services of individuals and/or public,  private, for-profit, or not-for-profit organizations that have expertise  needed to effectively carry out the provisions of the agency's fair  housing law. P funds are fixed amounts and shall be allocated based on  the FHAP appropriation. Agencies must consult with the CAO and GTR in  identifying appropriate usage of P funds for the geographical area that  the agency services. Some examples of proper P fund usage include, but  are not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contracting with qualified organizations to conduct fair housing  testing in appropriate cases;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Hiring experienced, temporary staff to assist in the  investigation of complex or aged cases;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Partnering with grassroots, faith-based or other community-based  organizations to conduct education and outreach to people of different  backgrounds on how to live together peacefully in the same housing  complex, neighborhood, or community;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Contracting with individuals outside the agency who have special  expertise needed for the investigation of fair housing cases (e.g.,  architects for design and construction cases or qualified individuals  from colleges and universities for the development of data and  statistical analyses).</p>
