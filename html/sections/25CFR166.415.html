                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Within five business days of the Indian landowner's notification to us that a payment has not been received, we will contact the permittee either in writing or by telephone requesting that the permittee provide documentation (e.g., canceled check, cash receipt voucher, copy of a money order or cashier's check) showing that payment has been made to the Indian landowner. If the permitee fails to provide such documentation, we will follow the procedures identified in Sec. 166.419 of this part to collect the money on behalf of the Indian landowner or to cancel the permit.</p>
