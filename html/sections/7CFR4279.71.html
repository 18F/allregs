                            <p class="depth0">Any public body or nonprofit corporation that receives a guaranteed loan that meets the thresholds established by 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, as codified by 2 CFR 400.1, must provide an audit for the fiscal year (of the borrower) in which the Loan Note Guarantee is issued. If the loan is for development or purchases made in a previous fiscal year through interim financing, an audit will also be provided for the fiscal year in which the development or purchases occurred. Any audit provided by a public body or nonprofit corporation in compliance with paragraph will be considered adequate to meet the audit requirements of the B&I; program for that year.
