                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Factors requiring denial. As specified in section 3(c) of the  BHC Act, the Board may not approve any application under this subpart  if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The transaction would result in a monopoly or would further any  combination or conspiracy to monopolize, or to attempt to monopolize,  the business of banking in any part of the United States;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The effect of the transaction may be substantially to lessen  competition in any section of the country, tend to create a monopoly, or  in any other manner be in restraint of trade, unless the Board finds  that the transaction's anti-competitive effects are clearly outweighed  by its probable effect in meeting the convenience and needs of the  community;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The applicant has failed to provide the Board with adequate  assurances that it will make available such information on its  operations or activities, and the operations or activities of any  affiliate of the applicant, that the Board deems appropriate to  determine and enforce compliance with the BHC Act and other applicable  federal banking statutes, and any regulations thereunder; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In the case of an application involving a foreign banking  organization, the foreign banking organization is not subject to  comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis by the  appropriate authorities in its home country, as provided in  Sec. 211.24(c)(1)(ii) of the Board's Regulation K (12 CFR  211.24(c)(1)(ii)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Other factors. In deciding applications under this subpart, the  Board also considers the following factors   with respect to the applicant, its subsidiaries, any banks related to  the applicant through common ownership or management, and the bank or  banks to be acquired:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Financial condition. Their financial condition and future  prospects, including whether current and projected capital positions and  levels of indebtedness conform to standards and policies established by  the Board.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Managerial resources. The competence, experience, and integrity  of the officers, directors, and principal shareholders of the applicant,  its subsidiaries, and the banks and bank holding companies concerned;  their record of compliance with laws and regulations; and the record of  the applicant and its affiliates of fulfilling any commitments to, and  any conditions imposed by, the Board in connection with prior  applications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Convenience and needs of community. The convenience and needs of  the communities to be served, including the record of performance under  the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (12 U.S.C. 2901 et seq.) and  regulations issued thereunder, including the Board's Regulation BB (12  CFR part 228).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Interstate transactions. The Board may approve any application  or notice under this subpart by a bank holding company to acquire  control of all or substantially all of the assets of a bank located in a  state other than the home state of the bank holding company, without  regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under the law of any  state, if the transaction complies with the requirements of section 3(d)  of the BHC Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(d)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Conditional approvals. The Board may impose conditions on any  approval, including conditions to address competitive, financial,  managerial, safety and soundness, convenience and needs, compliance or  other concerns, to ensure that approval is consistent with the relevant  statutory factors and other provisions of the BHC Act.</p>
