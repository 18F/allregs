                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The primary purpose of each transfer of surplus airport property  under section 13 of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 was to make the  property available for public or civil airport needs. However, it was  also intended to ensure the availability of the property transferred,  and of the entire airport, for use by the United States during a war or  national emergency, if needed. As evidence of this purpose, most  instruments of disposal of surplus airport property reserved or granted  to the United States a right of exclusive possession and control of the  airport during a war or emergency, substantially the same as one of the  following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That during the existence of any emergency declared by the  President or the Congress, the Government shall have the right without  charge except as indicated below to the full, unrestricted possession,  control, and use of the landing area, building areas, and airport  facilities or any part thereof, including any additions or improvements  thereto made subsequent to the declaration of the airport property as  surplus: Provided, however, That the Government shall be responsible  during the period of such use for the entire cost of maintaining all  such areas, facilities, and improvements, or the portions used, and  shall pay a fair rental for the use of any installations or structures  which have been added thereto without Federal aid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> During any national emergency declared by the President or by  Congress, the United States shall have the right to make exclusive or  nonexclusive use and have exclusive or nonexclusive control and  possession, without charge, of the airport at which the surplus property  is located or used or of such portion thereof as it may desire:  Provided, however, That the United States shall be responsible for the  entire cost of maintaining such part of the airport as it may use  exclusively, or over which it may have exclusive possession and control,  during the period of such use, possession, or control and shall be  obligated to contribute a reasonable share, commensurate with the use  made by it, of the cost of maintenance of such property as it may use  nonexclusively or over which it may have nonexclusive control and  possession: Provided further, That the United States shall pay a fair  rental for its use, control, or possession, exclusively or  nonexclusively, of any improvements to the airport made without U.S.  aid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A release from the terms, conditions, reservations, or  restrictions of   an instrument of disposal that might prejudice the needs or interests of  the armed forces, is granted only after consultation with the Department  of Defense.</p>
