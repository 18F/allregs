Prior to CMS's acceptance of a provider agreement or issuance or reissuance of a supplier billing number, or at any time upon written request by CMS, the provider or part B supplier must furnish CMS with the identity of any person who:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Has an ownership or control interest in the provider or part B supplier;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is an agent or managing employee of the provider or part B supplier; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Is a person identified in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section and has been convicted of, or was an owner of, had a controlling interest in, or was a managing employee of a corporation that has been convicted of a criminal offense, subjected to any civil monetary penalty, or excluded from the programs for any activities related to involvement in the Medicare, Medicaid, title V or title XX social services program, since the inception of those programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Refusal to enter into or renew agreement or to issue or reissue billing numbers. CMS may refuse to enter into or renew an agreement with a provider of services, or to issue or reissue a billing number to a part B supplier, if any person who has an ownership or control interest in the provider or supplier, or who is an agent or managing employee, has been convicted of a criminal offense or subjected to any civil penalty or sanction related to the involvement of that person in Medicare, Medicaid, title V or title XX social services programs. In making this decision, CMS considers the facts and circumstances of the specific case, including the nature and severity of the crime, penalty or sanction and the extent to which it adversely affected beneficiaries and the programs involved. CMS also considers whether it has been given reasonable assurance that the person will not commit any further criminal or civil offense against the programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notification of Inspector General. CMS promptly notifies the Inspector General of the Department of the receipt of any application or request for participation, certification, re-certification, or for a billing number that identifies any person described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section and the action taken on that application or request.
