Sec. 284.7 and 284.9 of this chapter, an intrastate pipeline may elect to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Base its rates upon the methodology used:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In designing rates to recover the cost of gathering, treatment, processing, transportation, delivery or similar service (including storage service) included in one of its then effective firm sales rate schedules for city-gate service on file with the appropriate state regulatory agency; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In determining the allowance permitted by the appropriate state regulatory agency to be included in a natural gas distributor's rates for city-gate natural gas service; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To use the rates contained in one of its then effective transportation rate schedules for intrastate service on file with the appropriate state regulatory agency which the intrastate pipeline determines covers service comparable to service under this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> If an intrastate pipeline does not choose to make any election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, it shall apply for Commission approval, by order, of the proposed rates and charges by filing with the Commission the proposed rates and charges, and information showing the proposed rates and charges are fair and equitable. Each petition for approval filed under this paragraph must be accompanied by the fee set forth in Sec. 381.403 or by a petition for waiver pursuant to Sec. 384.106 of this chapter. Upon filing the petition for approval, the intrastate pipeline may commence the transportation service and charge and collect the proposed rate, subject to refund.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If an intrastate pipeline does not choose to make any election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, it shall apply for Commission approval, by order, of the proposed rates and charges by filing with the Commission the proposed rates and charges, and information showing the proposed rates and charges are fair and equitable.

service, unless within the 150 day period, the Commission either extends the time for action, or institutes a proceeding in which all interested parties will be afforded an opportunity for written comments and for the oral presentation of views, data and arguments. In such proceeding, the Commission either will approve the rate or disapprove the rate and order refund, with interest, of any amount which has been determined to be in excess of those shown to be fair and equitable or in excess of the rates and charges which interstate pipelines would be permitted to charge for providing similar transportation service.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A Commission order approving or disapproving a transportation rate under this paragraph supersedes a rate determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Treatment of revenues. The Commission presumes that all revenues received by an intrastate pipeline in connection with transportation authorized under Sec. 284.122(a) and computed in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section have been or will be taken into account by the appropriate state regulatory agency for purposes of establishing transportation charges by the intrastate pipeline for service to intrastate customers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Presumptions.
