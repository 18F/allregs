                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> We do not approve any request that does not include all of the  information we require in Sec. Sec. 1254.94 and 1254.96.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> We do not normally approve requests to microfilm documents that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Have previously been microfilmed and made available to the  public;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> We have approved for microfilming by another party; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> We plan to film as a NARA microfilm publication or which relate  closely to other documents previously microfilmed or approved for  microfilming by NARA. We may grant exceptions to this provision at our  discretion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> We normally do not approve requests to microfilm documents:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Having restrictions on access that preclude their reproduction;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Known to be protected by copyright;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Having high intrinsic value that only authorized NARA personnel  may handle;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In vulnerable physical condition;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Having a high research demand and which we would have to deny to  others for an extended period of time during the microfilming process.  Where possible, we assist you in developing filming schedules that avoid  the need to close documents for a lengthy period of time; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In formats, such as oversize documents, bound volumes, and  others, that would be subject to excessive stress and possible damage  from special equipment you plan to use, as well as documents fastened  with grommets, heavy duty staples, miscellaneous fasteners, or wafers  and other adhesives that cannot be removed without tearing or breaking  documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> We normally do not approve requests from persons or  organizations that failed to produce usable microfilm or to honor  commitments they made in previous requests, or for whom we have had to  rescind previous permission to microfilm documents because of their  conduct.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> We do not approve requests to microfilm records in NARA  facilities in which there is insufficient space available for private  microfilming. We do not permit private microfilming in our records  storage (stack) areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Federal agencies microfilming records in support of the agency's  mission may use the space set aside for private microfilming. Agency  microfilming takes priority over private microfilming when there is  insufficient space to accommodate both at the same time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a NARA facility does not have enough space to accommodate  all requests, we may schedule separate projects by limiting the time  allowed for each particular project or by requiring projects to  alternate their use of the space.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> We also do not approve requests where the only space available  for filming is in the facility's research room, and such work would  disturb researchers. We do not move records from a facility lacking  space for private microfilming to another NARA facility for that  purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> We do not approve requests to microfilm records when there is  not enough staff to provide the necessary support services, including  document preparation, training of private microfilmers, and monitoring  the filming.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> We do not approve the start of a project to microfilm records  until you have agreed in writing to the amount and schedule of fees for  any training, microfilm preparation, and monitoring we must conduct that  is necessary to support your project. Our letter of tentative approval  for the project includes an agreement detailing the records in the  project and the detailed schedule of fees for NARA services for the  project. We give final approval when we receive your signed copy of the  agreement.</p>
