From time to time, but not less frequently than  every two years as directed by 49 U.S.C. 5309(g)(5), FTA publishes for  public comment policy guidance on the application of these measures, and  the agency expects it will continue to do so. Moreover, FTA may choose  to amend these measures, pending the results of ongoing studies  regarding transit benefit and cost evaluation methods. In addition, FTA  may establish warrants for one or more of these criteria through which  an automatic rating would be assigned based on the characteristics of  the project and/or its corridor. FTA will develop these warrants based  on analysis of the features of projects and/or corridor characteristics  that would produce satisfactory ratings on one or more of the criteria.  Such warrants would be included in policy guidance issued for public  comment before being finalized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. In this Appendix, the following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Enrichments mean certain improvements to the transit project  desired by the grant recipient that are non-integral to the basic  functioning of the project, whose benefits are not captured in whole by  other criteria, and are carried out simultaneous with grant execution  and may be included in the Federal grant. Enrichments include but are  not limited to artwork, landscaping, and bicycle and pedestrian  improvements such as sidewalks, paths, plazas, site and station  furniture, site lighting, signage, public artwork, bike facilities, and  permanent fencing. Enrichments also include sustainable building design  features of up to 2.5 percent of the total cost of the facilities (when  such facilities are designed to achieve a third-party certification or  to optimize a building's design to use less energy, water and reduce  greenhouse gas emissions that may not lead directly to an official  certification).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transit dependent person as used in this context means either a  person from a household that owns no cars or a person whose household  income places them in the lowest income stratum of the local travel  demand model. For those project sponsors choosing to use the simplified  national model ``transit dependent persons'' will be defined as  individuals residing in households that do not own a car. Project  sponsors that choose to continue to use their local travel model rather  than the FTA developed simplified national model to estimate trips will  define transit dependent persons as individuals in the lowest  socioeconomic stratum as defined in the local model, which is usually  either households with no cars or households in the lowest locally  defined income bracket.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Trips mean linked trips riding on any portion of the New Starts  or Small Starts project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Mobility Improvements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The total number of trips using the  proposed project. Extra weight may be given to trips that would be made  on the project by transit dependent persons in the current year, and, at  the discretion of the project sponsor, in the horizon year. The method  for assigning extra weight is set forth in policy guidance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the project sponsor chooses to consider project trips in the  horizon year in addition to the current year, trips will be based on the  weighted average of current year and horizon year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Environmental Benefits. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The monetized value of the  anticipated direct and indirect benefits to human health, safety,  energy, and the air quality environment that are expected to result from  implementation of the proposed project compared to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The existing environment with the transit system in the current  year or, (ii) at the discretion of the project sponsor, both the  existing environment with the transit system in the current year and the  no-build environment and transit system in the horizon year. The  monetized benefits will be divided by the annualized capital and  operating cost of the New Starts project, less the cost of enrichments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Environmental benefits used in the calculation would include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Change in air quality criteria pollutants,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Change in energy use,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Change in greenhouse gas emissions and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Change in safety,</p><p class="depth4">.(3) If the project sponsor chooses to consider environmental  benefits in the horizon year in addition to the current year,  environmental benefits will be based on the weighted average of current  year and horizon year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Congestion Relief.

The resulting environmental  benefits from the indirect VMT would be calculated, monetized, and  compared to the annualized capital and operating cost of the New Starts  project in a manner similar to that under the environmental benefits  criterion. Such benefits are not included in the environmental benefits  measure.</p><p class="depth0">New Starts Local Financial Commitment</p><p class="depth0">From time to time, but not less than frequently than every two years  as directed by U.S.C. 5309(g)(5), FTA publishes policy guidance on the  application of these measures, and the agency expects it will continue  to do so.
