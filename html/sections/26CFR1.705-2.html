                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em>. Such gain  (or loss) therefore generally will be offset by a corresponding decrease  in the gain or increase in the loss (or increase in the gain or decrease  in the loss) upon the subsequent disposition by the partner of its  interest in the partnership. Where such a difference exists with respect  to stock of a corporate partner that is held by the partnership, gain or  loss from the disposition of corporate partner stock attributable to the  difference is not recognized by the corporate partner under section  1032. To adjust the basis of the corporate partner's interest in the  partnership for this unrecognized gain or loss would not be appropriate  because it would create an opportunity for the recognition of taxable  gain or loss on a subsequent disposition of the partnership interest  where no economic gain or loss has been incurred by the corporate  partner and no corresponding taxable gain or loss had previously been  allocated to the corporate partner by the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Single partnership--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Required adjustments relating to  acquisitions of partnership interest. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> This paragraph (b)(1) applies  in situations where a corporation acquires an interest in a partnership  that holds stock in that corporation (or the partnership subsequently  acquires stock in that corporation in an exchanged basis transaction),  the partnership does not have an election under section 754 in effect  for the year in which the corporation acquires the interest, and the  partnership later sells or exchanges the stock. In these situations, the  increase (or decrease) in the corporation's adjusted basis in its  partnership interest resulting from the sale or exchange of the stock  equals the amount of gain (or loss) that the corporate partner would  have recognized (absent the application of section 1032) if, for the  year in which the corporation acquired the interest, a section 754  election had been in effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The provisions of this paragraph (b)(1) are illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A, B, and C form equal partnership PRS. Each partner  contributes $30,000 in exchange for its partnership interest. PRS has no  liabilities. PRS purchases stock in corporation X for $30,000, which  appreciates in value to $120,000. PRS also purchases inventory for  $60,000, which appreciates in value to $150,000. A sells its interest in  PRS to corporation X for $90,000 in a year for which an election under  section 754 is not in effect. PRS later sells the X stock for   $150,000. PRS realizes a gain of $120,000 on the sale of the X stock.  X's share of the gain is $40,000. Under section 1032, X does not  recognize its share of the gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Normally, X would be entitled to a $40,000 increase in the  basis of its PRS interest for its allocable share of PRS's gain from the  sale of the X stock, but a special rule applies in this situation. If a  section 754 election had been in effect for the year in which X acquired  its interest in PRS, X would have been entitled to a basis adjustment  under section 743(b) of $60,000 (the excess of X's basis for the  transferred partnership interest over X's share of the adjusted basis to  PRS of PRS's property). See Sec. 1.743-1(b). Under Sec. 1.755-1(b),  the basis adjustment under section 743(b) would have been allocated  $30,000 to the X stock (the amount of the gain that would have been  allocated to X from the hypothetical sale of the stock), and $30,000 to  the inventory (the amount of the gain that would have been allocated to  X from the hypothetical sale of the inventory).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If a section 754 election had been in effect for the year in  which X acquired its interest in PRS, the amount of gain that X would  have recognized upon PRS's disposition of X stock (absent the  application of section 1032) would be $10,000 (X's share of PRS's gain  from the stock sale, $40,000, minus the amount of X's basis adjustment  under section 743(b), $30,000). See Sec. 1.743-1(j). Accordingly, the  increase in the basis of X's interest in PRS is $10,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Required adjustments relating to distributions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> This  paragraph (b)(2) applies in situations where a corporation owns a direct  or indirect interest in a partnership that owns stock in that  corporation, the partnership distributes money or other property to  another partner and that partner recognizes gain or loss on the  distribution or the basis of the property distributed to that partner is  adjusted during a year in which the partnership does not have an  election under section 754 in effect, and the partnership subsequently  sells or exchanges the stock. In these situations, the increase (or  decrease) in the corporation's adjusted basis in its partnership  interest resulting from the sale or exchange of the stock equals the  amount of gain (or loss) that the corporate partner would have  recognized (absent the application of section 1032) if, for the year in  which the partnership made the distribution, a section 754 election had  been in effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The provisions of this paragraph (b)(2) are illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A, B, and corporation C form partnership PRS. A and B  each contribute $10,000 and C contributes $20,000 in exchange for a  partnership interest. PRS has no liabilities. PRS purchases stock in  corporation C for $10,000, which appreciates in value to $70,000. PRS  distributes $25,000 to A in complete liquidation of A's interest in PRS  in a year for which an election under section 754 is not in effect. PRS  later sells the C stock for $70,000. PRS realizes a gain of $60,000 on  the sale of the C stock. C's share of the gain is $40,000. Under section  1032, C does not recognize its share of the gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, the basis adjustment under section 734(b) would have been  allocated to the C stock, increasing its basis to $25,000 (where there  is a distribution resulting in an adjustment under section 734(b)(1)(A)  to the basis of undistributed partnership property, the adjustment is  allocated only to capital gain property).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If a section 754 election had been in effect for the year in  which PRS made the distribution to A, the amount of gain that PRS would  have recognized upon PRS's disposition of C stock would be $45,000  ($70,000 minus $25,000 basis in the C stock), and the amount of gain C  would have recognized upon PRS's disposition of the C stock (absent the  application of section 1032) would be $30,000 (C's share of PRS's gain  of $45,000 from the stock sale). Accordingly, upon PRS's sale of the C  stock, the increase in the basis of C's interest in PRS is $30,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Tiered partnerships and other arrangements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Required  adjustments. The purpose of these regulations as set forth in paragraph  (a) of this section cannot be avoided through the use of tiered  partnerships or other arrangements. For example, if a corporation  acquires an indirect interest in its own stock through a chain of two or  more partnerships (either where the corporation acquires a direct  interest in a partnership or where one of the partnerships in the chain  acquires an interest in another partnership), and gain or loss from the  sale or exchange of the stock is subsequently allocated to the   corporation, then the bases of the interests in the partnerships  included in the chain shall be adjusted in a manner that is consistent  with the purpose of this section. Similarly, if a corporation owns an  indirect interest in its own stock through a chain of two or more  partnerships, and a partnership in the chain distributes money or other  property to another partner and that partner recognizes gain or loss on  the distribution or the basis of the property distributed to that  partner is adjusted during a year in which the partnership does not have  an election under section 754 in effect, then upon any subsequent sale  or exchange of the stock, the bases of the interests in the partnerships  included in the chain shall be adjusted in a manner that is consistent  with the purpose of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (c) are illustrated  by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A, B, and C form a partnership (UTP), with each partner  contributing $25,000. UTP and D form a partnership (LTP). UTP  contributes $75,000 in exchange for its interest in LTP, and D  contributes $25,000 in exchange for D's interest in LTP. Neither UTP nor  LTP has any liabilities. LTP purchases stock in corporation E for  $100,000, which appreciates in value to $1,000,000. C sells its interest  in UTP to corporation E for $250,000 in a year for which an election  under section 754 is not in effect for UTP or LTP. LTP later sells the E  stock for $2,000,000. LTP realizes a $1,900,000 gain on the sale of the  E stock. UTP's share of the gain is $1,425,000, and E's share of the  gain is $475,000. Under section 1032, E does not recognize its share of  the gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> With respect to the basis of UTP's interest in LTP, if all of  the gain from the sale of the E stock (including E's share) were to  increase the basis of UTP's interest in LTP, UTP's basis in such  interest would be $1,500,000 ($75,000 + $1,425,000). The fair market  value of UTP's interest in LTP is $1,500,000. Because UTP did not have a  section 754 election in effect for the taxable year in which E acquired  its interest in UTP, UTP's basis in the LTP interest does not reflect  the purchase price paid by E for its interest. Increasing the basis of  UTP's interest in LTP by the full amount of the gain that would be  recognized (in the absence of section 1032) on the sale of the E stock  preserves the conformity between UTP's inside basis and outside basis  with respect to LTP (i.e., UTP's share of LTP's cash is equal to  $1,500,000, and UTP's basis in the LTP interest is $1,500,000) and  appropriately would cause UTP to recognize no gain or loss on the sale  of UTP's interest in LTP immediately after the sale of the E stock.  Accordingly, increasing the basis of UTP's interest in LTP by the entire  amount of gain allocated to UTP (including E's share) from LTP's sale of  the E stock is consistent with the purpose of this section. The  $1,425,000 of gain allocated by LTP to UTP will increase the adjusted  basis of UTP's interest in LTP under section 705(a)(1). The basis of  UTP's interest in LTP immediately after the sale of the E stock is  $1,500,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> With respect to the basis of E's interest in UTP, if E's share  of the gain allocated to UTP and then to E were to increase the basis of  E's interest in UTP, E's basis in such interest would be $725,000  ($250,000 + $475,000) and the fair market value of such interest would  be $500,000, so that E would recognize a loss of $225,000 if E sold its  interest in UTP immediately after LTP's disposition of the E stock. It  would be inappropriate for E to recognize a taxable loss of $225,000  upon a disposition of its interest in UTP because E would not incur an  economic loss in the transaction, and E did not recognize a taxable gain  upon LTP's disposition of the E stock that appropriately would be offset  by a taxable loss on the disposition of its interest in UTP.  Accordingly, increasing E's basis in its UTP interest by the entire  amount of gain allocated to E from the sale of the E stock is not  consistent with the purpose of this section. (Conversely, because A and  B were allocated taxable gain on the disposition of the E stock, it  would be appropriate to increase A's and B's bases in their respective  interests in UTP by the full amount of the gain allocated to them.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The appropriate basis adjustment for E's interest in UTP upon  the disposition of the E stock by LTP can be determined as the amount of  gain that E would have recognized (in the absence of section 1032) upon  the sale by LTP of the E stock if both UTP and LTP had made section 754  elections for the taxable year in which E acquired the interest in UTP.  If section 754 elections had been in effect for UTP and LTP for the year  in which E acquired E's interest in UTP, the following would occur. E  would be entitled to a $225,000 positive basis adjustment under section  743(b) with respect to the property of UTP. The entire basis adjustment  would be allocated to UTP's only asset, its interest in LTP. In  addition, the sale of C's interest in UTP would be treated as a deemed  sale of E's share of UTP's interest in LTP for purposes of sections 754  and 743. The deemed selling price of E's share of UTP's interest in LTP  would be $250,000 (E's share of UTP's adjusted basis in LTP, $25,000,  plus E's basis adjustment under section 743(b) with respect to the  assets of UTP, $225,000). The deemed sale of E's share of UTP's interest  in LTP would   trigger a basis adjustment under section 743(b) of $225,000 with respect  to the assets of LTP (the excess of E's share of UTP's adjusted basis in  LTP, including E's basis adjustment ($225,000), $250,000, over E's share  of the adjusted basis of LTP's property, $25,000). This $225,000  adjustment by LTP would be allocated to LTP's only asset, the E stock,  and would be segregated and allocated solely to E. The amount of LTP's  gain from the sale of the E stock (before considering section 743(b))  would be $1,900,000. E's share of this gain, $475,000, would be offset  in part by the $225,000 basis adjustment under section 743(b), so that E  would recognize gain equal to $250,000 in the absence of section 1032.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If the basis of E's interest in UTP were increased by $250,000,  the total basis of E's interest would equal $500,000. This would conform  to E's share of UTP's basis in the LTP interest ($1,500,000x1/ 3=$500,000) as well as E's indirect share of the cash held by LTP ((1/ 3x3/4)x$2,000,000=$500,000). Such a basis adjustment does not create the  opportunity for the recognition of an inappropriate loss by E on a  subsequent disposition of E's interest in UTP and is consistent with the  purpose of this section. Accordingly, under this paragraph (c), of the  $475,000 gain allocated to E, only $250,000 will apply to increase the  adjusted basis of E in UTP under section 705(a)(1). E's adjusted basis  in its UTP interest following the sale of the E stock is $500,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A, corporation B, and C form an equal partnership  (UTP), with each partner contributing $100,000. D, E, and F also form an  equal partnership (LTP), with each partner contributing $30,000. LTP  purchases stock in corporation B for $90,000, which appreciates in value  to $900,000. LTP has no liabilities. UTP purchases D's interest in LTP  for $300,000. LTP does not have an election under section 754 in effect  for the taxable year of UTP's purchase. LTP later sells the B stock for  $900,000. UTP's share of the gain is $270,000, and B's share of that  gain is $90,000. Under section 1032, B does not recognize its share of  the gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> With respect to the basis of UTP's interest in LTP, if all of  the gain from the sale of the B stock (including B's share) were to  increase the basis of UTP's interest in LTP, UTP's basis in the LTP  interest would be $570,000 ($300,000 + $270,000), and the fair market  value of such interest would be $300,000, so that B would be allocated a  loss of $90,000 (($570,000-$300,000)x1/3) if UTP sold its interest in  LTP immediately after LTP's disposition of the B stock. It would be  inappropriate for B to recognize a taxable loss of $90,000 upon a  disposition of UTP's interest in LTP. B would not incur an economic loss  in the transaction, and B was not allocated a taxable gain upon LTP's  disposition of the B stock that appropriately would be offset by a  taxable loss on the disposition of UTP's interest in LTP. Accordingly,  increasing UTP's basis in its LTP interest by the gain allocated to B  from the sale of the B stock is not consistent with the purpose of this  section. (Conversely, because E and F were allocated taxable gain on the  disposition of the B stock, it would be appropriate to increase E's and  F's bases in their respective interests in LTP by the full amount of  such gain.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The appropriate basis adjustment for UTP's interest in LTP  upon the disposition of the B stock by LTP can be determined as the  amount of gain that UTP would have recognized (in the absence of section  1032) upon the sale by LTP of the B stock if the portion of the gain  allocated to UTP that subsequently is allocated to B were determined as  if LTP had made an election under section 754 for the taxable year in  which UTP acquired its interest in LTP. If a section 754 election had  been in effect for LTP for the year in which UTP acquired its interest  in LTP, then with respect to B, the following would occur. UTP would be  entitled to a $90,000 positive basis adjustment under section 743(b),  allocable to B, in the property of LTP. The entire basis adjustment  would be allocated to LTP's only asset, its B stock. The amount of LTP's  gain from the sale of the B stock (before considering section 743(b))  would be $810,000. UTP's share of this gain, $270,000, would be offset,  in part, by the basis adjustment under section 743(b), so that UTP would  recognize gain equal to $180,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If the basis of UTP's interest in LTP were increased by  $180,000, the total basis of UTP's partnership interest would equal  $480,000. This would conform to the sum of UTP's share of the cash held  by LTP ((1/3x$900,000=$300,000) and the taxable gain recognized by A and  C on the disposition of the B stock that appropriately may be offset on  the disposition of their interests in UTP ($90,000+$90,000=$180,000).  Such a basis adjustment does not inappropriately create the opportunity  for the allocation of a loss to B on a subsequent disposition of UTP's  interest in LTP and is consistent with the purpose of this section.  Accordingly, of the $270,000 gain allocated to UTP, only $180,000 will  apply to increase the adjusted basis of UTP in LTP under section  705(a)(1). Such $180,000 basis increase must be segregated and allocated  $90,000 each to solely A and C. UTP's adjusted basis in its LTP interest  following the sale of the B stock is $480,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> With respect to B's interest in UTP, if B's share of the gain  allocated to UTP and then to B were to increase the basis of B's  interest in UTP, B would have a UTP partnership interest with an  adjusted basis of $190,000 ($100,000 + $90,000) and a value of $100,000,  so that B would recognize a loss of   $90,000 if B sold its interest in UTP immediately after LTP's  disposition of the B stock. It would be inappropriate for B to recognize  a taxable loss of $90,000 upon a disposition of its interest in UTP  because B would not incur an economic loss in the transaction, and B did  not recognize a taxable gain upon LTP's disposition of the B stock that  appropriately would be offset by a taxable loss on the disposition of  its interest in UTP. Accordingly, increasing B's basis in its UTP  interest by the gain allocated to B from the sale of the B stock is not  consistent with the purpose of this section. (Conversely, because A and  C were allocated taxable gain on the disposition of the B stock that is  a result of LTP not having a section 754 election in effect, it would be  appropriate for A and C to recognize an offsetting taxable loss on the  disposition of A's and C's interests in UTP. Accordingly, it would be  appropriate to increase A's and C's bases in their respective interests  in UTP by the amount of gain recognized by A and C.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The appropriate basis adjustment for B's interest in UTP upon  the disposition of the B stock by LTP can be determined as the amount of  gain that B would have recognized (in the absence of section 1032) upon  the sale by LTP of the B stock if the portion of the gain allocated to  UTP that is subsequently allocated to B were determined as if LTP had  made an election under section 754 for the taxable year in which UTP  acquired its interest in LTP. If a section 754 election had been in  effect for LTP for the year in which UTP acquired its interest in LTP,  then with respect to B, the following would occur. UTP would be entitled  to a basis adjustment under section 743(b) in the property of LTP of  $90,000 with respect to B. The entire basis adjustment would be  allocated to LTP's only asset, its B stock. The amount of LTP's gain  from the sale of the B stock (before considering section 743(b)) would  be $810,000. UTP's share of this gain, $270,000, would be offset, in  part, by the $90,000 basis adjustment under section 743(b), so that UTP  would recognize gain equal to $180,000. The $90,000 basis adjustment  would completely offset the gain that otherwise would be allocated to B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> If no gain were allocated to B so that the basis of B's  interest in UTP was not increased, the total basis of B's interest would  equal $100,000. This would conform to B's share of UTP's basis in the  LTP interest (($480,000-$180,000 (i.e., A's and C's share of the basis  that should offset taxable gain recognized as a result of LTP's failure  to have a section 754 election))x1/3=$100,000) as well as B's indirect  share of the cash held by LTP ((1/3x1/3)x$900,000=$100,000). Such a  basis adjustment does not create the opportunity for the recognition of  an inappropriate loss by B on a subsequent disposition of B's interest  in UTP and is consistent with the purpose of this section. Accordingly,  under this paragraph (c), of the $90,000 gain allocated to B, none will  apply to increase the adjusted basis of B in UTP under section  705(a)(1). B's adjusted basis in its UTP interest following the sale of  the B stock is $100,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Immediately after LTP's disposition of the B stock, UTP sells  its interest in LTP for $300,000. UTP's adjusted basis in its LTP  interest is $480,000, $180,000 of which must be allocated $90,000 each  to A and C. Accordingly, upon UTP's sale of its interest in LTP, UTP  realizes $180,000 of loss, and A and C in turn each realize $90,000 of  loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Positions in Stock. For purposes of this section, stock includes  any position in stock to which section 1032 applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective date. This section applies to gain or loss allocated  with respect to sales or exchanges of stock occurring after December 6,  1999, except that paragraph (d) of this section is applicable with  respect to sales or exchanges of stock occurring on or after March 29,  2002, and the fourth sentence of paragraph (a), paragraph (b)(2), and  the third sentence of paragraph (c)(1) of this section are applicable  with respect to sales or exchanges of stock occurring on or after March  18, 2003.
