                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Indebtedness in excess of value. With respect to any qualified real property business indebtedness that is discharged, the amount excluded from gross income under section 108(a)(1)(D) (concerning discharges of qualified real property business indebtedness) shall not exceed the excess, if any, of the outstanding principal amount of that indebtedness immediately before the discharge over the net fair market value of the qualifying real property, as defined in Sec. 1.1017-1(c)(1), immediately before the discharge. For purposes of this section, net fair market value means the fair market value of the qualifying real property (notwithstanding section 7701(g)), reduced by the outstanding principal amount of any qualified real property business indebtedness (other than the discharged indebtedness) that is secured by such property immediately before and after the discharge. Also, for purposes of section 108(c)(2)(A) and this section, outstanding principal amount means the principal amount of indebtedness together with all additional amounts owed that, immediately before the discharge, are equivalent to principal, in that interest on such amounts would accrue and compound in the future, except that outstanding principal amount shall not include amounts that are subject to section 108(e)(2) and shall be adjusted to account for unamortized premium and discount consistent with section 108(e)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Overall limitation.
