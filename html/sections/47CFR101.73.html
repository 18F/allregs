                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A mandatory negotiation period may be initiated at the option of  the ET licensee. Relocation of FMS licensees by Mobile Satellite Service  (MSS) operators and AWS licensees in the 2110-2150 MHz and 2160-2200 MHz  bands will be subject to mandatory negotiations only.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Once mandatory negotiations have begun, an FMS licensee may not  refuse to negotiate and all parties are required to negotiate in good  faith. Good faith requires each party to provide information to the  other that is reasonably necessary to facilitate the relocation process.  In evaluating claims that a party has not negotiated in good faith, the  FCC will consider, inter alia, the following factors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether the ET licensee has made a bona fide offer to relocate  the FMS licensee to comparable facilities in accordance with Section  101.75(b);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the FMS licensee has demanded a premium, the type of premium  requested (e.g., whether the premium is directly related to relocation,  such as system-wide relocations and analog-to-digital conversions,  versus other types of premiums), and whether the value of the premium as  compared to the cost of providing comparable facilities is  disproportionate (i.e., whether there is a lack of proportion or  relation between the two);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> What steps the parties have taken to determine the actual cost  of relocation to comparable facilities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Whether either party has withheld information requested by the  other party that is necessary to estimate relocation costs or to  facilitate the relocation process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any party alleging a violation of our good faith requirement  must attach an independent estimate of the relocation costs in question  to any documentation filed with the Commission in support of its claim.  An independent cost estimate must include a specification for the  comparable facility and a statement of the costs associated with  providing that facility to the incumbent licensee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Provisions for Relocation of Fixed Microwave Licensees in the  2110-2150 and 2160-2200 MHz bands. A separate mandatory negotiation  period will commence for each FMS licensee when an ET licensee informs  that FMS licensee in writing of its desire to negotiate. Mandatory  negotiations will be conducted with the goal of providing the FMS  licensee with comparable facilities defined as facilities possessing the  following characteristics:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Throughput. Communications throughput is the amount of  information transferred within a system in a   given amount of time. If analog facilities are being replaced with  analog, comparable facilities provide an equivalent number of 4 kHz  voice channels. If digital facilities are being replaced with digital,  comparable facilities provide equivalent data loading bits per second  (bps).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reliability. System reliability is the degree to which  information is transferred accurately within a system. Comparable  facilities provide reliability equal to the overall reliability of the  FMS system. For digital systems, reliability is measured by the percent  of time the bit error rate (BER) exceeds a desired value, and for analog  or digital voice transmission, it is measured by the percent of time  that audio signal quality meets an established threshold. If an analog  system is replaced with a digital system, only the resulting frequency  response, harmonic distortion, signal-to-noise and its reliability will  be considered in determining comparable reliability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Operating Costs. Operating costs are the cost to operate and  maintain the FMS system. ET licensees would compensate FMS licensees for  any increased recurring costs associated with the replacement facilities  (e.g., additional rental payments, and increased utility fees) for five  years after relocation. ET licensees could satisfy this obligation by  making a lump-sum payment based on present value using current interest  rates. Additionally, the maintenance costs to the FMS licensee would be  equivalent to the 2 GHz system in order for the replacement system to be  comparable.
