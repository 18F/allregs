                            <p class="depth0">Local governments may submit a Preliminary Action Program during the  initial interim period in lieu of a full Action Program. The Preliminary  Action Program must include a firm commitment by the local government to  complete and adopt a full Action Program by October 1, 1980. This  commitment must include a schedule for the development of the full  Recovery Action Program. The schedule should outline the activities  which will be undertaken, the anticipated time frame for the development  and completion of these activities, and the resources of people, money  and support services necessary for the development and completion of the  Recovery Action Program. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions  concerning the use of the Preliminary Action Program, local governments  are encouraged to prepare, adopt and submit as soon as possible a full  Action Program which complies with the provisions of Sec. Sec. 72.11,  72.12, and 72.13. Local governments which have already made a commitment  to park and recreation systems by establishing ongoing planning,  rehabilitation, service, operation and maintenance programs may use  these as a starting point for meeting Action Program requirements.
