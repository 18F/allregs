                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Warranties imposed by this subpart shall be for the first two years of engine use from the date of sale to the ultimate purchaser. Manufacturers of handheld engines subject to Phase 2 standards may apply to the Administrator for approval for a warranty period of less than two years for handheld engines that are subject to severe service in seasonal equipment and are likely to run their full useful life hours in less than two years. Such an application must be made prior to certification. Alternatively, manufacturers of handheld engines subject to Phase 2

standards may apply to the Administrator for approval for a warranty period equal to the useful life of the engine or two years, whichever is less, if the equipment in which the engine is placed is equipped with a meter for measuring hours of use. Such an application must be made prior to certification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The manufacturer of each new nonroad engine must warrant to the ultimate purchaser and each subsequent purchaser that the engine is designed, built and equipped so as to conform at the time of sale with applicable regulations under section 213 of the Act, and the engine is free from defects in materials and workmanship which cause such engine to fail to conform with applicable regulations for its warranty period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the case of a nonroad engine part, the manufacturer or rebuilder of the part may certify according to Sec. 85.2112 of this chapter that use of the part will not result in a failure of the engine to comply with emission standards promulgated in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For the purposes of this section, the owner of any nonroad engine warranted under this part is responsible for the proper maintenance of the engine as stated in the manufacturer's written instructions. Proper maintenance generally includes replacement and service, at the owner's expense at a service establishment or facility of the owner's choosing, such items as spark plugs, points, condensers, and any other part, item, or device related to emission control (but not designed for emission control) under the terms of the last sentence of section 207(a)(3) of the Act, unless such part, item, or device is covered by any warranty not mandated by this Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Starting with the 2010 model year, you must meet the conditions specified in 40 CFR 1054.120(f) to ensure that owners will be able to promptly obtain warranty repairs.</p><p class="depth2">Describe in your application for certification how you will meet these conditions.
