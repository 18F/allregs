                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any performance assessment used to demonstrate compliance with  Sec. 63.113 for 10,000 years after disposal must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Include data related to the geology, hydrology, and geochemistry  (including disruptive processes and events) of the Yucca Mountain site,  and the surrounding region to the extent necessary, and information on  the design of the engineered barrier system used to define, for 10,000  years after disposal, parameters and conceptual models used in the  assessment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Account for uncertainties and variabilities in parameter values,  for 10,000 years after disposal, and provide for the technical basis for  parameter ranges, probability distributions, or bounding values used in  the performance assessment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Consider alternative conceptual models of features and  processes, for 10,000 years after disposal, that are consistent with  available data and current scientific understanding and evaluate the  effects that alternative conceptual models have on the performance of  the geologic repository.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Consider only features, events, and processes consistent with  the limits on performance assessment specified at Sec. 63.342.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Provide the technical basis for either inclusion or exclusion of  specific features, events, and processes in the performance assessment.  Specific features, events, and processes must be evaluated in detail if  the magnitude and time of the resulting radiological exposures to the  reasonably maximally exposed individual, or radionuclide releases to the  accessible environment, for 10,000 years after disposal, would be  significantly changed by their omission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Provide the technical basis for either inclusion or exclusion of  degradation, deterioration, or alteration processes of engineered  barriers in the performance assessment, including those processes that  would adversely affect the performance of natural barriers. Degradation,  deterioration, or alteration processes of engineered barriers must be  evaluated in detail if the magnitude and time of the resulting  radiological exposures to the reasonably maximally exposed individual,  or radionuclide releases to the accessible environment, for 10,000 years  after disposal, would be significantly changed by their omission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Provide the technical basis for models used to represent the  10,000 years after disposal in the performance assessment, such as  comparisons made with outputs of detailed process-level models and/or  empirical observations (e.g., laboratory testing, field investigations,  and natural analogs).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The performance assessment methods used to satisfy the  requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are considered sufficient  for the performance assessment for the period of time after 10,000 years  and through the period of geologic stability.
