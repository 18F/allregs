damages, OWCP will determine whether recoveries received from one or more third parties should be attributed to separate conditions for which compensation is payable in connection with a single EEOICPA claim. If such an attribution is both practicable and equitable, as determined by OWCP, in its discretion, the conditions will be treated as separate injuries for purposes of calculating the amount to which the United States is subrogated.</p><p class="depth2">Effect of Tort Suits Against Beryllium Vendors and Atomic Weapons</p><p class="depth2">Employers</p>
