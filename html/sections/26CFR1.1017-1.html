                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)</em> (A) or (B) because the taxpayer excluded discharge  of indebtedness (COD income) from gross income. A taxpayer must reduce  in the following order, to the extent of the excluded COD income (but  not below zero), the adjusted bases of property held on the first day of  the taxable year following the taxable year that the taxpayer excluded  COD income from gross income (in proportion to adjusted basis):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>, that  secured the discharged indebtedness immediately before the discharge;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Personal property used in a trade or business or held for  investment, other than inventory, accounts receivable, and notes  receivable, that secured the discharged indebtedness immediately before  the discharge;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Remaining property used in a trade or business or held for  investment, other than inventory, accounts receivable, notes receivable,  and real property described in section 1221(1);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Inventory, accounts receivable, notes receivable, and real  property described in section 1221(1); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Property not used in a trade or business nor held for  investment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Operating rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Prior tax-attribute reduction. The amount  of excluded COD income applied to reduce basis does not include any COD  income applied to reduce tax attributes under sections 108(b)(2) (A)  through (D) and, if applicable, section 108(b)(5). For example, if a  taxpayer excludes $100 of COD income from gross income under section  108(a) and reduces tax attributes by $40 under sections 108(b)(2) (A)  through (D), the taxpayer is required to reduce the adjusted bases of  property by $60 ($100-$40) under section 108(b)(2)(E).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> (A) through (D), the taxpayer must reduce the  amount of COD income attributable to secured indebtedness A to $12 ($20  - ($20 / $100 x $40)) and must reduce the amount of COD income  attributable to unsecured indebtedness B to $48 ($80 - ($80 / $100 x  $40)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Limitation on basis reductions under section 108(b)(2)(E) in  bankruptcy or insolvency. If COD income arises from a discharge of  indebtedness in a title 11 case or while the taxpayer is insolvent, the  amount of any basis reduction under section 108(b)(2)(E) shall not  exceed the excess of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The aggregate of the adjusted bases of property and the amount  of money held by the taxpayer immediately after the discharge; over</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The aggregate of the liabilities of the taxpayer immediately  after the discharge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> applies to discharges of indebtedness occurring on or  after May 10, 2004.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(3)</em>.  See paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section for elections relating to  section 1221</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> property and partnership interests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Modification of fresh start rule for prior basis reductions  under section 108(b)(5). After reducing the adjusted bases of  depreciable property under   section 108(b)(5), a taxpayer must compute the limitation on basis  reductions under section 1017(b)(2) using the aggregate of the remaining  adjusted bases of property. For example, if, immediately after the  discharge of indebtedness in a title 11 case, a taxpayer's adjusted  bases of property is $100 and its undischarged indebtedness is $70, and  if the taxpayer elects to reduce the adjusted bases of depreciable  property by $10 under section 108(b)(5), section 1017(b)(2) limits any  further basis reductions under section 108(b)(2)(E) to $20 (($100 - $10)  - $70).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Changes in security. If any property is added or eliminated as  security for an indebtedness during the one-year period preceding the  discharge of that indebtedness, such addition or elimination shall be  disregarded where a principal purpose of the change is to affect the  taxpayer's basis reductions under section 1017.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Depreciable property. For purposes of this section, the term  depreciable property means any property of a character subject to the  allowance for depreciation or amortization, but only if the basis  reduction would reduce the amount of depreciation or amortization which  otherwise would be allowable for the period immediately following such  reduction. Thus, for example, a lessor cannot reduce the basis of leased  property where the lessee's obligation in respect of the property will  restore to the lessor the loss due to depreciation during the term of  the lease, since the lessor cannot take depreciation in respect of such  property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Election to treat section 1221(1) real property as depreciable-- (1) In general. For basis reductions under section 108(b)(5) and basis  reductions relating to qualified farm indebtedness, a taxpayer may elect  under sections 1017(b) (3)(E) and (4)(C), respectively, to treat real  property described in section 1221</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> as depreciable property. This  election is not available, however, for basis reductions under section  108(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Time and manner. To make an election under section 1017(b)  (3)(E) or (4)(C), a taxpayer must enter the appropriate information on  Form 982, Reduction of Tax Attributes Due to Discharge of Indebtedness  (and Section 1082 Basis Adjustment), and attach the form to a timely  filed (including extensions) Federal income tax return for the taxable  year in which the taxpayer has COD income that is excluded from gross  income under section 108(a). An election under this paragraph (f) may be  revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Partnerships--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Partnership COD income. For purposes of  paragraph (a) of this section, a taxpayer must treat a distributive  share of a partnership's COD income as attributable to a discharged  indebtedness secured by the taxpayer's interest in that partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Partnership interest treated as depreciable property--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In  general. For purposes of making basis reductions, if a taxpayer makes an  election under section 108(b)(5) (or 108(c)), the taxpayer must treat a  partnership interest as depreciable property (or depreciable real  property) to the extent of the partner's proportionate share of the  partnership's basis in depreciable property (or depreciable real  property), provided that the partnership consents to a corresponding  reduction in the partnership's basis (inside basis) in depreciable  property (or depreciable real property) with respect to such partner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Request by partner and consent of partnership--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general.  Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (g)(2)(ii), a taxpayer  may choose whether or not to request that a partnership reduce the  inside basis of its depreciable property (or depreciable real property)  with respect to the taxpayer, and the partnership may grant or withhold  such consent, in its sole discretion. A request by the taxpayer must be  made before the due date (including extensions) for filing the  taxpayer's Federal income tax return for the taxable year in which the  taxpayer has COD income that is excluded from gross income under section  108(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Request for consent required. A taxpayer must request a  partnership's consent to reduce inside basis if, at the time of the  discharge, the taxpayer owns (directly or indirectly) a greater than 50  percent interest in the capital and profits of the partnership, or if  reductions to the basis of the taxpayer's depreciable property (or  depreciable real property) are being made with respect to the taxpayer's  distributive   share of COD income of the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Granting of request required. A partnership must consent to  reduce its partners' shares of inside basis with respect to a discharged  indebtedness if consent is requested with respect to that indebtedness  by partners owning (directly or indirectly) an aggregate of more than 80  percent of the capital and profits interests of the partnership or five  or fewer partners owning (directly or indirectly) an aggregate of more  than 50 percent of the capital and profits interests of the partnership.  For example, if there is a cancellation of partnership indebtedness that  is secured by real property used in a partnership's trade or business,  and if partners owning (in the aggregate) 90 percent of the capital and  profits interests of the partnership elect to exclude the COD income  under section 108(c), the partnership must make the appropriate  reductions in those partners' shares of inside basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Partnership consent statement--(A) Partnership requirement. A  consenting partnership must include with the Form 1065, U.S. Partnership  Return of Income, for the taxable year following the year that ends with  or within the taxable year the taxpayer excludes COD income from gross  income under section 108(a), and must provide to the taxpayer on or  before the due date of the taxpayer's return (including extensions) for  the taxable year in which the taxpayer excludes COD income from gross  income, a statement that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contains the name, address, and taxpayer identification number  of the partnership; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> States the amount of the reduction of the partner's  proportionate interest in the adjusted bases of the partnership's  depreciable property or depreciable real property, whichever is  applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Taxpayer's requirement. For taxable years beginning before  January 1, 2003, statements described in Sec. 1.1017-1(g)(2)(iii)(A)  must be attached to a taxpayer's timely filed (including extensions)  Federal income tax return for the taxable year in which the taxpayer has  COD income that is excluded from gross income under section 108(a). For  taxable years beginning after December 31, 2002, taxpayers must retain  the statements and keep them available for inspection in the manner  required by Sec. 1.6001-1(e), but are not required to attach the  statements to their returns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Partner's share of partnership basis--(A) In general. For  purposes of this paragraph (g), a partner's proportionate share of the  partnership's basis in depreciable property (or depreciable real  property) is equal to the sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The partner's section 743(b) basis adjustments to items of  partnership depreciable property (or depreciable real property); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The common basis depreciation deductions (but not including  remedial allocations of depreciation deductions under Sec. 1.704-3(d))  that, under the terms of the partnership agreement effective for the  taxable year in which the discharge of indebtedness occurs, are  reasonably expected to be allocated to the partner over the property's  remaining useful life. The assumptions made by a partnership in  determining the reasonably expected allocation of depreciation  deductions must be consistent for each partner. For example, a  partnership may not treat the same depreciation deductions as being  reasonably expected by more than one partner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Effective date. This paragraph (g)(2)(iv) applies to elections  made under sections 108(b)(5) and 108(c) on or after December 15, 1999.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Treatment of basis reduction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Basis adjustment. The amount  of the reduction to the basis of depreciable partnership property  constitutes an adjustment to the basis of partnership property with  respect to the partner only. No adjustment is made to the common basis  of partnership property. Thus, for purposes of income, deduction, gain,  loss, and distribution, the partner will have a special basis for those  partnership properties the bases of which are adjusted under section  1017 and this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Recovery of adjustments to basis of partnership property.  Adjustments to the basis of partnership property under this section are  recovered in the manner described in Sec. 1.743-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Effect of basis reduction. Adjustments to the basis of  partnership property under this section are treated in   the same manner and have the same effect as an adjustment to the basis  of partnership property under section 743(b). The following example  illustrates this paragraph (g)(2)(v):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A, B, and C are equal partners in partnership PRS,  which owns (among other things) Asset 1, an item of depreciable property  with a basis of $30,000. A's basis in its partnership interest is  $20,000. Under the terms of the partnership agreement, A's share of the  depreciation deductions from Asset 1 over its remaining useful life will  be $10,000. Under section 1017, A requests, and PRS agrees, to decrease  the basis of Asset 1 with respect to A by $10,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(B)</em>, the amount of the section 1017 basis adjustment that A  recovers during the year is $1,000. A will report $1,000 of ordinary  income because A's distributive share of the partnership's common basis  depreciation deductions from Asset 1 ($0) is insufficient to offset the  amount of the section 1017 basis adjustment recovered by A during the  year ($1,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the following year, PRS sells Asset 1 for $15,000 and  recognizes a $12,000 loss. This loss is allocated equally between B and  C, and A's share of the loss is $0. Upon the sale of Asset 1, A recovers  its entire remaining section 1017 basis adjustment ($9,000). A will  report $9,000 of ordinary income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Effective date. This paragraph (g)(2)(v) applies to elections  made under sections 108(b)(5) and 108(c) on or after December 15, 1999.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Partnership basis reduction. The rules of this section  (including this paragraph (g)) apply in determining the properties to  which the partnership's basis reductions must be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Special allocation rule for cases to which section 1398 applies.  If a bankruptcy estate and a taxpayer to whom section 1398 applies  (concerning only individuals under Chapter 7 or 11 of title 11 of the  United States Code) hold property subject to basis reduction under  section 108(b) (2)(E) or (5) on the first day of the taxable year  following the taxable year of discharge, the bankruptcy estate must  reduce all of the adjusted bases of its property before the taxpayer is  required to reduce any adjusted bases of property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Effective date. This section applies to discharges of  indebtedness occurring on or after October 22, 1998.  [T.D. 8787, 63 FR 56563, Oct. 22, 1998, as amended by T.D. 8847, 64 FR  69921, Dec. 15, 1999; T.D. 9080, 68 FR 42593, July 18, 2003; T.D. 9100,  68 FR 70705, Dec. 19, 2003; T.D. 9100, 69 FR 5017, Feb. 3, 2004; T.D.  9127, 69 FR 26039, May 11, 2004; T.D. 9300, 71 FR 71042, Dec. 8, 2006]</p>
