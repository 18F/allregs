When an emergency purchase is made, the  requiring department must send one copy of the contract and a statement  of the emergency to the contracting activity of the acquiring  department;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Requirements for which the acquiring department's contracting  activity delegates contracting authority to the requiring department;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Items in a research and development stage (as described in FAR  part 35). Under this exception, the military departments may contract  for research and development requirements, including quantities for  testing purposes and items undergoing in-service evaluation (not yet in  actual production, but beyond prototype). Generally, this exception  applies only when research and development funds are used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Items peculiar to nuclear ordnance material where design  characteristics or test-inspection requirements are controlled by the  Department of Energy (DoE) or by DoD to ensure reliability of nuclear  weapons.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This exception applies to all items designed for and peculiar to  nuclear ordnance regardless of agency control, or to any item which  requires test or inspection conducted or controlled by DoE or DoD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This exception does not cover items used for both nuclear  ordnance and other purposes if the items are not subject to the special  testing procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Items to be acquired under FAR 6.302-6 (national security  requires limitation of sources);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Items to be acquired under FAR 6.302-1 (supplies available only  from the original source for follow-on contract);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Items directly related to a major system and which are design  controlled by and acquired from either the system manufacturer or a  manufacturer of a major subsystem;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Items subject to rapid design changes, or to continuous redesign  or modification during the production and/or operational use phases,  which require continual contact between industry and the requiring  department to ensure that the item meets the requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This exception permits the requiring department to contract for  items of highly unstable design. For use of this exception, it must be  clearly impractical, both technically and contractually, to refer the  acquisition to the acquiring department. Anticipation that contracting  by negotiation will be appropriate, or that a number of design changes  may occur during contract performance is not in itself sufficient reason  for using this exception.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This exception also applies to items requiring compatibility  testing, provided such testing requires continual contact between  industry and the requiring department;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Containers acquired only with items for which they are designed;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> One-time buy of a noncataloged item.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This exception permits the requiring departments to contract for  a nonrecurring requirement for a noncataloged item. This exception could  cover a part or component for a prototype which may be stock numbered at  a later date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This exception does not permit acquisitions of recurring  requirements for an item, based solely on the fact that the item is not  stock numbered, nor may it be used to acquire items which have only  slightly different   characteristics than previously cataloged items.
