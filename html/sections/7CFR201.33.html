If any such seed is later to be labeled as to origin and/or variety, the origin and/or variety as the case may be, shall be shown on the invoice if the seed is in bulk, otherwise, on a label, at

the time of transportation to such establishment, except that if it is covered by a declaration of origin and/or variety it will be sufficient if the lot designation appearing in the declaration is placed on the invoice if the seed is in bulk, or on a label if the seed is in containers, regardless of the quantity.
