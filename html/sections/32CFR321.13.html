                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. The Director of the Defense Security Service  establishes the following exemptions of records systems (or portions  thereof) from the provisions of these rules, and other indicated  portions of Pub. L. 93-579, in this section. They may be exercised only  by the Director, Defense Security Service and the Chief of the Office of  FOI and Privacy. Exemptions will be exercised only when necessary for a  specific, significant and legitimate reason connected with the purpose  of a records system, and not simply because they are authorized by  statute. Personal records releasable under the provisions of 5 U.S.C.  552 will not be withheld from subject individuals based on these  exemptions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> All systems of records maintained by DSS shall be exempt from  the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1) to  the extent that the system contains any information properly classified  under Executive Order 12958 and which is required by the Executive Order  to be withheld in the interest of national defense of foreign policy.  This exemption, which may be applicable to parts of all systems of  records, is necessary because certain record systems not otherwise  specifically designated for exemptions herein may contain items of  information that have been properly classified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> System identifier: V1-01.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> System name: Privacy and Freedom of Information Request Records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>.  However, if an individual is denied any right, privilege, or benefit for  which he would otherwise be entitled by Federal law or for which he  would otherwise be eligible, as a result of the maintenance of such  information, the individual will be provided access to such information  except to the extent that disclosure would reveal the identity of a  confidential source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Records maintained in connection with providing protective  services to the President and other individuals under 18 U.S.C. 3506,  may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of  determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for federal  civilian employment, military service, federal contracts, or access to  classified information may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5),  but only to the extent that such material would reveal the identity of a  confidential source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Any portion of this system that falls under the provisions of 5  U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), (k)(3), (k)(5) may be exempt from the following  subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d); (e)(1); (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I);  and (f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>, (k)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Reasons: (i) From subsection (c)(3) because it will enable DSS  to conduct certain investigations and relay law enforcement information  without compromise of the information, protection of investigative  techniques and efforts employed, and identities of confidential sources  who might not otherwise come forward and who furnished information under  an express promise that the sources' identity would be held in  confidence (or prior to the effective date of the Act, under an implied  promise);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> From subsections (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I) because it  will provide protection against notification of investigatory material  including certain reciprocal investigations and counterintelligence  information, which might alert a subject to the fact that an  investigation of that individual is taking place, and the disclosure of  which would weaken the on-going investigation, reveal investigatory  techniques, and place confidential informants in jeopardy who furnished  information under an express promise that the sources' identity would be  held in confidence (or prior to the effective date of the Act, under an  implied promise);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> From subsections (d) and (f) because requiring DSS to grant  access to records and agency rules for access and amendment of records  would unfairly impede the agency's investigation of allegations of  unlawful activities.

This would seriously  impede or compromise the investigation and case preparation by  prematurely revealing its existence and nature; compromise or interfere  with witnesses or make witnesses reluctant to cooperate with the  investigators; lead to suppression, alteration, fabrication, or  destruction of evidence; and endanger the physical safety of  confidential sources, witnesses, law enforcement personnel and their  families.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> From subsection (d) because the application of these provisions  could impede or compromise an investigation or prosecution if the  subject of an investigation had access to the records or were able to  use such rules to learn of the existence of an investigation before it  would be completed. In addition, the mere notice of the fact of an  investigation could inform the subject and others that their activities  are under or may become the subject of an investigation and could enable  the subjects to avoid detection or apprehension, to influence witnesses  improperly, to destroy evidence, or to fabricate testimony.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> From subsection (e)(1) because during an investigation it is  not always possible to detect the relevance or necessity of each piece  of information in the early stages of an investigation. In some cases,  it is only after the information is evaluated in light of other evidence  that its relevance and necessity will be clear. In other cases, what may  appear to be a relevant and necessary piece of information may become  irrelevant in light of further investigation. In addition, during the  course of an investigation, the investigator may obtain information that  related primarily to matters under the investigative jurisdiction of  another agency, and that information may not be reasonably segregated.  In the interest of effective law enforcement, DSS investigators should  retain this information, since it can aid in establishing patterns of  criminal activity and can provide valuable leads for Federal and other  law enforcement agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> From subsections (e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H), (e)(4)(I) and (f)  because this   system is exempt from subsection (d) of the Act, concerning access to  records. These requirements are inapplicable to the extent that these  records will be exempt from these subsections. However, DSS has  published information concerning its notification and access procedures,  and the records source categories because under certain circumstances,  DSS could decide it is appropriate for an individual to have access to  all or a portion of his/her records in this system of records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> [Reserved]  [64 FR 49660, Sept. 14, 1999, as amended at 70 FR 38009, July 1, 2005;  76 FR 22808, Apr. 25, 2011]</p>
