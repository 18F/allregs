                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Notification of IATTC recommendations and resolutions. Fishery management resolutions made by the IATTC and approved by the Department of State will be promulgated in the Federal Register via appropriate rulemaking. The publication in the Federal Register will summarize the fishery management resolutions and respond to any public comments received by NMFS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Tuna catch limits in the longline fishery in the Convention Area. (1) Fishing seasons for all tuna species begin on January 1 and end either on December 31 or when NMFS closes the fishery for a specific species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For each of the calendar years 2014, 2015, and 2016, there is a limit of 500 metric tons of bigeye tuna that may be captured and landed by longline gear in the Convention Area by fishing vessels of the United States that are over 24 meters in overall length.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> NMFS will monitor bigeye tuna landings with respect to the limit established under paragraph (b)(2) of this section using data submitted in logbooks and other available information. After NMFS determines that the limit in any year is expected to be reached by a specific future date, and at least 7 calendar days in advance of that date, NMFS will publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing that the limit has been reached and that the restrictions described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section will be in effect through the end of the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Once an announcement is made pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the following restrictions will apply during the period specified in the announcement:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A fishing vessel of the United States over 24 meters in overall length may not be used to retain on board, transship, or land bigeye tuna captured by longline gear in the Convention Area, except as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any bigeye tuna already on board a fishing vessel upon the effective date of the prohibitions may be retained on board, transshipped, and/or landed, to the extent authorized by applicable laws and regulations, provided that they are landed within 14 days after the prohibitions become effective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of a vessel that has declared to NMFS, pursuant to Sec. 665.23(a) of this title, that the current trip type is shallow-setting, the 14-day limit is waived, but the number of bigeye tuna retained on board, transshipped, or landed must not exceed the number on board the vessel upon the effective date of the prohibitions, as recorded by the NMFS observer on board the vessel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Bigeye tuna caught by longline gear used on a vessel of the United States over 24 meters in overall length

in the Convention Area may not be transshipped to a fishing vessel unless that fishing vessel is operated in compliance with a valid permit issued under Sec. 660.707 or Sec. 665.21 of this title.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A fishing vessel of the United States over 24 meters in overall length, other than a vessel for which a declaration has been made to NMFS, pursuant to Sec. 665.23(a) of this title, that the current trip is shallow-setting, may not be used to fish in the Pacific Ocean using longline gear both inside and outside the Convention Area during the same fishing trip, with the exception of a fishing trip during which the prohibitions were put into effect as announced under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If a fishing vessel of the United States over 24 meters in overall length--other than a vessel for which a declaration has been made to NMFS, pursuant to Sec. 665.23(a) of this title, that the current trip type is shallow-setting--is used to fish in the Pacific Ocean using longline gear outside the Convention Area and the vessel enters the Convention Area at any time during the same fishing trip, the longline gear on the fishing vessel must be stowed in a manner so as not to be readily available for fishing; specifically, the hooks, branch or dropper lines, and floats used to buoy the mainline must be stowed and not available for immediate use, and any power-operated mainline hauler on deck must be covered in such a manner that it is not readily available for use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Use of tender vessels. No person subject to these regulations may use a tender vessel in the Convention Area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Transshipments at sea. No person subject to these regulations may transship purse seine-caught tuna from one vessel to another vessel at sea within the Convention Area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Bycatch reduction measures. (1) As of January 1, 2012, bigeye, skipjack, and yellowfin tuna caught in the Convention Area by a fishing vessel of the United States of class size 4-6 (more than 182 metric tons carrying capacity) using purse seine gear must be retained on board and landed, except for fish deemed unfit for human consumption for reasons other than size. This requirement shall not apply to the last set of a trip if the available well capacity is insufficient to accommodate the entire catch.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All purse seine vessels must release all sharks, billfishes, rays, mahimahi (dorado), and other non-tuna fish species, except those being retained for consumption aboard the vessel, as soon as practicable after being identified on board the vessel during the brailing operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> All purse seine vessels must apply special sea turtle handling and release procedures, as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Whenever a sea turtle is sighted in the net, a speedboat shall be stationed close to the point where the net is lifted out of the water to assist in release of the turtle;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a turtle is entangled in the net, net roll shall stop as soon as the turtle comes out of the water and shall not resume until the turtle has been disentangled and released;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If, in spite of the measures taken under paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, a turtle is accidentally brought onboard the vessel alive and active, the vessel's engine shall be disengaged and the turtle shall be released as quickly as practicable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If a turtle brought on board under paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section is alive but comatose or inactive, the resuscitation procedures described in Sec. 223.206(d)(1)(i)(B) of this title shall be used before release of the turtle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The crew, operator, or owner of a fishing vessel of the United States used to fish for HMS in the Convention Area shall be prohibited from retaining onboard, transshipping, landing, storing, selling, or offering for sale any part or whole carcass of an oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) and must release unharmed, to the extent practicable, all oceanic whitetip sharks when brought alongside the vessel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Owners, operators, and crew of fishing vessels of the United States commercially fishing for tuna in the Convention Area may not set or attempt to set a purse seine on or around a whale shark (Rhincodon typus) if the animal is sighted prior to the commencement of the set or the attempted set.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The crew, operator, and owner of a fishing vessel of the United States commercially fishing for tuna in the

Convention Area must release as soon as possible, any whale shark that is encircled in a purse seine net, and must ensure that all reasonable steps are taken to ensure its safe release.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Purse seine closures in the Convention Area. (1) A fishing vessel of the United States of class size 4-6 (more than 182 metric tons carrying capacity) may not be used to fish with purse seine gear in the Convention Area for 62 days in each of the years 2014, 2015, and 2016 during one of the following two periods:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> From 0000 hours UTC on July 29 to 2400 hours UTC on September 28, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> From 0000 hours UTC on November 18 to 2400 hours UTC on January 18 of the following year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A vessel owner, manager, or association representative of a vessel that is subject to the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section must in 2014, 2015, and 2016 provide written notification to the Regional Administrator declaring to which one of the two closure periods identified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section his or her vessel will adhere in that year. This written notification must be submitted by fax at (562) 980-4047 or email at RegionalAdministrator. WCRHMS@noaa.gov and must be received no later than July 1 in each of the years 2014, 2015, and 2016. The written notification must include the vessel name and registration number, the closure dates that will be adhered to by that vessel, and the vessel owner or managing owner's name, signature, business address, and business telephone number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If written notification is not submitted per paragraph (f)(2) of this section for a vessel subject to the requirements under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, that vessel must adhere to the closure period under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Request for exemption due to force majeure. A request for exemption due to force majeure must be made to the Sustainable Fisheries Division by fax at (562) 980-4047 or emailed to RegionalAdministrator. WCRHMS@noaa.gov. The request must include the name and official number of the vessel, vessel owner or manager's name and signature, and evidence to support the request, which may include but is not limited to photographs, repair bills, certificates of departure from port, and in the case of a marine casualty, a completed copy of the U.S. Coast Guard Form CG-2692A (See 46 CFR 4.05-10).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If accepted by the Sustainable Fisheries Division, the request for exemption due to force majeure will be forwarded to the IATTC Director. If declined by the Sustainable Fisheries Division, within 10 days of the date that rejection, the applicant may give additional information or documentation to the Regional Administrator with a request that the initial decision be reconsidered by fax at (562) 980-4047 or email to RegionalAdministrator. WCRHMS@noaa.gov; the Regional Administrator shall respond within 14 business days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the request for an exemption due to force majeure is accepted by the IATTC, the vessel must observe a closure period of 30 consecutive days in the same year during which the force majeure event occurred, in one of the two closure periods described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A vessel of class size 4 (182 to 272 metric tons carrying capacity) may make one fishing trip of up to 30 days duration during the specified closure period in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, provided that the vessel carries an observer of the On-Board Observer Program of the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Program during the entire fishing trip.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A fishing vessel of the United States of class size 4-6 (more than 182 metric tons carrying capacity) may not be used from 0000 hours on September 29 to 2400 hours on October 29 in the years 2014, 2015, and 2016 to fish with purse seine gear within the area bounded at the east and west by 96 and 110 W. longitude and bounded at the north and south by 4 N. and 3 S. latitude.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> At all times while a vessel is in a time/area closed period established under paragraphs (f)(1) or (f)(6) of this section, unless fishing under exceptions established under paragraphs (f)(4) or (f)(5) of this section, the fishing gear of the vessel must be stowed in a manner as not to be readily available for fishing. In particular, the boom must be

lowered as far as possible so that the vessel cannot be used for fishing, but so that the skiff is accessible for use in emergency situations; the helicopter, if any must be tied down; and launches must be secured.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Restrictions on fishing in proximity to data buoys. (1) A longline or purse seine fishing vessel of the United States may not be used to fish for HMS within one nautical mile of an anchored data buoy in the Convention Area. The one-nautical-mile distance shall be measured from the data buoy to the nearest portion of the fishing vessel or items associated with the fishing vessel, such as gear or watercraft deployed by the fishing vessel, to the data buoy. This prohibition shall not apply if and when the fishing vessel is operated as part of a scientific research program that has received specific authorization by the IATTC or is conducting work on behalf of the IATTC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A fishing vessel of the United States used to fish for HMS, or any fishing gear, equipment, or watercraft deployed by such a fishing vessel, may not be used to interact with a data buoy while the fishing vessel is in the Convention Area. Interact with a data buoy means to engage in conduct that could impair the functioning of a data buoy through actions that include but that are not limited to the following: encircling the buoy with fishing gear; tying up to or attaching the vessel, or any fishing gear, part or portion of the fishing vessel, including equipment such as watercraft, to a data buoy or its mooring; or cutting a data buoy anchor line.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A vessel operator, crew member, or other persons on board a fishing vessel of the United States that is used to fish for HMS may not remove a data buoy or any parts thereof from the water and place it on board the fishing vessel or tow a data buoy when in the Convention Area unless authorized to do so by the owner of the data buoy or an authorized representative or agent of the owner. When practicable, advance written authorization must be available onboard a U.S. fishing vessel that has taken on board or tows a data buoy. In all other cases, a written document (e.g., fax, email) verifying the authorization must be obtained by the vessel owner or operator within 15 days of landing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In the event that a fishing vessel of the United States that is used to fish for HMS or any of its fishing gear, equipment, or associated watercraft, becomes entangled with a data buoy while the fishing vessel is in the Convention Area, the owner and operator of the fishing vessel must promptly remove the entangled fishing vessel, fishing gear, equipment, or associated watercraft with as little damage to the data buoy and its mooring and anchor lines as possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A vessel operator, crew member, or other persons on board a fishing vessel of the United States that is used to fish for HMS must take all reasonable measures to avoid fishing gear entanglement or interaction with drifting data buoys.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Pacific bluefin tuna commercial catch limits in the eastern Pacific Ocean for 2015-2016. The following is applicable to the U.S. commercial fishery for Pacific bluefin tuna in the Convention Area in the years 2015 and 2016.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For the calendar year 2015, all commercial fishing vessels of the United States combined may capture, retain, transship, or land no more than 425 metric tons in the Convention Area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In 2016, NMFS will publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing the 2016 catch limit. For the calendar year 2016, all commercial fishing vessels of the United States combined may capture, retain on board, transship, or land no more than the 2016 catch limit. The 2016 catch limit is calculated by adding any amount of the 425 metric ton catch limit that was not caught in 2015, as determined by NMFS, to 175 metric tons, except as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If 175 metric tons or less are caught in 2015, as determined by NMFS, then the 2016 catch limit is 425 metric tons;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If in 2015, greater than 300 metric tons and up to 400 metric tons are caught, as determined by NMFS, then the 2016 catch limit is 200 metric tons; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If greater than 425 metric tons are caught in 2015, as determined by

NMFS, then the 2016 catch limit is calculated by subtracting the amount caught in 2015 from 600 metric tons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In 2015 and 2016, a 25 metric ton trip limit will be in effect until NMFS anticipates that catch will be within 50 metric tons of the catch limits, after which a 2 metric ton trip limit will be in effect upon publication of a notice in the Federal Register by NMFS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> After NMFS determines that the catch limits under paragraphs (h)(1) and (2) of this section are expected to be reached by a future date, NMFS will publish a fishing closure notice in the Federal Register announcing the effective date that additional targeting, retaining on board, transshipping or landing Pacific bluefin tuna in the Convention Area shall be prohibited as described in paragraph (h)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Beginning on the date announced in the fishing closure notice published under paragraph (h)(4) of this section through the end of the calendar year, a commercial fishing vessel of the United States may not be used to target, retain on board, transship, or land Pacific bluefin tuna captured in the Convention Area, with the exception that any Pacific bluefin tuna already on board a fishing vessel on the effective date of the notice may be retained on board, transshipped, and/or landed, to the extent authorized by applicable laws and regulations, provided such Pacific bluefin tuna is landed within 14 days after the effective date published in the fishing closure notice.
