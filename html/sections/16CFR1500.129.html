                                Sec. 1500.129  Substances named in the Federal Caustic Poison Act.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The Commission finds that for those substances covered by the  Federal Caustic Poison Act (44 Stat. 1406), the requirements of section  2(p)(1) of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (repeated in Sec.  1500.3(b)(14)(i)) are not adequate for the protection of the public  health. Labeling for those substances, in the concentrations listed in  the Federal Caustic Poison Act, were required to bear the signal word  ``poison.'' The Commission concludes that the lack of the designation  ``poison'' would indicate to the consumer a lesser hazard and that such  would not be in the interest of the public health. Under the authority  granted in section 3(b) of the act, the Commission therefore finds that  for the following substances, and at the following concentrations, the  word ``poison'' is necessary instead of any signal word:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Hydrochloric acid and any preparation containing free or  chemically unneutralized hydrochloric acid (HCl) in a concentration of  10 percent or more.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Sulfuric acid and any preparation containing free or chemically  unneutralized sulfuric acid (H2 SO4) in a  concentration of 10 percent or more.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Nitric acid or any preparation containing free or chemically  unneutralized nitric acid (HNO3) in a concentration of 5  percent or more.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Carbolic acid (C6 H5 OH), also known as  phenol, and any preparation containing carbolic acid in a concentration  of 5 percent or more.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Oxalic acid and any preparation containing free or chemically   unneutralized oxalic acid (H2 C2 O4) in  a concentration of 10 percent or more.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Any salt of oxalic acid and any preparation containing any such  salt in a concentration of 10 percent or more.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Acetic acid or any preparation containing free or chemically  unneutralized acetic acid (HC2 H2 O2)  in a concentration of 20 percent or more.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Hypochlorous acid, either free or combined, and any preparation  containing the same in a concentration that will yield 10 percent or  more by weight of available chlorine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Potassium hydroxide and any preparation containing free or  chemically unneutralized potassium hydroxide (KOH), including caustic  potash and vienna paste (vienna caustic), in a concentration of 10  percent or more.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Sodium hydroxide and any preparation containing free or  chemically unneutralized sodium hydroxide (NaOH), including caustic soda  and lye in a concentration of 10 percent or more.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Silver nitrate, sometimes known as lunar caustic, and any  preparation containing silver nitrate (AgNO3) in a  concentration of 5 percent or more.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Ammonia water and any preparation containing free or chemically  uncombined ammonia (NH3), including ammonium hydroxide and  ``hartshorn,'' in a concentration of 5 percent or more.</p>
