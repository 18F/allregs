                            <p class="depth0">The Council on Environmental Quality (``CEQ'' or ``the Council'') was created by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 through 4347). The Council's authority is primarily derived from that Act, the Environmental Quality Improvement Act of 1970, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4371-4374), Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1977 (July 15, 1977), and Executive Order 11514, ``Protection and Enhancement of Environmental Quality,'' March 5, 1970, as amended by Executive Order 11991, May 24, 1977.</p>
