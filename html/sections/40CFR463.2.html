It includes water used in both the detergent wash and rinse cycles of a cleaning process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> ``Finishing'' water is processed water used to remove waste plastic material generated during a finishing process or to lubricate a plastic product during a finishing process. It includes water used to machine or to assemble intermediate or final plastic products.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> ``Plastic material'' is a synthetic organic polymer (i.e., a thermoset polymer, a thermoplastic polymer, or a combination of a natural polymer and a thermoset or thermoplastic polymer) that is solid in its final form and that was shaped by flow. The material can be either a homogeneous polymer or a polymer combined with fillers, plasticizers, pigments, stabilizers, or other additives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> ``Crude intermediate plastic material'' is plastic material formulated in an on-site polymerization process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> ``Mass of pollutant that can be discharged'' is the pollutant mass calculated by multiplying the pollutant concentration times the average process water usage flow rate.</p>
