                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> APHIS considers swine vesicular disease to exist in all regions of the world except those declared free of the disease by APHIS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A list of regions that APHIS has declared free of swine vesicular disease is maintained on the APHIS Web site at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/import--export/animals/animal--disease--status.shtml. Copies of the list will also be available via postal mail, fax, or email upon request to the Sanitary Trade Issues Team, National Center for Import and Export, Veterinary Services, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, 4700 River Road Unit 38, Riverdale, Maryland 20737.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> APHIS will add a region to the list of those it has declared free of swine vesicular disease after it conducts an evaluation of the region in accordance with Sec. 92.2 of this subchapter and finds that the disease is not present. In the case of a region formerly on this list that is removed due to an outbreak, the region may be returned to the list in accordance with the procedures for reestablishment of a region's disease-free status in Sec. 92.4 of this subchapter. APHIS will remove a region from the list of those it has declared free of swine vesicular disease upon determining that the disease exists in the region based on reports APHIS receives of outbreaks of the disease from veterinary officials of the exporting country, from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), or from other sources the Administrator determines to be reliable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> No pork or pork product may be imported into the United States from any region where swine vesicular disease is known to exist unless it complies with the following requirements and it is not otherwise prohibited importation into the United States under this part:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Such pork or pork product has been treated in accordance with one of the following procedures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Such pork or pork product has been fully cooked by a commercial method in a container hermetically sealed promptly after filling, but before such cooking, so that such cooking and sealing produced a fully sterilized product which is shelf-stable without refrigeration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Such pork or pork product is in compliance with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> All bones were completely removed prior to cooking; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Such pork or pork product received heat treatment in a commercially accepted manner used for perishable canned pork products so that it reached an internal temperature of 69 [deg]C.

During movement from the port of entry to the meat processing establishment, the pork or pork products must be moved under Department seals or seals of the U.S. Customs Service, and shall be otherwise handled as the Administrator may direct in order to guard against the introduction and dissemination of swine vesicular disease. Seals applied under this section may not be broken except by persons authorized by the Administrator to do so.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\12\ The names and addresses of approved establishments may be obtained from, and request for approval of any establishment may be made to, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Veterinary Services, National Center for Import-Export, 4700 River Road Unit 38, Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1231. Establishments will be approved only if the Administrator determines that the imported articles will be so handled at the establishment as to prevent the introduction and dissemination of livestock or poultry diseases into the United States. Approval of any establishment may be refused or withdrawn only after the operator thereof has been given notice of the proposed action and has had an opportunity to present his views thereon.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Such pork or pork product, if it originated in a swine vesicular disease free region, has been cured and dried and is in compliance with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> All bones have been completely removed, either in the region of origin or in the region where the pork or pork products are processed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)(1)</em> Such pork or pork product is accompanied from the swine vesicular disease free region of origin to the processing establishment in the swine vesicular disease affected region by a certificate signed by an official of the National Government of the swine vesicular disease free region of origin specifying that the pork or pork product involved originated in that region and the pork or pork product was consigned to a processing establishment in ------------ (a region not listed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section as free
