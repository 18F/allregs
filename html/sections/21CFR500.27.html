                                Sec. 500.27  Methylene blue-containing drugs for use in animals.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> New information requires a re- evaluation of the status of drugs  containing methylene blue (tetramethylthionine chloride) for oral use in  cats or dogs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It has been demonstrated that two orally administered urinary  antiseptic-antispasmodic preparations that contained methylene blue  cause Heinz body hemolytic anemia in cats when used according to label  directions. The specific cause of the reaction was determined to be the  methylene blue contained in the preparations. The reaction can be severe  enough to cause death of treated animals.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Heinz body hemolytic anemia reaction to methylene blue has  also   been demonstrated in dogs under laboratory conditions. The precise  mechanism by which methylene blue produces the characteristic  erythrocytic inclusion bodies (Heinz bodies) and associated hemolytic  anemia is unclear.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The effectiveness of orally administered methylene blue as a  urinary antiseptic is open to question. It appears that following oral  administration, methylene blue is poorly and erratically absorbed and  also slowly and erratically excreted in the urine. Studies in the dog  indicate it is excreted in the urine essentially as leukomethylene blue  stabilized in some manner. Methylene blue itself is stepwise  demethylated in alkaline solutions (alkaline urine being a frequent  consequence of urinary infection) to Azure B, Azure A, and Azure C. The  antiseptic efficacy of all of these excretion products is  unsubstantiated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In view of the foregoing, the Commissioner has concluded that  animal drugs containing methylene blue for oral use in cats or dogs are  neither safe nor generally recognized as effective within the meaning of  section 201(v) of the act and are therefore considered new animal drugs.  Accordingly, all prior formal and informal opinions expressed by the  Food and Drug Administration that such drugs are ``not new drugs'' or  ``no longer new drugs'' are hereby revoked.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Animal drugs that contain methylene blue for oral use in cats or  dogs and not the subject of an approved new animal drug application  (NADA) are deemed to be adulterated under the provisions of section  501(a) (5) and/or (6) and/or misbranded under section 502(a) of the act  and subject to regulatory action as of April 10, 1978.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sponsors of animal drugs that contain methylene blue for oral  use in cats or dogs and not the subject of an approved new animal drug  application (NADA) may submit an application in conformity with Sec.  514.1 of this chapter. Such applications will be processed in accordance  with section 512 of the act. Submission of an NADA will not constitute  grounds for continued marketing of this drug substance until such  application is approved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> New animal drug applications required by this regulation  pursuant to section 512 of the act shall be submitted to the Food and  Drug Administration.
