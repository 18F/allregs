Specifically, this regulation defines eligible applicants, eligible  activities, EPA priorities for selecting recipients, funding limits, and  matching requirements. Projects funded under this part are also subject  to 2 CFR parts 200 and 1500. Those regulations contain Federal audit and  other general administrative requirements. This regulation does not  apply to the programs implemented under sections 5 and 7 of the NEEA.  [57 FR 8390, Mar. 9, 1992, as amended at 79 FR 76063, Dec. 19, 2014]</p>
