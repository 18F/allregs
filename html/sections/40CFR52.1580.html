If the State fails to submit to EPA the final modeling demonstrating that its program will meet the relevant enhanced I/M performance standard by February 1, 1998, the conditional approval will automatically convert to a disapproval as explained under Section 110(k) of the Clean Air Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State of New Jersey's March 27, 1996 submittal for an enhanced motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program, as amended on November 27, 1996 and April 22, 1997, is conditionally approved based on certain contingencies, for an interim period to last 18 months.
