                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General considerations. (1) Career officers at the Senior Level  normally shall be appointed as the result of promotion of Mid-Level  career officers. Where the needs of the Foreign Service at the Senior  Level cannot otherwise be met by this approach, limited appointments may  by granted to applicants as Senior Career Candidates or as limited non- career appointees in accordance with these regulations. However, as  required by section 305(b) of the Foreign Service Act of 1980  (hereinafter referred to as the Act), but qualified by section 305(b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  and (2) and section 2403(c) of the Act, the limited appointment of an  individual in the Senior Foreign Service shall not cause the number of  members of the Senior Foreign Service serving under limited appointments  to exceed 5 percent of the total members of the Senior Foreign Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Successful applicants under the Senior Career Candidate Program  will be appointed to Career Candidate status for a period not to exceed  5 years. Such limited Career Candidate appointments may not be renewed  or extended beyond 5 years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Under section 306 of the Act, Senior Career Candidates may be  found qualified to become career members of the Senior Foreign Service.  Those who are not found to be so qualified prior to the expiration of  their limited appointments will be separated from the Career Candidate  Program no later than the expiration date of their appointments.  Separated candidates who originally were employees of a Federal  department or agency, and who were appointed to the Senior Foreign  Service with the consent of the head of that department or agency, will  be entitled to reemployment rights in that department or agency in  accordance with section 310 of the Act and section 3597 of title 5,  United States Code.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The following regulations shall be utilized in conjunction with  section 593, Volume 3, Foreign Affairs Manual (``Senior Foreign Service  Officer Career Candidate Program''). (Also see Foreign Affairs Manual  Circulars No. 8 [applicable to the Department of State only] and No. 9  [applicable to the Departments of State, Agriculture, and Commerce, the  Agency for International Development, and the United States Information  Agency], dated March 6, 1981.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Senior Career Candidate appointments--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Eligibility  requirements. Senior Career Candidates must meet the following  eligibility requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Citizenship. Each person appointed as a Senior Career Candidate  must be a citizen of the United States.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Age. All career candidate appointments shall be made before the  candidate's 60th birthday. Appointments by the United States Information  Agency shall be made before the candidate's 58th birthday. The maximum  age for appointment under this program is based on the requirement that  all career candidates shall be able to: (A) Complete at least two full  tours of duty, exclusive of orientation and training; (B) complete the  requisite eligibility period for tenure consideration and (C) complete  the requisite eligibility period to receive retirement benefits, prior  to reaching the mandatory retirement age of 65 prescribed by the Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Service. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> On the date of application, an applicant must  have completed a minimum of 15 years of professional work experience,  including at least 5 years of service in a position of responsibility in  a Federal Government agency or agencies or elsewhere equivalent to that  of a Mid-Level Foreign Service officer (classes FS-1 through FS-3). The  duties and responsibilities of the position occupied by the applicant  must have been similar to or closely related to that of a Foreign  Service officer in terms of knowledge,   skills, abilities, and overseas work experience. In addition, an  applicant must currently be in, or have been in, a position comparable  to a Foreign Service officer of class 1 (FS-1), or higher.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Applicants from outside the Federal Government, and Federal  employees who at the time of application lack the 15 years of  professional work experience or the 5 years of service in a position of  responsibility as defined in the preceding paragraph, may, however, be  considered if they are found to possess a combination of educational  background, professional work experience, and skills needed by the  Foreign Service at the Senior Level in employment categories which  normally are not staffed by promotion of Mid-Level career officers.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Non-career members of the Senior Foreign Service of a Federal  Government department or agency also may apply for the Senior Career  Candidate Program if they meet the eligibility requirements for the  program.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Certification of need. Before an application can be processed,  the Director of Personnel of the foreign affairs agency concerned must  certify that there is a need for the applicant as a Senior Career  Candidate based upon (A) the projections of personnel flows and needs  mandated by section 601(c)(2) of the Act, and (B) a finding that the  combination of educational background, professional work experience, and  skills possessed by the applicant is not expected to be available in the  immediate future in sufficient numbers within the Senior Foreign  Service, including by promotion and/or special training of career  personnel. This certification of need will be requested by the Board of  Examiners for the Foreign Service from the appropriate foreign affairs  agency Director of Personnel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Application. All applicants for the Senior Career Candidate  Program must apply in writing through the prospective employing agency  to the Board of Examiners for consideration. The applicant shall submit  a completed Standard Form 171, ``Personnel Qualifications Statement,''  and Form DSP-34, ``Supplement to Application for Federal Employment,''  to the Board. In addition, the applicant shall submit a narrative  statement, not exceeding four typewritten pages in length, describing  the applicant's pertinent background and professional work experience,  which includes a statement of the applicant's willingness and ability to  accept the obligation of world-wide service. The Board may request  additional written information from the applicant following receipt of  the initial application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Qualifications evaluation panel. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Board of Examiners will  establish a file for each applicant, placing in it all available  documentation of value in evaluating the applicant's potential for  service as a Senior Career Candidate. For an applicant from within the  Federal Government, this will include the personnel file from the  employing department or agency.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The complete file will be reviewed by a Qualifications  Evaluation Panel of the Board of Examiners to determine whether the  applicant meets the statutory and other eligibility requirements, to  assess the applicant's skills under the certification of need issued by  the prospective employing agency, and to recommend whether the applicant  should be examined for possible appointment as a Senior Career  Candidate. If the Qualifications Evaluation Panel decides that the  applicant is not eligible for examination, the prospective employing  agency shall be informed by the Board of the reasons for that decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Written examination. The Board of Examiners normally will not  require Senior Career Candidate applicants to undergo a written  examination. However, the Board may, upon securing the agreement of the  prospective employing agency, decide that such applicants should be  required to take an appropriate written examination prescribed by the  Board. If so, an applicant whose score on the written examination is at  or above the passing level set by the Board will be eligible for  selection for the oral examination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Oral examination--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Examining panel. Applicants recommended by  the Qualifications Evaluation Panel will be given an appropriate oral  examination by a Panel of Senior Foreign Service deputy examiners of the  Board of Examiners. The Oral Examining Panel   shall be composed of at least two deputy examiners who are Senior  Foreign Service career officers of the prospective employing agency, and  at least one deputy examiner who is a Senior Foreign Service career  officer from another foreign affairs agency operating under the Foreign  Service Act. The Examining Panel shall be chaired by a deputy examiner  who is a Senior Foreign Service career officer of the prospective  employing agency. At least one of the Examining Panel members shall  represent the functional or specialist field for which the applicant is  being examined. Determinations of duly constituted panels of deputy  examiners are final, unless modified by specific action of the Board of  Examiners.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Criteria. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The Examining Panel will question the applicant  regarding the indicated functional or specialist field and other matters  relevant to the applicant's qualifications for appointment as a Senior  Career Candidate. Prior to the oral examination, the applicant will be  asked to write an essay, on a topic related to Foreign Service work, to  enable the Examining Panel to judge the applicant's effectiveness of  written expression. This essay requirement may be waived at the request  of the head of the prospective employing agency, if, for example, the  applicant is a career member of the Senior Executive Service.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The oral examination will be conducted under written criteria,  established in consultation with the prospective employing agency and  publicly announced by the Board of Examiners. The examination will seek  to determine the ability of the applicant to meet the objective of  section 101 of the Act, which provides for a Senior Foreign Service  ``characterized by strong policy formulation capabilities, outstanding  executive leadership qualities, and highly developed functional, foreign  language, and area expertise.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Grading. Applicants taking the oral examination will be graded  as ``recommended,'' or ``not recommended'' by the Examining Panel. Those  graded as ``recommended'' also will be given a numerical score, under  the standard Board of Examiners scoring criteria, for use by the Final  Review Panel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Background investigation. Senior Career Candidate applicants  recommended by the Examining Panel will be subject to the same  background investigation as required for Junior and Mid-Level Foreign  Service Officer Career Candidates. The background investigation shall be  conducted to determine suitability for appointment to the Foreign  Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Medical examination. Senior Career Candidate applicants  recommended by the Examining Panel, and their dependents, will be  subject to the same medical examination as required for the Junior and  Mid-Level Foreign Service Career Candidates. The medical examination  shall be conducted to determine the applicant's physical fitness to  perform the duties of a Foreign Service officer on a world-wide basis  and, for applicants and dependents, to determine the presence of any  physical, neurological, or mental condition of such a nature as to make  it unlikely that they would be able to function on a world-wide basis.  Applicants and/or dependents who do not meet the required medical  standards may be given further consideration, as appropriate, under the  procedures of the prospective employing agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Foreign language requirement. Applicants recommended by the  Examining Panel will be required to take a subsequent examination to  measure their fluency in foreign languages, and/or their aptitude for  learning them. Senior Career Candidates will be subject to the foreign  language requirements established for their occupational category by  their prospective employing agency. Senior Career Candidate applicants  for the Foreign Commercial Service must demonstrate proficiency by  examination in two foreign languages. United States Information Agency  Senior Career Candidates, other than Senior Specialist Career  Candidates, must demonstrate proficiency in at least one foreign  language. Except for the Foreign Commercial Service and the United  States Information Agency, an applicant may be appointed without first  having passed an examination in a foreign language,   but the appointed Senior Career Candidate may not be commissioned as a  Career Senior Foreign Service officer unless adequate proficiency in a  foreign language is achieved. This language requirement will not apply  to candidates in occupational categories which, in the judgment of the  prospective employing agency, do not require foreign language  proficiency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Final review panel. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The entire file of an applicant  recommended by the Examining Panel will be reviewed and graded by a  Final Review Panel, after the results of the background investigation,  medical examination and language examination are received. The Final  Review Panel will decide whether or not to recommend the applicant for  appointment, taking into account all of the available information  concerning the applicant.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Final Review Panel shall consist of a chairperson who shall  be a Deputy Examiner who is a career Senior Foreign Service officer of  the prospective employing agency, and at least two other Deputy  Examiners of the Board of Examiners. Of the Deputy Examiners serving on  the Final Review Panel, the majority shall be career Senior Foreign  Service officers of the prospective employing agency; and at least one  shall be a career Senior Foreign Service officer of one of the other  foreign affairs agencies operating under the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Certification of appointment. The file of an applicant  recommended by the Final Review Panel will be submitted to the Board of  Examiners for consideration and approval. An applicant found by the  Board to meet the standards for appointment as a Senior Foreign Service  Career Candidate shall be so certified to the Director of Personnel of  the prospective employing agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Limited non-career appointments. (1) Other Senior Foreign  Service appointments may be made on a limited non-career basis for  individuals who do not wish to compete for career appointments, but for  whom a need can be certified by the Director of Personnel of the foreign  affairs agency concerned. Such limited non-career senior appointees will  be subject to the eligibility requirements set forth in Sec.  11.30(b)(1) (i) and (iv). The maximum age set forth in Sec.  11.30(b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(ii)</em> does not apply to such appointments. However, because  Foreign Service members generally are subject to the mandatory  retirement age of 65, under section 812 of the Act, limited non-career  Senior appointments normally will not extend beyond the appointee's 65th  birthday. Limited non-career appointees of the Department of Commerce  and the United States Information Agency will not be subject to the  language requirements of Sec. 11.30(b)(8). Applicants for limited non- career senior appointments will be subject to the same background  investigation and medical examination required of career candidates, but  normally they will not be subject to a written or oral examination, or  to approval by the Board of Examiners. Processing procedures for such  applicants will be established by the Director of Personnel of the  foreign affairs agency concerned. Their appointments normally will be  limited to the duration of the specific assignments for which they are  to be hired, may not exceed 5 years in duration, and may not be renewed  or extended beyond 5 years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prior to the expiration of their limited non-career senior  appointments, if they meet all the eligibility requirements set forth in  Sec. 11.30(b)(1), such individuals may elect to compete for career  candidate status in the Senior Foreign Service by qualifying at that  time for and taking the examinations required of career candidates. If  appointed as career candidates, the length of service under their  previous limited non-career appointments may be counted under the  procedures of the employing agency as part of the trial period of  service prescribed before a career candidate can receive a career  appointment. The total period of limited appointment (non-career and  career candidate) of such individuals may not exceed 5 years in  duration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Nothing in this section will limit the right of an individual  who has previously served as a limited non-career senior appointee from  subsequently applying for consideration as a new applicant and being  appointed as a Senior Career Candidate after a limited non-career  appointment has expired.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reporting requirement. The Director of Personnel of each foreign  affairs agency shall report annually to the Director General of the  Foreign Service, Department of State, the number and nature of the  limited Senior Foreign Service appointments (non-career and career  candidates) made by that agency under these regulations.  (Secs. 206(a) and 301(b), Foreign Service Act of 1980 (secs. 206(a) and  301(b), Pub. L. 96-465, 94 Stat. 2079 and 2083 (22 U.S.C. 3926 and  3941)))  [48 FR 38607, Aug. 25, 1983]</p>
