                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The intermingled character of the O. and C. lands presents  peculiar problems of management which require for their solution the  cooperation between the Federal Government and the owners of the  intermingled lands, particularly with respect to timber roads.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It is well established that the value of standing timber is  determined in significant part by the cost of transporting the logs to  the mill. Where there is an existing road which is adequate or can  readily be made adequate for the removal of timber in the area, the  failure to make such road available for access to all the mature and  overmature timber it could tap leads to economic waste. Blocks of timber  which are insufficient in volume or value to support the construction of  a duplicating road may be left in the woods for lack of access over the  existing road. Moreover, the duplication of an existing road reduces the  value of the federal and other timber which is tapped by the existing  road.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> It is also clear that the Department of the Interior, which is  responsible for the conservation of the resources of the O. and C. lands  and is charged specifically with operating the timber lands on a  sustained-yield basis, must have access to these lands for the purpose  of managing them and their resources. In addition, where the public  interest requires the disposition of Federal timber by competitive  bidding, prospective bidders must have an opportunity to reach the  timber to be sold. Likewise, where other timber is committed by  cooperative agreement to coordinated administration with timber of the  United States, there must be access to both.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Accordingly, to the extent that in the judgment of the  authorized officer it appears necessary to accomplish these purposes,  when the United States, acting through the Bureau of Land Management,  grants a right-of-way across O. and C. lands to a private operator, the  private operator will be required to grant to the United States for use  by it and its licensees:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Rights-of-way across lands controlled directly or indirectly by  him;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The right to use, to the extent indicated in Sec. Sec. 2812.3-5  and 2812.3-6, any portions of the road system or rights-of-way  controlled directly or indirectly by the private operator which is  adequate or can economically be made adequate to accommodate the  probable normal requirements of both the operator and of the United  States and its licensees, and which form an integral part of or may be  added to the road system with which the requested right-of-way will  connect;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The right to extend such road system across the operator's lands  to reach federal roads or timber; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In addition, in the limited circumstances set forth in Sec.  2812.3-2 of this subpart the right to use certain other roads and  rights-of-way. The permit will describe by legal subdivisions the lands  of the operator as to which the United States receives rights. In  addition, the extent and duration of the rights received by the United  States will be specifically stated in the permit and ordinarily will  embrace only those portions of such road system, rights-of-way and lands  as may be actually needed for the management and removal of federal  timber, or other timber committed by a cooperative agreement to  coordinated administration with timber of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When the United States or a licensee of the United States uses  any portion of a permittee's road system for the removal of forest  products, the permittee will be entitled to receive just compensation,  including a fair share of the maintenance and amortization charges  attributable to such road, and to prescribe reasonable road operating  rules, in accordance with Sec. Sec. 2812.3-7 to 2812.4-4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> As some examples of how this policy would be applied in  particular instances, the United States may issue a permit under subpart  2812 without requesting any rights with respect to roads, rights-of-way  or lands which the   authorized officer finds will not be required for management of or  access to Federal timber, or timber included in a cooperative agreement.  Where, however, the authorized officer finds that there is a road  controlled directly or indirectly by the applicant, which will be needed  for such purposes and which he finds either has capacity to accommodate  the probable normal requirements both of the applicant and of the  Government and its licensees, or such additional capacity can be most  economically provided by an investment in such road system by the  Government rather than by the construction of a duplicate road, he may  require, for the period of time during which the United States and its  licensees will have need for the road, the rights to use the road for  the marketing and management of its timber and of timber included in a  cooperative agreement in return for the granting of rights-of-way across  O. and C. lands, and an agreement that the road builder will be paid a  fair share of the cost of the road and its maintenance. Where it appears  to the authorized officer that such a road will not be adequate or  cannot economically be enlarged to handle the probable normal  requirements both of the private operator and of the United States and  its licensees, or even where the authorized officer has reasonable doubt  as to such capacity, he will not request rights over such a road.  Instead, the Bureau will make provision for its own road system either  by providing in its timber sale contracts that in return for the road  cost allowance made in fixing the appraised value of the timber, timber  purchasers will construct or extend a different road system, or by  expending for such construction or by extension monies appropriated for  such purposes by the Congress, or, where feasible, by using an existing  duplicating road over which the Government has obtained road rights. In  such circumstances, however, road cost and maintenance allowances made  in the stumpage price of O. and C. timber will be required to be applied  to the road which the Bureau has the right to use, and thereafter will  not in any circumstances be available for amortization or maintenance  costs of the applicant's road.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> When a right-of-way permit is issued for a road or road system  over which the United States obtains rights of use for itself and its  licensees, the authorized officer will seek to agree with the applicant  respecting such matters as the time, route, and specifications for the  future development of the road system involved; the portion of the  capital and maintenance costs of the road system to be borne by the  timber to be transported over the road system by the United States and  its licensees; a formula for determining the proportion of the capacity  of the road system which is to be available to the United States and its  licensees for the transportation of forest products; and other similar  matters respecting the use of the road by the United States and its  licensees and the compensation payable therefor. To the extent that any  such matter is not embraced in such an agreement, it will be settled by  negotiation between the permittee and the individual licensees of the  United States who use the road, and, in the event of their disagreement,  by private arbitration between them in accordance with the laws of the  State of Oregon.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The authorized officer may in his discretion, issue short term  right-of-way permits for periods not exceeding three years, subject to  one-year extensions in his discretion. Such permits shall specify the  volume of timber which may be carried over the right-of-way and the area  from which such timber may be logged. The permits shall be revocable by  the authorized officer, the State Director, or the Secretary for  violation of their terms and conditions or of these regulations or if  hazardous conditions result from the construction, maintenance or use of  the rights-of-way by the permittees or those acting under their  authority. As a condition for the granting of such permits, the  applicant must comply with Sec. Sec. 2812.3-1 and 2812.3-3 of this  subpart to the extent that rights-of-way and road use rights are needed  to remove government timber offered for sale in the same general area  during the period for which the short term right-of-way is granted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The authorized officer may, in his discretion, issue to private  operators   rights-of-way across O. and C. lands, needed for the conduct of salvage  operations, for a period not to exceed five years. A salvage operation  as used in this paragraph means the removal of trees injured or killed  by windstorms, insect infestation, disease, or fire, together with any  adjacent green timber needed to make an economic logging show. As a  condition of the granting of such rights-of-way, the operator will be  required, when the authorized officer deems it necessary, to grant to  the United States and its licensees for the conduct of salvage  operations on O. and C. lands for a period not to exceed five years,  rights-of-way across lands controlled directly or indirectly by him and  to grant the right to use to the extent indicated in Sec. Sec. 2812.3-5  and 2812.3-6 any portions of the road system controlled directly or  indirectly by the private operator which is adequate or can economically  be made adequate to accommodate the requirements of both the operator  and of the United States and its licensees.
