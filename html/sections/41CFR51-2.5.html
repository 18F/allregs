                            <p class="depth0">The Committee considers the particular facts and circumstances in  each case in determining if a commodity or service is suitable for  addition to the Procurement List. When the Committee determines that a  proposed addition is likely to have a severe adverse impact on a current  contractor, it takes this fact into consideration in deciding not to add  the commodity or service to the Procurement List, or to add only a  portion of the Government requirement for the item. If the Committee  decides to add a commodity or service in whole or in part to the  Procurement List, that decision is announced in the Federal Register  with a notice that includes information on the effective date of the  addition.
