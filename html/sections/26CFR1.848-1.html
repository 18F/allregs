                                Sec. 1.848-1  Definitions and special provisions.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope and effective date. The definitions and special provisions  in this section apply solely for purposes of determining specified  policy acquisition expenses under section 848 of the Internal Revenue  Code, this section, and Sec. Sec. 1.848-2 and 1.848-3. Unless otherwise  specified, the rules of this section are effective for the taxable years  of an insurance company beginning after November 14, 1991.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Specified insurance contract--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A ``specified  insurance contract'' is any life insurance contract, annuity contract,  noncancellable or guaranteed renewable accident and health insurance  contract, or combination contract. A reinsurance agreement that  reinsures the risks under a specified insurance contract is treated in  the same manner as the reinsured contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. A ``specified insurance contract''  does not include any pension plan contract (as defined in section  818(a)), flight insurance or similar contract, or qualified foreign  contract (as defined in section 807(e)(4)).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Reinsurance of qualified foreign contracts. The exception for  qualified foreign contracts does not apply to reinsurance agreements  that reinsure qualified foreign contracts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Life insurance contract. A ``life insurance contract'' is any  contract--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Issued after December 31, 1984, that qualifies as a life  insurance contract under section 7702(a) (including an endowment  contract as defined in 7702(h)); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Issued prior to January 1, 1985, if the premiums on the contract  are reported as life insurance premiums on the insurance company's  annual statement (or could be reported as life insurance premiums if the  company were required to file the annual statement for life and accident  and health companies).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Noncancellable accident and health insurance contract. The term  ``noncancellable accident and health insurance contract'' has the same  meaning for purposes of section 848 as the term has for purposes of  section 816(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Guaranteed renewable accident and health insurance contract. The  term ``guaranteed renewable accident and health insurance contract'' has  the same meaning for purposes of section 848 as the term has for  purposes of section 816(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Combination contract--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definition. A ``combination contract''  is a contract (other than a contract described in section 848(e)(3))  that provides two or more types of insurance coverage, at least one of  which if offered separately would be a life insurance contract, an  annuity contract, or a noncancellable or guaranteed renewable accident  and health insurance contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Treatment of premiums on a combination contract--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general.  If the premium allocable to each type of insurance coverage is  separately stated on the insurance company's annual statement (or could  be separately stated if the insurance company were required to file the  annual statement for life and accident and health companies), the  premium allocable to each type of insurance coverage in a combination  contract is subject to the capitalization rate, if any, that would apply  if that coverage was provided in a separate contract. If the premium  allocable to each type of insurance coverage in a combination contract  is not separately stated, the entire premium is subject to the highest  capitalization percentage applicable to any of the coverages provided.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> De minimis premiums. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(2)--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A de minimis premium is not required to be separately stated;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In determining the highest capitalization percentage applicable  to a combination contract, the coverage to which a de minimis premium is  allocable is disregarded;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> If the separate statement requirement of this paragraph (g)(2)  is satisfied, a de minimis premium is treated in accordance with its  characterization on the insurance company's annual statement; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Whether a premium for an insurance coverage is de minimis is  determined by comparing that premium with the aggregate of the premiums  for the combination contract. A premium that is not more than 2 percent  of the   premium for the entire contract is considered de minimis. Whether a  premium that is more than 2 percent is de minimis is determined based on  all the facts and circumstances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Example. The principles of this paragraph (g) are illustrated by  the following example.</p><p class="depth3">Example. A life insurance company (L1) issues a contract to an  employer (X) which provides cancellable accident and health insurance  coverage and group term life insurance coverage to X's employees. L1  charges a premium of $1,000 for the contract, $950 of which is  attributable to the cancellable accident and health insurance coverage  and $50 of which is attributable to the group term life insurance  coverage. On its annual statement, L1 reports the premiums attributable  to the accident and health insurance coverage separately from the  premiums attributable to the group term life insurance coverage. The  contract issued by L1 is a combination contract as defined in paragraph  (g)(1) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section,  only the premiums attributable to the group term life insurance coverage  ($50) are subject to the provisions of section 848. The premiums  attributable to the cancellable accident and health insurance coverage  ($950) are not subject to the provisions of section 848.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Group life insurance contract--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A life insurance  contract (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) is group life  insurance contract if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The contract is a group life insurance contract under the  applicable law;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The coverage is provided under a master contract issued to the  group policyholder, which may be a trust, trustee, or agent;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The premiums on the contract are reported either as group life  insurance premiums or credit life insurance premiums on the insurance  company's annual statement (or could be reported as group life insurance  premiums or credit life insurance premiums if the company were required  to file the annual statement for life and accident and health  companies);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The group affiliation requirement of paragraph (h)(2) of this  section is satisfied;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The premiums on the contract are determined on a group basis  within the meaning of paragraph (h)(3) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The proceeds of the contract are not payable to or for the  benefit of the insured's employer, an organization or association to  which the insured belongs, or other similar person. (See paragraph  (h)(7) of this section for special rules that apply in determining if  this requirement is satisfied.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Group affiliation requirement--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. The group  affiliation requirement of section 848(e)(2)(A) and this paragraph  (h)(2) is satisfied only if all of the individuals eligible for coverage  under the contract constitute a group described in paragraphs (h)(2)  (ii) through (viii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Employee group. An employee group consists of all of the  employees (including statutory employees within the meaning of section  3121(d)(3) and individuals who are treated as employed by a single  employer under section 414 (b), (c), or (m)), or any class or classes  thereof within the meaning of paragraph (h)(2)(x) of this section, of an  employer. For this purpose, the term ``employee'' includes--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A retired or former employee;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The sole proprietor, if the employer is a sole proprietorship;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A partner of the partnership, if the employer is a partnership;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> A director of the corporation, if the employer is a corporation;  and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> An elected or appointed official of the public body, if the  employer is a public body.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Debtor group. A debtor group consists of all of the debtors,  or any class or classes thereof within the meaning of paragraph  (h)(2)(x) of this section, of a creditor. For this purpose, the term  ``debtor'' includes a borrower of money or purchaser or lessee of goods,  services, or property for which payment is arranged through a credit  transaction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Labor union group. A labor union group consists of all of the  members, or any class or classes thereof within the meaning of paragraph  (h)(2)(x) of this section, of a labor union or similar employee  organization.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Association group. An association group consists of all of the  members, or any class or classes thereof within the meaning of paragraph  (h)(2)(x) of this section, of an association that, at the time the  master contract is issued--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Is organized and maintained for purposes other than obtaining  insurance;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Has been in active existence for at least two years (including,  in the case of a merged or successor association, the years of active  existence of any predecessor association); and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Has at least 100 members.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Credit union group. A credit union group consists of all of the  members or borrowers, or any class or classes thereof within the meaning  of paragraph (h)(2)(x) of this section, of a credit union.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Multiple group. A multiple group consists of two or more  groups from any single category described in paragraphs (h)(2) (ii)  through (vi) of this section. A multiple group may not include two or  more groups from different categories described in paragraph (h)(2) (ii)  through (vi) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Certain discretionary groups. Provided that the contract  otherwise satisfies the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this  section, a contract issued to one of the following discretionary groups  is treated as satisfying the group affiliation requirement of this  paragraph (h)(2)--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A contract issued to a group consisting of students of one or  more universities or other educational institutions;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A contract issued to a group consisting of members or former  members of the U.S. Armed Forces;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A contract issued to a group of individuals for the payment of  future funeral expenses; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> A contract issued to any other discretionary group as specified  by the Commissioner in subsequent guidance published in the Internal  Revenue Bulletin. (See Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Employees treated as members. In determining whether the group  affiliation requirement of paragraph (h)(2) of this section is  satisfied, the employees of a labor union, credit union, or association  may be treated as members of a labor union group, a credit union group,  or an association group, respectively.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Class or classes of a group determined without regard to  individual health characteristics--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In general. A class or classes of  a group described in paragraphs (h)(2) (ii) through (viii) of this  section may be determined using any reasonable characteristics (for  example, amount of insurance, location, or occupation) other than  individual health characteristics. The employees of a single employer  covered under a policy issued to a multi-employer trust are considered a  class of a group described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Limitation of coverage based on certain work and age  requirements permissible. A limitation of coverage under a group  contract to persons who are actively at work or of a pre-retirement age  (for example, age 65 or younger) is not treated as based on individual  health characteristics.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Premiums determined on a group basis--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. Premiums  for a contract are determined on a group basis for purposes of section  848(e)(2)(B) and this paragraph (h) only if the premium charged by the  insurance company for each member of the group (or any class thereof) is  determined on the basis of the same rates for the corresponding amount  of coverage (for example, per $1,000 of insurance) or on the basis of  rates which differ only because of the gender, smoking habits, or age of  the member.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exception for substandard premium rates for certain high risk  insureds. Any difference in premium rates is disregarded for purposes of  this paragraph (h)(3) if the difference is charged for an individual who  was accepted for coverage at a substandard rate prior to January 1,  1993.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Flexible premium contracts. In the case of a group universal  life insurance contract, the identical premium requirement is satisfied  if the premium rates used by the insurance company in determining the  periodic mortality charges applied to the policy account value of any  member insured by the contract differ from those of other members  (within the same class) only because of the gender, smoking habits, or  age of the member.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Determination of actual age. For purposes of this paragraph  (h)(3), determinations of actual age may be made using any reasonable  method, provided that this method is applied consistently for all  members of the group.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Underwriting practices used by company. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Disqualification of group--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as otherwise  provided in this paragraph (h)(5), if the requirements of paragraphs  (h)(1), (2), and (3) of this section are not satisfied with respect to  one or more members of the group, or of a class within a group (within  the meaning of paragraph (h)(2)(x) of this section), the premiums for  the entire group (or class) are treated as individual life insurance  premiums.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exception for de minimis failures. If the requirements of  paragraphs (h) (1), (2), or (3) of this section are not satisfied with  respect to one or more members of the group (or class), but the sum of  the premiums charged by the insurance company for those individuals is  no more than 5 percent of the aggregate premiums for the group (or  class), only the premiums charged for those individuals are treated as  premiums for an individual life insurance contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Supplemental life insurance coverage. For purposes of  determining whether the requirement in paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this  section is satisfied, any supplemental life insurance coverage  (including optional coverage for members of the group, their spouses, or  their dependent children) is (or is treated as) a separate contract. In  determining whether the group affiliation requirement of paragraph  (h)(2) of this section is satisfied for the supplemental coverage, a  member's spouse and dependent children are treated as members of the  group if they are eligible for coverage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Special rules relating to the payment of proceeds. The following  rules apply for purposes of section 848(e)(2) and paragraph (h)(1)(vi)  of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Contracts issued to a welfare benefit fund. If a contract issued  to a welfare benefit fund (as defined in section 419) provides for  payment of proceeds to the welfare benefit fund, the proceeds of the  contract are not considered payable to or for the benefit of the  insured's employer, an organization or association to which the insured  belongs, or other similar person, provided the proceeds are paid as  benefits to the employee or the employee's beneficiary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Credit life insurance contracts. If a credit life insurance  contract provides for payment of proceeds to the insured's creditor, the  proceeds of the contract are not treated as payable to or for the  benefit of the insured's employer, an organization or association to  which the insured belongs, or other similar person, provided the  proceeds are applied against an outstanding indebtedness of the insured.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> ``Organization or association'' limited to the sponsor of the  contract or the group policyholder. The term ``organization or  association'' means the organization or association that is either the  sponsor of the contract or the group policyholder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> General deductions. The term ``general deductions'' is defined  in section 848(c)(2). An insurance company determines its general  deductions for the taxable year without regard to amounts capitalized or  amortized under section 848(a). The amount of a company's general  deductions is also determined without regard to the rules of Sec.  1.848-2(f), which apply only for purposes of determining net  consideration for reinsurance agreements.
