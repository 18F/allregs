The 3-year average will be calculated using numbers available as of March 1 of each year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(2)</em> The number of individuals enrolled in health care coverage through the qualified high risk pool of the State will be determined by attestation by the State in its grant application and verified for reasonability by the Secretary through acceptable industry data sources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The amount awarded to each eligible State will be the lesser of the 50 percent of losses incurred by its qualified risk pool for the fiscal year in question or its allotment under the formula.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> One-third of the total appropriation will be available for the bonus grants.
