                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The following requirements apply to all ladders as indicated, including job-made ladders.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ladders shall be capable of supporting the following loads without failure:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each self-supporting portable ladder: At least four times the maximum intended load, except that each extra-heavy-duty type 1A metal or plastic ladder shall sustain at least 3.3 times the maximum intended load. The ability of a ladder to sustain the loads indicated in this paragraph shall be determined by applying or transmitting the requisite load to the ladder in a downward vertical direction. Ladders built and tested in conformance with the applicable provisions of appendix A

of this subpart will be deemed to meet this requirement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each portable ladder that is not self-supporting: At least four times the maximum intended load, except that each extra-heavy-duty type 1A metal or plastic ladders shall sustain at least 3.3 times the maximum intended load. The ability of a ladder to sustain the loads indicated in this paragraph shall be determined by applying or transmitting the requisite load to the ladder in a downward vertical direction when the ladder is placed at an angle of 75\1/2\ degrees from the horizontal. Ladders built and tested in conformance with the applicable provisions of appendix A will be deemed to meet this requirement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Each fixed ladder: At least two loads of 250 pounds (114 kg) each, concentrated between any two consecutive attachments (the number and position of additional concentrated loads of 250 pounds (114 kg) each, determined from anticipated usage of the ladder, shall also be included), plus anticipated loads caused by ice buildup, winds, rigging, and impact loads resulting from the use of ladder safety devices. Each step or rung shall be capable of supporting a single concentrated load of at least 250 pounds (114 kg) applied in the middle of the step or rung. Ladders built in conformance with the applicable provisions of appendix A will be deemed to meet this requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ladder rungs, cleats, and steps shall be parallel, level, and uniformly spaced when the ladder is in position for use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> Rungs, cleats, and steps of portable ladders (except as provided below) and fixed ladders (including individual-rung/step ladders) shall be spaced not less than 10 inches (25 cm) apart, nor more than 14 inches (36 cm) apart, as measured between center lines of the rungs, cleats, and steps.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Rungs, cleats, and steps of portable ladders (except as provided below) and fixed ladders (including individual-rung/step ladders) shall be spaced not less than 10 inches (25 cm) apart, nor more than 14 inches (36 cm) apart, as measured between center lines of the rungs, cleats, and steps.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Rungs, cleats, and steps of step stools shall be not less than 8 inches (20 cm) apart, nor more than 12 inches (31 cm) apart, as measured between center lines of the rungs, cleats, and steps.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Rungs, cleats, and steps of the base section of extension trestle ladders shall not be less than 8 inches (20 cm) nor more than 18 inches (46 cm) apart, as measured between center lines of the rungs, cleats, and steps. The rung spacing on the extension section of the extension trestle ladder shall be not less than 6 inches (15 cm) nor more than 12 inches (31 cm), as measured between center lines of the rungs, cleats, and steps.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(i)</em> The minimum clear distance between the sides of individual-rung/step ladders and the minimum clear distance between the side rails of other fixed ladders shall be 16 inches (41 cm).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The minimum clear distance between the sides of individual-rung/step ladders and the minimum clear distance between the side rails of other fixed ladders shall be 16 inches (41 cm).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The minimum clear distance between side rails for all portable ladders shall be 11\1/2\ inches (29 cm).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The rungs of individual-rung/step ladders shall be shaped such that employees' feet cannot slide off the end of the rungs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)(i)</em> The rungs and steps of fixed metal ladders manufactured after March 15, 1991, shall be corrugated, knurled, dimpled, coated with skid-resistant material, or otherwise treated to minimize slipping.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The rungs and steps of fixed metal ladders manufactured after March 15, 1991, shall be corrugated, knurled, dimpled, coated with skid-resistant material, or otherwise treated to minimize slipping.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The rungs and steps of portable metal ladders shall be corrugated, knurled, dimpled, coated with skid-resistant material, or otherwise treated to minimize slipping.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Ladders shall not be tied or fastened together to provide longer sections unless they are specifically designed for such use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A metal spreader or locking device shall be provided on each stepladder to hold the front and back sections in an open position when the ladder is being used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> When splicing is required to obtain a given length of side rail, the resulting side rail must be at least equivalent in strength to a one-piece side rail made of the same material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Except when portable ladders are used to gain access to fixed ladders (such as those on utility towers, billboards, and other structures where the bottom of the fixed ladder is elevated to limit access), when two or more separate ladders are used to reach an elevated work area, the ladders shall be offset with a platform or landing between the ladders.
