                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Computation of tax liability. The tax liability  for a consolidated return year of a group of two or more corporations  described in section 1504(e) which are exempt from taxation under  section 501 (hereinafter referred to in this section as ``exempt  group'') shall be determined on a consolidated basis by applying the  provisions of subchapter F of chapter 1 of the code in the manner  provided in this section. See section 1504(e) for tax-exempt  corporations eligible to file a consolidated return.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Applicability of other consolidated return provisions. The  provisions of Sec. 1.1502-1 through Sec. 1.1502-80 shall be applicable  to an exempt group to the extent they are not inconsistent with the  provisions of this section or the provisions of subchapter F of chapter  1 of the Code. For purposes of applying the provisions of Sec. 1.1502-1  through Sec. 1.1502-80 to an exempt group, the following substitutions  shall be made:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The term ``exempt group'' shall be substituted for the term  ``group'',</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The terms ``unrelated business taxable income'', ``separate  unrelated business taxable income'', and ``consolidated unrelated  business taxable income'' shall be substituted for the terms ``taxable  income'', ``separate taxable income'', and ``consolidated taxable  income'', and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The term ``consolidated liability for tax determined under  Sec. 1.1502-2'' (or an equivalent term) shall mean the consolidated  liability for tax of an exempt group determined under paragraph (b) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Consolidated liability for tax. The tax liability for a  consolidated return year of an exempt group is the tax imposed by  section 511(a) or section 1201(a) on the consolidated unrelated business  taxable income for the year (determined under paragraph (c) of this  section), and by allowing the credits and surtax exemption provided in  Sec. 1.1502-2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Consolidated unrelated business taxable income. The consolidated  unrelated business taxable income for a consolidated return year shall  be determined by taking into account:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The separate unrelated business taxable income of each member of  the exempt group (determined under paragraph (d) of this section);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any consolidated net operating loss deduction (determined under   Sec. 1.1502-21A or 1.1502-21 (as appropriate) subject to the limitations  provided in section 512(b)(6);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any consolidated charitable contribution deduction (determined  under Sec. 1.1502-24) subject to the limitations provided in section  512(b)(10); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any consolidated net gain or net loss from the disposition of  debt-financed property (as defined in section 514(b)) taken into account  as provided by section 514(a), or from the cutting of timber to which  section 631 applies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Separate unrelated business taxable income. The separate  unrelated business taxable income of a member of an exempt group shall  be computed in accordance with the provisions of section 512 covering  the determination of unrelated business taxable income of separate  corporations, except that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The provisions of paragraphs (a) through (k) and (o) of  Sec. 1.1502-12 shall apply; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>.
