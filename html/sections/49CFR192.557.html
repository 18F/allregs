Pressure may be increased as necessary to test each  regulator, after a regulator has been installed on each pipeline subject  to the increased pressure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> After complying with paragraph (b) of this section, the increase  in maximum allowable operating pressure must be made in increments that  are equal to 10 p.s.i. (69 kPa) gage or 25 percent of the total pressure  increase, whichever produces the fewer number of increments. Whenever  the requirements of paragraph (b)(6) of this section apply, there must  be at least two approximately equal incremental increases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If records for cast iron or ductile iron pipeline facilities are  not complete enough to determine stresses produced by internal pressure,  trench loading, rolling loads, beam stresses, and other bending loads,  in evaluating the level of safety of the pipeline when operating at the  proposed increased pressure, the following procedures must be followed:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In estimating the stresses, if the original laying conditions  cannot be ascertained, the operator shall assume that cast iron pipe was  supported on blocks with tamped backfill and that ductile iron pipe was  laid without blocks with tamped backfill.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unless the actual maximum cover depth is known, the operator  shall measure the actual cover in at least three places where the cover  is most likely to be greatest and shall use the greatest cover measured.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unless the actual nominal wall thickness is known, the operator  shall determine the wall thickness by cutting and measuring coupons from  at least three separate pipe lengths. The coupons must be cut from pipe  lengths in areas where the cover depth is most likely to be the  greatest. The average of all measurements taken must be increased by the  allowance indicated in the following table:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Allowance inches (millimeters)</p><p class="depth3">--------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Cast iron pipe</p><p class="depth3">Pipe size inches (millimeters)             --------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Centrifugally    Ductile iron pipe</p><p class="depth3">Pit cast pipe        cast pipe ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3 to 8 (76 to 203).....................................       0.075 (1.91)       0.065 (1.65)       0.065 (1.65) 10 to 12 (254 to 305)..................................        0.08 (2.03)        0.07 (1.78)        0.07 (1.78) 14 to 24 (356 to 610)..................................        0.08 (2.03)        0.08 (2.03)       0.075 (1.91) 30 to 42 (762 to 1067).................................        0.09 (2.29)        0.09 (2.29)       0.075 (1.91) 48 (1219)..............................................        0.09 (2.29)        0.09 (2.29)        0.08 (2.03) 54 to 60 (1372 to 1524)................................        0.09 (2.29)  .................  ................. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For cast iron pipe, unless the pipe manufacturing process is  known, the operator shall assume that the pipe is pit cast pipe with a  bursting tensile strength of 11,000 p.s.i.
