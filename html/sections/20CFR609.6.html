                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determination of first claim. The State agency whose State law applies to an individual under Sec. 609.8 shall, promptly upon the filing of a first claim for UCFE, determine whether the individual is eligible and whether a disqualification applies, and, if the individual is found to be eligible, the individual's benefit year and the weekly and maximum amounts of UCFE payable to the individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determinations of weekly claims. The State agency promptly shall, upon the filing of a claim for payment of UCFE or waiting period credit with respect to a week, determine whether the individual is entitled to a payment of UCFE or waiting period credit with respect to such week, and, if entitled, the amount of UCFE or waiting period credit to which the individual is entitled.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Redetermination. The provisions of the applicable State law concerning the right to request, or authority to undertake, reconsideration of a determination pertaining to State unemployment compensation under the applicable State law shall apply to determinations pertaining to UCFE.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notices to individual. The State agency promptly shall give notice in writing to the individual of any determination or redetermination of a first claim, and, except as may be authorized under paragraph (g) of this section, of any determination or redetermination of any weekly claim which denies UCFE or waiting period credit or reduces the weekly amount or maximum amount initially determined to be payable. Each notice of determination or redetermination shall include such information regarding the determination or redetermination and notice of right to reconsideration or appeal, or both, as is furnished with written notices of determinations and redeterminations with respect to claims for State unemployment compensation; and where information furnished by a Federal agency was considered in making the determination, or redetermination, the notice thereof shall include an explanation of the right of the individual to seek additional information pursuant to Sec. 609.23 and/or a reconsideration of Federal findings pursuant to Sec. 609.24.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Obtaining information for claim determinations. (1) Information required for the determination of claims for UCFE shall be obtained by the State agency from claimants, employers, and others, in the same manner as information is obtained for claim purposes under the applicable State law, but information (including additional and reconsidered Federal findings) shall be obtained from the Federal agency that employed the UCFE claimant as prescribed in Sec. Sec. 609.21 through 609.25. On request by a UCFE claimant, the State agency shall seek additional information pursuant to Sec. 609.23 and reconsideration of Federal findings pursuant to Sec. 609.24.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Information required for the determination of claims for UCFE shall be obtained by the State agency from claimants, employers, and others, in the same manner as information is obtained for claim purposes under the applicable State law, but information (including additional and reconsidered Federal findings) shall be obtained from the Federal agency that employed the UCFE claimant as prescribed in Sec. Sec. 609.21 through 609.25. On request by a UCFE claimant, the State agency shall seek additional information pursuant to Sec. 609.23 and reconsideration of Federal findings pursuant to Sec. 609.24.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If Federal findings have not been received from a Federal agency within 12 days after the request for information was submitted to the Federal agency, the State agency shall determine the individual's entitlement to UCFE on the basis of an affidavit completed by the individual on a form prescribed by the Department. In addition, the individual shall submit for examination by the State agency any documents issued by the Federal agency (for example, Standard Form 50 or W-2) verifying that the individual performed services for and received wages from such Federal agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If Federal findings received by a State agency after a determination has been made under this section contain information which would result in a change in the individual's eligibility for or entitlement to UCFE, the State agency promptly shall make a redetermination and notify the individual, as provided in this section. All payments of UCFE made prior to or after such redetermination shall be adjusted in accordance therewith.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Promptness. Full payment of UCFE when due shall be consistent with this part 609 and shall be made with the greatest promptness that is administratively feasible, but the provisions of part 640 of this chapter (relating to promptness of benefit payments) shall not be applicable to the UCFE Program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Secretary's standard. The procedures for making determinations and

redeterminations, and furnishing written notices of determinations, redeterminations, and rights of appeal to individuals applying for UCFE, shall be consistent with this part 609 and with the Secretary's ``Standard for Claim Determinations--Separation Information'' (Employment Security Manual, part V, sections 6010 et seq.).
