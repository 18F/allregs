                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Basic rules. Coverage may be reinstated without interruption of  benefits if the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The enrollee appeals the termination by the end of the month  following the month in which SSA sent the notice of termination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The enrollee alleges and it is found that the enrollee did not  receive timely and adequate notice that the premiums were overdue.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The enrollee pays, within 30 days after SSA's subsequent request  for payment, all premiums due through the month in which he or she  appealed the termination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Basis for reinstating coverage. Coverage may be reinstated if  the evidence establishes one of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The enrollee acted diligently to pay the premiums or to request  relief upon receiving a premium notice very   late in the grace period or shortly after its end, and the delayed  notice was not the enrollee's fault. (For example, if the billing notice  was misaddressed or lost in the mail, it would not be the enrollee's  fault; if the enrollee had moved and not notified SSA of the new  address, he or she would be responsible for the delay.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On the basis of information given by SSA, the enrollee could  reasonably have believed that the premiums were being paid by deduction  from benefits or by some other means. (An example would be a notice  indicating that premiums would be paid by a State Medicaid agency or a  group payer or would be deducted from the spouse's civil service  annuity.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No basis for reinstating coverage. Coverage may not be  reinstated if the enrollee--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Received timely and adequate notice but failed to pay within the  grace period, for example because of insufficient income or resources;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Appealed the termination more than one month after the month in  which SSA sent the termination notice.</p>
