                                Sec. 1.336-1  General principles, nomenclature, and definitions
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Overview--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Section 336(e) authorizes the  promulgation of regulations under which, in certain circumstances, a  sale, exchange, or distribution of the stock of a corporation may be  treated as an asset sale. This section and Sec. Sec. 1.336-2 through  1.336-5 provide the rules for and consequences of making such election.  This section provides the definitions and nomenclature. Generally,  except to the extent inconsistent with section 336(e), the results of  section 336(e) should coincide with those of section 338(h)(10).  Accordingly, to the extent not inconsistent with section 336(e) or these  regulations, the principles of section 338 and the regulations under  section 338 apply for purposes of these regulations. For example, Sec.  1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(8), concerning the availability of the section 453  installment method, may apply with respect to section 336(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Consistency rules. In general, the principles of Sec. 1.338-8,  concerning asset and stock consistency, apply with respect to section  336(e). However, for this purpose, the application of Sec. 1.338- 8(b)(1) is modified such that Sec. 1.338-8(b)(1)(iii) applies to an  asset if the asset is owned, immediately after its acquisition and on  the disposition date, by a person or by a related person (as defined in  Sec. 1.336-1(b)(12)) to a person that acquires, by sale, exchange,  distribution, or any combination thereof, five percent or more, by  value, of the stock of target in the qualified stock disposition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of Sec. Sec. 1.336-1 through 1.336-5  (except as otherwise provided):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Seller. The term seller means any domestic corporation that  makes a qualified stock disposition of stock of another corporation.  Seller includes both a transferor and a distributor of target stock.  Generally, all members of a consolidated group that dispose of target  stock are treated as a single seller. See Sec. 1.336-2(g)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Purchaser. The term purchaser means one or more persons that  acquire or receive the stock of another corporation in a qualified stock  disposition. A purchaser includes both a transferee and a distributee of  target stock.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Target; S corporation target; old target; new target. The term  target means any domestic corporation the stock of   which is sold, exchanged, or distributed in a qualified stock  disposition. An S corporation target is a target that is an S  corporation immediately before the disposition date; any other target is  a non-S corporation target. Except as the context otherwise requires, a  reference to target includes a reference to an S corporation target. In  the case of a transaction not described in section 355(d)(2) or (e)(2),  old target refers to target for periods ending on or before the close of  target's disposition date and new target refers to target for subsequent  periods. In the case of a transaction described in section 355(d)(2) or  (e)(2), old target refers to target for periods ending on or before the  disposition date as well as for subsequent periods.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> S corporation shareholders. S corporation shareholders are the S  corporation target's shareholders. Unless otherwise provided, a  reference to S corporation shareholders refers both to S corporation  shareholders who dispose of and those who do not dispose of their S  corporation target stock.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Disposed of; disposition--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. The term disposed of  refers to a transfer of stock in a disposition. The term disposition  means any sale, exchange, or distribution of stock, but only if--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The basis of the stock in the hands of the purchaser is not  determined in whole or in part by reference to the adjusted basis of  such stock in the hands of the person from whom the stock is acquired or  under section 1014(a) (relating to property acquired from a decedent);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, the  stock is not sold, exchanged, or distributed in a transaction to which  section 351, 354, 355, or 356 applies and is not sold, exchanged, or  distributed in any transaction described in regulations in which the  transferor does not recognize the entire amount of the gain or loss  realized in the transaction; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The stock is not sold, exchanged, or distributed to a related  person.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exception for disposition of stock in certain section 355  transactions. Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) of this section, a  distribution of stock to a person who is not a related person in a  transaction in which the full amount of stock gain would be recognized  pursuant to section 355(d)(2) or (e)(2) shall be considered a  disposition.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Transactions with related persons. In determining whether  stock is sold, exchanged, or distributed to a related person, the  principles of section 338(h)(3)(C) and Sec. 1.338-3(b)(3) shall apply.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> No consideration paid. Stock in target may be considered  disposed of if, under general principles of tax law, seller is  considered to sell, exchange, or distribute stock of target  notwithstanding that no amount may be paid for (or allocated to) the  stock.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Disposed of stock reacquired by certain persons. Stock disposed  of by seller to another person under this section that is reacquired by  seller or a member of seller's consolidated group during the 12-month  disposition period shall not be considered as disposed of. Similarly,  stock disposed of by an S corporation shareholder to another person  under this section that is reacquired by the S corporation shareholder  or by a person related (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(12) of this  section) to the S corporation shareholder during the 12-month  disposition period shall not be considered as disposed of.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Qualified stock disposition--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. The term qualified  stock disposition means any transaction or series of transactions in  which stock meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2) of a domestic  corporation is either sold, exchanged, or distributed, or any  combination thereof, by another domestic corporation or by the S  corporation shareholders in a disposition, within the meaning of  paragraph (b)(5) of this section, during the 12-month disposition  period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Overlap with qualified stock purchase--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In general. Except  as provided in paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(B) of this section, a transaction  satisfying the definition of a qualified stock disposition under  paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, which also qualifies as a qualified  stock purchase (as defined in section 338(d)(3)), will not be treated as  a qualified stock disposition.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Exception. If, as a result of the deemed sale of old target's  assets pursuant to a section 336(e) election, there would be, but for  paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(A) of this section, a qualified stock disposition  of the stock of a subsidiary of target, then paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(A)  shall not apply to the disposition of the stock of the subsidiary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> 12-month disposition period. The term 12-month disposition  period means the 12-month period beginning with the date of the first  sale, exchange, or distribution of stock included in a qualified stock  disposition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Disposition date. The term disposition date means, with respect  to any corporation, the first day on which there is a qualified stock  disposition with respect to the stock of such corporation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Disposition date assets. Disposition date assets are the assets  of target held at the beginning of the day after the disposition date  (but see Sec. 1.338-1(d) (regarding certain transactions on the  disposition date)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Domestic corporation. The term domestic corporation has the  same meaning as in Sec. 1.338-2(c)(9).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Section 336(e) election. A section 336(e) election is an  election to apply section 336(e) to target. A section 336(e) election is  made by making an election for target under Sec. 1.336-2(h).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Related persons. Two persons are related if stock of a  corporation owned by one of the persons would be attributed under  section 318(a), other than section 318(a)(4), to the other. However,  neither section 318(a)(2)(A) nor section 318(a)(3)(A) apply to attribute  stock ownership from a partnership to a partner, or from a partner to a  partnership, if such partner owns, directly or indirectly, interests  representing less than five percent of the value of the partnership.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Liquidation. Any reference to a liquidation is treated as a  reference to the transfer described in Sec. 1.336-2(b)(1)(iii)  notwithstanding its ultimate characterization for Federal income tax  purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Deemed asset disposition. The deemed sale of old target's  assets is, without regard to its characterization for Federal income tax  purposes, referred to as the deemed asset disposition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> Deemed disposition tax consequences. Deemed disposition tax  consequences refers to, in the aggregate, the Federal income tax  consequences (generally, the income, gain, deduction, and loss) of the  deemed asset disposition. Deemed disposition tax consequences also  refers to the Federal income tax consequences of the transfer of a  particular asset in the deemed asset disposition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> 80-percent purchaser. An 80-percent purchaser is any purchaser  that, after application of the attribution rules of section 318(a),  other than section 318(a)(4), owns 80 percent or more of the voting  power or value of target stock.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(17)</em> Recently disposed stock. The term recently disposed stock means  any stock in target that is not held by seller, a member of seller's  consolidated group, or an S corporation shareholder immediately after  the close of the disposition date and that was disposed of by seller, a  member of seller's consolidated group, or an S corporation shareholder  during the 12-month disposition period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(18)</em> Nonrecently disposed stock. The term nonrecently disposed stock  means stock in target that is held on the disposition date by a  purchaser or a person related (as described in Sec. 1.336-1(b)(12)) to  the purchaser who owns, on the disposition date, with the application of  section 318(a), other than section 318(a)(4), at least 10 percent of the  total voting power or value of the stock of target and that is not  recently disposed stock.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Nomenclature. For purposes of Sec. Sec. 1.336-1 through 1.336- 5, except as otherwise provided, Parent, Seller, Target, Sub, S  Corporation Target, and Target Subsidiary are domestic corporations and  A, B, C, and D are individuals, none of whom are related to Parent,  Seller, Target, Sub, S Corporation Target, Target Subsidiary, or each  other.
