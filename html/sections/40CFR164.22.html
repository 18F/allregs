                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Concise statement required. Any document containing objections  to an order of the Administrator of his refusal to register, or his  intent to cancel the registration, or change the classification of a  pesticide, shall clearly and concisely set forth such objections and the  basis for each objection, including relevant allegations of fact  concerning the pesticide under consideration. The document shall  indicate the registration number of the pesticide, if applicable, a copy  of the currently accepted and/or proposed labeling and a list of the  currently registered or proposed uses of said pesticide.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amendments to objections byleave. Objections may be amended at  any time prior to the commencement of the public hearing by leave of the  Administrative Law Judge or by written consent of all parties. The  Administrative Law Judge shall freely grant such leave when justice so  requires. If the Administrative Law Judge determines that additional  time is necessary to permit a party to prepare for matters raised by  amendments to objections, the commencement of the hearing shall be  delayed for an appropriate period. This subsection shall not permit the  addition, beyond the statutory deadline, of registered pesticides which  are not included in the objections filed pursuant to paragraph (a) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Amendments to objections as a matter of right. Objections may be  amended as a matter of right within 30 days, or in such time as the  Administrator shall designate, after the Administrator amends his notice  of intent to cancel a registration, change a classification, or his  refusal to register a pesticide.</p>
