Safety is essential to NASA and  is a material part of this contract. NASA's safety priority is to  protect: (1) The public; (2) astronauts and pilots; (3) the NASA  workforce (including contractor employees working on NASA contracts);  and (4) high-value equipment and property. A major breach of safety may  constitute a breach of contract that entitles the Government to exercise  any of its rights and remedies applicable to material parts of this  contract, including termination for default. A major breach of safety  must be related directly to the work on the contract. A major breach of  safety is an act or omission of the Contractor that consists of an  accident, incident, or exposure resulting in a fatality or mission  failure; or in damage to equipment or property equal to or greater than  $1 million; or in any ``willful'' or ``repeat'' violation cited by the  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or by a state  agency operating under an OSHA approved plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Security is the condition of safeguarding against espionage,  sabotage, crime (including computer crime), or attack. A major breach of  security may constitute a breach of contract that entitles the  Government to exercise any of its rights and remedies applicable to  material parts of this contract, including termination for default. A  major breach of security may occur on or off Government installations,  but must be   related directly to the work on the contract. A major breach of security  is an act or omission by the Contractor that results in compromise of  classified information, illegal technology transfer, workplace violence  resulting in criminal conviction, sabotage, compromise or denial of  information technology services, equipment or property damage from  vandalism greater than $250,000, or theft greater than $250,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the event of a major breach of safety or security, the  Contractor shall report the breach to the Contracting Officer. If  directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall conduct its  own investigation and report the results to the Government. The  Contractor shall cooperate with the Government investigation, if  conducted.</p><p class="depth0">Alterate I (FEB 2006) As prescribed in 1823.7001(d)(2), substitute  the following paragraphs (a) and (b) for paragraphs (a) and (b) of the  basic clause:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Safety is the freedom from those conditions that can cause  death, injury, occupational illness, damage to or loss of equipment or  property, or damage to the environment.
