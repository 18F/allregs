                            <p class="depth0">The statement of interest paid and taxes disbursed furnished by the mortgagee to the mortgagor pursuant to Sec. 203.508(c) of this chapter shall include, or be accompanied by, an accounting of the total amount of assistance payments paid by the Secretary and applied to the mortgagor's account during the preceding year. Such accounting will be provided in a manner which indicates (or permits the mortgagor readily to compute) the excess of the total amount of interest payments made during the year over the amount of the assistance payments made by the Secretary. The foregoing accounting shall contain, or be accompanied by, notification regarding the deductibility of interest payments made by the mortgagor in substantially the following language: ``If you itemize deductions on your income tax returns, please read this notice. Under Sec. 1.163-

1(d) of Federal Income Tax Regulations, you, as the borrower, may deduct for Federal income tax purposes only that part, if any, of mortgage interest payments made during the year which exceeded the amount of assistance payments made by HUD during the year. You are urged to contact your tax advisor or State and local tax offices for guidance regarding the deductibility of payments on your State or local income tax returns.''
