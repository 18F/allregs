                            <p class="depth0">The Board has determined that employees must be aware of their NLRA rights in order to exercise those rights effectively. Employers subject to this rule are required to post the employee notice to inform employees of their rights. Failure to post the employee notice may be found to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed by NLRA Section 7, 29 U.S.C. 157, in violation of NLRA Section 8(a)(1), 29 U.S.C. 158(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">Normally, the Board will determine whether an employer is in compliance when a person files an unfair labor practice charge alleging that the employer has failed to post the employee notice required under this part. Filing a charge sets in motion the Board's procedures for investigating and adjudicating alleged unfair labor practices, and for remedying conduct that the Board finds to be unlawful. See NLRA Sections 10-11, 29 U.S.C. 160-61, and 29 CFR part 102, subpart B.</p>
