                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application for specific terms--(1) In general. A person is not required to provide a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer under Sec. 222.72(a) or (c) if the consumer applies for specific material terms and is granted those terms, unless those terms were specified by the person using a consumer report after the consumer applied for or requested credit and after the person obtained the consumer report. For purposes of this section, ``specific material terms'' means a single material term, or set of material terms, such as an annual percentage rate of 10 percent, and not a range of alternatives, such as an annual percentage rate that may be 8, 10, or 12 percent, or between 8 and 12 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A person is not required to provide a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer under Sec. 222.72(a) or (c) if the consumer applies for specific material terms and is granted those terms, unless those terms were specified by the person using a consumer report after the consumer applied for or requested credit and after the person obtained the consumer report. For purposes of this section, ``specific material terms'' means a single material term, or set of material terms, such as an annual percentage rate of 10 percent, and not a range of alternatives, such as an annual percentage rate that may be 8, 10, or 12 percent, or between 8 and 12 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Example. A consumer receives a firm offer of credit from a credit card issuer. The terms of the firm offer are based in whole or in part on information from a consumer report that the credit card issuer obtained under the FCRA's firm offer of credit provisions. The solicitation offers the consumer a credit card with a single purchase annual percentage rate of 12 percent. The consumer applies for and receives a credit card with an annual percentage rate of 12 percent. Other customers

with the same credit card have a purchase annual percentage rate of 10 percent. The exception applies because the consumer applied for specific material terms and was granted those terms. Although the credit card issuer specified the annual percentage rate in the firm offer of credit based in whole or in part on a consumer report, the credit card issuer specified that material term before, not after, the consumer applied for or requested credit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adverse action notice. A person is not required to provide a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer under Sec. 222.72(a), (c), or (d) if the person provides an adverse action notice to the consumer under section 615(a) of the FCRA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Prescreened solicitations--(1) In general. A person is not required to provide a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer under Sec. 222.72(a) or (c) if the person:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A person is not required to provide a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer under Sec. 222.72(a) or (c) if the person:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Obtains a consumer report that is a prescreened list as described in section 604(c)(2) of the FCRA; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Uses the consumer report for the purpose of making a firm offer of credit to the consumer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> More favorable material terms. This exception applies to any firm offer of credit offered by a person to a consumer, even if the person makes other firm offers of credit to other consumers on more favorable material terms.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Example. A credit card issuer obtains two prescreened lists from a consumer reporting agency. One list includes consumers with high credit scores. The other list includes consumers with low credit scores. The issuer mails a firm offer of credit to the high credit score consumers with a single purchase annual percentage rate of 10 percent. The issuer also mails a firm offer of credit to the low credit score consumers with a single purchase annual percentage rate of 14 percent. The credit card issuer is not required to provide a risk-based pricing notice to the low credit score consumers who receive the 14 percent offer because use of a consumer report to make a firm offer of credit does not trigger the risk-based pricing notice requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Loans secured by residential real property--credit score disclosure. (1) In general. A person is not required to provide a risk-based pricing notice to a consumer under Sec. 222.72(a) or (c) if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general.

Use of a graph or statement obtained from the person providing the credit score that meets the requirements of this paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(E) is deemed to comply with this requirement;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> A statement that the consumer is encouraged to verify the accuracy of the information contained in the consumer report and has the right to dispute any inaccurate information in the report;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> A statement that federal law gives the consumer the right to obtain copies of his or her consumer reports directly from the consumer reporting agencies, including a free report from each of the nationwide consumer reporting agencies once during any 12-month period;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> Contact information for the centralized source from which consumers may obtain their free annual consumer reports; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(I)</em> A statement directing consumers to the Web sites of the Federal Reserve Board and Federal Trade Commission to obtain more information about consumer reports.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Form of the notice.
