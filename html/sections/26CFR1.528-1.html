                                Sec. 1.528-1  Homeowners associations.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 528 only applies to taxable years of homeowners associations beginning after December 31, 1973. To qualify as a homeowners association an organization must either be a condominium management association or a residential real estate management association. For the purposes of Section 528 and the regulations under that section, the term homeowners association shall refer only to an organization described in section 528. Cooperative housing corporations and organizations based on a similar form of ownership are not eligible to be taxed as homeowners associations. As a general rule, membership in either a condominium management association or a residential real estate management association is confined to the developers and the owners of the units, residences, or lots. Furthermore, membership in either type of association is normally required as a condition of such ownership. However, if the membership of an organization consists of other homeowners associations, the owners of units, residences, or lots who are members of such other homeowners associations will be treated as the members of the organization for the purposes of the regulations under section 528.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Condominium. The term condominium means an interest in real property consisting of an undivided interest in common in a portion of a parcel of real property (which may be a fee simple estate or an estate for years, such as a leasehold or subleasehold) together with a separate interest in space in a building located on such property. An interest in property is not a condominium unless the undivided interest in the common elements are vested in the unit holders. In addition, a condominium must meet the requirements of applicable state or local law relating to condominiums or horizontal property regimes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Residential real estate management association. Residential real estate

management associations are normally composed of owners of single-family residential units located in a subdivision, development, or similar area. However, they may also include as members, owners of multiple-family dwelling units located in such areas. They are commonly formed to administer and enforce covenants relating to the architecture and appearance of the real estate development as well as to perform certain maintenance duties relating to common areas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Tenants. Tenants will not be considered members for purposes of meeting the source of income test under section 528(c)(1)(B) and Sec. 1.528-5. However, the fact that tenants of members of a homeowners association are permitted to be members of the association will not disqualify an association under section 528(c)(1) if it otherwise meets the requirements of section 528(c) and these regulations.
