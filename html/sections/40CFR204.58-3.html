Manufacturers should prepare the instructions with this purpose in mind. The instructions should be clear and, to the extent practicable, written in non-technical language.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The instructions must not be used to secure an unfair competitive advantage. They should not restrict replacement equipment to original equipment or service to dealer service. Manufacturers who so restrict replacement equipment must make public any performance specifications on such equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For the purpose of encouraging proper maintenance, the manufacturer shall provide a record or log book which shall contain a performance schedule for all required noise emission control maintenance. Space shall be provided in this record book so that the purchaser can note what maintenance was done, by whom, where and when.
