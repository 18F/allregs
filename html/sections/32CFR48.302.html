At or before the time of his retirement, he must submit proof of final dissolution of prior marriages, if any, both for himself and his spouse. The age of the dependents must be substantiated by a birth certificate or other competent evidence. The birth date of a member must be verified by his service record. All required substantiating evidence must be at the disbursing office which would normally pay the member retired pay or retainer pay immediately following retirement so as to permit the establishment of accurate pay accounts and to prevent the creation of indebtedness or overpayments.</p>
