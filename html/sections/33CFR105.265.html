At MARSEC Level 1, the facility owner or operator must ensure the implementation of measures to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unless unsafe to do so, routinely check cargo, cargo transport units, and cargo storage areas within the facility prior to, and during, cargo handling operations for evidence of tampering;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Check that cargo, containers, or other cargo transport units entering the facility match the delivery note or equivalent cargo documentation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Screen vehicles; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Check seals and other methods used to prevent tampering upon entering the facility and upon storage within the facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> MARSEC Level 2. In addition to the security measures required for MARSEC Level 1 in this section, at MARSEC Level 2, the facility owner or operator must also ensure the implementation of additional security measures, as specified for MARSEC Level 2 in the approved FSP.

In addition to the security measures required for MARSEC Level 1 and MARSEC Level 2, at MARSEC Level 3, the facility owner or operator must ensure the implementation of additional security measures, as specified for MARSEC Level 3 in the approved FSP. These additional security measures may include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Restricting or suspending cargo movements or operations within all or part of the facility or specific vessels;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Being prepared to cooperate with responders and vessels; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Verifying the inventory and location of any dangerous goods and hazardous substances, including certain dangerous cargoes, held within the facility and their location.
