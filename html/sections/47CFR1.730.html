                                Sec. 1.730  The Enforcement Bureau's Accelerated Docket.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Parties to formal complaint proceedings against common carriers  within the responsibility of the Enforcement Bureau (see Secs. 0.111,  0.311, 0.314 of this chapter) may request inclusion on the Bureau's  Accelerated Docket. As set out in Secs. 1.720 through 1.736, proceedings  on the Accelerated Docket are subject to shorter pleading deadlines and  certain other procedural rules that do not apply to other formal  complaint proceedings before the Enforcement Bureau.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any party that contemplates filing a formal complaint may submit  a request to the Chief of the Enforcement Bureau's Market Disputes  Resolution Division, either by phone or in writing, seeking inclusion of  its complaint, once filed, on the Accelerated Docket. In appropriate  cases, Commission staff shall schedule and supervise pre-filing  settlement negotiations between the parties to the dispute. If the  parties do not resolve their dispute and the matter is accepted for  handling on the Accelerated Docket, the complainant shall file its  complaint with a letter stating that it has gained admission to the  Accelerated Docket. When it files its complaint, such a complainant  shall also serve a copy of its complaint on the Commission staff that  supervised the pre-filing settlement discussions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Within five days of receiving service of a complaint, any  defendant in a formal complaint proceeding may submit by facsimile or  hand delivery, to the Chief of the Enforcement Bureau's Market Disputes  Resolution Division, a request seeking inclusion of its proceeding on  the Accelerated Docket. Such a defendant contemporaneously   shall transmit, in the same manner, a copy of its request to all parties  to the proceeding. A defendant submitting such a request shall file and  serve its answer in compliance with the requirements of Sec. 1.724(k),  except that the defendant shall not be required to serve with its answer  the automatic document production required by Secs. 1.724(k)(7) and  1.729(i)(1). In proceedings accepted onto the Accelerated Docket at a  defendant's request, the Commission staff will conduct supervised  settlement discussions as appropriate. After accepting such a proceeding  onto the Accelerated Docket, Commission staff will establish a schedule  for the remainder of the proceeding, including the parties'  Sec. 1.729(i)(1) automatic production of documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> During the thirty days following the effective date of these  rules, any party to a pending formal complaint proceeding in which an  answer has been filed or is past due may seek admission of the  proceeding to the Accelerated Docket by submitting a request by  facsimile or hand delivery to the Chief of the Enforcement Bureau's  Market Disputes Resolution Division, with facsimile copies to all other  parties to the proceeding by the same mode of transmission. If a pending  proceeding is accepted onto the Accelerated Docket, Commission staff  will conduct supervised settlement discussions if appropriate and  establish a schedule for the remainder of the proceeding, including the  parties' Sec. 1.729(i)(1) automatic production of documents if  necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In determining whether to admit a proceeding onto the  Accelerated Docket, Commission staff may consider factors from the  following, non-exclusive list:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether it appears that the parties to the dispute have  exhausted the reasonable opportunities for settlement during the staff- supervised settlement discussions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether the expedited resolution of a particular dispute or  category of disputes appears likely to advance competition in the  telecommunications market.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether the issues in the proceeding appear suited for decision  under the constraints of the Accelerated Docket. This factor may entail,  inter alia, examination of the number of distinct issues raised in a  proceeding, the likely complexity of the necessary discovery, and  whether the complainant bifurcates any damages claims for decision in a  separate proceeding. See Sec. 1.722(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Whether the complainant states a claim for violation of the Act,  or Commission rule or order that falls within the Commission's  jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Whether it appears that inclusion of a proceeding on the  Accelerated Docket would be unfair to one party because of an  overwhelming disparity in the parties' resources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Such other factors as the Commission staff, within its  substantial discretion, may deem appropriate and conducive to the prompt  and fair adjudication of complaint proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If it appears at any time that a proceeding on the Accelerated  Docket is no longer appropriate for such treatment, Commission staff may  remove the matter from the Accelerated Docket either on its own motion  or at the request of any party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Minitrials.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In Accelerated Docket proceedings, the Commission may conduct a  minitrial, or hearing-type proceeding, as an alternative to requiring  that parties submit briefs in support of their cases. Minitrials  typically will take place between 40 and 45 days after the filing of the  complaint. A Commission Administrative Law Judge (``ALJ'') typically  will preside at the minitrial, administer oaths to witnesses, and time  the parties' presentation of their cases. In consultation with the  Commission staff, the ALJ will rule on objections or procedural issues  that may arise during the course of the minitrial.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Before a minitrial, each party will receive a specific time  allotment in which it may present evidence and make argument during the  minitrial. The ALJ or other Commission staff presiding at the minitrial  will deduct from each party's time allotment any time that the party  spends presenting either evidence or argument during the proceeding. The  presiding official shall have broad discretion in determining   any time penalty or deduction for a party who appears to be  intentionally delaying either the proceeding or the presentation of  another party's case. Within the limits imposed by its time allotment, a  party may present evidence and argument in whatever manner or format it  chooses, provided, however, that the submission of written testimony  shall not be permitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Three days before a minitrial, each party to a proceeding shall  serve on all other parties a copy of all exhibits that the party intends  to introduce during the minitrial and a list of all witnesses, including  expert witnesses, that the party may call during the minitrial. Service  of this material shall be accomplished either by hand or by facsimile  transmission. Objections to any exhibits or proposed witness testimony  will be heard before the beginning of the minitrial.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> for good cause  shown.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Two days before the beginning of the minitrial, parties shall  file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. These submissions  shall not exceed 40 pages per party. Within three days after the  conclusion of the minitrial, parties may submit revised proposed  findings of fact and conclusions of law to meet evidence introduced or  arguments raised at the minitrial. These submissions shall not exceed 20  pages per party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The parties shall arrange for the stenographic transcription of  minitrial proceedings so that transcripts are available and filed with  the Commission no more than three days after the conclusion of the  minitrial. Absent an agreement to the contrary, the cost of the  transcript shall be shared equally between the parties to the  proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Applications for review of staff decisions issued on delegated  authority in Accelerated Docket proceedings shall comply with the filing  and service requirements in Sec. 1.115(e)(4). In those Accelerated  Docket proceedings which raise issues that may not be decided on  delegated authority (see 47 U.S.C. 155(c)(1); 47 CFR 0.291(d)), the  staff decision issued after the minitrial will be a recommended decision  subject to adoption or modification by the Commission. Any party to the  proceeding that seeks modification of the recommended decision may do so  by filing comments challenging the decision within 15 days of its  release by the Commission's Office of Media Relations. (Compare  Sec. 1.4(b)(2).) Opposition comments may be filed within 15 days of the  comments challenging the decision; reply comments may be filed 10 days  thereafter and shall be limited to issues raised in the opposition  comments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If no party files comments challenging the recommended decision,  the Commission will issue its decision adopting or modifying the  recommended decision within 45 days of its release. If parties to the  proceeding file comments to the recommended decision, the Commission  will issue its decision adopting or modifying the recommended decision  within 30 days of the filing of the final comments.
