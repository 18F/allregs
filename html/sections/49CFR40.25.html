                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Yes, as an employer, you must, after obtaining an employee's  written consent, request the information about the employee listed in  paragraph (b) of this section. This requirement applies only to  employees seeking to begin performing safety-sensitive duties for you  for the first time (i.e., a new hire, an employee transfers into a  safety-sensitive position). If the employee refuses to provide this  written consent, you must not permit the employee to perform safety- sensitive functions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>  from DOT-regulated employers who have employed the employee during any  period during the two years before the date of the employee's  application or transfer:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Alcohol tests with a result of 0.04 or higher alcohol  concentration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Verified positive drug tests;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Refusals to be tested (including verified adulterated or  substituted drug test results);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Other violations of DOT agency drug and alcohol testing  regulations; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> With respect to any employee who violated a DOT drug and alcohol  regulation, documentation of the employee's successful completion of DOT  return-to-duty requirements (including follow-up tests). If the previous  employer does not have information about the return-do-duty process  (e.g., an employer who did not hire an employee who tested positive on a  pre-employment test), you must seek to obtain this information from the  employee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The information obtained from a previous employer includes any  drug or alcohol test information obtained from previous employers under  this section or other applicable DOT agency regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If feasible, you must obtain and review this information before  the employee first performs safety-sensitive functions. If this is not  feasible, you must obtain and review the information as soon as  possible. However, you must not permit the employee to perform safety- sensitive functions after 30 days from the date on which the employee  first performed safety-sensitive functions, unless you have obtained or  made and documented a good faith effort to obtain this information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If you obtain information that the employee has violated a DOT  agency drug and alcohol regulation, you must not use the employee to  perform safety-sensitive functions unless you also obtain information  that the employee   has subsequently complied with the return-to-duty requirements of  Subpart O of this part and DOT agency drug and alcohol regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> You must provide to each of the employers from whom you request  information under paragraph (b) of this section written consent for the  release of the information cited in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The release of information under this section must be in any  written form (e.g., fax, e-mail, letter) that ensures confidentiality.  As the previous employer, you must maintain a written record of the  information released, including the date, the party to whom it was  released, and a summary of the information provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If you are an employer from whom information is requested under  paragraph (b) of this section, you must, after reviewing the employee's  specific, written consent, immediately release the requested information  to the employer making the inquiry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> As the employer requesting the information required under this  section, you must maintain a written, confidential record of the  information you obtain or of the good faith efforts you made to obtain  the information. You must retain this information for three years from  the date of the employee's first performance of safety-sensitive duties  for you.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> As the employer, you must also ask the employee whether he or  she has tested positive, or refused to test, on any pre-employment drug  or alcohol test administered by an employer to which the employee  applied for, but did not obtain, safety-sensitive transportation work  covered by DOT agency drug and alcohol testing rules during the past two  years. If the employee admits that he or she had a positive test or a  refusal to test, you must not use the employee to perform safety- sensitive functions for you, until and unless the employee documents  successful completion of the return-to-duty process (see paragraphs  (b)(5) and (e) of this section).</p>
