                            <p class="depth0">The Bureau of Prisons recognizes the desirability of establishing a  policy that affords the public information about its operations via the  news media. Representatives of the news media (see Sec. 540.2) may visit  institutions for the purpose of preparing reports about the institution,  programs, and activities. It is not the intent of this rule to provide  publicity for an inmate or special privileges for the news media, but  rather to insure a better informed public. The Bureau of Prisons also  has a responsibility to protect the privacy and other rights of inmates  and members of the staff. Therefore, an interview in an institution must  be regulated to insure the orderly and safe operation of the  institution.</p>
