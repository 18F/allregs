                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whenever a DOL agency is holding funds of a debtor from which  administrative offset is sought by another DOL agency or other Federal  agency, the DOL agency holding funds should not initiate the requested  offset until it has been provided by the creditor organization with an  appropriate written certification that the debtor owes a debt (including  the amount) and that applicable provisions of the Federal Claims  Collection Standards have been fully complied with.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Moreover, the DOL agency holding funds of the debtor should  determine whether collection by offset   would be in the best interests of the United States; for example, if the  debtor is a contractor for the DOL agency holding funds, whether  administrative offset would impair the contractor's ability to perform  under the terms of the contract. The creditor organization should be  notified promptly of the determination.</p>
