                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prohibited charges. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this  section, a long-term care hospital may not charge a beneficiary for any  covered services for which payment is made by Medicare, even if the  hospital's costs of furnishing services to that beneficiary are greater  than the amount the hospital is paid under the prospective payment  system. If Medicare has paid at the full LTCH prospective payment system  standard Federal payment rate, that payment applies to the hospital's  costs for services furnished until the high-cost outlier threshold is  met. If Medicare pays less than the full LTCH prospective payment system  standard Federal payment rate and payment was not made at the site  neutral payment rate, that payment only applies to the hospital's costs  for those costs or days used to calculate the Medicare payment. If  Medicare has paid at the full site neutral payment rate, that payment  applies to the hospital's costs for services furnished until the high- cost outlier is met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Permitted charges. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A long-term care hospital that receives a  payment at the full LTCH prospective payment system standard Federal  payment rate or the site neutral payment rate may only charge the  Medicare beneficiary for the applicable deductible and coinsurance  amounts under Sec.

Sec. 409.82, 409.83, and 409.87 of  this chapter, for items and services as specified under Sec. 489.20(a)  of this chapter, and for services provided during the stay that were not  the basis for the short-stay adjusted payment.
