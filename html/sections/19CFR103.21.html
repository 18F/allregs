For purposes of this subpart, the term ``CBP employee'' includes all present and former officers and employees of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> CBP documents.

The failure of any CBP employee to follow the procedures specified in this subpart neither creates nor confers any rights, privileges, or benefits on any person or party.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In camera inspection of records. Nothing in this subpart authorizes CBP personnel to withhold records from a federal court, whether civil or criminal, pursuant to its order for such records appropriately made, for purposes of in camera inspection of the records to determine the propriety of claimed exemption(s) from disclosure.
