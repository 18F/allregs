In addition, administrative offset may not be used when a statute explicitly prohibits its use to collect the claim or type of claim involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unless otherwise provided, debts or payments not subject to administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 may be collected by administrative offset under common law, or any other applicable statutory authority.</p>
