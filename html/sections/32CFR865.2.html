In appropriate cases, it directs correction of military records to remove an error or injustice, or recommends such correction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Recommending action. When an applicant alleges reprisal under the Military Whistleblowers Protection Act, 10 U.S.C. 1034, the Board may recommend to the Secretary of the Air Force that disciplinary or administrative action be taken against those responsible for the reprisal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Deciding cases. The Board normally decides cases on the evidence of the record. It is not an investigative body. However, the Board may, in its discretion, hold a hearing or call for
