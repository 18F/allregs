                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following circumstances shall be cause for initiation of proceedings under this part for withdrawal of approval of a State plan, or any portion thereof.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whenever the Assistant Secretary determines that under Sec. 1902.2(b) of this chapter a State has not substantially completed the developmental steps of its plan at the end of three years from the date of commencement of operations, a withdrawal proceeding shall be instituted. Examples of a lack of substantial completion of developmental steps include but are not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A failure to develop the necessary regulations and administrative guidelines for an ``at least as effective'' enforcement program;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Failure to promulgate all or a majority of the occupational safety and health standards in an issue covered by the plan; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Failure to enact the required enabling legislation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whenever the Assistant Secretary determines that there is no longer a reasonable expectation that a State plan will meet the criteria of Sec. 1902.3 of this chapter involving the completion of developmental steps within the three year period immediately following commencement of operations, a withdrawal proceeding shall be instituted. Examples of a lack of reasonable expectation include but are not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A failure to enact enabling legislation in the first two years following commencement of operations where the remaining developmental steps are dependent on the passage of enabling legislation and cannot be completed within one year; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Repeal or substantial amendment of the enabling legislation by the State legislature so that the State program fails to meet the criteria in Sec. 1902.3 of this chapter; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Inability to complete the developmental steps within the indicated three year period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whenever the Assistant Secretary determines that in the operation or administration of a State plan, or as a result of any modifications to a plan, there is a failure to comply substantially with any provision of the plan, including assurances contained in the plan, a withdrawal proceeding shall be instituted in a State which has received final approval under section 18(e) of the Act, and may be instituted in a State which has received initial approval under section 18(c) of the Act.

Examples of a lack of substantial compliance include but are not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Where a State over a period of time consistently fails to provide effective enforcement of standards;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where the rights of employees are circumscribed in such a manner as to diminish the effectiveness of the program;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Where a State, without good cause, fails to continue to maintain its program in accordance with the appropriate changes in the Federal program;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Where a State fails to comply with the required assurances on a sufficient number of qualified personnel and/or adequate resources for administration and enforcement of the program; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Where, on the basis of actual operations, the Assistant Secretary determines that the criteria in section 18(c) of the Act are not being met, that the period of concurrent authority under section 18(e) of the Act should not be extended, and that final approval under section 18(e) of the Act should not be given.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A State may, at any time both before or after a determination under section 18(e) of the Act, voluntarily withdraw its plan, or any portion thereof, by notifying the Assistant Secretary in writing setting forth the reasons for such withdrawal. Such notification shall be accompanied by a letter terminating the application for related grants authorized under section 23(g) of the Act in accordance with 29 CFR 1951.25(d). Upon receipt of the State notice the Assistant Secretary shall cause to be published in the Federal Register a notice of withdrawal of approval of the State plan or portion thereof (see Montana notice 39 FR 2361, June 27, 1974).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Approval of a portion of a plan may be withdrawn under any of the paragraphs in this section when it is determined that that portion is reasonably separable from the remainder of the plan in a manner consistent with the provisions in Sec. 1902.2(c) of this chapter defining the scope of a State plan. As an example, such a partial withdrawal of approval would be considered appropriate where a State fails to adopt, without good cause shown, Federal standards within a separable issue, such as occupational health.
