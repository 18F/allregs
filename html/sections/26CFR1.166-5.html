                                Sec. 1.166-5  Nonbusiness debts.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> or section 166(c) in determining the taxable income of a  taxpayer other than a corporation. See section 166(d)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(A)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If, in the case of a taxpayer other than a corporation, a  nonbusiness debt becomes wholly worthless within the taxable year, the  loss resulting therefrom shall be treated as a loss from the sale or  exchange, during the taxable year, of a capital asset held for not more  than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months  for taxable years beginning in 1977). Such a loss is subject to the  limitations provided in section 1211, relating to the limitation on  capital losses, and section 1212, relating to the capital loss  carryover, and in the regulations under those sections. A loss on a  nonbusiness debt shall be treated as sustained only if and when the debt  has become totally worthless, and no deduction shall be allowed for a  nonbusiness debt which is recoverable in part during the taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nonbusiness debt defined. For purposes of section 166 and this  section, a nonbusiness debt is any debt other than--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A debt which is created, or acquired, in the course of a trade  or business of the taxpayer, determined without regard to the  relationship of the debt to a trade or business of the taxpayer at the  time when the debt becomes worthless; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(C)</em>. See Sec. 1.165-5, relating to losses on worthless  securities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Guaranty of obligations. For provisions treating a loss  sustained by a guarantor of obligations as a loss resulting from the  worthlessness of a debt, see Sec. Sec. 1.166-8 and 1.166-9.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The application of this section may be illustrated by  the following examples involving a case where A, an individual who is  engaged in the grocery business and who makes his return on the basis of  the calendar year, extends credit to B in 1955 on an open account:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. In 1956 A sells the business but retains the claim  against B. The claim becomes worthless in A's hands in 1957. A's loss is  not controlled by the nonbusiness debt provisions, since the original  consideration has been advanced by A in his trade or business.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. In 1956 A sells the business to C but sells the claim  against B to the taxpayer, D. The claim becomes worthless in D's hands  in 1957. During 1956 and 1957, D is not engaged in any trade or  business. D's loss is controlled by the nonbusiness debt provisions even  though the original consideration has been advanced by A in his trade or  business, since the debt has not been created or acquired in connection  with a trade or business of D and since in 1957 D is not engaged in a  trade or business incident to the conduct of which a loss from the  worthlessness of such claim is a proximate result.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. In 1956 A dies, leaving the business, including the  accounts receivable, to his son, C, the taxpayer. The claim against B  becomes worthless in C's hands in 1957. C's loss is not controlled by  the nonbusiness debt provisions. While C does not advance any  consideration for the claim, or create or acquire it in connection with  his trade or business, the loss is sustained as a proximate incident to  the conduct of the trade or business in which he is engaged at the time  the debt becomes worthless.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. In 1956 A dies, leaving the business to his son, C, but  leaving the claim against B to his son, D, the taxpayer. The claim  against B becomes worthless in D's hands in 1957. During 1956 and 1957,  D is not engaged in any trade or business. D's loss is controlled by the  nonbusiness debt provisions even though the original consideration has  been advanced by A in his trade or business, since the debt has not been  created or acquired in connection with a trade or business of D and  since in 1957 D is not engaged in a trade or business incident to the  conduct of which a loss from the worthlessness of such claim is a  proximate result.</p><p class="depth2">Example 5. In 1956 A dies; and, while his executor, C, is carrying  on the business, the claim against B becomes worthless in 1957. The loss  sustained by A's estate is not controlled by the nonbusiness debt  provisions. While C does not advance any consideration for the claim on  behalf of the estate, or create or acquire it in connection with a trade  or business in which the estate is engaged, the loss is sustained as a  proximate incident to the conduct of the trade or business in which the  estate is engaged at the time the debt becomes worthless.</p><p class="depth2">Example 6. In 1956, A, in liquidating the business, attempts to  collect the claim against B but finds that it has become worthless. A's  loss is not controlled by the nonbusiness debt provisions, since the  original consideration has been advanced by A in his trade or business  and since a loss incurred in liquidating a trade or business is a  proximate incident to the conduct thereof.
