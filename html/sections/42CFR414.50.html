time the billing physician or other supplier submits a claim for a service furnished by the performing physician, the billing physician or other supplier has a reasonable belief that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For the 12 months prior to and including the month in which the service was performed, the performing physician furnished substantially all of his or her professional services through the billing physician or other supplier; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The performing physician will furnish substantially all of his or her professional services through the billing physician or other supplier for the next 12 months (including the month in which the service is performed).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A physician will be deemed to share a practice with the billing physician or other supplier with respect to the performance of the TC or PC of a diagnostic test if the physician is an owner, employee or independent contractor of the billing physician or other supplier and the TC or PC is performed in the office of the billing physician or other supplier. The ``office of the billing physician or other supplier'' is any medical office space, regardless of number of locations, in which the ordering physician or other ordering supplier regularly furnishes patient care, and includes space where the billing physician or other supplier furnishes diagnostic testing, if the space is located in the same building (as defined in Sec. 411.351) in which the ordering physician or other ordering supplier regularly furnishes patient care. With respect to a billing physician or other supplier that is a physician organization (as defined in Sec. 411.351 of this chapter), the ``office of the billing physician or other supplier'' is space in which the ordering physician provides substantially the full range of patient care services that the ordering physician provides generally.
