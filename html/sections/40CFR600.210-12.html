Except as specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, fuel economy and CO2 emissions for general labels may be determined by one of two methods. The first is based on vehicle-specific model-type 5-cycle data as determined in Sec. 600.209-12(b). This method is available for all vehicles and is required for vehicles that do not qualify for the second method as described in Sec. 600.115 (other than electric vehicles). The second method, the derived 5-cycle method, determines fuel economy and CO2 emissions values from the FTP and HFET tests using equations that are derived from vehicle-specific 5-cycle model type data, as determined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Manufacturers may voluntarily lower fuel economy values and raise CO2 values if they determine that the label values from any method are not representative of the fuel economy and CO2 emissions for that model type. MPG values may not be lowered without also making a corresponding change to the CO2 value for a model type.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Vehicle-specific 5-cycle labels.
