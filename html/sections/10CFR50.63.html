                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each light-water-cooled nuclear power plant  licensed to operate under this part, each light-water-cooled nuclear  power plant licensed under subpart C of 10 CFR part 52 after the  Commission makes the finding under Sec. 52.103(g) of this chapter, and  each design for a light-water-cooled nuclear power plant approved under  a standard design approval,   standard design certification, and manufacturing license under part 52  of this chapter must be able to withstand for a specified duration and  recover from a station blackout as defined in Sec. 50.2. The specified  station blackout duration shall be based on the following factors:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The redundancy of the onsite emergency ac power sources;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The reliability of the onsite emergency ac power sources;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The expected frequency of loss of offsite power; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The probable time needed to restore offsite power.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The reactor core and associated coolant, control, and protection  systems, including station batteries and any other necessary support  systems, must provide sufficient capacity and capability to ensure that  the core is cooled and appropriate containment integrity is maintained  in the event of a station blackout for the specified duration. The  capability for coping with a station blackout of specified duration  shall be determined by an appropriate coping analysis. Licensees are  expected to have the baseline assumptions, analyses, and related  information used in their coping evaluations available for NRC review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Limitation of scope. Paragraph (c) of this section does not  apply to those plants licensed to operate prior to July 21, 1988, if the  capability to withstand station blackout was specifically addressed in  the operating license proceeding and was explicitly approved by the NRC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Implementation--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Information Submittal. For each light-water- cooled nuclear power plant licensed to operate on or before July 21,  1988, the licensee shall submit the information defined below to the  Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation by April 17, 1989.  For each light-water-cooled nuclear power plant licensed to operate  after July 21, 1988, but before September 27, 2007, the licensee shall  submit the information defined in this section to the Director of the  Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, by 270 days after the date of  license issuance. For each light-water-cooled nuclear power plant  operating license application submitted after September 27, 2007, the  applicant shall submit the information defined below in its final safety  analysis report.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A proposed station blackout duration to be used in determining  compliance with paragraph (a) of this section, including a justification  for the selection based on the four factors identified in paragraph (a)  of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A description of the procedures that will be implemented for  station blackout events for the duration determined in paragraph  (c)(1)(i) of this section and for recovery therefrom; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A list of modifications to equipment and associated  procedures, if any, necessary to meet the requirements of paragraph (a)  of this section, for the specified station blackout duration determined  in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, and a proposed schedule for  implementing the stated modifications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Alternate ac source: The alternate ac power source(s), as  defined in Sec. 50.2, will constitute acceptable capability to  withstand station blackout provided an analysis is performed which  demonstrates that the plant has this capability from onset of the  station blackout until the alternate ac source(s) and required shutdown  equipment are started and lined up to operate. The time required for  startup and alignment of the alternate ac power source(s) and this  equipment shall be demonstrated by test. Alternate ac source(s) serving  a multiple unit site where onsite emergency ac sources are not shared  between units must have, as a minimum, the capacity and capability for  coping with a station blackout in any of the units. At sites where  onsite emergency ac sources are shared between units, the alternate ac  source(s) must have the capacity and capability as required to ensure  that all units can be brought to and maintained in safe shutdown (non- DBA) as defined in Sec. 50.2. If the alternate ac source(s) meets the  above requirements and can be demonstrated by test to be available to  power the shutdown buses within 10 minutes of the onset of station  blackout, then no coping analysis is required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Regulatory Assessment: After consideration of the information  submitted in accordance with paragraph   (c)(1) of this section, the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor  Regulation, will notify the licensee of the Director's conclusions  regarding the adequacy of the proposed specified station blackout  duration, the proposed equipment modifications and procedures, and the  proposed schedule for implementing the procedures and modifications for  compliance with paragraph (a) this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Implementation Schedule: For each light-water-cooled nuclear  power plant licensed to operate on or before June 21, 1988, the licensee  shall, within 30 days of the notification provided in accordance with  paragraph (c)(3) of this section, submit to the Director of the Office  of Nuclear Reactor Regulation a schedule commitment for implementing any  equipment and associated procedure modifications necessary to meet the  requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. This submittal must  include an explanation of the schedule and a justification if the  schedule does not provide for completion of the modifications within two  years of the notification provided in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)  of this section. A final schedule for implementing modifications  necessary to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this  section will be established by the NRC staff in consultation and  coordination with the affected licensee.
