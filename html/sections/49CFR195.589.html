Appendix A to Part 195--Delineation Between Federal and State</p><p class="depth0">Jurisdiction--Statement of Agency Policy and Interpretation</p><p class="depth0">In 1979, Congress enacted comprehensive safety legislation governing  the transportation of hazardous liquids by pipeline, the Hazardous  Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, 49 U.S.C. 2001 et seq. (HLPSA). The  HLPSA expanded the existing statutory authority for safety regulation,  which was limited to transportation by common carriers in interstate and  foreign commerce, to transportation through facilities used in or  affecting interstate or foreign commerce. It also added civil penalty,  compliance order, and injunctive enforcement authorities to the existing  criminal sanctions. Modeled largely on the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety  Act of 1968, 49 U.S.C. 1671 et seq. (NGPSA), the HLPSA provides for a  national hazardous liquid pipeline safety program with nationally  uniform minimal standards and with enforcement administered through a  Federal-State partnership. The HLPSA leaves to exclusive Federal  regulation and enforcement the ``interstate pipeline facilities,'' those  used for the pipeline transportation of hazardous liquids in interstate  or foreign commerce. For the remainder of the pipeline facilities,  denominated ``intrastate pipeline facilities,'' the HLPSA provides that  the same Federal regulation and enforcement will apply unless a State  certifies that it will assume those responsibilities. A certified State  must adopt the same minimal standards but may adopt additional more  stringent standards so long as they are compatible. Therefore, in States  which participate in the hazardous liquid pipeline safety program  through certification, it is necessary to distinguish the interstate  from the intrastate pipeline facilities.</p><p class="depth0">In deciding that an administratively practical approach was  necessary in distinguishing between interstate and intrastate liquid  pipeline facilities and in determining how best to accomplish this, DOT  has logically examined the approach used in the NGPSA. The NGPSA defines  the interstate gas pipeline facilities subject to exclusive Federal  jurisdiction as those subject to the economic regulatory jurisdiction of  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Experience has proven  this approach practical. Unlike the NGPSA however, the HLPSA has no  specific reference to FERC jurisdiction, but instead defines interstate  liquid pipeline facilities by the more commonly used means of specifying  the end points of the transportation involved. For example, the economic  regulatory jurisdiction of FERC over the transportation of both gas and  liquids by pipeline is defined in much the same way. In implementing the  HLPSA DOT has sought a practicable means of distinguishing between  interstate and intrastate pipeline facilities that provide the requisite  degree of certainty to Federal and State enforcement personnel and to  the regulated entities. DOT intends that this statement of agency policy  and interpretation provide that certainty.</p><p class="depth0">In 1981, DOT decided that the inventory of liquid pipeline  facilities identified as subject to the jurisdiction of FERC  approximates the HLPSA category of ``interstate pipeline facilities.''  Administrative use of the FERC inventory has the added benefit of  avoiding the creation of a separate Federal scheme for determination of  jurisdiction over the same regulated entities. DOT recognizes that the  FERC inventory is only an approximation and may not be totally  satisfactory without some modification. The difficulties stem from some  significant differences in the economic regulation of liquid and of  natural gas pipelines. There is an affirmative assertion of jurisdiction  by FERC over natural gas pipelines through the issuance of certificates  of public convenience and necessity prior to   commencing operations. With liquid pipelines, there is only a rebuttable  presumption of jurisdiction created by the filing by pipeline operators  of tariffs (or concurrences) for movement of liquids through existing  facilities. Although FERC does police the filings for such matters as  compliance with the general duties of common carriers, the question of  jurisdiction is normally only aired upon complaint. While any person,  including State or Federal agencies, can avail themselves of the FERC  forum by use of the complaint process, that process has only been rarely  used to review jurisdictional matters (probably because of the  infrequency of real disputes on the issue). Where the issue has arisen,  the reviewing body has noted the need to examine various criteria  primarily of an economic nature. DOT believes that, in most cases, the  formal FERC forum can better receive and evaluate the type of  information that is needed to make decisions of this nature than can  DOT.</p><p class="depth0">In delineating which liquid pipeline facilities are interstate  pipeline facilities within the meaning of the HLPSA, DOT will generally  rely on the FERC filings; that is, if there is a tariff or concurrence  filed with FERC governing the transportation of hazardous liquids over a  pipeline facility or if there has been an exemption from the obligation  to file tariffs obtained from FERC, then DOT will, as a general rule,  consider the facility to be an interstate pipeline facility within the  meaning of the HLPSA. The types of situations in which DOT will ignore  the existence or non-existence of a filing with FERC will be limited to  those cases in which it appears obvious that a complaint filed with FERC  would be successful or in which blind reliance on a FERC filing would  result in a situation clearly not intended by the HLPSA such as a  pipeline facility not being subject to either State or Federal safety  regulation. DOT anticipates that the situations in which there is any  question about the validity of the FERC filings as a ready reference  will be few and that the actual variations from reliance on those  filings will be rare. The following examples indicate the types of  facilities which DOT believes are interstate pipeline facilities subject  to the HLPSA despite the lack of a filing with FERC and the types of  facilities over which DOT will generally defer to the jurisdiction of a  certifying state despite the existence of a filing with FERC.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Pipeline company P operates a pipeline from ``Point A''  located in State X to ``Point B'' (also in X). The physical facilities  never cross a state line and do not connect with any other pipeline  which does cross a state line. Pipeline company P also operates another  pipeline between ``Point C'' in State X and ``Point D'' in an adjoining  State Y. Pipeline company P files a tariff with FERC for transportation  from ``Point A'' to ``Point B'' as well as for transportation from  ``Point C'' to ``Point D.'' DOT will ignore filing for the line from  ``Point A'' to ``Point B'' and consider the line to be intrastate.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Same as in example 1 except that P does not file any  tariffs with FERC. DOT will assume jurisdiction of the line between  ``Point C'' and ``Point D.''</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Same as in example 1 except that P files its tariff for  the line between ``Point C'' and ``Point D'' not only with FERC but also  with State X. DOT will rely on the FERC filing as indication of  interstate commerce.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Same as in example 1 except that the pipeline from  ``Point A'' to ``Point B'' (in State X) connects with a pipeline  operated by another company transports liquid between ``Point B'' (in  State X) and ``Point D'' (in State Y). DOT will rely on the FERC filing  as indication of interstate commerce.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Same as in example 1 except that the line between ``Point  C'' and ``Point D'' has a lateral line connected to it. The lateral is  located entirely with State X. DOT will rely on the existence or non- existence of a FERC filing covering transportation over that lateral as  determinative of interstate commerce.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Same as in example 1 except that the certified agency in  State X has brought an enforcement action (under the pipeline safety  laws) against P because of its operation of the line between ``Point A''  and ``Point B''. P has successfully defended against the action on  jurisdictional grounds. DOT will assume jurisdiction if necessary to  avoid the anomaly of a pipeline subject to neither State or Federal  safety enforcement. DOT's assertion of jurisdiction in such a case would  be based on the gap in the state's enforcement authority rather than a  DOT decision that the pipeline is an interstate pipeline facility.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Pipeline Company P operates a pipeline that originates on  the Outer Continental Shelf. P does not file any tariff for that line  with FERC. DOT will consider the pipeline to be an interstate pipeline  facility.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Pipeline Company P is constructing a pipeline from  ``Point C'' (in State X) to ``Point D'' (in State Y). DOT will consider  the pipeline to be an interstate pipeline facility.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. Pipeline company P is constructing a pipeline from  ``Point C'' to ``Point E'' (both in State X) but intends to file tariffs  with FERC in the transportation of hazardous liquid in interstate  commerce. Assuming there is some connection to an interstate pipeline  facility, DOT will consider this line to be an interstate pipeline  facility.</p><p class="depth0">Example 10. Pipeline Company P has operated a pipeline subject to  FERC economic   regulation. Solely because of some statutory economic deregulation, that  pipeline is no longer regulated by FERC. DOT will continue to consider  that pipeline to be an interstate pipeline facility.</p><p class="depth0">As seen from the examples, the types of situations in which DOT will  not defer to the FERC regulatory scheme are generally clear-cut cases.  For the remainder of the situations where variation from the FERC scheme  would require DOT to replicate the forum already provided by FERC and to  consider economic factors better left to that agency, DOT will decline  to vary its reliance on the FERC filings unless, of course, not doing so  would result in situations clearly not intended by the HLPSA.  [Amdt. 195-33, 50 FR 15899, Apr. 23, 1985]    Sec. Appendix B to Part 195--Risk-Based Alternative to Pressure Testing</p><p class="depth0">Older Hazardous Liquid and Carbon Dioxide Pipelines</p><p class="depth0">Risk-Based Alternative</p><p class="depth0">This Appendix provides guidance on how a risk-based alternative to  pressure testing older hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines  rule allowed by Sec. 195.303 will work. This risk-based alternative  establishes test priorities for older pipelines, not previously pressure  tested, based on the inherent risk of a given pipeline segment. The  first step is to determine the classification based on the type of pipe  or on the pipeline segment's proximity to populated or environmentally  sensitive area. Secondly, the classifications must be adjusted based on  the pipeline failure history, product transported, and the release  volume potential.</p><p class="depth0">Tables 2-6 give definitions of risk classification A, B, and C  facilities. For the purposes of this rule, pipeline segments containing  high risk electric resistance-welded pipe (ERW pipe) and lapwelded pipe  manufactured prior to 1970 and considered a risk classification C or B  facility shall be treated as the top priority for testing because of the  higher risk associated with the susceptibility of this pipe to  longitudinal seam failures.</p><p class="depth0">In all cases, operators shall annually, at intervals not to exceed  15 months, review their facilities to reassess the classification and  shall take appropriate action within two years or operate the pipeline  system at a lower pressure. Pipeline failures, changes in the  characteristics of the pipeline route, or changes in service should all  trigger a reassessment of the originally classification.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1 explains different levels of test requirements depending on  the inherent risk of a given pipeline segment. The overall risk  classification is determined based on the type of pipe involved, the  facility's location, the product transported, the relative volume of  flow and pipeline failure history as determined from Tables 2-6.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1.

Appendix C to Part 195--Guidance for Implementation of an Integrity</p><p class="depth0">Management Program</p><p class="depth0">This Appendix gives guidance to help an operator implement the  requirements of the integrity management program rule in Secs. 195.450  and 195.452.

Identifying a high consequence area and factors for considering a  pipeline segment's potential impact on a high consequence area.</p><p class="depth0">A. The rule defines a High Consequence Area as a high population  area, an other populated area, an unusually sensitive area, or a  commercially navigable waterway. The Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS)  will map these areas on the National Pipeline Mapping System (NPMS). An  operator, member of the public or other government agency may view and  download the data from the NPMS home page http://www.npms.phmsa.gov/.  OPS will maintain the NPMS and update it periodically. However, it is an  operator's responsibility to ensure that it has identified all high  consequence areas that could be affected by a pipeline segment. An  operator is also responsible for periodically evaluating its pipeline  segments to look for population or environmental changes that may have  occurred around the pipeline and to keep its program current with this  information. (Refer to Sec. 195.452(d)(3).)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Digital Data on populated areas available on U.S. Census Bureau  maps.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Geographic Database on the commercial navigable waterways  available on http://www.bts.gov/gis/ntatlas/networks.html.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Bureau of Transportation Statistics database that includes  commercially navigable waterways and non-commercially navigable  waterways. The database can be downloaded from the BTS website at http:/ /www.bts.gov/gis/ntatlas/networks.html.</p><p class="depth0">B. The rule requires an operator to include a process in its program  for identifying which pipeline segments could affect a high consequence  area and to take measures to prevent and mitigate the consequences of a  pipeline failure that could affect a high consequence area. (See  Secs. 195.452 (f) and (i).) Thus, an operator will need to consider how  each pipeline segment could affect a high consequence area. The primary  source for the listed risk factors is a US DOT study on instrumented  Internal Inspection devices (November 1992). Other sources include the  National Transportation Safety Board, the Environmental Protection  Agency and the Technical Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Standards  Committee. The following list provides guidance to an operator on both  the mandatory and additional factors:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Terrain surrounding the pipeline. An operator should consider  the contour of the land profile and if it could allow the liquid from a  release to enter a high consequence area. An operator can get this  information from topographical maps such as U.S. Geological Survey  quadrangle maps.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Drainage systems such as small streams and other smaller  waterways that could serve as a conduit to a high consequence area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Crossing of farm tile fields. An operator should consider the  possibility of a spillage in the field following the drain tile into a  waterway.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Crossing of roadways with ditches along the side. The ditches  could carry a spillage to a waterway.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The nature and characteristics of the product the pipeline is  transporting (refined products, crude oils, highly volatile liquids,  etc.) Highly volatile liquids becomes gaseous when exposed to the  atmosphere. A spillage could create a vapor cloud that could settle into  the lower elevation of the ground profile.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Physical support of the pipeline segment such as by a cable  suspension bridge. An operator should look for stress indicators on the  pipeline (strained supports, inadequate support at towers), atmospheric  corrosion, vandalism, and other obvious signs of improper maintenance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Operating conditions of the pipeline (pressure, flow rate,  etc.). Exposure of the pipeline to an operating pressure exceeding the  established maximum operating pressure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The hydraulic gradient of the pipeline.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The diameter of the pipeline, the potential release volume, and  the distance between the isolation points.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Potential physical pathways between the pipeline and the high  consequence area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Response capability (time to respond, nature of response).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Potential natural forces inherent in the area (flood zones,  earthquakes, subsidence areas, etc.)</p><p class="depth0">II. Risk factors for establishing frequency of assessment.</p><p class="depth0">A. By assigning weights or values to the risk factors, and using the  risk indicator tables, an operator can determine the priority for  assessing pipeline segments, beginning with those segments that are of  highest risk, that have not previously been assessed. This list provides  some guidance on some of the risk factors to consider (see  Sec. 195.452(e)). An operator should also develop factors specific to  each pipeline segment it is assessing, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Populated areas, unusually sensitive environmental areas,  National Fish Hatcheries, commercially navigable waters, areas where  people congregate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Results from previous testing/inspection.

Example: This example illustrates a hypothetical model used to  establish an integrity assessment schedule for a hypothetical pipeline  segment. After we determine the risk factors applicable to the pipeline  segment, we then assign values or numbers to each factor, such as, high  (5), moderate (3), or low (1). We can determine an overall risk  classification (A, B, C) for the segment using the risk tables and a  sliding scale (values 5 to 1) for risk factors for which tables are not  provided. We would classify a segment as C if it fell above \2/3\ of  maximum value (highest overall risk value for any one segment when  compared with other segments of a pipeline), a segment as B if it fell  between \1/3\ to \2/3\ of maximum value, and the remaining segments as  A.</p><p class="depth0">i. For the baseline assessment schedule, we would plan to assess 50%  of all pipeline segments covered by the rule, beginning with the highest  risk segments, within the first 3\1/2\ years and the remaining segments  within the seven-year period. For the continuing integrity assessments,  we would plan to assess the C segments within the first two (2) years of  the schedule, the segments classified as moderate risk no later than  year three or four and the remaining lowest risk segments no later than  year five (5).</p><p class="depth0">ii. For our hypothetical pipeline segment, we have chosen the  following risk factors and obtained risk factor values from the  appropriate table. The values assigned to the risk factors are for  illustration only.  Age of pipeline: assume 30 years old (refer to ``Age of Pipeline'' risk  table)-- Risk Value = 5 Pressure tested: tested once during construction-- Risk Value = 5 Coated: (yes/no)--yes Coating Condition: Recent excavation of suspected areas showed holidays  in coating (potential corrosion risk)-- Risk Value = 5 Cathodically Protected: (yes/no)--yes--Risk Value = 1 Date cathodic protection installed: five years after pipeline was  constructed (Cathodic protection installed within one year of the  pipeline's construction is generally considered low risk.)--Risk Value =  3 Close interval survey: (yes/no)--no--Risk Value = 5 Internal Inspection tool used: (yes/no)--yes. Date of pig run? In last  five years--Risk Value = 1   Anomalies found: (yes/no)--yes, but do not pose an immediate safety risk  or environmental hazard--Risk Value = 3 Leak History: yes, one spill in last 10 years. (refer to ``Leak  History'' risk table)--Risk Value = 2 Product transported: Diesel fuel. Product low risk. (refer to  ``Product'' risk table)--Risk Value = 1 Pipe size: 16 inches. Size presents moderate risk (refer to ``Line  Size'' risk table)--Risk Value = 3</p><p class="depth0">iii. Overall risk value for this hypothetical segment of pipe is 34.  Assume we have two other pipeline segments for which we conduct similar  risk rankings. The second pipeline segment has an overall risk value of  20, and the third segment, 11. For the baseline assessment we would  establish a schedule where we assess the first segment (highest risk  segment) within two years, the second segment within five years and the  third segment within seven years. Similarly, for the continuing  integrity assessment, we could establish an assessment schedule where we  assess the highest risk segment no later than the second year, the  second segment no later than the third year, and the third segment no  later than the fifth year.</p><p class="depth0">III.

Types of internal inspection tools to use.</p><p class="depth0">An operator should consider at least two types of internal  inspection tools for the integrity assessment from the following list.  The type of tool or tools an operator selects will depend on the results  from previous internal inspection runs, information analysis and risk  factors specific to the pipeline segment:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Geometry Internal inspection tools for detecting changes to  ovality, e.g., bends, dents, buckles or wrinkles, due to construction  flaws or soil movement, or other outside force damage;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Metal Loss Tools (Ultrasonic and Magnetic Flux Leakage) for  determining pipe wall anomalies, e.g., wall loss due to corrosion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Crack Detection Tools for detecting cracks and crack-like  features, e.g., stress corrosion cracking (SCC), fatigue cracks, narrow  axial corrosion, toe cracks, hook cracks, etc.</p><p class="depth0">V. Methods to measure performance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> This guidance is to help an operator establish  measures to evaluate the effectiveness of its integrity management  program. The performance measures required will depend on the details of  each integrity management program and will be based on an understanding  and analysis of the failure mechanisms or threats to integrity of each  pipeline segment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An operator should select a set of measurements to judge how  well its program is performing. An operator's objectives for its program  are to ensure public safety, prevent or minimize leaks and spills and  prevent property and environmental damage. A typical integrity  management program will be an ongoing program and it may contain many  elements. Therefore, several performance measure are likely to be needed  to   measure the effectiveness of an ongoing program.</p><p class="depth0">B. Performance measures. These measures show how a program to  control risk on pipeline segments that could affect a high consequence  area is progressing under the integrity management requirements.  Performance measures generally fall into three categories:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Selected Activity Measures--Measures that monitor the  surveillance and preventive activities the operator has implemented.  These measure indicate how well an operator is implementing the various  elements of its integrity management program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Deterioration Measures--Operation and maintenance trends that  indicate when the integrity of the system is weakening despite  preventive measures. This category of performance measure may indicate  that the system condition is deteriorating despite well executed  preventive activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Failure Measures--Leak History, incident response, product loss,  etc. These measures will indicate progress towards fewer spills and less  damage.</p><p class="depth0">C. Internal vs. External Comparisons. These comparisons show how a  pipeline segment that could affect a high consequence area is  progressing in comparison to the operator's other pipeline segments that  are not covered by the integrity management requirements and how that  pipeline segment compares to other operators' pipeline segments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Internal--Comparing data from the pipeline segment that could  affect the high consequence area with data from pipeline segments in  other areas of the system may indicate the effects from the attention  given to the high consequence area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> External--Comparing data external to the pipeline segment (e.g.,  OPS incident data) may provide measures on the frequency and size of  leaks in relation to other companies.</p><p class="depth0">D. Examples. Some examples of performance measures an operator could  use include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A performance measurement goal to reduce the total volume from  unintended releases by -% (percent to be determined by operator) with an  ultimate goal of zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A performance measurement goal to reduce the total number of  unintended releases (based on a threshold of 5 gallons) by -----%  (percent to be determined by operator) with an ultimate goal of zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A performance measurement goal to document the percentage of  integrity management activities completed during the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A performance measurement goal to track and evaluate the  effectiveness of the operator's community outreach activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A narrative description of pipeline system integrity, including  a summary of performance improvements, both qualitative and  quantitative, to an operator's integrity management program prepared  periodically.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A performance measure based on internal audits of the operator's  pipeline system per 49 CFR Part 195.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> A performance measure based on external audits of the operator's  pipeline system per 49 CFR Part 195.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> A performance measure based on operational events (for example:  relief occurrences, unplanned valve closure, SCADA outages, etc.) that  have the potential to adversely affect pipeline integrity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> A performance measure to demonstrate that the operator's  integrity management program reduces risk over time with a focus on high  risk items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> A performance measure to demonstrate that the operator's  integrity management program for pipeline stations and terminals reduces  risk over time with a focus on high risk items.</p><p class="depth0">VI. Examples of types of records an operator must maintain.</p><p class="depth0">The rule requires an operator to maintain certain records. (See  Sec. 195.452(l)). This section provides examples of some records that an  operator would have to maintain for inspection to comply with the  requirement. This is not an exhaustive list.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> a process for identifying which pipelines could affect a high  consequence area and a document identifying all pipeline segments that  could affect a high consequence area;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> a plan for baseline assessment of the line pipe that includes  each required plan element;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> modifications to the baseline plan and reasons for the  modification;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> use of and support for an alternative practice;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> a framework addressing each required element of the integrity  management program, updates and changes to the initial framework and  eventual program;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> a process for identifying a new high consequence area and  incorporating it into the baseline plan, particularly, a process for  identifying population changes around a pipeline segment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> an explanation of methods selected to assess the integrity of  line pipe;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> a process for review of integrity assessment results and data  analysis by a person qualified to evaluate the results and data;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> the process and risk factors for determining the baseline  assessment interval;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> results of the baseline integrity assessment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> the process used for continual evaluation, and risk factors  used for determining the frequency of evaluation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> process for integrating and analyzing information about the  integrity of a pipeline, information and data used for the information  analysis;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> results of the information analyses and periodic evaluations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> the process and risk factors for establishing continual re- assessment intervals;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> justification to support any variance from the required re- assessment intervals;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> integrity assessment results and anomalies found, process for  evaluating and remediating anomalies, criteria for remedial actions and  actions taken to evaluate and remediate the anomalies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(17)</em> other remedial actions planned or taken;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(18)</em> schedule for evaluation and remediation of anomalies,  justification to support deviation from required remediation times;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(19)</em> risk analysis used to identify additional preventive or  mitigative measures, records of preventive and mitigative actions  planned or taken;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(20)</em> criteria for determining EFRD installation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(21)</em> criteria for evaluating and modifying leak detection  capability;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(22)</em> methods used to measure the program's effectiveness.</p><p class="depth0">VII. Conditions that may impair a pipeline's integrity.</p><p class="depth0">Section 195.452(h) requires an operator to evaluate and remediate  all pipeline integrity issues raised by the integrity assessment or  information analysis. An operator must develop a schedule that  prioritizes conditions discovered on the pipeline for evaluation and  remediation. The following are some examples of conditions that an  operator should schedule for evaluation and remediation.</p><p class="depth0">A. Any change since the previous assessment.</p><p class="depth0">B. Mechanical damage that is located on the top side of the pipe.</p><p class="depth0">C. An anomaly abrupt in nature.</p><p class="depth0">D. An anomaly longitudinal in orientation.</p><p class="depth0">E. An anomaly over a large area.</p><p class="depth0">F.
