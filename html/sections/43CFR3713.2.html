The administrative law judge shall notify the department or agency and all mining claimants entitled to notice as the result of the filing of such verified statement of the time and place of such hearing at least 30 days in advance thereof. The notice of hearing shall contain a statement specifying the issues upon which evidence will be submitted at the hearing. Such hearing shall be held in the county where the lands in question, or parts thereof, are located unless the mining claimant agrees otherwise.</p>
