The borrower must also submit to RUS:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A written plan for corrective action taken or planned; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Comments on the status of corrective action taken on previously reported findings and recommendations.</p><p class="depth3">If corrective action is not necessary, a written statement describing the reason it is not should accompany the auditor's report.
