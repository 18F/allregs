                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Substantiation of tip income--(1) In general. An employee shall maintain sufficient evidence to establish the amount of tip income received by the employee during a taxable year. A daily record maintained by the employee (as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section) shall constitute sufficient evidence. If the employee does not maintain a daily record, other evidence of the amount of tip income received during the year, such as documentary evidence (as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section), shall constitute sufficient evidence, but only if such other evidence is as credible and as reliable as a daily record. The Commissioner may by revenue ruling, procedure or other guidance of general applicability provide for other methods of demonstrating evidence of tip income. However, notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph (a) (1), a daily record or other evidence that is as credible and as reliable as a daily record may not be sufficient evidence if there are facts or circumstances which indicate that the employee received a larger amount of tip income. Moreover, oral statements of the employee, without corroboration, cannot constitute sufficient evidence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. An employee shall maintain sufficient evidence to establish the amount of tip income received by the employee during a taxable year. A daily record maintained by the employee (as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section) shall constitute sufficient evidence. If the employee does not maintain a daily record, other evidence of the amount of tip income received during the year, such as documentary evidence (as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section), shall constitute sufficient evidence, but only if such other evidence is as credible and as reliable as a daily record.

Moreover, oral statements of the employee, without corroboration, cannot constitute sufficient evidence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Daily record. The daily record shall state the employee's name and address, the employer's name, and the establishment's name. The daily record shall show for each work day the amount of cash tips and charge tips received directly from customers or from other employees, and the amount of tips, if any, paid out to other employees through tip sharing, tip pooling or other arrangements and the names of such employees. The record shall also show the date that each entry is made. Form 4070A, Employee's Daily Record of Tips, may be used to maintain such daily record. In addition, an electronic system maintained by the employer that collects substantially similar information as Form 4070A may be used to maintain such daily record, provided the employee receives and maintains a paper copy of the daily record. The daily record of tips received by an employee shall be prepared and maintained in such manner that each entry

is made on or near the date the tip income is received. A daily record made on or near the date the tip income is received has a high degree of credibility not present with respect to a record prepared subsequent thereto when generally there is a lack of accurate recall. An entry is made ``near the date the tip income is received'' if the required information with respect to tips received and paid out by the employee for the day is recorded at a time when the employee has full present knowledge of those receipts and payments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Documentary evidence. Documentary evidence consists of copies of any documents that contain (i) amounts that were added to a check by customers as a tip and paid over to the employee or (ii) amounts that were paid by a customer for food or beverages with respect to which tips generally would be received by the employee. Examples of documentary evidence are copies of restaurant bills, credit card charges, or charges under any other arrangement (see Sec. 31.6053-3(j)(4)) containing amounts added by the customer as a tip.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Retention of records. Records maintained under this section shall be kept at all times available for inspection by authorized internal revenue officers or employees, and shall be retained so long as the contents thereof may become material in the administration of any internal revenue law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effective date. The substantiation requirements of this Sec. 31.6053-4 shall be effective for tips received on or after October 1, 1985. For the rules in effect prior to October 1, 1985, see section 6001 and the regulations thereunder. Substantiation considered sufficient as provided in this Sec. 31.6053-4 will also be considered sufficient for tips received before October 1, 1985.
