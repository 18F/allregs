                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Form SS-5. If you wish to change the name or other personal identifying information you previously submitted in connection with an application for a social security number card, you must complete and sign a Form SS-5 except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. You must prove your identity, and you may be required to provide other evidence. (See Sec. 422.107 for evidence requirements.) You may obtain a Form SS-5 from any local Social Security office or from one of the sources noted in Sec. 422.103(b). You may submit a completed request for change in records to any Social Security office, or, if you are outside the U.S., to the

Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office, Manila, Philippines, or to any U.S. Foreign Service post or U.S. military post. If your request is for a change of name on the card (i.e., verified legal changes to the first name and/or surname), we may issue you a replacement card bearing the same number and the new name. We will grant an exception from the limitations specified in Sec. 422.103(e)(2) for replacement social security number cards representing a change in name or, if you are an alien, a change to a restrictive legend shown on the card. (See Sec. 422.103(e)(3) for the definition of a change to a restrictive legend.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Assisting in enumeration. We may enter into an agreement with officials of the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security to assist us by collecting, as part of the immigration process, information to change the name or other personal identifying information you previously submitted in connection with an application or request for a social security number card. If your request is to change a name on the card (i.e., verified legal changes to the first name and/or surname) or to correct the restrictive legend on the card to reflect a change in alien status, we may issue you a replacement card bearing the same number and the new name or legend. We will grant an exception from the limitations specified in Sec. 422.103(e)(2) for replacement social security number cards representing a change of name or, if you are an alien, a change to a restrictive legend shown on the card. (See Sec. 422.103(e)(3) for the definition of a change to a restrictive legend.)
