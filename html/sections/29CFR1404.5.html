                                Sec. 1404.5  Listing on the roster, criteria for listing and removal,
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Persons seeking to be listed on the Roster must complete and submit an application form that may be obtained from OAS. Upon receipt of an executed application, OAS will review the application, assure that it is complete, make such inquiries as are necessary, and submit the application to the Board. The Board will review the completed application under the criteria in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section, and will forward to the FMCS Director its recommendation as to whether or not the applicant meets the criteria for listing on the Roster. The Director shall make all final decisions as to whether an applicant may be listed on the Roster. Each applicant shall be notified in writing of the Director's decision and the reasons therefore.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General criteria. (1) Applicants will be listed on the Roster upon a determination that he or she:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applicants will be listed on the Roster upon a determination that he or she:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is experienced, competent and acceptable in decision-making roles in the resolution of labor relations disputes; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Has extensive and recent experience in relevant positions in collective bargaining; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Is capable of conducting an orderly hearing, can analyze testimony and exhibits and can prepare clear and concise findings and awards within reasonable time limits.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For applicants who are governmental employees, the following criteria shall also apply:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Federal Employees: These applicants must provide the OAS with written permission from their employer to work as an arbitrator. Federal employees will not be assigned to panels involving the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Governmental Employees other than Federal: These applicants must provide the OAS with written permission from their employer to work as an arbitrator as well as a statement of the jurisdiction(s) in which the applicant is permitted to do this work.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> FMCS may identify certain positions relating to collective bargaining that will substitute for the General Criteria. FMCS may also identify periodic educational requirements for remaining on the Roster.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Proof of qualification. The qualifications listed in paragraph (a) of this section are preferably demonstrated by the submission of five recent arbitration awards prepared by the applicant while serving as an impartial arbitrator of record chosen by the parties to labor relations disputes arising under collective bargaining agreements, or the successful completion of the FMCS labor arbitrator training course plus two awards as described above, and the submission of information demonstrating extensive and recent experience in collective bargaining, including at least the position or title held, duties or responsibilities, the name and location of the company or organization, and the dates of employment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Advocacy. Any person who at the time of application is an advocate as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, must agree to cease such activity before being recommended for listing on the Roster by the Board. Except in the case of persons listed on the Roster as advocates before November 17, 1976, any person who did not divulge his or her advocacy at the time of listing or who becomes an advocate while listed on the Roster and who did not request to be placed on inactive status pursuant to Sec. 1404.6 prior to becoming an advocate, shall be recommended for removal by the Board after the fact of advocacy is revealed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definition of Advocacy. An advocate is a person who represents employers, labor organizations, or individuals as an employee, attorney, or consultant, in matters of labor relations or employment relations, including but not limited to the subjects of union representation and recognition matters, collective bargaining, arbitration, unfair labor practices, equal employment opportunity, and other areas generally recognized as constituting labor or employment relations. The definition includes representatives of employers or employees in individual cases or controversies involving worker's compensation, occupational health or safety, minimum wage, or other labor standards matters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This definition of advocate also includes a person who is directly or indirectly associated with an advocate in a business or professional relationship as, for example, partners or employees of a law firm. Individuals engaged only in joint education or training or other non-adversarial activities will not be deemed as advocates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Listing on roster, removal. Listing on the Roster shall be by decision of the Director of FMCS based upon the recommendations of the Board or upon the Director's own initiative. The Board may recommend for removal, and the Director may remove, any person listed on the Roster for violation of this part or of the Code of Professional Responsibility. FMCS will provide to the affected arbitrator written notice of removal from the Roster. Complaints about arbitrators should be in writing and sent to the Director of OAS. The complaint should cite the specific section of the Code or the

FMCS rule the arbitrator has allegedly violated. The following criteria shall be a basis for the Board to recommend and/or the Director to initiate a member's removal from the Roster:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No longer meets the criteria for admission;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Has become an advocate as defined in paragraph (c) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Has been repeatedly or flagrantly delinquent in submitting awards;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Has refused to make reasonable and periodic reports in a timely manner to FMCS, as required in subpart C of this part, concerning activities pertaining to arbitration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Has been the subject of a complaint by parties who use FMCS services and the Board, after appropriate inquiry, concludes that cause for removal has been shown;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Is determined to be unacceptable to the parties who use FMCS arbitration services. Such a determination of unacceptability may be based on FMCS records which show the number of times the arbitrator's name has been proposed to the parties and the number of times he or she has been selected. Such cases will be reviewed for extenuating circumstances, such as length of time on the Roster or prior history;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Has been in an inactive status pursuant to Sec. 1404.6 for longer than two years and has not paid the annual listing fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Procedure for removal. Prior to any recommendation by the Board to remove an arbitrator from the Roster, the Board shall conduct an inquiry into the facts of any such recommended removal. When the Board recommends removal of an arbitrator, it shall send the arbitrator a written notice. This notice shall inform the arbitrator of the Board's recommendation and the basis for it, and that he or she has 60 days from the date of such notice to submit a written response or information showing why the arbitrator should not be removed. When the Director removes an arbitrator from the Roster, he or she shall inform the arbitrator of this in writing, stating the effective date of the removal and the length of time of the removal if it is not indefinite. An arbitrator so removed may seek reinstatement to the Roster by making written application to the Director no earlier than two years after the effective date of his or her removal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Suspension. The director of OAS may suspend for a period not to exceed 180 days any person listed on the Roster who has violated any of the criteria in paragraph (d) of this section. Arbitrators shall be promptly notified of a suspension. The arbitrator may appeal a suspension to the Board, which shall make a recommendation to the Director of FMCS. The decision of the Director of FMCS shall constitute the final action of the agency.
