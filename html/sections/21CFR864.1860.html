                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. Immunohistochemistry test systems (IHC's) are in  vitro diagnostic devices consisting of polyclonal or monoclonal  antibodies labeled with directions for use and performance claims, which  may be packaged with ancillary reagents in kits. Their intended use is  to identify, by immunological techniques, antigens in tissues or  cytologic specimens. Similar devices intended for use with flow  cytometry devices are not considered IHC's.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification of immunohistochemistry devices. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Class I  (general controls). Except as described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3)  of this section, these devices are exempt from the premarket  notification requirements in part 807, subpart E of this chapter. This  exemption applies to IHC's that provide the pathologist with adjunctive  diagnostic information that may be incorporated into the pathologist's  report, but that is not ordinarily reported to the clinician as an  independent finding. These IHC's are used after the primary diagnosis of  tumor (neoplasm) has been made by conventional histopathology using  nonimmunologic histochemical stains, such as hematoxylin and eosin.  Examples of class I IHC's are differentiation markers that are used as  adjunctive tests to subclassify tumors, such as keratin.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Class II (special control, guidance document: ``FDA Guidance for  Submission of Immunohistochemistry Applications to the FDA,'' Center for  Devices and Radiologic Health, 1998). These IHC's are intended for the  detection and/or measurement of certain target analytes in order to  provide prognostic or predictive data that are not directly confirmed by  routine histopathologic internal and external control specimens. These  IHC's provide the pathologist with information that is ordinarily  reported as independent diagnostic information to the ordering  clinician, and the claims associated with these data are widely accepted  and supported by valid scientific evidence. Examples of class II IHC's  are those intended for semiquantitative   measurement of an analyte, such as hormone receptors in breast cancer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Class III (premarket approval). IHC's intended for any use not  described in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Date of PMA or notice of completion of a PDP is required. As of  May 28, 1976, an approval under section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug,  and Cosmetic Act is required for any device described in paragraph  (b)(3) of this section before this device may be commercially  distributed. See Sec. 864.3.  [63 FR 30142, June 3, 1998]</p>
