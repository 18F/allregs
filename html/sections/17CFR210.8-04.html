                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If a business combination has occurred or is probable, financial statements of the business acquired or to be acquired shall be furnished for the periods specified in paragraph (c) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This encompasses the purchase of an interest in a business accounted for by the equity method.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Acquisitions of a group of related businesses that are probable or that have occurred subsequent to the latest fiscal year end for which audited financial statements of the issuer have been filed shall be treated as if they are a single business combination for purposes of this section. The required financial statements of related businesses may be presented on a combined basis for any periods they are under common control or management. A group of businesses is deemed to be related if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> They are under common control or management;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The acquisition of one business is conditioned on the acquisition of each other business; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Each acquisition is conditioned on a single common event.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Annual financial statements required by this rule shall be audited. The form and content of the financial statements shall be in accordance with Sec. Sec. 210.8-02 and 8-03.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The periods for which financial statements are to be presented are determined by comparison of the most recent annual financial statements of the business acquired or to be acquired and the smaller reporting company's most recent annual financial statements filed at or before the date of acquisition to evaluate each of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compare the smaller reporting company's investments in and advances to the acquiree to the total consolidated assets of the smaller reporting company as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Compare the smaller reporting company's proportionate share of the total assets (after intercompany eliminations) of the acquiree to the total consolidated assets of the smaller reporting company as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Compare the smaller reporting company's equity in the income from continuing operations before income taxes, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of a change in accounting

principles of the acquiree exclusive of amounts attributable to any noncontrolling interests to such consolidated income of the smaller reporting company for the most recently completed fiscal year.</p><p class="depth3">Computational note to Sec. 210.8-04(b):</p><p class="depth3">For purposes of making the prescribed income test the following guidance should be applied: If income of the smaller reporting company and its subsidiaries consolidated exclusive of amounts attributable to any noncontrolling interests for the most recent fiscal year is at least 10 percent lower than the average of the income for the last five fiscal years, such average income should be substituted for purposes of the computation. Any loss years should be omitted for purposes of computing average income.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> If none of the conditions specified in paragraph (b) of this section exceeds 20%, financial statements are not required. If any of the conditions exceed 20%, but none exceeds 40%, financial statements shall be furnished for the most recent fiscal year and any interim periods specified in Sec. 210.8-03. If any of the conditions exceed 40%, financial statements shall be furnished for the two most recent fiscal years and any interim periods specified in Sec. 210.8-03.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If none of the conditions specified in paragraph (b) of this section exceeds 20%, financial statements are not required. If any of the conditions exceed 20%, but none exceeds 40%, financial statements shall be furnished for the most recent fiscal year and any interim periods specified in Sec. 210.8-03. If any of the conditions exceed 40%, financial statements shall be furnished for the two most recent fiscal years and any interim periods specified in Sec. 210.8-03.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The separate audited balance sheet of the acquired business is not required when the smaller reporting company's most recent audited balance sheet filed is for a date after the acquisition was consummated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the aggregate impact of individually insignificant businesses acquired since the date of the most recent audited balance sheet filed for the registrant exceeds 50%, financial statements covering at least the substantial majority of the businesses acquired shall be furnished. Such financial statements shall be for the most recent fiscal year and any interim periods specified in Sec. 210.8-03.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Registration statements not subject to the provisions of Sec. 230.419 of this chapter (Regulation C) and proxy statements need not include separate financial statements of the acquired or to be acquired business if it does not meet or exceed any of the conditions specified in paragraph (b) of this section at the 50 percent level, and either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The consummation of the acquisition has not yet occurred; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The effective date of the registration statement, or mailing date in the case of a proxy statement, is no more than 74 days after consummation of the business combination, and the financial statements have not been filed previously by the registrant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An issuer that omits from its initial registration statement financial statements of a recently consummated business combination pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section shall furnish those financial statements and any pro forma information specified by Sec. 210.8-05 under cover of Form 8-K (Sec. 249.308 of this chapter) no later than 75 days after consummation of the acquisition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the smaller reporting company made a significant business acquisition after the latest fiscal year end and filed a report on Form 8-K, which included audited financial statements of such acquired business for the periods required by paragraph (c) of this section and the pro forma financial information required by Sec. 210.8-05, the determination of significance may be made by using pro forma amounts for the latest fiscal year in the report on Form 8-K rather than by using the historical amounts of the registrant. The tests may not be made by ``annualizing'' data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the business acquired or to be acquired is a foreign business, financial statements of the business meeting the requirements of Item 17 of Form 20-F (Sec. 249.220f of this chapter) will satisfy this section.
