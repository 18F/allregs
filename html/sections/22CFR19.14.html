However, a  principal may not waive the portion of his/her annuity authorized to be  paid to a former spouse under Sec. 19.7 or Sec. 19.9 or to a  beneficiary under Sec. 19.6. An annuity waiver shall be in writing and  sent to the Department (PER/ER/RET). A waiver may be revoked in writing  at any time. Payment of the annuity waived may not be made for the  period during which the waiver was in effect.</p>
