                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. IMLS will use the most efficient and least costly  methods to comply with FOIA requests. IMLS will charge fees to recover  all allowable direct costs incurred, and may charge fees for searching  for and reviewing requested records even if the records are determined  to be exempt from disclosure or cannot be located. IMLS will charge fees  in accordance with the category of the FOIA requester.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Commercial use requests. IMLS will assess charges to recover the  full direct cost of searching for, reviewing and duplicating the  requested records. IMLS may recover the cost of searching for and  reviewing records even if there is ultimately no disclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requests from educational and non-commercial scientific  institutions. IMLS will charge for duplication costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Requests by representatives of the news media. IMLS will charge  for duplication costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All other requests. IMLS will assess charges to recover the full  direct cost for searching for and duplicating the requested records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Status of Requester. IMLS' decision regarding the categorization  of a requester will be made on a case-by-case basis based upon the  requester's intended use of the requested records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General fee schedule. The following fees will be charged in  accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Manual search fee. The fee charged will be the salary rate(s)  (i.e., basic pay plus 16.1 percent) of the employee(s) conducting the  search.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Computer search fee. The fee charged will be the actual direct  cost of providing the service including the cost of operating the  central processing unit for the operating time that is directly  attributed to searching for records responsive to a request and the  operator/programmer salary apportionable to the search.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Review fee. The fee charged will equal the salary rate(s) (i.e.,  basic pay plus 16.1 percent) of the employee(s) conducting the review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Duplication fee. Copies of records photocopied on an 8\1/2\ x 11  inch sheet of paper will be provided at $.10 per page. For duplication  of other materials, the charge will be the direct cost of duplication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Restrictions on charging fees. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except for records provided  in response to a commercial use request, the first 100 pages of  duplication and the first two (2) hours of search time will be provided  at no charge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fees will not be charged to any requester, including commercial  use requesters, if the total amount calculated under this section is  less than $25.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Fees likely to exceed $25. If the total fee charges are likely  to exceed $25, IMLS will notify you of the estimated amount of the  charges, including a breakdown of the fees for search, review and/or  duplication, unless you have indicated in advance that you are   willing to pay higher fees and will offer you an opportunity to confer  with the FOIA Public Liaison to revise the request to meet your needs at  a lower cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Waiver or reduction of fees. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> IMLS will disclose records  without charge or at a reduced charge if the agency determines that  disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is  likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the  operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the  commercial interest of the requester.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> IMLS will use the following factors to determine whether a fee  will be waived or reduced:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The subject of the request. Whether the subject of the requested  records concerns the ``operations or activities of the government'';</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The informative value of the information to be disclosed.  Whether the disclosure is ``likely to contribute'' to an understanding  of government operations or activities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the  general public likely to result from disclosure. Whether disclosure of  the requested information will contribute to ``public understanding'';</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The significance of the contribution to public understanding.  Whether disclosure is likely to contribute ``significantly'' to public  understanding of government operations or activities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest. Whether  you have a commercial interest that would be furthered by the  disclosure; and if so</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The primary interest in disclosure. Whether the magnitude of  your commercial interest is sufficiently large in comparison with the  public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the your  commercial interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Assessment and collection of fees. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If you fail to pay your  bill within thirty (30) days, interest will accrue from the date the  bill was mailed, and will be assessed at the rate prescribed in 31  U.S.C. 3717.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If IMLS reasonably believes that you are attempting to divide a  request into a series of requests to avoid the assessment of fees, the  agency may aggregate such requests and charge accordingly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Advance payment. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Advance payment of fees will generally not  be required. IMLS may request an advance payment of the fee, however,  if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The charges are likely to exceed $250; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> You have failed previously to pay a fee in a timely fashion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When IMLS requests an advance payment, the time limits  described in section (a)(6) of the FOIA will begin only after IMLS has  received full payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Failure to comply. In the absence of unusual or exceptional  circumstances, IMLS will not assess fees if the agency fails to comply  with any time limit set forth in these regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Waivers. IMLS may waive fees in other circumstances solely at  its discretion, consistent with 5 U.S.C. 552.</p>
