                            <p class="depth0">This part is related to a number of other parts. Part 217 of this  chapter describes how to apply for an annuity. Part 218 indicates when  annuities begin and when they terminate. Part 219 sets out what evidence  is necessary to prove   eligibility. Where eligibility for an annuity is based upon a family  relationship to an employee (for example, a widow's annuity), the  definition of such family relationship may be found in part 222 of this  chapter. Part 225 of this chapter describes the computation of the  primary insurance amount.</p>
