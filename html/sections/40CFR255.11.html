                            <p class="depth0">The following criteria are intended to assist in the process of  agency selection pursuant to section 4006(b) of the Act. They may also  be useful in pointing out needed improvements in the qualifications of  the selected agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Existing agencies with demonstrated satisfactory ability to  plan, manage, or operate solid waste management services should be  considered   for planning and implementation responsibilities. Agencies which have  completed planning that resulted in successful implementation of solid  waste management facilities or services should be given priority  consideration for future planning responsibilities when they otherwise  meet these criteria.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An agency to be identified as responsible for conducting  regional solid waste management planning should:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be a representative organization composed of, or whose  membership is composed of, individuals at least a majority of whom are  elected officials of local governments or their designees having  jurisdiction in the planning region.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Have planning jurisdiction in the entire planning region.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Be capable of having the planning process fully underway within  1 year after identification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Have established procedures for adoption, review, and revision  of plans and resolution of major issues, including procedures for public  participation in the planning process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Have appropriate experience and skills to perform all of its  assigned responsibilities, including expertise for the particular waste  type, processing or disposal technology, and functional area. (Attention  is directed to OMB Circular No. A-95, paragraph 1.e., part IV of  Attachment A which encourages the designation of established substate  district comprehensive planning agencies as the agencies to carry out  areawide planning assisted or required under any Federal program).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In identifying agencies for solid waste management planning and  implementation under section 4006 of the Act, the State should review  the solid waste activities being conducted by water quality management  planning agencies designated under section 208 of the Federal Water  Pollution Control Act. Where feasible, identification of such agencies  should be considered in the joint identification processes of subpart C  of this part. There should be a formal means of coordination established  with the State water quality management agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Planning objectives will influence agency selection.  Distinctions may be made between policy planning and facility planning  and between planning a single solid waste management system and  comprehensive planning which addresses trade-offs among various media.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For coordinating planning and implementation under the State  plan, as required in section 4003(1)(c), consideration should be given  to identifying one agency for both functions. Where separate planning  and implementation agencies are selected, there should be some means to  ensure implementation, such as State legislation or an interagency  agreement that all constituent jurisdictions will abide by the plan.  Furthermore, strong coordination should be established between the  planning agency and the implementing agency. During the planning period,  the implementation agency should have continual access to plan  development processes. There should be an administrative procedure to  resolve conflicts between planners and implementers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The agency responsible for carrying out the regional plan should  be constituted with authority to implement the plan in its constituent  jurisdictions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The need for a reliable volume of waste to supply disposal or  recovery facilities should be addressed. The Agency providing such  facilities whose member jurisdictions could choose whether or not to  utilize the facility should analyze that need and consider methods such  as franchising or public utility controls to assure an adequate supply.</p>
