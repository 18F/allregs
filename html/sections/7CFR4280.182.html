                            <p class="depth0">Feasibility study grants will be serviced in accordance with  Departmental regulations; 7 CFR part 1951, subparts E and O; and  paragraphs (a) through (n) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Inspections. Grantees will permit periodic inspection of the  project records and operations by a representative of the Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Programmatic changes. The grantee shall obtain prior Agency  approval for any change to the scope or objectives of the approved  project. Failure to obtain prior approval of changes to the scope of  work or budget may result in suspension, termination, and recovery of  grant funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Changes in project cost or scope. If there is a significant  reduction in project cost or changes in project   scope, the applicant's funding needs, eligibility, and scoring, as  applicable, will be reassessed. Decreases in Agency funds will be based  on revised project costs and other selection factors; however, other  factors, including Agency regulations and Notices used at the time of  grant approval, will remain the same. Obligated grant funds not needed  to complete the project will be de-obligated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Transfer of obligations. Subject to Agency approval, an  obligation of funds established for a grantee may be transferred to a  different (substituted) grantee provided:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The substituted grantee</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is eligible;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Has a close and genuine relationship with the original grantee;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Has the authority to receive the assistance approved for the  original grantee; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The type of renewable energy technology and the scope of the  project for which the Agency funds will be used remain unchanged.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Financial management system and records. Grantees are required  to maintain a financial management system and records in accordance with  Departmental regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Fund disbursement. Grant funds will be expended on a pro rata  basis with matching funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requests for reimbursement may be submitted monthly or more  frequently if authorized to do so by the Agency. Ordinarily, payment  will be made within 30 days after receipt of a proper request for  reimbursement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Grantee shall not request reimbursement for the Federal  share of amounts withheld from contractors to ensure satisfactory  completion of work until after it makes those payments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Standard Form 270, ``Request for Advance or Reimbursement,'' or  other format prescribed by the Agency shall be used to request grant  reimbursements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For renewable energy system feasibility studies, grant funds  will be disbursed in accordance with the above through 90 percent of  grant disbursement. The final 10 percent of grant funds will be held by  the Agency until a feasibility study acceptable to the Agency has been  submitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Deobligation of grant funds. Funds remaining after all costs  incident to the project have been paid or provided for are subject to  deobligation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Monitoring of project. Grantees are responsible for ensuring  that all activities are performed within the approved scope of work and  that funds are only used for approved purposes. Grantees shall  constantly monitor performance to ensure that time schedules are being  met, projected work by time periods is being accomplished, financial  resources are being appropriately expended by contractors (if  applicable), and any other performance objectives identified in the  scope of work are being achieved. The Agency will monitor grantees to  ensure that activities are performed in accordance with the Agency- approved scope of work and to ensure that funds are expended for  approved purposes. The Agency's monitoring of grantees neither relieves  the grantee of its responsibilities to ensure that activities are  performed within the scope of work approved by the Agency and that funds  are expended for approved purposes only nor provides recourse or a  defense to the grantee should the grantee conduct unapproved activities,  engage in unethical conduct, engage in activities that are or give the  appearance of a conflict of interest, or expend funds for unapproved  purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Federal financial reports. A SF-425, ``Federal Financial  Report,'' and a project performance report will be required of all  grantees on a semiannual basis. The grantee will complete the project  within the total sums available to it, including the grant, in  accordance with the scope of work and any necessary modifications  thereof prepared by the grantee and approved by the Agency. The final  federal financial report must be submitted to the Agency within 90 days  after the feasibility study has been completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Performance reports. Grantees must submit to the Agency, in  writing, semiannual performance reports and a final performance report.  Grantees are to submit an original of each report to the Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Semiannual performance reports. Each semiannual performance  report shall describe current progress and identify any problems,  delays, or adverse conditions, if any, which have affected or will  affect attainment of overall project objectives or prevent meeting time  frame for completion of the feasibility study within 2 years. This  disclosure shall be accompanied by a statement of the action taken or  planned to resolve the situation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Final performance report. A final performance report, which will  serve as the last semiannual performance report, will be required within  90 days after the feasibility study has been completed. The final  performance report shall summarize any problems, delays, or adverse  conditions, if any, which have affected the project objectives or  prevented meeting time frames for completion of the feasibility study.  The final performance report should indicate if the grantee intends to  proceed with the construction of the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Final deliverables. Upon completion of the feasibility study,  the grantee shall submit the following to the Agency:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The project feasibility study; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> SF-270.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Renewable energy feasibility studies. Beginning the first full  year after the feasibility study has been completed, grantees shall  report annually for 2 years on the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is the renewable energy system project for which the feasibility  study was conducted underway? If ``yes,'' describe how far along the  renewable energy system project is (e.g., financing has been secured,  site has been secured, construction contracts are in place, project is  completed).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is the renewable energy system project complete? If so, what is  the actual amount of energy being produced?</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Other reports. For clarification purposes, the Agency may  request any additional project and/or performance data for the project  for which grant funds have been received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Grant close-out and related activities. Grant close-out and  related activities shall be performed in accordance with the  Departmental Regulations. In addition, failure to submit satisfactory  reports on time under the provisions of paragraphs (i) through (m) of  this section may result in the suspension or termination of a grant. The  provisions of this section apply to grants and sub-grants.    Sec. Sec. 4280.183-4280.185  [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2">Energy Audit and Renewable Energy Development Assistance Grants</p>
