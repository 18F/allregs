A department of a provider comprises both the specific physical facility that serves as the site of services of a type for which payment could be claimed under the Medicare or Medicaid program, and the personnel and equipment needed to deliver the services at that facility. A department of a provider may not by itself be qualified to participate in Medicare as a provider under Sec. 489.2 of this chapter, and the Medicare conditions of participation do not apply to a department as an independent entity. For purposes of this part, the term ``department of a provider'' does not include an RHC or, except as specified in paragraph (n) of this section, an FQHC.</p><p class="depth3">Free-standing facility means an entity that furnishes health care services to Medicare beneficiaries and that is not integrated with any other entity as a main provider, a department of a provider, remote location of a hospital, satellite facility, or a provider-based entity.</p><p class="depth3">Main provider means a provider that either creates, or acquires ownership of, another entity to deliver additional health care services under its name, ownership, and financial and administrative control.</p><p class="depth3">Provider-based entity means a provider of health care services, or an RHC as defined in Sec. 405.2401(b) of this chapter, that is either created by, or acquired by, a main provider for the purpose of furnishing health care services of a different type from those of the main provider under the ownership and administrative and financial control of the main provider, in accordance with the provisions of this section. A provider-based entity comprises both the specific physical facility that serves as the site of services of a type for which payment could be claimed under the Medicare or Medicaid program, and the personnel and equipment needed to deliver the services at that facility. A provider-based entity may, by itself, be qualified to participate in Medicare as a provider under Sec. 489.2 of this chapter, and the Medicare conditions of participation do apply to a provider-based entity as an independent entity.</p><p class="depth3">Provider-based status means the relationship between a main provider and a provider-based entity or a department of a provider, remote location of a hospital, or satellite facility, that complies with the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth3">Remote location of a hospital means a facility or an organization that is either created by, or acquired by, a hospital that is a main provider for the purpose of furnishing inpatient hospital services under the name, ownership, and financial and administrative control of the main provider, in accordance with the provisions of this section. A remote location of a hospital

comprises both the specific physical facility that serves as the site of services for which separate payment could be claimed under the Medicare or Medicaid program, and the personnel and equipment needed to deliver the services at that facility. The Medicare conditions of participation do not apply to a remote location of a hospital as an independent entity. For purposes of this part, the term ``remote location of a hospital'' does not include a satellite facility as defined in Sec.

(1) A facility or organization is not entitled to be treated as provider-based simply because it or the main provider believe it is provider-based.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A facility or organization is not entitled to be treated as provider-based simply because it or the main provider believe it is provider-based.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a facility was treated as provider-based in relation to a hospital or CAH on October 1, 2000, it will continue to be considered provider-based in relation to that hospital or CAH until the start of the hospital's first cost reporting period beginning on or after July 1, 2003. The requirements, limitations, and exclusions specified in paragraphs (d), (e), (f), (h), and (i) of this section will not apply to that hospital or CAH until the start of the hospital's first cost reporting period beginning on or after July 1, 2003. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), a facility is considered as provider-based on October 1, 2000 if, on that date, it either had a written determination from CMS that it was provider-based, or was billing and being paid as a provider-based department or entity of the hospital.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> Except as specified in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(5) of this section, if a potential main provider seeks a determination of provider-based status for a facility that is located on the campus of the potential main provider, the provider would be required to submit an attestation stating that the facility meets the criteria in paragraph (d) of this section and, if it is a hospital, also attest that it will fulfill the obligations of hospital outpatient departments and hospital-based entities described in paragraph (g) of this section. The provider seeking such a determination would also be required to maintain documentation of the basis for its attestations and to make that documentation available to CMS and to CMS contractors upon request. If the facility is operated as a joint venture, the provider would also have to attest that it will comply with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as specified in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(5) of this section, if a potential main provider seeks a determination of provider-based status for a facility that is located on the campus of the potential main provider, the provider would be required to submit an attestation stating that the facility meets the criteria in paragraph (d) of this section and, if it is a hospital, also attest that it will fulfill the obligations of hospital outpatient departments and hospital-based entities described in paragraph (g) of this section. The provider seeking such a determination would also be required to maintain documentation of the basis for its attestations and to make that documentation available to CMS and to CMS contractors upon request. If the facility is operated as a joint venture, the provider would also have to attest that it will comply with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the facility is not located on the campus of the potential main provider, the provider seeking a determination would be required to submit an attestation stating that the facility meets the criteria in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, and if the facility is operated under a management contract, the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section. If the potential main provider is a hospital, the hospital also would be required to attest that it will fulfill the obligations of hospital outpatient departments and hospital-based entities described in paragraph (g) of this section. The provider would be required to supply documentation of the basis for its attestations to CMS at the time it submits its attestations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Whenever a provider submits an attestation of provider-based status for an on-campus facility or organization, as described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, CMS will send the provider written acknowledgment of receipt of the attestation, review the attestation for completeness, consistency with the criteria in this section, and consistency with information in the possession of CMS at the time the attestation is received, and make a determination as to whether the facility or organization is provider-based.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Whenever a provider submits an attestation of provider-based status for an off-campus facility or organization, as described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, CMS will send the provider written acknowledgment of receipt of the attestation, review the attestation for completeness, consistency with the criteria in this section, consistency with the documentation submitted with the attestation and consistency with information in the possession of CMS at the time the attestation is received, and make a determination as to whether the facility or organization is provider-based.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A facility that is not located on the campus of a hospital and that is used as a site where physician services

of the kind ordinarily furnished in physician offices are furnished is presumed as a free-standing facility, unless CMS determines the facility has provider-based status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A facility that has requested provider-based status in relation to a hospital or CAH on or after October 1, 2000 and before October 1, 2002 will be treated as provider-based in relation to the hospital or CAH from the first date on or after October 1, 2000 on which the facility was licensed (to the extent required by the State), staffed and equipped to treat patients until the date on which CMS determines that the facility does not qualify for provider-based status.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reporting of material changes in relationships. A main provider that has had one or more facilities or organizations considered provider-based also may report to CMS any material change in the relationship between it and any provider-based facility or organization, such as a change in ownership of the facility or organization or entry into a new or different management contract that would affect the provider-based status of the facility or organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Requirements applicable to all facilities or organizations. Any facility or organization for which provider-based status is sought, whether located on or off the campus of a potential main provider, must meet all of the following requirements to be determined by CMS to have provider-based status:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Licensure. The department of the provider, the remote location of a hospital, or the satellite facility and the main provider are operated under the same license, except in areas where the State requires a separate license for the department of the provider, the remote location of a hospital, or the satellite facility, or in States where State law does not permit licensure of the provider and the prospective department of the provider, the remote location of a hospital, or the satellite facility under a single license. If a State health facilities' cost review commission or other agency that has authority to regulate the rates charged by hospitals or other providers in a State finds that a particular facility or organization is not part of a provider, CMS will determine that the facility or organization does not have provider-based status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Clinical services. The clinical services of the facility or organization seeking provider-based status and the main provider are integrated as evidenced by the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Professional staff of the facility or organization have clinical privileges at the main provider.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The main provider maintains the same monitoring and oversight of the facility or organization as it does for any other department of the provider.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The medical director of the facility or organization seeking provider-based status maintains a reporting relationship with the chief medical officer or other similar official of the main provider that has the same frequency, intensity, and level of accountability that exists in the relationship between the medical director of a department of the main provider and the chief medical officer or other similar official of the main provider, and is under the same type of supervision and accountability as any other director, medical or otherwise, of the main provider.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Medical staff committees or other professional committees at the main provider are responsible for medical activities in the facility or organization, including quality assurance, utilization review, and the coordination and integration of services, to the extent practicable, between the facility or organization seeking provider-based status and the main provider.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Medical records for patients treated in the facility or organization are integrated into a unified retrieval system (or cross reference) of the main provider.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Inpatient and outpatient services of the facility or organization and the main provider are integrated, and patients treated at the facility or organization who require further care have full access to all services of the main provider and are referred where appropriate to the corresponding inpatient or outpatient department or service of the main provider.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Financial integration. The financial operations of the facility or organization are fully integrated within the financial system of the main provider, as

evidenced by shared income and expenses between the main provider and the facility or organization. The costs of a facility or organization that is a hospital department are reported in a cost center of the provider, costs of a provider-based facility or organization other than a hospital department are reported in the appropriate cost center or cost centers of the main provider, and the financial status of any provider-based facility or organization is incorporated and readily identified in the main provider's trial balance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Public awareness. The facility or organization seeking status as a department of a provider, a remote location of a hospital, or a satellite facility is held out to the public and other payers as part of the main provider. When patients enter the provider-based facility or organization, they are aware that they are entering the main provider and are billed accordingly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Obligations of hospital outpatient departments and hospital-based entities. In the case of a hospital outpatient department or a hospital-based entity, the facility or organization must fulfill the obligations of hospital outpatient departments and hospital-based entities described in paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Additional requirements applicable to off-campus facilities or organizations. Except as described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(5) of this section, any facility or organization for which provider-based status is sought that is not located on the campus of a potential main provider must meet both the requirements in paragraph (d) of this section and all of the following additional requirements, in order to be determined by CMS to have provider-based status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Operation under the ownership and control of the main provider. The facility or organization seeking provider-based status is operated under the ownership and control of the main provider, as evidenced by the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The business enterprise that constitutes the facility or organization is 100 percent owned by the main provider.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The main provider and the facility or organization seeking status as a department of the main provider, a remote location of a hospital, or a satellite facility have the same governing body.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The facility or organization is operated under the same organizational documents as the main provider. For example, the facility or organization seeking provider-based status must be subject to common bylaws and operating decisions of the governing body of the main provider where it is based.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The main provider has final responsibility for administrative decisions, final approval for contracts with outside parties, final approval for personnel actions, final responsibility for personnel policies (such as fringe benefits or code of conduct), and final approval for medical staff appointments in the facility or organization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Administration and supervision. The reporting relationship between the facility or organization seeking provider-based status and the main provider must have the same frequency, intensity, and level of accountability that exists in the relationship between the main provider and one of its existing departments, as evidenced by compliance with all of the following requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The facility or organization is under the direct supervision of the main provider.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The facility or organization is operated under the same monitoring and oversight by the provider as any other department of the provider, and is operated just as any other department of the provider with regard to supervision and accountability. The facility or organization director or individual responsible for daily operations at the entity--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Maintains a reporting relationship with a manager at the main provider that has the same frequency, intensity, and level of accountability that exists in the relationship between the main provider and its existing departments; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Is accountable to the governing body of the main provider, in the same manner as any department head of the provider.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The following administrative functions of the facility or organization are integrated with those of the

provider where the facility or organization is based: billing services, records, human resources, payroll, employee benefit package, salary structure, and purchasing services. Either the same employees or group of employees handle these administrative functions for the facility or organization and the main provider, or the administrative functions for both the facility or organization and the entity are--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Contracted out under the same contract agreement; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Handled under different contract agreements, with the contract of the facility or organization being managed by the main provider.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Location. The facility or organization meets the requirements in paragraph (e)(3)(i), (e)(3)(ii), (e)(3)(iii), (e)(3)(iv), (e)(3)(v), or, in the case of an RHC, paragraph (e)(3)(vi) of this section, and the requirements in paragraph (e)(3)(vii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The facility or organization is located within a 35-mile radius of the campus of the hospital or CAH that is the potential main provider.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The facility or organization is owned and operated by a hospital or CAH that has a disproportionate share adjustment (as determined under Sec. 412.106 of this chapter) greater than 11.75 percent or is described in Sec. 412.106(c)(2) of this chapter implementing section 1886(d)(5)(F)(i)(II) of the Act and is--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Owned or operated by a unit of State or local government;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A public or nonprofit corporation that is formally granted governmental powers by a unit of State or local government;

Other than staff that may be paid under such a Medicare fee schedule, the main provider may not utilize the services of ``leased'' employees (that is, personnel who are actually employed by the management company but provide services for the provider under a staff leasing or similar agreement) that are directly involved in the delivery of patient care.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The administrative functions of the facility or organization are integrated with those of the main provider, as determined under criteria in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The main provider has significant control over the operations of the facility or organization as determined under criteria in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The management contract is held by the main provider itself, not by a parent organization that has control over both the main provider and the facility or organization.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Furnishing all services under arrangement.
