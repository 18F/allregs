                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you use insurance to satisfy all or part of your obligation  to demonstrate OSFR, you may use only insurance certificates issued by  insurers that have achieved a ``Secure'' rating for claims paying  ability in their latest review by A.M. Best's Insurance Reports,  Standard & Poor's Insurance Rating Services, or other equivalent rating  made by a rating service acceptable to BOEM.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must submit information about your insurers to BOEM on a  completed and unaltered Form BOEM-1019. The information you submit must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Include all the information required by Sec.  553.41 and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be executed on one original insurance certificate (i.e., Form  BOEM-1019)   for each OSFR layer (see paragraph (c) of this section), showing all  participating insurers and their proportion (quota share) of this risk.  The certificate must bear the original signatures of each insurer's  underwriter or of their lead underwriters, underwriting managers, or  delegated brokers, depending on who is authorized to bind the  underwriter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For each insurance company on the insurance certificate,  indicate the insurer's claims-paying-ability rating and the rating  service that issued the rating.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The insurance evidence you provide to BOEM as OSFR evidence may  be divided into layers, subject to the following restrictions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The total amount of OSFR evidence must equal the total amount  you must demonstrate under Sec.  553.13;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No more than one insurance certificate may be used to cover each  OSFR layer specified in Sec.  553.13(b) (i.e., four layers for an OCS  COF, and five layers for a non-OCS COF);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You may use one insurance certificate to cover any number of  consecutive OSFR layers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each insurer's participation in the covered insurance risk must  be on a proportional (quota share) basis, must be expressed as a  percentage of a whole layer, and the certificate must not contain  intermediate, horizontal layers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> You may use an insurance deductible. If you use more than one  insurance certificate, the deductible amount must apply only to the  certificate that covers the base OSFR amount layer. To satisfy an  insurance deductible, you may use only those methods that are acceptable  as evidence of OSFR under this part; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> You must identify a U.S. agent for service of process on each  insurance certificate you submit to BOEM. The agent may be different for  each insurance certificate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You may submit to BOEM a temporary insurance confirmation (fax  binder) for each insurance certificate you use as OSFR evidence. Submit  your fax binder on Form BOEM-1019, and each form must include the  signature of an underwriter for at least one of the participating  insurers. BOEM will accept your fax binder as OSFR evidence during a  period that ends 90 days after the date that you need the insurance to  demonstrate OSFR.</p>
