                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Delegating functions. As provided in agency procedures,  contracting officers may delegate contract administration or specialized  support services, either through interagency agreements or by direct  request to the cognizant CAO listed in the Federal Directory of Contract  Administration Services Components. The delegation should include--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name and address of the CAO designated to perform the  administration (this information also shall be entered in the contract);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any special instructions, including any functions withheld or  any specific authorization to perform functions listed in 42.302(b);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A copy of the contract to be administered; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Copies of all contracting agency regulations or directives that  are--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Incorporated into the contract by reference; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Otherwise necessary to administer the contract, unless copies  have been provided previously.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Special instructions. As necessary, the contracting officer also  shall advise the contractor (and other activities as appropriate) of any  functions withheld from or additional functions delegated to the CAO.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Delegating additional functions. For individual contracts or  groups of contracts, the contracting office may delegate to the CAO  functions not listed in 42.302: Provided that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prior coordination with the CAO ensures the availability of  required resources;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of authority to issue orders under provisioning  procedures in existing contracts and under basic ordering agreements for  items and services identified in the schedule, the head of the  contracting activity or designee approves the delegation; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The delegation does not require the CAO to undertake new or  follow-on acquisitions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Rescinding functions. The contracting officer at the requesting  agency may rescind or recall a delegation to administer a contract or  perform a contract administration function, except for functions  pertaining to cost accounting standards and negotiation of forward  pricing rates and indirect cost rates (also see 42.003). The requesting  agency must coordinate with the CAO to establish a reasonable transition  period prior to rescinding or recalling the delegation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Secondary delegations of contract administration. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A CAO that  has been delegated administration of a contract under paragraph (a) or  (c) of this section, or a contracting office retaining contract  administration, may request supporting contract administration from the  CAO cognizant of the contractor location where performance of specific  contract administration functions is required. The request shall--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Be in writing;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Clearly state the specific functions to be performed; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Be accompanied by a copy of pertinent contractual and other  necessary documents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The prime contractor is responsible for managing its  subcontracts. The CAO's review of subcontracts is normally limited to  evaluating the prime contractor's management of the subcontracts (see  Part 44). Therefore, supporting contract administration shall not be  used for subcontracts unless--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Government otherwise would incur undue cost;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Successful completion of the prime contract is threatened; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> It is authorized under paragraph (f) of this section or  elsewhere in this regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Special surveillance. For major system acquisitions (see part  34), the contracting officer may designate certain high risk or critical  subsystems or components for special surveillance in addition to  requesting supporting contract administration. This surveillance shall  be conducted in a manner consistent with the policy of requesting that  the cognizant CAO perform contract administration functions at a  contractor's facility (see 42.002).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Refusing delegation of contract administration. An agency may  decline a request for contract administration services on a case-by-case  basis if resources of the agency are inadequate to accomplish the tasks.  Declinations shall be in writing.</p>
