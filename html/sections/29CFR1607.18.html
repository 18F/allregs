                            <p class="depth0">The official title of these guidelines is ``Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (1978)''. The Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (1978) are intended to establish a uniform Federal position in the area of prohibiting discrimination in employment practices on grounds of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. These guidelines have been adopted by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Labor, the Department of Justice, and the Civil Service Commission.</p><p class="depth0">The official citation is:</p><p class="depth0">Section __, Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedure (1978); 43 FR __ (August 25, 1978).</p><p class="depth0">The short form citation is:</p><p class="depth0">Section __, U.G.E.S.P. (1978); 43 FR __ (August 25, 1978).</p><p class="depth0">When the guidelines are cited in connection with the activities of one of

the issuing agencies, a specific citation to the regulations of that agency can be added at the end of the above citation. The specific additional citations are as follows:
