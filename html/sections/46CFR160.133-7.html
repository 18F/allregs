                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To seek Coast Guard approval of a release mechanism, a  manufacturer must comply with, and each release mechanism must meet, the  requirements of the following--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> IMO LSA Code, as amended by Resolution MSC.320(89), chapter IV/ 4.4.7.6 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 160.133-5 of this  subpart), and a release mechanism for free-fall lifeboats must also meet  the applicable provisions of chapter VI/6.1.4;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> IMO Revised recommendation on testing, as amended by Resolution  MSC.321(89), Part 1/6.9 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 160.133-5  of this subpart);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> 46 CFR part 159; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> This subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each release mechanism must meet the following requirements--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Design. All functions of the release mechanism, including  removal of interlocks, operation of the release handle, resetting the  hooks, and reattaching the falls to the hooks, must be designed to be  operable by persons wearing immersion suits;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each release mechanism should be designed following standard  human engineering practices described in ASTM F 1166 (incorporated by  reference, see Sec. 160.133-5 of this subpart). Design limits should be  based on a range from the fifth percentile female to the ninety-fifth  percentile male values for critical body dimensions and functional  capabilities as described in ASTM F 1166. The dimensions for a person  wearing an immersion suit correspond to the arctic clothed dimensions of  ASTM F 1166;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Steel. Each major structural component of each release mechanism  must be constructed of corrosion-resistant steel. Corrosion-resistant  steel must be a type 302 stainless steel per ASTM A 276, ASTM A 313 or  ASTM A 314 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 160.133-5 of this  subpart). Other corrosion-resistant materials may be used if accepted by  the Commandant as having equivalent or superior corrosion-resistant  characteristics;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Welding. Welding must be performed by welders certified by the  Commandant, a classification society recognized by the Commandant in  accordance with 46 CFR 8.220, the U.S. Navy, or the national body where  the release mechanism is constructed or the national body's designated  recognized organization. Only electrodes intended for use with the  material being welded may be used. All welds must be checked using  appropriate non-destructive tests;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Metals in contact with each other must be either galvanically  compatible or insulated with suitable non-porous materials. Provisions  must also be made to prevent loosening or tightening resulting from  differences of thermal expansion, freezing, buckling of parts, galvanic  corrosion, or other incompatibilities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Screws, nuts, bolts, pins, keys, and other similar hardware,  securing moving parts must be fitted with suitable lock washers, cotter  pins, or locks to prevent them from coming adrift;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The on-load operation of the release mechanism must require two  separate, deliberate actions by the operator;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The mechanical protection required by ``IMO'', LSA Code, as  amended by Resolution MSC.320(89), Chapter IV/4.4.7.6.2.2 must only be  able to be engaged when the release mechanism is   properly and completely reset. Proper engagement of the mechanical  protection must be visually indicated;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The release and recovery procedures required by ``IMO'' LSA  Code, as amended by Resolution MSC.320(89),Chapter IV/4.4.7.6.5 must be  included as an illustrated operation instruction plate or placard. The  plate or placard must be corrosion resistant and weatherproof and must  be marked with the word ``Danger''. The illustrations must correspond  exactly to those used in the instruction and maintenance manual provided  by the manufacturer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The release lever or control must be red in color, and the area  immediately surrounding the control must be a sharply contrasting light  color;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> The release lever and its connection to the release mechanism  must be of sufficient strength so that there is no deformation of the  release lever or the release control assembly during on-load release;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Positive means of lubrication must be provided for each bearing  which is not permanently lubricated. Points of lubrication must be so  located that they are clearly visible and accessible in the installed  position in the boat;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> A hydraulic system, if used to activate the release mechanism,  must be in accordance with 46 CFR part 58, subpart 58.30, with hose and  fittings in accordance with 46 CFR part 56, subpart 56.60, except that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Push-on type fittings such as Aeroquip 1525-X, 25156-X, and  FC332-X are not permitted;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The length of nonmetallic flexible hose is limited to 760 mm  (30 in); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If a hand pump is provided, adequate space must be provided  for the hand pump or hand operation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Each release mechanism designed to launch a boat by free-fall  must not be able to carry any weight until the release mechanism is  properly reset, and each of the two independent activation systems  required to be operated from inside the boat must require at least two  independent actions from different locations inside the boat to release  the hook; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determinations of equivalence of design, construction, and  materials will be made by the Commandant only.  [USCG-2010-0048, 76 FR 62983, Oct. 11, 2011, as amended by 79 FR 44139,  July 30, 2014]</p>
