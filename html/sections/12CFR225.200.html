                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. Under section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act (12  U.S.C. 377) and section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12  U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)), a nonbank subsidiary of a bank holding company may  to a limited extent underwrite and deal in securities for which  underwriting and dealing by a member bank is prohibited. Pursuant to the  Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, these  so-called section 20 subsidiaries are required to register with the SEC  as broker-dealers and are subject to all the financial reporting, anti- fraud and financial responsibility rules applicable to broker-dealers.  In addition,   transactions between insured depository institutions and their section  20 affiliates are restricted by sections 23A and 23B of the Federal  Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371c and 371c-1). The Board expects a section 20  subsidiary, like any other subsidiary of a bank holding company, to be  operated prudently. Doing so would include observing corporate  formalities (such as the maintenance of separate accounting and  corporate records), and instituting appropriate risk management,  including independent trading and exposure limits consistent with parent  company guidelines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Conditions. As a condition of each order approving establishment  of a section 20 subsidiary, a bank holding company shall comply with the  following conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Capital. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A bank holding company shall maintain adequate  capital on a fully consolidated basis. If operating a section 20  authorized to underwrite and deal in all types of debt and equity  securities, a bank holding company shall maintain strong capital on a  fully consolidated basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the event that a bank or thrift affiliate of a section 20  subsidiary shall become less than well capitalized (as defined in  section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1831o), and  the bank holding company shall fail to restore it promptly to the well  capitalized level, the Board may, in its discretion, reimpose the  funding, credit extension and credit enhancement firewalls contained in  its 1989 order allowing underwriting and dealing in bank-ineligible  securities, \1\ or order the bank holding company to divest the section  20 subsidiary. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ Firewalls 5-8, 19, 21 and 22 of J.P.

In  the event that the Board determines that the foreign bank's capital has  fallen below these levels and the foreign bank fails to restore its  capital position promptly, the Board may, in its discretion, reimpose  the funding, credit extension and credit enhancement firewalls contained  in its 1990 order allowing foreign banks to underwrite and deal in bank- ineligible securities, \2\ or order the foreign bank to divest the  section 20 subsidiary. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ Firewalls 5-8, 19, 21 and 22 of Canadian Imperial Bank of  Commerce, The Royal Bank of Canada, Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC,  76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 158, (1990). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Internal controls. (i) Each bank holding company or foreign bank  shall cause its subsidiary banks, thrifts, branches or agencies \3\ to  adopt policies and procedures, including appropriate limits on exposure,  to govern their participation in transactions underwritten or arranged  by a section 20 affiliate. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\3\ The terms ``branch'' and ``agency'' refer to a U.S. branch and  agency of a foreign bank. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Each bank holding company or foreign bank shall ensure that an  independent and thorough credit evaluation has been undertaken in  connection with participation by a bank, thrift, or branch or agency in  such transactions, and that adequate documentation of that evaluation is  maintained for review by examiners of the appropriate federal banking  agency and the Federal Reserve.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Interlocks restriction. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Directors, officers or employees of  a bank or thrift subsidiary of a bank holding company, or a bank or  thrift subsidiary or branch or agency of a foreign bank, shall not serve  as a majority of the board of directors or the chief executive officer  of an affiliated section 20 subsidiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Directors, officers or employees of a section 20 subsidiary  shall not serve as a majority of the board of directors or the chief  executive officer of an affiliated bank or thrift subsidiary or branch  or agency, except that the manager of a branch or agency may act as a  director of the underwriting subsidiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of this standard, the manager of a branch or  agency of a foreign bank generally will be considered to be the chief  executive officer of the branch or agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Customer disclosure--(i) Disclosure to section 20 customers. A  section 20 subsidiary shall provide, in writing, to   each of its retail customers, \4\ at the time an investment account is  opened, the same minimum disclosures, and obtain the same customer  acknowledgment, described in the Interagency Statement on Retail Sales  of Nondeposit Investment Products (Statement) as applicable in such  situations. These disclosures must be provided regardless of whether the  section 20 subsidiary is itself engaged in activities through  arrangements with a bank that is covered by the Statement. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\4\ For purposes of this operating standard, a retail customer is  any customer that is not an ``accredited investor'' as defined in 17 CFR  230.501(a). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Disclosures accompanying investment advice. A director,  officer, or employee of a bank, thrift, branch or agency may not express  an opinion on the value or the advisability of the purchase or the sale  of a bank-ineligible security that he or she knows is being underwritten  or dealt in by a section 20 affiliate unless he or she notifies the  customer of the affiliate's role.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Intra-day credit. Any intra-day extension of credit to a section  20 subsidiary by an affiliated bank, thrift, branch or agency shall be  on market terms consistent with section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Restriction on funding purchases of securities during  underwriting period. No bank, thrift, branch or agency shall knowingly  extend credit to a customer secured by, or for the purpose of  purchasing, any bank-ineligible security that a section 20 affiliate is  underwriting or has underwritten within the past 30 days, unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The extension of credit is made pursuant to, and consistent with  any conditions imposed in a preexisting line of credit that was not  established in contemplation of the underwriting; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The extension of credit is made in connection with clearing  transactions for the section 20 affiliate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Reporting requirement. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Each bank holding company or foreign  bank shall submit quarterly to the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank any  FOCUS report filed with the NASD or other self-regulatory organizations,  and any information required by the Board to monitor compliance with  these operating standards and section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act, on  forms provided by the Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the event that a section 20 subsidiary is required to  furnish notice concerning its capitalization to the Securities and  Exchange Commission pursuant to 17 CFR 240.17a-11, a copy of the notice  shall be filed concurrently with the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Foreign banks. A foreign bank shall ensure that any extension of  credit by its branch or agency to a section 20 affiliate, and any  purchase by such branch or agency, as principal or fiduciary, of  securities for which a section 20 affiliate is a principal underwriter,  conforms to sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, and that  its branches and agencies not advertise or suggest that they are  responsible for the obligations of a section 20 affiliate, consistent  with section 23B(c) of the Federal Reserve Act.

Appendix A to Part 225--Capital Adequacy Guidelines for Bank</p><p class="depth0">Holding Companies: Risk-Based Measure</p><p class="depth0">I. Overview</p><p class="depth0">The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has adopted a  risk-based capital measure to assist in the assessment of the capital  adequacy of bank holding companies (banking organizations). \1\ The  principal objectives of this measure are to: (i) Make regulatory capital  requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among  banking organizations; (ii) factor off-balance sheet exposures into the  assessment of capital adequacy; (iii) minimize disincentives to holding  liquid, low-risk assets; and (iv) achieve greater consistency in the  evaluation of the capital adequacy of major banking organizations  throughout the world. \2\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ Supervisory ratios that relate capital to total assets for bank  holding companies are outlined in appendices B and D of this part.</p><p class="depth0">\2\ The risk-based capital measure is based upon a framework  developed jointly by supervisory authorities from the countries  represented on the Basle Committee on Banking Regulations and  Supervisory Practices (Basle Supervisors' Committee) and endorsed by the  Group of Ten Central Bank Governors. The framework is described in a  paper prepared by the BSC entitled ``International Convergence of  Capital Measurement,'' July 1988.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of  capital and a framework for calculating weighted risk assets by  assigning assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories.  An institution's risk-based capital ratio is calculated by dividing its  qualifying capital (the numerator of the ratio) by its weighted risk  assets (the denominator). \3\ The definition of qualifying capital is  outlined below in section II, and the procedures for calculating  weighted risk assets are discussed in section III. Attachment I  illustrates a sample calculation of weighted risk assets and the risk- based capital ratio. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\3\ Banking organizations will initially be expected to utilize  period-end amounts in calculating their risk-based capital ratios. When  necessary and appropriate, ratios based on average balances may also be  calculated on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, to the extent banking  organizations have data on average balances that can be used to  calculate risk-based ratios, the Federal Reserve will take such data  into account. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">In addition, when certain organizations that engage in trading  activities calculate their risk-based capital ratio under this appendix  A, they must also refer to appendix E of this part, which incorporates  capital charges for certain market risks into the risk-based capital  ratio. When calculating their risk-based capital ratio under this  appendix A, such organizations are required to refer to appendix E of  this part for supplemental rules to determine qualifying and excess  capital, calculate risk-weighted assets, calculate market risk  equivalent assets, and calculate risk-based capital ratios adjusted for  market risk.</p><p class="depth0">The risk-based capital guidelines also establish a schedule for  achieving a minimum supervisory standard for the ratio of qualifying  capital to weighted risk assets and provide for transitional  arrangements during a phase-in period to facilitate adoption and  implementation of the measure at the end of 1992. These interim  standards and transitional arrangements are set forth in section IV.</p><p class="depth0">The risk-based guidelines apply on a consolidated basis to any bank  holding company with consolidated assets of $500 million or more. The  risk-based guidelines also apply on a consolidated basis to any bank  holding company with consolidated assets of less than $500 million if  the holding company (i) is engaged in significant nonbanking activities  either directly or through a nonbank subsidiary; (ii) conducts  significant off-balance sheet activities (including securitization and  asset management or administration) either directly or through a nonbank  subsidiary; or (iii) has a material amount of debt or equity securities  outstanding (other than trust preferred securities) that are registered  with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Federal Reserve  may apply the risk-based guidelines at its discretion to any bank  holding company, regardless of asset size, if such action is warranted  for supervisory purposes. \4\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\4\ [Reserved] ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">The risk-based guidelines are to be used in the inspection and  supervisory process as well as in the analysis of applications acted  upon by the Federal Reserve. Thus, in considering an application filed  by a bank holding company, the Federal Reserve will take into account  the organization's risk-based capital ratio, the reasonableness of its  capital plans, and the degree of progress it has demonstrated toward  meeting the interim and final risk-based capital standards.</p><p class="depth0">The risk-based capital ratio focuses principally on broad categories  of credit risk, although the framework for assigning assets and off- balance sheet items to risk categories does incorporate elements of  transfer risk, as well as limited instances of interest rate and market  risk. The risk-based ratio does not, however, incorporate other factors  that can affect an organization's financial condition. These factors  include overall interest rate exposure; liquidity, funding and market  risks; the quality and level of earnings; investment or loan portfolio  concentrations; the quality of loans and investments; the effectiveness  of loan and investment policies; and management's ability to monitor and  control financial and operating risks.</p><p class="depth0">In addition to evaluating capital ratios, an overall assessment of  capital adequacy must take account of these other factors, including, in  particular, the level and severity of problem and classified assets. For  this reason, the final supervisory judgment on an organization's capital  adequacy may differ significantly from conclusions that might be drawn  solely from the level of the organization's risk-based capital ratio.</p><p class="depth0">The risk-based capital guidelines establish minimum ratios of  capital to weighted risk assets. In light of the considerations just  discussed, banking organizations generally are expected to operate well  above the minimum risk-based ratios. In particular, banking  organizations contemplating significant expansion proposals are expected  to maintain strong capital levels substantially above the minimum ratios  and should not allow significant diminution of financial strength below  these strong levels to fund their expansion plans. Institutions with  high or inordinate   levels of risk are also expected to operate above minimum capital  standards. In all cases, institutions should hold capital commensurate  with the level and nature of the risks to which they are exposed.  Banking organizations that do not meet the minimum risk-based standard,  or that are otherwise considered to be inadequately capitalized, are  expected to develop and implement plans acceptable to the Federal  Reserve for achieving adequate levels of capital within a reasonable  period of time.</p><p class="depth0">The Board will monitor the implementation and effect of these  guidelines in relation to domestic and international developments in the  banking industry. When necessary and appropriate, the Board will  consider the need to modify the guidelines in light of any significant  changes in the economy, financial markets, banking practices, or other  relevant factors.</p><p class="depth0">The Federal Reserve may determine that the regulatory capital  treatment for a banking organization's exposure or other relationship to  an entity not consolidated on the banking organization's balance sheet  is not commensurate with the actual risk relationship of the banking  organization to the entity. In making this determination, the Federal  Reserve may require the banking organization to treat the entity as if  it were consolidated onto the balance sheet of the banking organization  for risk-based capital purposes and calculate the appropriate risk-based  capital ratios accordingly, all as specified by the Federal Reserve.</p><p class="depth0">II. Definition of Qualifying Capital for the Risk Based Capital Ratio</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A banking organization's qualifying total capital consists of  two types of capital components: ``core capital elements'' (tier 1  capital elements) and ``supplementary capital elements'' (tier 2 capital  elements). These capital elements and the various limits, restrictions,  and deductions to which they are subject, are discussed below. To  qualify as an element of tier 1 or tier 2 capital, an instrument must be  fully paid up and effectively unsecured. Accordingly, if a banking  organization has purchased, or has directly or indirectly funded the  purchase of, its own capital instrument, that instrument generally is  disqualified from inclusion in regulatory capital. A qualifying tier 1  or tier 2 capital instrument must be subordinated to all senior  indebtedness of the organization. If issued by a bank, it also must be  subordinated to claims of depositors. In addition, the instrument must  not contain or be covered by any covenants, terms, or restrictions that  are inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On a case-by-case basis, the Federal Reserve may determine  whether, and to what extent, any instrument that does not fit wholly  within the terms of a capital element set forth below, or that does not  have the characteristics or the ability to absorb losses commensurate  with the capital treatment specified below, will qualify as an element  of tier 1 or tier 2 capital. In making such a determination, the Federal  Reserve will consider the similarity of the instrument to instruments  explicitly addressed in the guidelines; the ability of the instrument to  absorb losses, particularly while the organization operates as a going  concern; the maturity and redemption features of the instrument; and  other relevant terms and factors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The redemption of capital instruments before stated maturity  could have a significant impact on an organization's overall capital  structure. Consequently, an organization should consult with the Federal  Reserve before redeeming any equity or other capital instrument included  in tier 1 or tier 2 capital prior to stated maturity if such redemption  could have a material effect on the level or composition of the  organization's capital base. Such consultation generally would not be  necessary when the instrument is to be redeemed with the proceeds of, or  replaced by, a like amount of a capital instrument that is of equal or  higher quality with regard to terms and maturity and the Federal Reserve  considers the organization's capital position to be fully sufficient.</p><p class="depth0">A. The Definition and Components of Qualifying Capital</p><p class="depth0">1. Tier 1 capital. Tier 1 capital generally is defined as the sum of  core capital elements less any amounts of goodwill, other intangible  assets, interest-only strips receivables, deferred tax assets,  nonfinancial equity investments, and other items that are required to be  deducted in accordance with section II.B. of this appendix. Tier 1  capital must represent at least 50 percent of qualifying total capital.</p><p class="depth0">a. Core capital elements (tier 1 capital elements). The elements  qualifying for inclusion in the tier 1 component of a banking  organization's qualifying total capital are:</p><p class="depth0">i. Qualifying common stockholders' equity;</p><p class="depth0">ii. Qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, including  related surplus, and senior perpetual preferred stock issued to the  United States Department of the Treasury (Treasury) under the Troubled  Asset Relief Program (TARP), established by the Emergency Economic  Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA), Division A of Public Law 110-343  (which for purposes of this appendix shall be considered qualifying  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock), including related surplus;</p><p class="depth0">iii. Minority interest related to qualifying common or noncumulative  perpetual preferred stock directly issued by a consolidated U.S.  depository institution or foreign bank subsidiary (Class A minority  interest); and</p><p class="depth0">iv. Restricted core capital elements. The aggregate of these items  is limited within tier 1 capital as set forth in section II.A.1.b. of  this appendix. These elements are defined to include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock (including  related surplus);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Minority interest related to qualifying cumulative perpetual  preferred stock directly issued by a consolidated U.S. depository  institution or foreign bank subsidiary (Class B minority interest);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Minority interest related to qualifying common stockholders'  equity or perpetual preferred stock issued by a consolidated subsidiary  that is neither a U.S. depository institution nor a foreign bank (Class  C minority interest);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Qualifying trust preferred securities; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Subordinated debentures issued prior to October 4, 2010, to the  Treasury under the TARP (TARP Subordinated Securities) established by  the EESA by a bank holding company that has made a valid election to be  taxed under Subchapter S of Chapter 1 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code  (S-Corp BHC) or by a bank holding company organized in mutual form  (Mutual BHC).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The  aggregate amount of restricted core capital elements that may be  included in the tier 1 capital of a banking organization must not exceed  25 percent of the sum of all core capital elements, including restricted  core capital elements, net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax  liability. Stated differently, the aggregate amount of restricted core  capital elements is limited to one-third of the sum of core capital  elements, excluding restricted core capital elements, net of goodwill  less any associated deferred tax liability. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, the full amount of TARP Subordinated Securities issued by an  S-Corp BHC or Mutual BHC may be included in its tier 1 capital, provided  that the banking organization must include the TARP Subordinated  Securities in restricted core capital elements for the purposes of  determining the aggregate amount of other restricted core capital  elements that may be included in tier 1 capital in accordance with this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In addition, the aggregate amount of restricted core capital  elements (other than qualifying mandatory convertible preferred  securities \5\) that may be included in the tier 1 capital of an  internationally active banking organization \6\ must not exceed 15  percent of the sum of all core capital elements, including restricted  core capital elements, net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax  liability. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\5\ Qualifying mandatory convertible preferred securities generally  consist of the joint issuance by a bank holding company to investors of  trust preferred securities and a forward purchase contract, which the  investors fully collateralize with the securities, that obligates the  investors to purchase a fixed amount of the bank holding company's  common stock, generally in three years. A bank holding company wishing  to issue mandatorily convertible preferred securities and include them  in tier 1 capital must consult with the Federal Reserve prior to  issuance to ensure that the securities' terms are consistent with tier 1  capital treatment.</p><p class="depth0">\6\ For this purpose, an internationally active banking organization  is a banking organization that (1) as of its most recent year-end FR Y- 9C reports total consolidated assets equal to $250 billion or more or  (2) on a consolidated basis, reports total on-balance-sheet foreign  exposure of $10 billion or more on its filings of the most recent year- end FFIEC 009 Country Exposure Report. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Amounts of restricted core capital elements in excess of this  limit generally may be included in tier 2 capital. The excess amounts of  restricted core capital elements that are in the form of Class C  minority interest and qualifying trust preferred securities are subject  to further limitation within tier 2 capital in accordance with section  II.A.2.d.iv. of this appendix. A banking organization may attribute  excess amounts of restricted core capital elements first to any  qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock or to Class B minority  interest, and second to qualifying trust preferred securities or to  Class C minority interest, which are subject to a tier 2 sublimit.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Transition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The quantitative limits for restricted core capital elements set  forth in sections II.A.1.b.i. and II.A.2.d.iv. of this appendix become  effective on March 31, 2011. Prior to that time, a banking organization  with restricted core capital elements in amounts that cause it to exceed  these limits must consult with the Federal Reserve on a plan for  ensuring that the banking organization is not unduly relying on these  elements in its capital base and, where appropriate, for reducing such  reliance to ensure that the organization complies with these limits as  of March 31, 2011.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Until March 31, 2011, the aggregate amount of qualifying  cumulative perpetual preferred stock (including related surplus) and  qualifying trust preferred securities that a banking organization may  include in tier 1 capital is limited to 25 percent of the sum of   the following core capital elements: qualifying common stockholders'  equity, Qualifying noncumulative and cumulative perpetual preferred  stock (including related surplus), qualifying minority interest in the  equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, and qualifying trust  preferred securities. Amounts of qualifying cumulative perpetual  preferred stock (including related surplus) and qualifying trust  preferred securities in excess of this limit may be included in tier 2  capital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Until March 31, 2011, internationally active banking  organizations generally are expected to limit the amount of qualifying  cumulative perpetual preferred stock (including related surplus) and  qualifying trust preferred securities included in tier 1 capital to 15  percent of the sum of core capital elements set forth in section  II.A.1.b.ii.2. of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">c. Definitions and requirements for core capital elements--i.  Qualifying common stockholders' equity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Definition. Qualifying common stockholders' equity is limited to  common stock; related surplus; and retained earnings, including capital  reserves and adjustments for the cumulative effect of foreign currency  translation, net of any treasury stock, less net unrealized holding  losses on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable  fair values. For this purpose, net unrealized holding gains on such  equity securities and net unrealized holding gains (losses) on  available-for-sale debt securities are not included in qualifying common  stockholders' equity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Restrictions on terms and features. A capital instrument that  has a stated maturity date or that has a preference with regard to  liquidation or the payment of dividends is not deemed to be a component  of qualifying common stockholders' equity, regardless of whether or not  it is called common equity. Terms or features that grant other  preferences also may call into question whether the capital instrument  would be deemed to be qualifying common stockholders' equity. Features  that require, or provide significant incentives for, the issuer to  redeem the instrument for cash or cash equivalents will render the  instrument ineligible as a component of qualifying common stockholders'  equity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reliance on voting common stockholders' equity. Although section  II.A.1. of this appendix allows for the inclusion of elements other than  common stockholders' equity within tier 1 capital, voting common  stockholders' equity, which is the most desirable capital element from a  supervisory standpoint, generally should be the dominant element within  tier 1 capital. Thus, banking organizations should avoid over-reliance  on preferred stock and nonvoting elements within tier 1 capital. Such  nonvoting elements can include portions of common stockholders' equity  where, for example, a banking organization has a class of nonvoting  common equity, or a class of voting common equity that has substantially  fewer voting rights per share than another class of voting common  equity. Where a banking organization relies excessively on nonvoting  elements within tier 1 capital, the Federal Reserve generally will  require the banking organization to allocate a portion of the nonvoting  elements to tier 2 capital.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Qualifying perpetual preferred stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Qualifying requirements. Perpetual preferred stock qualifying  for inclusion in tier 1 capital has no maturity date and cannot be  redeemed at the option of the holder. Perpetual preferred stock will  qualify for inclusion in tier 1 capital only if it can absorb losses  while the issuer operates as a going concern.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Restrictions on terms and features. Perpetual preferred stock  included in tier 1 capital may not have any provisions restricting the  banking organization's ability or legal right to defer or waive  dividends, other than provisions requiring prior or concurrent deferral  or waiver of payments on more junior instruments, which the Federal  Reserve generally expects in such instruments consistent with the notion  that the most junior capital elements should absorb losses first.  Dividend deferrals or waivers for preferred stock, which the Federal  Reserve expects will occur either voluntarily or at its direction when  an organization is in a weakened condition, must not be subject to  arrangements that would diminish the ability of the deferral to shore up  the banking organization's resources. Any perpetual preferred stock with  a feature permitting redemption at the option of the issuer may qualify  as tier 1 capital only if the redemption is subject to prior approval of  the Federal Reserve. Features that require, or create significant  incentives for the issuer to redeem the instrument for cash or cash  equivalents will render the instrument ineligible for inclusion in tier  1 capital. For example, perpetual preferred stock that has a credit- sensitive dividend feature--that is, a dividend rate that is reset  periodically based, in whole or in part, on the banking organization's  current credit standing--generally does not qualify for inclusion in  tier 1 capital. \7\ Similarly, perpetual preferred stock that has a   dividend rate step-up or a market value conversion feature--that is, a  feature whereby the holder must or can convert the preferred stock into  common stock at the market price prevailing at the time of conversion-- generally does not qualify for inclusion in tier 1 capital. \8\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\7\ Traditional floating-rate or adjustable-rate perpetual preferred  stock (that is, perpetual preferred stock in which the dividend rate is  not affected by the issuer's credit standing or financial condition but  is adjusted periodically in relation to an independent index based  solely on general market interest rates), however, generally qualifies  for inclusion in tier 1 capital provided all other requirements are met.</p><p class="depth0">\8\ Notwithstanding this provision, senior perpetual preferred stock  issued to the Treasury under the TARP, established by the EESA, may be  included in tier 1 capital. In addition, traditional convertible  perpetual preferred stock, which the holder must or can convert into a  fixed number of common shares at a preset price, generally qualifies for  inclusion in tier 1 capital provided all other requirements are met. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Noncumulative and cumulative features. Perpetual preferred stock  that is noncumulative generally may not permit the accumulation or  payment of unpaid dividends in any form, including in the form of common  stock. Perpetual preferred stock that provides for the accumulation or  future payment of unpaid dividends is deemed to be cumulative,  regardless of whether or not it is called noncumulative.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Qualifying minority interest. Minority interest in the common  and preferred stockholders' equity accounts of a consolidated subsidiary  (minority interest) represents stockholders' equity associated with  common or preferred equity instruments issued by a banking  organization's consolidated subsidiary that are held by investors other  than the banking organization. Minority interest is included in tier 1  capital because, as a general rule, it represents equity that is freely  available to absorb losses in the issuing subsidiary. Nonetheless,  minority interest typically is not available to absorb losses in the  banking organization as a whole, a feature that is a particular concern  when the minority interest is issued by a subsidiary that is neither a  U.S. depository institution nor a foreign bank. For this reason, this  appendix distinguishes among three types of qualifying minority  interest. Class A minority interest is minority interest related to  qualifying common and noncumulative perpetual preferred equity  instruments issued directly (that is, not through a subsidiary) by a  consolidated U.S. depository institution \9\ or foreign bank \10\  subsidiary of a banking organization. Class A minority interest is not  subject to a formal limitation within tier 1 capital. Class B minority  interest is minority interest related to qualifying cumulative perpetual  preferred equity instruments issued directly by a consolidated U.S.  depository institution or foreign bank subsidiary of a banking  organization. Class B minority interest is a restricted core capital  element subject to the limitations set forth in section II.A.1.b.i. of  this appendix, but is not subject to a tier 2 sub-limit. Class C  minority interest is minority interest related to qualifying common or  perpetual preferred stock issued by a banking organization's  consolidated subsidiary that is neither a U.S. depository institution  nor a foreign bank. Class C minority interest is eligible for inclusion  in tier 1 capital as a restricted core capital element and is subject to  the limitations set forth in sections II.A.1.b.i. and II.A.2.d.iv. of  this appendix. Minority interest in small business investment companies,  investment funds that hold nonfinancial equity investments (as defined  in section II.B.5.b. of this appendix), and subsidiaries engaged in  nonfinancial activities are not included in the banking organization's  tier 1 or total capital if the banking organization's interest in the  company or fund is held under one of the legal authorities listed in  section II.B.5.b. of this appendix. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\9\ U.S. depository institutions are defined to include branches  (foreign and domestic) of federally insured banks and depository  institutions chartered and headquartered in the 50 states of the United  States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and U.S. territories and  possessions. The definition encompasses banks, mutual or stock savings  banks, savings or building and loan associations, cooperative banks,  credit unions, and international banking facilities of domestic banks.</p><p class="depth0">\10\ For this purpose, a foreign bank is defined as an institution  that engages in the business of banking; is recognized as a bank by the  bank supervisory or monetary authorities of the country of its  organization or principal banking operations; receives deposits to a  substantial extent in the regular course of business; and has the power  to accept demand deposits. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">iv. Qualifying trust preferred securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A banking organization that wishes to issue trust preferred  securities and include them in tier 1 capital must first consult with  the Federal Reserve. Trust preferred securities are defined as undated  preferred securities issued by a trust or similar entity sponsored (but  generally not consolidated) by a banking organization that is the sole  common equity holder of the trust. Qualifying trust preferred securities  must allow for   dividends to be deferred for at least twenty consecutive quarters  without an event of default, unless an event of default leading to  acceleration permitted under section II.A.1.c.iv.(2) has occurred. The  required notification period for such deferral must be reasonably short,  no more than 15 business days prior to the payment date. Qualifying  trust preferred securities are otherwise subject to the same  restrictions on terms and features as qualifying perpetual preferred  stock under section II.A.1.c.ii.(2) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The sole asset of the trust must be a junior subordinated note  issued by the sponsoring banking organization that has a minimum  maturity of thirty years, is subordinated with regard to both  liquidation and priority of periodic payments to all senior and  subordinated debt of the sponsoring banking organization (other than  other junior subordinated notes underlying trust preferred securities).  Otherwise the terms of a junior subordinated note must mirror those of  the preferred securities issued by the trust. \11\ The note must comply  with section II.A.2.d. of this appendix and the Federal Reserve's  subordinated debt policy statement set forth in 12 CFR 250.166 \12\  except that the note may provide for an event of default and the  acceleration of principal and accrued interest upon (a) nonpayment of  interest for 20 or more consecutive quarters or (b) termination of the  trust without redemption of the trust preferred securities, distribution  of the notes to investors, or assumption of the obligation by a  successor to the banking organization. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this  appendix, be reduced by the notional amount of the banking  organization's investment in the security issued by the pooling entity.</p><p class="depth0">\12\ Trust preferred securities issued before April 15, 2005,  generally would be includable in tier 1 capital despite noncompliance  with sections II.A.1.c.iv. or II.A.2.d. of this appendix or 12 CFR  250.166 provided the non-complying terms of the instrument (i) have been  commonly used by banking organizations, (ii) do not provide an  unreasonably high degree of protection to the holder in circumstances  other than bankruptcy of the banking organization, and (iii) do not  effectively allow a holder in due course of the note to stand ahead of  senior or subordinated debt holders in the event of bankruptcy of the  banking organization. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In the last five years before the maturity of the note, the  outstanding amount of the associated trust preferred securities is  excluded from tier 1 capital and included in tier 2 capital, where the  trust preferred securities are subject to the amortization provisions  and quantitative restrictions set forth in sections II.A.2.d.iii. and  iv. of this appendix as if the trust preferred securities were limited- life preferred stock.</p><p class="depth0">2. Supplementary capital elements (tier 2 capital elements). The  tier 2 component of an institution's qualifying capital may consist of  the following items that are defined as supplementary capital elements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Allowance for loan and lease losses (subject to limitations  discussed below);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Perpetual preferred stock and related surplus (subject to  conditions discussed below);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Hybrid capital instruments (as defined below), perpetual debt,  and mandatory convertible debt securities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Term subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock,  including related surplus (subject to limitations discussed below);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Unrealized holding gains on equity securities (subject to  limitations discussed in section II.A.2.e. of this appendix).</p><p class="depth0">The maximum amount of tier 2 capital that may be included in an  institution's qualifying total capital is limited to 100 percent of tier  1 capital (net of goodwill, other intangible assets, interest-only  strips receivables and nonfinancial equity investments that are required  to be deducted in accordance with section II.B. of this appendix A).</p><p class="depth0">The elements of supplementary capital are discussed in greater  detail below.</p><p class="depth0">a. Allowance for loan and lease losses. Allowances for loan and  lease losses are reserves that have been established through a charge  against earnings to absorb future losses on loans or lease financing  receivables. Allowances for loan and lease losses exclude ``allocated  transfer risk reserves,'' \13\ and reserves created against identified  losses. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\13\ Allocated transfer risk reserves are reserves that have been  established in accordance with Section 905(a) of the International  Lending Supervision Act of 1983, 12 U.S.C. 3904(a), against certain  assets whose value U.S. supervisory authorities have found to be  significantly impaired by protracted transfer risk problems. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">During the transition period, the risk-based capital guidelines  provide for reducing the amount of this allowance that may be included  in an institution's total capital. Initially, it is unlimited. However,  by year-end 1990, the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses  that will qualify as capital will be limited to 1.5 percent of an  institution's weighted risk assets. By the end of the transition period,  the amount of the allowance qualifying for inclusion in Tier 2 capital  may not exceed 1.25 percent of weighted risk assets. \14\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\14\ The amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses that may  be included in Tier 2 capital is based on a percentage of gross weighted  risk assets. A banking organization may deduct reserves for loan and  lease losses in excess of the amount permitted to be included in Tier 2  capital, as well as allocated transfer risk reserves, from the sum of  gross weighted risk assets and use the resulting net sum of weighted  risk assets in computing the denominator of the risk-based capital  ratio. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this appendix is eligible for inclusion in tier 2  capital without limit. \15\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\15\ Long-term preferred stock with an original maturity of 20 years  or more (including related surplus) will also qualify in this category  as an element of tier 2 capital. If the holder of such an instrument has  the right to require the issuer to redeem, repay, or repurchase the  instrument prior to the original stated maturity, maturity would be  defined for risk-based capital purposes as the earliest possible date on  which the holder can put the instrument back to the issuing banking  organization. In the last five years before the maturity of the stock,  it must be treated as limited-life preferred stock, subject to the  amortization provisions and quantitative restrictions set forth in  sections II.A.2.d.iii. and iv. of this appendix. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">c. Hybrid capital instruments, perpetual debt, and mandatory  convertible debt securities. Hybrid capital instruments include  instruments that are essentially permanent in nature and that have  certain characteristics of both equity and debt. Such instruments may be  included in Tier 2 without limit. The general criteria hybrid capital  instruments must meet in order to qualify for inclusion in Tier 2  capital are listed below:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The instrument must be unsecured; fully paid-up and subordinated  to general creditors. If issued by a bank, it must also be subordinated  to claims or depositors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The instrument must not be redeemable at the option of the  holder prior to maturity, except with the prior approval of the Federal  Reserve. (Consistent with the Board's criteria for perpetual debt and  mandatory convertible securities, this requirement implies that holders  of such instruments may not accelerate the payment of principal except  in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The instrument must be available to participate in losses while  the issuer is operating as a going concern. (Term subordinated debt  would not meet this requirement.) To satisfy this requirement, the  instrument must convert to common or perpetual preferred stock in the  event that the accumulated losses exceed the sum of the retained  earnings and capital surplus accounts of the issuer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The instrument must provide the option for the issuer to defer  interest payments if: a) the issuer does not report a profit in the  preceding annual period (defined as combined profits for the most recent  four quarters), and b) the issuer eliminates cash dividends on common  and preferred stock.</p><p class="depth0">Perpetual debt and mandatory convertible debt securities that meet  the criteria set forth in 12 CFR part 225, appendix B, also qualify as  unlimited elements of Tier 2 capital for bank holding companies.</p><p class="depth0">d. Subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock--i. Five- year minimum maturity. Subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred  stock must have an original weighted average maturity of at least five  years to qualify as tier 2 capital. If the holder has the option to  require the issuer to redeem, repay, or repurchase the instrument prior  to the original stated maturity, maturity would be defined, for risk- based capital purposes, as the earliest possible date on which the  holder can put the instrument back to the issuing banking organization.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Other restrictions on subordinated debt. Subordinated debt  included in tier 2 capital must comply with the Federal Reserve's  subordinated debt policy statement set forth in   12 CFR 250.166. \16\ Accordingly, such subordinated debt must meet the  following requirements: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\16\ The subordinated debt policy statement set forth in 12 CFR  250.166 notes that certain terms found in subordinated debt may provide  protection to investors without adversely affecting the overall benefits  of the instrument to the issuing banking organization and, thus, would  be acceptable for subordinated debt included in capital. For example, a  provision that prohibits a bank holding company from merging,  consolidating, or selling substantially all of its assets unless the new  entity redeems or assumes the subordinated debt or that designates the  failure to pay principal and interest on a timely basis as an event of  default would be acceptable, so long as the occurrence of such events  does not allow the debt holders to accelerate the payment of principal  or interest on the debt. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The subordinated debt must be unsecured.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The subordinated debt must clearly state on its face that it is  not a deposit and is not insured by a Federal agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The subordinated debt must not have credit-sensitive features or  other provisions that are inconsistent with safe and sound banking  practice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Subordinated debt issued by a subsidiary U.S. depository  institution or foreign bank of a bank holding company must be  subordinated in right of payment to the claims of all the institution's  general creditors and depositors, and generally must not contain  provisions permitting debt holders to accelerate payment of principal or  interest upon the occurrence of any event other than receivership of the  institution. Subordinated debt issued by a bank holding company or its  subsidiaries that are neither U.S. depository institutions nor foreign  banks must be subordinated to all senior indebtedness of the issuer;  that is, the debt must be subordinated at a minimum to all borrowed  money, similar obligations arising from off-balance sheet guarantees and  direct credit substitutes, and obligations associated with derivative  products such as interest rate and foreign exchange contracts, commodity  contracts, and similar arrangements. Subordinated debt issued by a bank  holding company or any of its subsidiaries that is not a U.S. depository  institution or foreign bank must not contain provisions permitting debt  holders to accelerate the payment of principal or interest upon the  occurrence of any event other than the bankruptcy of the bank holding  company or the receivership of a major subsidiary depository  institution. Thus, a provision permitting acceleration in the event that  any other affiliate of the bank holding company issuer enters into  bankruptcy or receivership makes the instrument ineligible for inclusion  in tier 2 capital.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Discounting in last five years. As a limited-life capital  instrument approaches maturity, it begins to take on characteristics of  a short-term obligation. For this reason, the outstanding amount of term  subordinated debt and limited-life preferred stock eligible for  inclusion in tier 2 capital is reduced, or discounted, as these  instruments approach maturity: one-fifth of the outstanding amount is  excluded each year during the instrument's last five years before  maturity. When remaining maturity is less than one year, the instrument  is excluded from tier 2 capital.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Limits. The aggregate amount of term subordinated debt  (excluding mandatory convertible debt) and limited-life preferred stock  as well as, beginning March 31, 2011, qualifying trust preferred  securities and Class C minority interest in excess of the limits set  forth in section II.A.1.b.i. of this appendix that may be included in  tier 2 capital is limited to 50 percent of tier 1 capital (net of  goodwill and other intangible assets required to be deducted in  accordance with section II.B.1.b. of this appendix). Amounts of these  instruments in excess of this limit, although not included in tier 2  capital, will be taken into account by the Federal Reserve in its  overall assessment of a banking organization's funding and financial  condition.</p><p class="depth0">e. Unrealized gains on equity securities and unrealized gains  (losses) on other assets. Up to 45 percent of pretax net unrealized  holding gains (that is, the excess, if any, of the fair value over  historical cost) on available-for-sale equity securities with readily  determinable fair values may be included in supplementary capital.  However, the Federal Reserve may exclude all or a portion of these  unrealized gains from Tier 2 capital if the Federal Reserve determines  that the equity securities are not prudently valued. Unrealized gains  (losses) on other types of assets, such as bank premises and available- for-sale debt securities, are not included in supplementary capital, but  the Federal Reserve may take these unrealized gains (losses) into  account as additional factors when assessing an institution's overall  capital adequacy.</p><p class="depth0">f. Revaluation reserves. i. Such reserves reflect the formal balance  sheet restatement or revaluation for capital purposes of asset carrying  values to reflect current market values. The Federal Reserve generally  has not included unrealized asset appreciation in capital ratio  calculations, although it has long taken such values into account as a  separate factor in assessing the overall financial strength of a banking  organization.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Consistent with long-standing supervisory practice, the excess  of market values over book values for assets held by bank   holding companies will generally not be recognized in supplementary  capital or in the calculation of the risk-based capital ratio. However,  all bank holding companies are encouraged to disclose their equivalent  of premises (building) and security revaluation reserves. The Federal  Reserve will consider any appreciation, as well as any depreciation, in  specific asset values as additional considerations in assessing overall  capital strength and financial condition.</p><p class="depth0">B. Deductions from Capital and Other Adjustments</p><p class="depth0">Certain assets are deducted from an organization's capital for the  purpose of calculating the risk-based capital ratio. \17\ These assets  include: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\17\ Any assets deducted from capital in computing the numerator of  the ratio are not included in weighted risk assets in computing the  denominator of the ratio. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(a)</em> Goodwill--deducted from the sum of core capital elements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Certain identifiable intangible assets, that is, intangible  assets other than goodwill--deducted from the sum of core capital  elements in accordance with section II.B.1.b. of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Certain credit-enhancing interest-only strips receivables-- deducted from the sum of core capital elements in accordance with  sections II.B.1.c. through e. of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Investments in banking and finance subsidiaries that are not  consolidated for accounting or supervisory purposes, and investments in  other designated subsidiaries or associated companies at the discretion  of the Federal Reserve--deducted from total capital components (as  described in greater detail below).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Reciprocal holdings of capital instruments of banking  organizations--deducted from total capital components.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Deferred tax assets--portions are deducted from the sum of core  capital elements in accordance with section II.B.4. of this appendix A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Nonfinancial equity investments--portions are deducted from the  sum of core capital elements in accordance with section II.B.5 of this  appendix A.</p><p class="depth0">1. Goodwill and other intangible assets--a. Goodwill. Goodwill is an  intangible asset that represents the excess of the cost of an acquired  entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and  liabilities assumed. Goodwill is deducted from the sum of core capital  elements in determining tier 1 capital.</p><p class="depth0">b. Other intangible assets. i. All servicing assets, including  servicing assets on assets other than mortgages (i.e., nonmortgage  servicing assets), are included in this appendix as identifiable  intangible assets. The only types of identifiable intangible assets that  may be included in, that is, not deducted from, an organization's  capital are readily marketable mortgage servicing assets, nonmortgage  servicing assets, and purchased credit card relationships. The total  amount of these assets that may be included in capital is subject to the  limitations described below in sections II.B.1.d. and e. of this  appendix.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The treatment of identifiable intangible assets set forth in  this section generally will be used in the calculation of a bank holding  company's capital ratios for supervisory and applications purposes.  However, in making an overall assessment of a bank holding company's  capital adequacy for applications purposes, the Board may, if it deems  appropriate, take into account the quality and composition of an  organization's capital, together with the quality and value of its  tangible and intangible assets.</p><p class="depth0">c. Credit-enhancing interest-only strips receivables (I/Os) i.  Credit-enhancing I/Os are on-balance sheet assets that, in form or in  substance, represent a contractual right to receive some or all of the  interest due on transferred assets and expose the bank holding company  to credit risk directly or indirectly associated with transferred assets  that exceeds a pro rata share of the bank holding company's claim on the  assets, whether through subordination provisions or other credit  enhancement techniques. Such I/Os, whether purchased or retained,  including other similar ``spread'' assets, may be included in, that is,  not deducted from, a bank holding company's capital subject to the  limitations described below in sections II.B.1.d. and e. of this  appendix.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Both purchased and retained credit-enhancing I/Os, on a non-tax  adjusted basis, are included in the total amount that is used for  purposes of determining whether a bank holding company exceeds the tier  1 limitation described below in this section. In determining whether an  I/O or other types of spread assets serve as a credit enhancement, the  Federal Reserve will look to the economic substance of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0">d. Fair value limitation. The amount of mortgage servicing assets,  nonmortgage servicing assets, and purchased credit card relationships  that a bank holding company may include in capital shall be the lesser  of 90 percent of their fair value, as determined in accordance with  section II.B.1.f. of this appendix, or 100 percent of their book value,  as adjusted for capital purposes in accordance with the instructions to  the Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies (FR Y- 9C Report). The amount of credit-enhancing I/Os that a bank holding  company may include in capital shall be its fair value. If both the  application of the limits on mortgage servicing assets, nonmortgage  servicing assets, and purchased   credit card relationships and the adjustment of the balance sheet amount  for these assets would result in an amount being deducted from capital,  the bank holding company would deduct only the greater of the two  amounts from its core capital elements in determining tier 1 capital.</p><p class="depth0">e. Tier 1 capital limitation. i. The total amount of mortgage  servicing assets, nonmortgage servicing assets, and purchased credit  card relationships that may be included in capital, in the aggregate,  cannot exceed 100 percent of tier 1 capital. Nonmortgage servicing  assets and purchased credit card relationships are subject, in the  aggregate, to a separate sublimit of 25 percent of tier 1 capital. In  addition, the total amount of credit-enhancing I/Os (both purchased and  retained) that may be included in capital cannot exceed 25 percent of  tier 1 capital. \18\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\18\ Amounts of servicing assets, purchased credit card  relationships, and credit-enhancing I/Os (both retained and purchased)  in excess of these limitations, as well as all other identifiable  intangible assets, including core deposit intangibles and favorable  leaseholds, are to be deducted from a bank holding company's core  capital elements in determining tier 1 capital. However, identifiable  intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing assets and purchased  credit card relationships) acquired on or before February 19, 1992,  generally will not be deducted from capital for supervisory purposes,  although they will continue to be deducted for applications purposes. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">ii. For purposes of calculating these limitations on mortgage  servicing assets, nonmortgage servicing assets, purchased credit card  relationships, and credit-enhancing I/Os, tier 1 capital is defined as  the sum of core capital elements, net of goodwill, and net of all  identifiable intangible assets other than mortgage servicing assets,  nonmortgage servicing assets, and purchased credit card relationships,  but prior to the deduction of any disallowed mortgage servicing assets,  any disallowed nonmortgage servicing assets, any disallowed purchased  credit card relationships, any disallowed credit-enhancing I/Os (both  purchased and retained), any disallowed deferred tax assets, and any  nonfinancial equity investments.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Bank holding companies may elect to deduct goodwill, disallowed  mortgage servicing assets, disallowed nonmortgage servicing assets, and  disallowed credit-enhancing I/Os (both purchased and retained) on a  basis that is net of any associated deferred tax liability. Deferred tax  liabilities netted in this manner cannot also be netted against deferred  tax assets when determining the amount of deferred tax assets that are  dependent upon future taxable income.</p><p class="depth0">f. Valuation. Bank holding companies must review the book value of  goodwill and other intangible assets at least quarterly and make  adjustments to these values as necessary. The fair value of mortgage  servicing assets, nonmortgage servicing assets, purchased credit card  relationships, and credit-enhancing I/Os also must be determined at  least quarterly. This determination shall include adjustments for any  significant changes in original valuation assumptions, including changes  in prepayment estimates or account attrition rates. Examiners will  review both the book value and the fair value assigned to these assets,  together with supporting documentation, during the inspection process.  In addition, the Federal Reserve may require, on a case-by-case basis,  an independent valuation of a bank holding company's goodwill, other  intangible assets, or credit-enhancing I/Os.</p><p class="depth0">g. Growing organizations. Consistent with long-standing Board  policy, banking organizations experiencing substantial growth, whether  internally or by acquisition, are expected to maintain strong capital  positions substantially above minimum supervisory levels, without  significant reliance on intangible assets or credit-enhancing I/Os.</p><p class="depth0">2. Investments in certain subsidiaries-- a. Unconsolidated banking  or finance subsidiaries. The aggregate amount of investments in banking  or finance subsidiaries \19\ whose financial statements are not  consolidated for accounting or regulatory reporting purposes, regardless  of whether the investment is made by the parent bank holding company or  its direct or indirect subsidiaries, will be deducted from the  consolidated parent banking organization's total capital components.  \20\ Generally, investments for this purpose are defined as equity and  debt capital investments and any other instruments that are deemed to be  capital in the particular subsidiary. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\19\ For this purpose, a banking and finance subsidiary generally is  defined as any company engaged in banking or finance in which the parent  institution holds directly or indirectly more than 50 percent of the  outstanding voting stock, or which is otherwise controlled or capable of  being controlled by the parent institution. For purposes of this  section, the definition of banking and finance subsidiary does not  include a trust or other special purpose entity used to issue trust  preferred securities.</p><p class="depth0">\20\ An exception to this deduction would be made in the case of  shares acquired in the regular course of securing or collecting a debt  previously contracted in good faith. The requirements for consolidation  are spelled out in the instructions to the FR Y-9C Report.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Advances (that is, loans, extensions of credit, guarantees,  commitments, or any other forms of credit exposure) to the subsidiary  that are not deemed to be capital will generally not be deducted from an  organization's capital. Rather, such advances generally will be included  in the parent banking organization's consolidated assets and be assigned  to the 100 percent risk category, unless such obligations are backed by  recognized collateral or guarantees, in which case they will be assigned  to the risk category appropriate to such collateral or guarantees. These  advances may, however, also be deducted from the consolidated parent  banking organization's capital if, in the judgment of the Federal  Reserve, the risks stemming from such advances are comparable to the  risks associated with capital investments or if the advances involve  other risk factors that warrant such an adjustment to capital for  supervisory purposes. These other factors could include, for example,  the absence of collateral support.</p><p class="depth0">Inasmuch as the assets of unconsolidated banking and finance  subsidiaries are not fully reflected in a banking organization's  consolidated total assets, such assets may be viewed as the equivalent  of off-balance sheet exposures since the operations of an unconsolidated  subsidiary could expose the parent organization and its affiliates to  considerable risk. For this reason, it is generally appropriate to view  the capital resources invested in these unconsolidated entities as  primarily supporting the risks inherent in these off-balance sheet  assets, and not generally available to support risks or absorb losses  elsewhere in the organization.</p><p class="depth0">b. Other subsidiaries and investments. The deduction of investments,  regardless of whether they are made by the parent bank holding company  or by its direct or indirect subsidiaries, from a consolidated banking  organization's capital will also be applied in the case of any  subsidiaries, that, while consolidated for accounting purposes, are not  consolidated for certain specified supervisory or regulatory purposes,  such as to facilitate functional regulation. For this purpose, aggregate  capital investments (that is, the sum of any equity or debt instruments  that are deemed to be capital) in these subsidiaries will be deducted  from the consolidated parent banking organization's total capital  components. \21\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\21\ Investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries will be deducted  from both Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. As a general rule, one-half (50  percent) of the aggregate amount of capital investments will be deducted  from the bank holding company's Tier 1 capital and one-half (50 percent)  from its Tier 2 capital. However, the Federal Reserve may, on a case-by- case basis, deduct a proportionately greater amount from Tier 1 if the  risks associated with the subsidiary so warrant. If the amount  deductible from Tier 2 capital exceeds actual Tier 2 capital, the excess  would be deducted from Tier 1 capital. Bank holding companies' risk- based capital ratios, net of these deductions, must exceed the minimum  standards set forth in section IV. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Advances (that is, loans, extensions of credit, guarantees,  commitments, or any other forms of credit exposure) to such subsidiaries  that are not deemed to be capital will generally not be deducted from  capital. Rather, such advances will normally be included in the parent  banking organization's consolidated assets and assigned to the 100  percent risk category, unless such obligations are backed by recognized  collateral or guarantees, in which case they will be assigned to the  risk category appropriate to such collateral or guarantees. These  advances may, however, be deducted from the consolidated parent banking  organization's capital if, in the judgment of the Federal Reserve, the  risks stemming from such advances are comparable to the risks associated  with capital investments or if such advances involve other risk factors  that warrant such an adjustment to capital for supervisory purposes.  These other factors could include, for example, the absence of  collateral support. \22\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\22\ In assessing the overall capital adequacy of a banking  organization, the Federal Reserve may also consider the organization's  fully consolidated capital position. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">In general, when investments in a consolidated subsidiary are  deducted from a consolidated parent banking organization's capital, the  subsidiary's assets will also be excluded from the consolidated assets  of the parent banking organization in order to assess the latter's  capital adequacy. \23\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\23\ If the subsidiary's assets are consolidated with the parent  banking organization for financial reporting purposes, this adjustment  will involve excluding the subsidiary's assets on a line-by-line basis  from the consolidated parent organization's assets. The parent banking  organization's capital ratio will then be calculated on a consolidated  basis with the exception that the assets of the excluded subsidiary will  not be consolidated with the remainder of the parent banking  organization. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">The Federal Reserve may also deduct from a banking organization's  capital, on a case-by-case basis, investments in certain other  subsidiaries in order to determine if the consolidated banking  organization meets minimum supervisory capital requirements without  reliance on the resources invested in such subsidiaries.</p><p class="depth0">The Federal Reserve will not automatically deduct investments in  other unconsolidated subsidiaries or investments in joint ventures and  associated companies. \24\ Nonetheless, the resources invested in these  entities, like investments in unconsolidated banking and finance  subsidiaries, support assets not consolidated with the rest of the  banking organization's activities and, therefore, may not be generally  available to support additional leverage or absorb losses elsewhere in  the banking organization. Moreover, experience has shown that banking  organizations stand behind the losses of affiliated institutions, such  as joint ventures and associated companies, in order to protect the  reputation of the organization as a whole. In some cases, this has led  to losses that have exceeded the investments in such organizations. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\24\ The definition of such entities is contained in the  instructions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding  Companies. Under regulatory reporting procedures, associated companies  and joint ventures generally are defined as companies in which the  banking organization owns 20 to 50 percent of the voting stock. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">For this reason, the Federal Reserve will monitor the level and  nature of such investments for individual banking organizations and may,  on a case-by-case basis, deduct such investments from total capital  components, apply an appropriate risk-weighted capital charge against  the organization's proportionate share of the assets of its associated  companies, require a line-by-line consolidation of the entity (in the  event that the parent's control over the entity makes it the functional  equivalent of a subsidiary), or otherwise require the organization to  operate with a risk-based capital ratio above the minimum.</p><p class="depth0">In considering the appropriateness of such adjustments or actions,  the Federal Reserve will generally take into account whether:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The parent banking organization has significant influence over  the financial or managerial policies or operations of the subsidiary,  joint venture, or associated company;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The banking organization is the largest investor in the  affiliated company; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Other circumstances prevail that appear to closely tie the  activities of the affiliated company to the parent banking organization.</p><p class="depth0">3. Reciprocal holdings of banking organizations' capital  instruments. Reciprocal holdings of banking organizations' capital  instruments (that is, instruments that qualify as Tier 1 or Tier 2  capital) will be deducted from an organization's total capital  components for the purpose of determining the numerator of the risk- based capital ratio.</p><p class="depth0">Reciprocal holdings are cross-holdings resulting from formal or  informal arrangements in which two or more banking organizations swap,  exchange, or otherwise agree to hold each other's capital instruments.  Generally, deductions will be limited to intentional cross-holdings. At  present, the Board does not intend to require banking organizations to  deduct non-reciprocal holdings of such capital instruments. \25\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\25\ Deductions of holdings of capital securities also would not be  made in the case of interstate ``stake out'' investments that comply  with the Board's Policy Statement on Nonvoting Equity Investments, 12  CFR 225.143 (Federal Reserve Regulatory Service 4-172.1; 68 Federal  Reserve Bulletin 413 (1982)). In addition, holdings of capital  instruments issued by other banking organizations but taken in  satisfaction of debts previously contracted would be exempt from any  deduction from capital. The Board intends to monitor nonreciprocal  holdings of other banking organizations' capital instruments and to  provide information on such holdings to the Basle Supervisors' Committee  as called for under the Basle capital framework. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">4. Deferred-tax assets. a. The amount of deferred-tax assets that is  dependent upon future taxable income, net of the valuation allowance for  deferred-tax assets, that may be included in, that is, not deducted  from, a bank holding company's capital may not exceed the lesser of:</p><p class="depth0">i. The amount of these deferred-tax assets that the bank holding  company is expected to realize within one year of the calendar quarter- end date, based on its projections of future taxable income for that  year, \26\ or ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\26\ To determine the amount of expected deferred-tax assets  realizable in the next 12 months, an institution should assume that all  existing temporary differences fully reverse as of the report date.  Projected future taxable income should not include net operating loss  carry-forwards to be used during that year or the amount of existing  temporary differences a bank holding company expects to reverse within  the year. Such projections should include the estimated effect of tax- planning strategies that the organization expects to implement to  realize net operating losses or tax-credit carry-forwards that would  otherwise expire during the year. Institutions do not have to prepare a  new 12-month projection each quarter. Rather, on interim report dates,  institutions may use the future-taxable income projections for their  current fiscal year, adjusted for any significant changes that have  occurred or are expected to occur. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">ii. 10 percent of tier 1 capital.</p><p class="depth0">b. The reported amount of deferred-tax assets, net of any valuation  allowance for deferred-tax assets, in excess of the lesser of these two  amounts is to be deducted from a banking organization's core capital  elements in determining tier 1 capital. For purposes of calculating the  10 percent limitation, tier 1 capital is defined as the sum of core  capital elements, net of goodwill and net of all identifiable intangible  assets other than mortgage servicing assets, nonmortgage servicing  assets, and purchased credit card relationships, but prior to the  deduction of any disallowed mortgage servicing assets, any disallowed  nonmortgage servicing assets, any disallowed purchased credit card  relationships, any disallowed credit-enhancing I/Os, any disallowed  deferred-tax assets, and any nonfinancial equity investments. There  generally is no limit in tier 1 capital on the amount of deferred-tax  assets that can be realized from taxes paid in prior carry-back years or  from future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences.</p><p class="depth0">5. Nonfinancial equity investments--a. General. A bank holding  company must deduct from its core capital elements the sum of the  appropriate percentages (as determined below) of the adjusted carrying  value of all nonfinancial equity investments held by the parent bank  holding company or by its direct or indirect subsidiaries. For purposes  of this section II.B.5, investments held by a bank holding company  include all investments held directly or indirectly by the bank holding  company or any of its subsidiaries.</p><p class="depth0">b. Scope of nonfinancial equity investments. A nonfinancial equity  investment means any equity investment held by the bank holding company:  under the merchant banking authority of section 4(k)(4)(H) of the BHC  Act and subpart J of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.175 et seq.);  under section 4(c)(6) or 4(c)(7) of BHC Act in a nonfinancial company or  in a company that makes investments in nonfinancial companies; in a  nonfinancial company through a small business investment company (SBIC)  under section 302(b) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958; \27\  in a nonfinancial company under the portfolio investment provisions of  the Board's Regulation K (12 CFR 211.8(c)(3)); or in a nonfinancial  company under section 24 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (other  than section 24(f)). \28\ A nonfinancial company is an entity that  engages in any activity that has not been determined to be financial in  nature or incidental to financial activities under section 4(k) of the  Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(k)). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\27\ An equity investment made under section 302(b) of the Small  Business Investment Act of 1958 in an SBIC that is not consolidated with  the parent banking organization is treated as a nonfinancial equity  investment.</p><p class="depth0">\28\ See 12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(6), (c)(7) and (k)(4)(H); 15 U.S.C.  682(b); 12 CFR 211.5(b)(1)(iii); and 12 U.S.C. 1831a. In a case in which  the Board of Directors of the FDIC, acting directly in exceptional cases  and after a review of the proposed activity, has permitted a lesser  capital deduction for an investment approved by the Board of Directors  under section 24 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, such deduction  shall also apply to the consolidated bank holding company capital  calculation so long as the bank's investments under section 24 and SBIC  investments represent, in the aggregate, less than 15 percent of the  Tier 1 capital of the bank. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">c. Amount of deduction from core capital. i. The bank holding  company must deduct from its core capital elements the sum of the  appropriate percentages, as set forth in Table 1, of the adjusted  carrying value of all nonfinancial equity investments held by the bank  holding company. The amount of the percentage deduction increases as the  aggregate amount of nonfinancial equity investments held by the bank  holding company increases as a percentage of the bank holding company's  Tier 1 capital.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1--Deduction for Nonfinancial Equity Investments ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Aggregate adjusted carrying value of all</p><p class="depth0">nonfinancial equity investments held     Deduction from Core Capital</p><p class="depth0">directly or indirectly by the bank      Elements (as a percentage of</p><p class="depth0">holding company (as a percentage of the    the adjusted carrying value</p><p class="depth0">Tier 1 capital of the parent banking          of the investment)</p><p class="depth0">organization) \1\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Less than 15 percent.....................  8 percent. 15 percent to 24.99 percent..............  12 percent. 25 percent and above.....................  25 percent. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \1\ For purposes of calculating the adjusted carrying value of</p><p class="depth0">nonfinancial equity investments as a percentage of Tier 1 capital,</p><p class="depth0">Tier 1 capital is defined as the sum of core capital elements net of</p><p class="depth0">goodwill and net of all identifiable intangible assets other than</p><p class="depth0">mortgage servicing assets, nonmortgage servicing assets and purchased</p><p class="depth0">credit card relationships, but prior to the deduction for any</p><p class="depth0">disallowed mortgage servicing assets, any disallowed nonmortgage</p><p class="depth0">servicing assets, any disallowed purchased credit card relationships,</p><p class="depth0">any disallowed credit enhancing I/Os (both purchased and retained),</p><p class="depth0">any disallowed deferred tax assets, and any nonfinancial equity</p><p class="depth0">investments.</p><p class="depth0">ii. These deductions are applied on a marginal basis to the portions  of the adjusted carrying value of nonfinancial equity investments that  fall within the specified ranges of the parent holding company's Tier 1  capital. For example, if the adjusted carrying value of all nonfinancial  equity investments held by a bank holding company equals 20 percent of  the Tier 1 capital of the bank holding company, then the amount of the  deduction would be 8 percent of the adjusted carrying value of all  investments up to 15 percent of the company's Tier 1 capital, and 12  percent   of the adjusted carrying value of all investments in excess of 15  percent of the company's Tier 1 capital.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The total adjusted carrying value of any nonfinancial equity  investment that is subject to deduction under this paragraph is excluded  from the bank holding company's risk-weighted assets for purposes of  computing the denominator of the company's risk-based capital ratio.  \29\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\29\ For example, if 8 percent of the adjusted carrying value of a  nonfinancial equity investment is deducted from Tier 1 capital, the  entire adjusted carrying value of the investment will be excluded from  risk-weighted assets in calculating the denominator for the risk-based  capital ratio. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">iv. As noted in section I, this appendix establishes minimum risk- based capital ratios and banking organizations are at all times expected  to maintain capital commensurate with the level and nature of the risks  to which they are exposed. The risk to a banking organization from  nonfinancial equity investments increases with its concentration in such  investments and strong capital levels above the minimum requirements are  particularly important when a banking organization has a high degree of  concentration in nonfinancial equity investments (e.g., in excess of 50  percent of Tier 1 capital). The Federal Reserve intends to monitor  banking organizations and apply heightened supervision to equity  investment activities as appropriate, including where the banking  organization has a high degree of concentration in nonfinancial equity  investments, to ensure that each organization maintains capital levels  that are appropriate in light of its equity investment activities. The  Federal Reserve also reserves authority to impose a higher capital  charge in any case where the circumstances, such as the level of risk of  the particular investment or portfolio of investments, the risk  management systems of the banking organization, or other information,  indicate that a higher minimum capital requirement is appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">d. SBIC investments. i. No deduction is required for nonfinancial  equity investments that are held by a bank holding company through one  or more SBICs that are consolidated with the bank holding company or in  one or more SBICs that are not consolidated with the bank holding  company to the extent that all such investments, in the aggregate, do  not exceed 15 percent of the aggregate of the bank holding company's pro  rata interests in the Tier 1 capital of its subsidiary banks. Any  nonfinancial equity investment that is held through or in an SBIC and  not required to be deducted from Tier 1 capital under this section  II.B.5.d. will be assigned a 100 percent risk-weight and included in the  parent holding company's consolidated risk-weighted assets. \30\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\30\ If a bank holding company has an investment in an SBIC that is  consolidated for accounting purposes but that is not wholly owned by the  bank holding company, the adjusted carrying value of the bank holding  company's nonfinancial equity investments through the SBIC is equal to  the holding company's proportionate share of the adjusted carrying value  of the SBIC's equity investments in nonfinancial companies. The  remainder of the SBIC's adjusted carrying value (i.e. the minority  interest holders' proportionate share) is excluded from the risk- weighted assets of the bank holding company. If a bank holding company  has an investment in a SBIC that is not consolidated for accounting  purposes and has current information that identifies the percentage of  the SBIC's assets that are equity investments in nonfinancial companies,  the bank holding company may reduce the adjusted carrying value of its  investment in the SBIC proportionately to reflect the percentage of the  adjusted carrying value of the SBIC's assets that are not equity  investments in nonfinancial companies. If a bank holding company reduces  the adjusted carrying value of its investment in a non-consolidated SBIC  to reflect financial investments of the SBIC, the amount of the  adjustment will be risk weighted at 100 percent and included in the  bank's risk-weighted assets. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">ii. To the extent the adjusted carrying value of all nonfinancial  equity investments that a bank holding company holds through one or more  SBICs that are consolidated with the bank holding company or in one or  more SBICs that are not consolidated with the bank holding company  exceeds, in the aggregate, 15 percent of the aggregate Tier 1 capital of  the company's subsidiary banks, the appropriate percentage of such  amounts (as set forth in Table 1) must be deducted from the bank holding  company's core capital elements. In addition, the aggregate adjusted  carrying value of all nonfinancial equity investments held through a  consolidated SBIC and in a non-consolidated SBIC (including any  investments for which no deduction is required) must be included in  determining, for purposes of Table 1, the total amount of nonfinancial  equity investments held by the bank holding company in relation to its  Tier 1 capital.</p><p class="depth0">e. Transition provisions. No deduction under this section II.B.5 is  required to be made with respect to the adjusted carrying value of any  nonfinancial equity investment (or portion of such an investment) that  was made by the bank holding company prior to March 13, 2000, or that  was made after such   date pursuant to a binding written commitment \31\ entered into by the  bank holding company prior to March 13, 2000, provided that in either  case the bank holding company has continuously held the investment since  the relevant investment date. \32\ For purposes of this section  II.B.5.e., a nonfinancial equity investment made prior to March 13,  2000, includes any shares or other interests received by the bank  holding company through a stock split or stock dividend on an investment  made prior to March 13, 2000, provided the bank holding company provides  no consideration for the shares or interests received and the  transaction does not materially increase the bank'' holding company's  proportional interest in the company. The exercise on or after March 13,  2000, of options or warrants acquired prior to March 13, 2000, is not  considered to be an investment made prior to March 13, 2000, if the bank  holding company provides any consideration for the shares or interests  received upon exercise of the options or warrants. Any nonfinancial  equity investment (or portion thereof) that is not required to be  deducted from Tier 1 capital under this section II.B.5.e. must be  included in determining the total amount of nonfinancial equity  investments held by the bank holding company in relation to its Tier 1  capital for purposes of Table 1. In addition, any nonfinancial equity  investment (or portion thereof) that is not required to be deducted from  Tier 1 capital under this section II.B.5.e. will be assigned a 100- percent risk weight and included in the bank holding company's  consolidated risk-weighted assets. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\31\ A ``binding written commitment'' means a legally binding  written agreement that requires the banking organization to acquire  shares or other equity of the company, or make a capital contribution to  the company, under terms and conditions set forth in the agreement.  Options, warrants, and other agreements that give a banking organization  the right to acquire equity or make an investment, but do not require  the banking organization to take such actions, are not considered a  binding written commitment for purposes of this section II.B.5.</p><p class="depth0">\32\ For example, if a bank holding company made an equity  investment in 100 shares of a nonfinancial company prior to March 13,  2000, that investment would not be subject to a deduction under this  section II.B.5. However, if the bank holding company made any additional  equity investment in the company after March 13, 2000, such as by  purchasing additional shares of the company (including through the  exercise of options or warrants acquired before or after March 13, 2000)  or by making a capital contribution to the company, and such investment  was not made pursuant to a binding written commitment entered into  before March 13, 2000, the adjusted carrying value of the additional  investment would be subject to a deduction under this section II.B.5. In  addition, if the bank holding company sold and repurchased shares of the  company after March 13, 2000, the adjusted carrying value of the re- acquired shares would be subject to a deduction under this section  II.B.5. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">f. Adjusted carrying value. i. For purposes of this section II.B.5.,  the ``adjusted carrying value'' of investments is the aggregate value at  which the investments are carried on the balance sheet of the  consolidated bank holding company reduced by any unrealized gains on  those investments that are reflected in such carrying value but excluded  from the bank holding company's Tier 1 capital and associated deferred  tax liabilities. For example, for investments held as available-for-sale  (AFS), the adjusted carrying value of the investments would be the  aggregate carrying value of the investments (as reflected on the  consolidated balance sheet of the bank holding company) less any  unrealized gains on those investments that are included in other  comprehensive income and not reflected in Tier 1 capital, and associated  deferred tax liabilities. \33\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\33\ Unrealized gains on AFS investments may be included in  supplementary capital to the extent permitted under section II.A.2.e of  this appendix A. In addition, the unrealized losses on AFS equity  investments are deducted from Tier 1 capital in accordance with section  II.A.1.a of this appendix A. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">ii. As discussed above with respect to consolidated SBICs, some  equity investments may be in companies that are consolidated for  accounting purposes. For investments in a nonfinancial company that is  consolidated for accounting purposes under generally accepted accounting  principles, the parent banking organization's adjusted carrying value of  the investment is determined under the equity method of accounting (net  of any intangibles associated with the investment that are deducted from  the consolidated bank holding company's core capital in accordance with  section II.B.1 of this appendix). Even though the assets of the  nonfinancial company are consolidated for accounting purposes, these  assets (as well as the credit equivalent amounts of the company's off- balance sheet items) should be excluded from the banking organization's  risk-weighted assets for regulatory capital purposes.</p><p class="depth0">g. Equity investments. For purposes of this section II.B.5, an  equity investment means any equity instrument (including common stock,  preferred stock, partnership interests, interests in limited liability  companies,   trust certificates and warrants and call options that give the holder  the right to purchase an equity instrument), any equity feature of a  debt instrument (such as a warrant or call option), and any debt  instrument that is convertible into equity where the instrument or  feature is held under one of the legal authorities listed in section  II.B.5.b. of this appendix. An investment in any other instrument  (including subordinated debt) may be treated as an equity investment if,  in the judgment of the Federal Reserve, the instrument is the functional  equivalent of equity or exposes the state member bank to essentially the  same risks as an equity instrument.</p><p class="depth0">Attachment II--Summary of Definition of Qualifying Capital for Bank</p><p class="depth0">Holding Companies*</p><p class="depth0">[Using the Year-End 1992 Standard] ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Components                      Minimum requirements ------------------------------------------------------------------------ CORE CAPITAL (Tier 1)..................

III. Procedures for Computing Weighted Risk Assets and Off-Balance Sheet</p><p class="depth0">Items</p><p class="depth0">A. Procedures</p><p class="depth0">Assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet items of  bank holding companies are assigned to one of several broad risk  categories, according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or  the nature of the collateral. The aggregate dollar value of the amount  in each category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with  that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the risk  categories are added together, and this sum is the banking  organization's total weighted risk assets that comprise the denominator  of the risk-based capital ratio. Attachment I provides a sample  calculation.</p><p class="depth0">Risk weights for all off-balance sheet items are determined by a  two-step process. First, the ``credit equivalent amount'' of off-balance  sheet items is determined, in most cases, by multiplying the off-balance  sheet item by a credit conversion factor. Second, the credit equivalent  amount is treated like any balance sheet asset and generally is assigned  to the appropriate risk category according to the obligor, or, if  relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral.</p><p class="depth0">In general, if a particular item qualifies for placement in more  than one risk category, it is assigned to the category that has the  lowest risk weight. A holding of a U.S. municipal revenue bond that is  fully guaranteed by a U.S. bank, for example, would be assigned the 20  percent risk weight appropriate to claims guaranteed by U.S. banks,  rather   than the 50 percent risk weight appropriate to U.S. municipal revenue  bonds. \34\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\34\ An investment in shares of a fund whose portfolio consists  primarily of various securities or money market instruments that, if  held separately, would be assigned to different risk categories,  generally is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the highest  risk-weighted asset that the fund is permitted to hold in accordance  with the stated investment objectives set forth in the prospectus. An  organization may, at its option, assign a fund investment on a pro rata  basis to different risk categories according to the investment limits in  the fund's prospectus. In no case will an investment in shares in any  fund be assigned to a total risk weight of less than 20 percent. If an  organization chooses to assign a fund investment on a pro rata basis,  and the sum of the investment limits of assets in the fund's prospectus  exceeds 100 percent, the organization must assign risk weights in  descending order. If, in order to maintain a necessary degree of short- term liquidity, a fund is permitted to hold an insignificant amount of  its assets in short-term, highly liquid securities of superior credit  quality that do not qualify for a preferential risk weight, such  securities generally will be disregarded when determining the risk  category into which the organization's holding in the overall fund  should be assigned. The prudent use of hedging instruments by a fund to  reduce the risk of its assets will not increase the risk weighting of  the fund investment. For example, the use of hedging instruments by a  fund to reduce the interest rate risk of its government bond portfolio  will not increase the risk weight of that fund above the 20 percent  category. Nonetheless, if a fund engages in any activities that appear  speculative in nature or has any other characteristics that are  inconsistent with the preferential risk weighting assigned to the fund's  assets, holdings in the fund will be assigned to the 100 percent risk  category. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">The Federal Reserve will, on a case-by-case basis, determine the  appropriate risk weight for any asset or credit equivalent amount of an  off-balance sheet item that does not fit wholly within the terms of one  of the risk weight categories set forth below or that imposes risks on a  bank holding company that are incommensurate with the risk weight  otherwise specified below for the asset or off-balance sheet item. In  addition, the Federal Reserve will, on a case-by-case basis, determine  the appropriate credit conversion factor for any off-balance sheet item  that does not fit wholly within the terms of one of the credit  conversion factors set forth below or that imposes risks on a banking  organization that are incommensurate with the credit conversion factors  otherwise specified below for the off-balance sheet item. In making such  a determination, the Federal Reserve will consider the similarity of the  asset or off-balance sheet item to assets or off-balance sheet items  explicitly treated in the guidelines, as well as other relevant factors.</p><p class="depth0">B. Collateral, Guarantees, and Other Considerations</p><p class="depth0">1. Collateral. The only forms of collateral that are formally  recognized by the risk-based capital framework are: Cash on deposit in a  subsidiary lending institution; securities issued or guaranteed by the  central governments of the OECD-based group of countries, \35\ U.S.  Government agencies, or U.S. Government-sponsored agencies; and  securities issued by multilateral lending institutions or regional  development banks. Claims fully secured by such collateral generally are  assigned to the 20 percent risk-weight category. Collateralized  transactions meeting all the conditions described in section III.C.1.  may be assigned a zero percent risk weight. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\35\ The OECD-based group of countries comprises all full members of  the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)  regardless of entry date, as well as countries that have concluded  special lending arrangements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  associated with the IMF's General Arrangements to Borrow, but excludes  any country that has rescheduled its external sovereign debt within the  previous five years. As of November 1995, the OECD included the  following countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark,  Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan,  Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal,  Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United  States; and Saudi Arabia had concluded special lending arrangements with  the IMF associated with the IMF's General Arrangements to Borrow. A  rescheduling of external sovereign debt generally would include any  renegotiation of terms arising from a country's inability or  unwillingness to meet its external debt service obligations, but  generally would not include renegotiations of debt in the normal course  of business, such as a renegotiation to allow the borrower to take  advantage of a decline in interest rates or other change in market  conditions. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">With regard to collateralized claims that may be assigned to the 20  percent risk-weight category, the extent to which qualifying securities  are recognized as collateral is determined by their current market  value. If such a claim is only partially secured, that is, the market  value of the pledged securities is less than the face amount of a  balance-sheet asset or an off-balance-sheet item, the   portion that is covered by the market value of the qualifying collateral  is assigned to the 20 percent risk category, and the portion of the  claim that is not covered by collateral in the form of cash or a  qualifying security is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the  obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor. For example, to the extent that  a claim on a private sector obligor is collateralized by the current  market value of U.S. Government securities, it would be placed in the 20  percent risk category and the balance would be assigned to the 100  percent risk category.</p><p class="depth0">2. Guarantees. Guarantees of the OECD and non-OECD central  governments, U.S. Government agencies, U.S. Government-sponsored  agencies, state and local governments of the OECD-based group of  countries, multilateral lending institutions and regional development  banks, U.S. depository institutions, and foreign banks are also  recognized. If a claim is partially guaranteed, that is, coverage of the  guarantee is less than the face amount of a balance sheet asset or an  off-balance sheet item, the portion that is not fully covered by the  guarantee is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the obligor  or, if relevant, to any collateral. The face amount of a claim covered  by two types of guarantees that have different risk weights, such as a  U.S. Government guarantee and a state guarantee, is to be apportioned  between the two risk categories appropriate to the guarantors.</p><p class="depth0">The existence of other forms of collateral or guarantees that the  risk-based capital framework does not formally recognize may be taken  into consideration in evaluating the risks inherent in an organization's  loan portfolio--which, in turn, would affect the overall supervisory  assessment of the organization's capital adequacy.</p><p class="depth0">3. Recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual  interests, and asset- and mortgage-backed securities. Direct credit  substitutes, assets transferred with recourse, and securities issued in  connection with asset securitizations and structured financings are  treated as described below. The term ``asset securitizations'' or  ``securitizations'' in this rule includes structured financings, as well  as asset securitization transactions.</p><p class="depth0">a. Definitions--i. Credit derivative means a contract that allows  one party (the ``protection purchaser'') to transfer the credit risk of  an asset or off-balance sheet credit exposure to another party (the  ``protection provider''). The value of a credit derivative is dependent,  at least in part, on the credit performance of the ``reference asset.''</p><p class="depth0">ii. Credit-enhancing representations and warranties means  representations and warranties that are made or assumed in connection  with a transfer of assets (including loan servicing assets) and that  obligate the bank holding company to protect investors from losses  arising from credit risk in the assets transferred or the loans  serviced. Credit-enhancing representations and warranties include  promises to protect a party from losses resulting from the default or  nonperformance of another party or from an insufficiency in the value of  the collateral. Credit-enhancing representations and warranties do not  include:</p><p class="depth0">1. Early default clauses and similar warranties that permit the  return of, or premium refund clauses covering, 1-4 family residential  first mortgage loans that qualify for a 50 percent risk weight for a  period not to exceed 120 days from the date of transfer. These  warranties may cover only those loans that were originated within 1 year  of the date of transfer;</p><p class="depth0">2. Premium refund clauses that cover assets guaranteed, in whole or  in part, by the U.S. Government, a U.S. Government agency or a  government-sponsored enterprise, provided the premium refund clauses are  for a period not to exceed 120 days from the date of transfer; or</p><p class="depth0">3. Warranties that permit the return of assets in instances of  misrepresentation, fraud or incomplete documentation.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Direct credit substitute means an arrangement in which a bank  holding company assumes, in form or in substance, credit risk associated  with an on- or off-balance sheet credit exposure that was not previously  owned by the bank holding company (third-party asset) and the risk  assumed by the bank holding company exceeds the pro rata share of the  bank holding company's interest in the third-party asset. If the bank  holding company has no claim on the third-party asset, then the bank  holding company's assumption of any credit risk with respect to the  third party asset is a direct credit substitute. Direct credit  substitutes include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0">1. Financial standby letters of credit that support financial claims  on a third party that exceed a bank holding company's pro rata share of  losses in the financial claim;</p><p class="depth0">2. Guarantees, surety arrangements, credit derivatives, and similar  instruments backing financial claims that exceed a bank holding  company's pro rata share in the financial claim;</p><p class="depth0">3. Purchased subordinated interests or securities that absorb more  than their pro rata share of losses from the underlying assets;</p><p class="depth0">4. Credit derivative contracts under which the bank holding company  assumes more than its pro rata share of credit risk on a third party  exposure;</p><p class="depth0">5. Loans or lines of credit that provide credit enhancement for the  financial obligations of an account party;</p><p class="depth0">6. Purchased loan servicing assets if the servicer is responsible  for credit losses or if the servicer makes or assumes credit-enhancing  representations and warranties with   respect to the loans serviced. Mortgage servicer cash advances that meet  the conditions of section III.B.3.a.viii. of this appendix are not  direct credit substitutes;</p><p class="depth0">7. Clean-up calls on third party assets. Clean-up calls that are 10  percent or less of the original pool balance that are exercisable at the  option of the bank holding company are not direct credit substitutes;  and</p><p class="depth0">8. Liquidity facilities that provide liquidity support to ABCP  (other than eligible ABCP liquidity facilities).</p><p class="depth0">iv. Eligible ABCP liquidity facility means a liquidity facility  supporting ABCP, in form or in substance, that is subject to an asset  quality test at the time of draw that precludes funding against assets  that are 90 days or more past due or in default. In addition, if the  assets that an eligible ABCP liquidity facility is required to fund  against are externally rated assets or exposures at the inception of the  facility, the facility can be used to fund only those assets or  exposures that are externally rated investment grade at the time of  funding. Notwithstanding the eligibility requirements set forth in the  two preceding sentences, a liquidity facility will be considered an  eligible ABCP liquidity facility if the assets that are funded under the  liquidity facility and which do not meet the eligibility requirements  are guaranteed, either conditionally or unconditionally, by the U.S.  government or its agencies, or by the central government of an OECD  country.</p><p class="depth0">v. Externally rated means that an instrument or obligation has  received a credit rating from a nationally recognized statistical rating  organization.</p><p class="depth0">vi. Face amount means the notional principal, or face value, amount  of an off-balance sheet item; the amortized cost of an asset not held  for trading purposes; and the fair value of a trading asset.</p><p class="depth0">vii. Financial asset means cash or other monetary instrument,  evidence of debt, evidence of an ownership interest in an entity, or a  contract that conveys a right to receive or exchange cash or another  financial instrument from another party.</p><p class="depth0">viii. Financial standby letter of credit means a letter of credit or  similar arrangement that represents an irrevocable obligation to a  third-party beneficiary:</p><p class="depth0">1. To repay money borrowed by, or advanced to, or for the account  of, a second party (the account party), or</p><p class="depth0">2. To make payment on behalf of the account party, in the event that  the account party fails to fulfill its obligation to the beneficiary.</p><p class="depth0">ix. Liquidity Facility means a legally binding commitment to provide  liquidity support to ABCP by lending to, or purchasing assets from, any  structure, program, or conduit in the event that funds are required to  repay maturing ABCP.</p><p class="depth0">x. Mortgage servicer cash advance means funds that a residential  mortgage loan servicer advances to ensure an uninterrupted flow of  payments, including advances made to cover foreclosure costs or other  expenses to facilitate the timely collection of the loan. A mortgage  servicer cash advance is not a recourse obligation or a direct credit  substitute if:</p><p class="depth0">1. The servicer is entitled to full reimbursement and this right is  not subordinated to other claims on the cash flows from the underlying  asset pool; or</p><p class="depth0">2. For any one loan, the servicer's obligation to make  nonreimbursable advances is contractually limited to an insignificant  amount of the outstanding principal balance of that loan.</p><p class="depth0">xi. Nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO)  means an entity recognized by the Division of Market Regulation of the  Securities and Exchange Commission (or any successor Division)  (Commission) as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization  for various purposes, including the Commission's uniform net capital  requirements for brokers and dealers.</p><p class="depth0">xii. Recourse means the retention, by a bank holding company, in  form or in substance, of any credit risk directly or indirectly  associated with an asset it has transferred and sold that exceeds a pro  rata share of the banking organization's claim on the asset. If a  banking organization has no claim on a transferred asset, then the  retention of any risk of credit loss is recourse. A recourse obligation  typically arises when a bank holding company transfers assets and  retains an explicit obligation to repurchase the assets or absorb losses  due to a default on the payment of principal or interest or any other  deficiency in the performance of the underlying obligor or some other  party. Recourse may also exist implicitly if a bank holding company  provides credit enhancement beyond any contractual obligation to support  assets it has sold. The following are examples of recourse arrangements:</p><p class="depth0">1. Credit-enhancing representations and warranties made on the  transferred assets;</p><p class="depth0">2. Loan servicing assets retained pursuant to an agreement under  which the bank holding company will be responsible for credit losses  associated with the loans being serviced. Mortgage servicer cash  advances that meet the conditions of section III.B.3.a.x. of this  appendix are not recourse arrangements;</p><p class="depth0">3. Retained subordinated interests that absorb more than their pro  rata share of losses from the underlying assets;</p><p class="depth0">4. Assets sold under an agreement to repurchase, if the assets are  not already included on the balance sheet;</p><p class="depth0">5. Loan strips sold without contractual recourse where the maturity  of the transferred   loan is shorter than the maturity of the commitment under which the loan  is drawn;</p><p class="depth0">6. Credit derivatives issued that absorb more than the bank holding  company's pro rata share of losses from the transferred assets;</p><p class="depth0">7. Clean-up calls at inception that are greater than 10 percent of  the balance of the original pool of transferred loans. Clean-up calls  that are 10 percent or less of the original pool balance that are  exercisable at the option of the bank holding company are not recourse  arrangements; and</p><p class="depth0">8. Liquidity facilities that provide liquidity support to ABCP  (other than eligible ABCP liquidity facilities).</p><p class="depth0">xiii. Residual interest means any on-balance sheet asset that  represents an interest (including a beneficial interest) created by a  transfer that qualifies as a sale (in accordance with generally accepted  accounting principles) of financial assets, whether through a  securitization or otherwise, and that exposes the bank holding company  to credit risk directly or indirectly associated with the transferred  assets that exceeds a pro rata share of the bank holding company's claim  on the assets, whether through subordination provisions or other credit  enhancement techniques. Residual interests generally include credit- enhancing I/Os, spread accounts, cash collateral accounts, retained  subordinated interests, other forms of over-collateralization, and  similar assets that function as a credit enhancement. Residual interests  further include those exposures that, in substance, cause the bank  holding company to retain the credit risk of an asset or exposure that  had qualified as a residual interest before it was sold. Residual  interests generally do not include interests purchased from a third  party, except that purchased credit-enhancing I/Os are residual  interests for purposes of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">xiv. Risk participation means a participation in which the  originating party remains liable to the beneficiary for the full amount  of an obligation (e.g., a direct credit substitute) notwithstanding that  another party has acquired a participation in that obligation.</p><p class="depth0">xv. Securitization means the pooling and repackaging by a special  purpose entity of assets or other credit exposures into securities that  can be sold to investors. Securitization includes transactions that  create stratified credit risk positions whose performance is dependent  upon an underlying pool of credit exposures, including loans and  commitments.</p><p class="depth0">xvi. Sponsor means a bank holding company that establishes an ABCP  program; approves the sellers permitted to participate in the program;  approves the asset pools to be purchased by the program; or administers  the program by monitoring the assets, arranging for debt placement,  compiling monthly reports, or ensuring compliance with the program  documents and with the program's credit and investment policy.</p><p class="depth0">xvii. Structured finance program means a program where receivable  interests and asset-backed securities issued by multiple participants  are purchased by a special purpose entity that repackages those  exposures into securities that can be sold to investors. Structured  finance programs allocate credit risks, generally, between the  participants and credit enhancement provided to the program.</p><p class="depth0">xviii. Traded position means a position that is externally rated and  is retained, assumed, or issued in connection with an asset  securitization, where there is a reasonable expectation that, in the  near future, the rating will be relied upon by unaffiliated investors to  purchase the position; or an unaffiliated third party to enter into a  transaction involving the position, such as a purchase, loan, or  repurchase agreement.</p><p class="depth0">b. Credit equivalent amounts and risk weight of recourse obligations  and direct credit substitutes. i. Credit equivalent amount. Except as  otherwise provided in sections III.B.3.c. through f. and III.B.5. of  this appendix, the credit-equivalent amount for a recourse obligation or  direct credit substitute is the full amount of the credit-enhanced  assets for which the bank holding company directly or indirectly retains  or assumes credit risk multiplied by a 100 percent conversion factor.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Risk-weight factor. To determine the bank holding company's  risk-weight factor for off-balance sheet recourse obligations and direct  credit substitutes, the credit equivalent amount is assigned to the risk  category appropriate to the obligor in the underlying transaction, after  considering any associated guarantees or collateral. For a direct credit  substitute that is an on-balance sheet asset (e.g., a purchased  subordinated security), a bank holding company must calculate risk- weighted assets using the amount of the direct credit substitute and the  full amount of the assets it supports, i.e., all the more senior  positions in the structure. The treatment of direct credit substitutes  that have been syndicated or in which risk participations have been  conveyed or acquired is set forth in section III.D.1 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">c. Externally-rated positions: credit-equivalent amounts and risk  weights of recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual  interests, and asset- and mortgage-backed securities (including asset- backed commercial paper)--i. Traded positions. With respect to a  recourse obligation, direct credit substitute, residual interest (other  than a credit-enhancing I/Ostrip) or asset- and mortgage-backed security  (including asset-backed commercial paper) that is a traded position and  that has received an external rating on a long-term   position that is one grade below investment grade or better or a short- term rating that is investment grade, the bank holding company may  multiply the face amount of the position by the appropriate risk weight,  determined in accordance with the tables below. Stripped mortgage-backed  securities and other similar instruments, such as interest-only or  principal-only strips that are not credit enhancements, must be assigned  to the 100 percent risk category. If a traded position has received more  than one external rating, the lowest single rating will apply.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Risk weight</p><p class="depth0">Long-term rating category            Examples         (In percent) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Highest or second highest           AAA, AA.............              20</p><p class="depth0">investment grade. Third highest investment grade....  A...................              50 Lowest investment grade...........

A-3, P-3............             100 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">ii. Non-traded positions. A recourse obligation, direct credit  substitute, or residual interest (but not a credit-enhancing I/O strip)  extended in connection with a securitization that is not a traded  position may be assigned a risk weight in accordance with section  III.B.3.c.i. of this appendix if:</p><p class="depth0">1. It has been externally rated by more than one NRSRO;</p><p class="depth0">2. It has received an external rating on a long-term position that  is one grade below investment grade or better or on a short-term  position that is investment grade by all NRSROs providing a rating;</p><p class="depth0">3. The ratings are publicly available; and</p><p class="depth0">4. The ratings are based on the same criteria used to rate traded  positions.</p><p class="depth0">If the ratings are different, the lowest rating will determine the  risk category to which the recourse obligation, direct credit  substitute, or residual interest will be assigned.</p><p class="depth0">d. Senior positions not externally rated. For a recourse obligation,  direct credit substitute, residual interest, or asset-or mortgage-backed  security that is not externally rated but is senior or preferred in all  features to a traded position (including collateralization and  maturity), a bank holding company may apply a risk weight to the face  amount of the senior position in accordance with section III.B.3.c.i. of  this appendix, based on the traded position, subject to any current or  prospective supervisory guidance and the bank holding company satisfying  the Federal Reserve that this treatment is appropriate. This section  will apply only if the traded subordinated position provides substantive  credit support to the unrated position until the unrated position  matures.</p><p class="depth0">e. Capital requirement for residual interests--i. Capital  requirement for credit-enhancing I/O strips. After applying the  concentration limit to credit-enhancing I/O strips (both purchased and  retained) in accordance with sections II.B.2.c. through e. of this  appendix, a bank holding company must maintain risk-based capital for a  credit-enhancing I/O strip (both purchased and retained), regardless of  the external rating on that position, equal to the remaining amount of  the credit-enhancing I/O (net of any existing associated deferred tax  liability), even if the amount of risk-based capital required to be  maintained exceeds the full risk-based capital requirement for the  assets transferred. Transactions that, in substance, result in the  retention of credit risk associated with a transferred credit-enhancing  I/O strip will be treated as if the credit-enhancing I/O strip was  retained by the bank holding company and not transferred.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Capital requirement for other residual interests. 1. If a  residual interest does not meet the requirements of sections III.B.3.c.  or d. of this appendix, a bank holding must maintain risk-based capital  equal to the remaining amount of the residual interest that is retained  on the balance sheet (net of any existing associated deferred tax  liability), even if the amount of risk-based capital required to be  maintained exceeds the full risk-based capital requirement for the  assets transferred. Transactions that, in substance, result in the  retention of credit risk associated with a transferred residual interest  will be treated as if the residual interest was retained by the bank  holding company and not transferred.</p><p class="depth0">2. Where the aggregate capital requirement for residual interests  and other recourse obligations in connection with the same transfer of  assets exceed the full risk-based capital requirement for those assets,  a bank holding company must maintain risk-based capital equal to the  greater of the risk-based capital requirement for the residual interest  as calculated under section III.B.3.e.ii.1. of   this appendix or the full risk-based capital requirement for the assets  transferred.</p><p class="depth0">f. Positions that are not rated by an NRSRO. A position (but not a  residual interest) maintained in connection with a securitization and  that is not rated by a NRSRO may be risk-weighted based on the bank  holding company's determination of the credit rating of the position, as  specified in the table below, multiplied by the face amount of the  position. In order to obtain this treatment, the bank holding company's  system for determining the credit rating of the position must meet one  of the three alternative standards set out in sections III.B.3.f.i.  through III.B.3.f.iii. of this appendix.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Risk weight</p><p class="depth0">Rating category                 Examples         (In percent) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Highest or second highest           AAA, AA.............             100</p><p class="depth0">investment grade.

Internal risk rating used for asset-backed programs. A direct  credit substitute (other than a purchased credit-enhancing I/O) is  assumed in connection with an asset-backed commercial paper program  sponsored by the bank holding company and the bank holding company is  able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Federal Reserve, prior to  relying upon its use, that the bank holding company's internal credit  risk rating system is adequate. Adequate internal credit risk rating  systems usually contain the following criteria:</p><p class="depth0">1. The internal credit risk system is an integral part of the bank  holding company's risk management system, which explicitly incorporates  the full range of risks arising from a bank holding company's  participation in securitization activities;</p><p class="depth0">2. Internal credit ratings are linked to measurable outcomes, such  as the probability that the position will experience any loss, the  position's expected loss given default, and the degree of variance in  losses given default on that position;</p><p class="depth0">3. The bank holding company's internal credit risk system must  separately consider the risk associated with the underlying loans or  borrowers, and the risk associated with the structure of a particular  securitization transaction;</p><p class="depth0">4. The bank holding company's internal credit risk system must  identify gradations of risk among ``pass'' assets and other risk  positions;</p><p class="depth0">5. The bank holding company must have clear, explicit criteria that  are used to classify assets into each internal risk grade, including  subjective factors;</p><p class="depth0">6. The bank holding company must have independent credit risk  management or loan review personnel assigning or reviewing the credit  risk ratings;</p><p class="depth0">7. The bank holding company must have an internal audit procedure  that periodically verifies that the internal credit risk ratings are  assigned in accordance with the established criteria;</p><p class="depth0">8. The bank holding company must monitor the performance of the  internal credit risk ratings assigned to nonrated, nontraded direct  credit substitutes over time to determine the appropriateness of the  initial credit risk rating assignment and adjust individual credit risk  ratings, or the overall internal credit risk ratings system, as needed;  and</p><p class="depth0">9. The internal credit risk system must make credit risk rating  assumptions that are consistent with, or more conservative than, the  credit risk rating assumptions and methodologies of NRSROs.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Program Ratings. A direct credit substitute or recourse  obligation (other than a residual interest) is assumed or retained in  connection with a structured finance program and a NRSRO has reviewed  the terms of the program and stated a rating for positions associated  with the program. If the program has options for different combinations  of assets, standards, internal credit enhancements and other relevant  factors, and the NRSRO specifies ranges of rating categories to them,  the bank holding company may apply the rating category that corresponds  to the bank holding company's position. In order to rely on a program  rating, the bank holding company must demonstrate to the Federal  Reserve's satisfaction that the credit risk rating assigned to the  program meets the same standards generally used by NRSROs for rating  traded positions. The bank holding company must also demonstrate to the  Federal Reserve's satisfaction that the criteria underlying the NRSRO's  assignment of ratings for the program are satisfied for the particular  position. If a bank holding company participates in a securitization  sponsored by another party, the Federal Reserve may authorize the bank  holding company to use this approach based on a programmatic rating  obtained by the sponsor of the program.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Computer Program. The bank holding company is using an  acceptable credit assessment computer program to determine the rating of  a direct credit substitute or recourse obligation (but not residual  interest)   issued in connection with a structured finance program. A NRSRO must  have developed the computer program, and the bank holding company must  demonstrate to the Federal Reserve's satisfaction that ratings under the  program correspond credibly and reliably with the rating of traded  positions.</p><p class="depth0">g. Limitations on risk-based capital requirements--i. Low-level  exposure. If the maximum contractual exposure to loss retained or  assumed by a bank holding company in connection with a recourse  obligation or a direct credit substitute is less than the effective  risk-based capital requirement for the enhanced assets, the risk-based  capital requirement is limited to the maximum contractual exposure, less  any liability account established in accordance with generally accepted  accounting principles. This limitation does not apply when a bank  holding company provides credit enhancement beyond any contractual  obligation to support assets it has sold.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Mortgage-related securities or participation certificates  retained in a mortgage loan swap. If a bank holding company holds a  mortgage-related security or a participation certificate as a result of  a mortgage loan swap with recourse, capital is required to support the  recourse obligation plus the percentage of the mortgage-related security  or participation certificate that is not covered by the recourse  obligation. The total amount of capital required for the on-balance  sheet asset and the recourse obligation, however, is limited to the  capital requirement for the underlying loans, calculated as if the  organization continued to hold these loans as on-balance sheet assets.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Related on-balance sheet assets. If a recourse obligation or  direct credit substitute subject to section III.B.3. of this appendix  also appears as a balance sheet asset, the balance sheet asset is not  included in an organization's risk-weighted assets to the extent the  value of the balance sheet asset is already included in the off-balance  sheet credit equivalent amount for the recourse obligation or direct  credit substitute, except in the case of loan servicing assets and  similar arrangements with embedded recourse obligations or direct credit  substitutes. In that case, both the on-balance sheet assets and the  related recourse obligations and direct credit substitutes are  incorporated into the risk-based capital calculation.</p><p class="depth0">4. Maturity. Maturity is generally not a factor in assigning items  to risk categories with the exception of claims on non-OECD banks,  commitments, and interest rate and foreign exchange rate contracts.  Except for commitments, short-term is defined as one year or less  remaining maturity and long-term is defined as over one year remaining  maturity. In the case of commitments, short-term is defined as one year  or less original maturity and long-term is defined as over one year  original maturity.</p><p class="depth0">5. Small Business Loans and Leases on Personal Property Transferred  with Recourse. a. Notwithstanding other provisions of this appendix A, a  qualifying banking organization that has transferred small business  loans and leases on personal property (small business obligations) with  recourse shall include in weighted-risk assets only the amount of  retained recourse, provided two conditions are met. First, the  transaction must be treated as a sale under GAAP and, second, the  banking organization must establish pursuant to GAAP a non-capital  reserve sufficient to meet the organization's reasonably estimated  liability under the recourse arrangement. Only loans and leases to  businesses that meet the criteria for a small business concern  established by the Small Business Administration under section 3(a) of  the Small Business Act are eligible for this capital treatment.</p><p class="depth0">b. For purposes of this appendix A, a banking organization is  qualifying if it meets the criteria for well capitalized or, by order of  the Board, adequately capitalized, as those criteria are set forth in  the Board's prompt corrective action regulation for state member banks  (12 CFR 208.40). For purposes of determining whether an organization  meets these criteria, its capital ratios must be calculated without  regard to the capital treatment for transfers of small business  obligations with recourse specified in section III.B.5.a. of this  appendix A. The total outstanding amount of recourse retained by a  qualifying banking organization on transfers of small business  obligations receiving the preferential capital treatment cannot exceed  15 percent of the organization's total risk-based capital. By order, the  Board may approve a higher limit.</p><p class="depth0">c. If a bank holding company ceases to be qualifying or exceeds the  15 percent capital limitation, the preferential capital treatment will  continue to apply to any transfers of small business obligations with  recourse that were consummated during the time that the organization was  qualifying and did not exceed the capital limit.</p><p class="depth0">6. Asset-backed commercial paper programs. a. An asset-backed  commercial paper (ABCP) program means a program that primarily issues  externally rated commercial paper backed by assets or exposures held in  a bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entity.</p><p class="depth0">b. If a bank holding company has multiple overlapping exposures  (such as a program-wide credit enhancement and multiple pool-specific  liquidity facilities) to an ABCP program that is not consolidated for  risk-based capital purposes, the bank holding company is not required to  hold duplicative risk-based capital under this appendix against the  overlapping position. Instead, the bank holding   company should apply to the overlapping position the applicable risk- based capital treatment that results in the highest capital charge.</p><p class="depth0">C. Risk Weights</p><p class="depth0">Attachment III contains a listing of the risk categories, a summary  of the types of assets assigned to each category and the risk weight  associated with each category, that is, 0 percent, 20 percent, 50  percent, and 100 percent. A brief explanation of the components of each  category follows.</p><p class="depth0">1. Category 1: zero percent. This category includes cash (domestic  and foreign) owned and held in all offices of subsidiary depository  institutions or in transit and gold bullion held in either a subsidiary  depository institution's own vaults or in another's vaults on an  allocated basis, to the extent it is offset by gold bullion liabilities.  \36\ The category also includes all direct claims (including securities,  loans, and leases) on, and the portions of claims that are directly and  unconditionally guaranteed by, the central governments \37\ of the OECD  countries and U.S. Government agencies, \38\ as well as all direct local  currency claims on, and the portions of local currency claims that are  directly and unconditionally guaranteed by, the central governments of  non-OECD countries, to the extent that subsidiary depository  institutions have liabilities booked in that currency. A claim is not  considered to be unconditionally guaranteed by a central government if  the validity of the guarantee is dependent upon some affirmative action  by the holder or a third party. Generally, securities guaranteed by the  U.S. Government or its agencies that are actively traded in financial  markets, such as GNMA securities, are considered to be unconditionally  guaranteed. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\36\ All other holdings of bullion are assigned to the 100 percent  risk category.</p><p class="depth0">\37\ A central government is defined to include departments and  ministries, including the central bank, of the central government. The  U.S. central bank includes the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, and stock held  in these banks as a condition of membership is assigned to the zero  percent risk category. The definition of central government does not  include state, provincial, or local governments; or commercial  enterprises owned by the central government. In addition, it does not  include local government entities or commercial enterprises whose  obligations are guaranteed by the central government, although any  claims on such entities guaranteed by central governments are placed in  the same general risk category as other claims guaranteed by central  governments. OECD central governments are defined as central governments  of the OECD-based group of countries; non-OECD central governments are  defined as central governments of countries that do not belong to the  OECD-based group of countries.</p><p class="depth0">\38\ A U.S. Government agency is defined as an instrumentality of  the U.S. Government whose obligations are fully and explicitly  guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest by the  full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. Such agencies include the  Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), the Veterans  Administration (VA), the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the  Export-Import Bank (Exim Bank), the Overseas Private Investment  Corporation (OPIC), the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), and the  Small Business Administration (SBA). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">This category also includes claims collateralized by cash on deposit  in the subsidiary lending institution or by securities issued or  guaranteed by OECD central governments or U.S. government agencies for  which a positive margin of collateral is maintained on a daily basis,  fully taking into account any change in the banking organization's  exposure to the obligor or counterparty under a claim in relation to the  market value of the collateral held in support of that claim.</p><p class="depth0">This category also includes ABCP (i) purchased by a bank holding  company on or after September 19, 2008, from an SEC-registered open-end  investment company that holds itself out as a money market mutual fund  under SEC Rule 2a-7 (17 CFR 270.2a-7) and (ii) pledged by the bank  holding company to a Federal Reserve Bank to secure financing from the  ABCP lending facility (AMLF) established by the Board on September 19,  2008.</p><p class="depth0">2. Category 2: 20 percent. a. This category includes cash items in  the process of collection, both foreign and domestic; short-term claims  (including demand deposits) on, and the portions of short-term claims  that are guaranteed by, \39\ U.S. depository institutions \40\ and  foreign banks \41\; and long-term   claims on, and the portions of long-term claims that are guaranteed by,  U.S. depository institutions and OECD banks. \42\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\39\ Claims guaranteed by U.S. depository institutions and foreign  banks include risk participations in both bankers acceptances and  standby letters of credit, as well as participations in commitments,  that are conveyed to U.S. depository institutions or foreign banks.</p><p class="depth0">\40\ See footnote 9 of this appendix for the definition of a U.S.  depository institution. For this purpose, the definition also includes  U.S.-chartered depository institutions owned by foreigners. However,  branches and agencies of foreign banks located in the U.S., as well as  all bank holding companies, are excluded.</p><p class="depth0">\41\ See footnote 10 of this appendix for the definition of a  foreign bank. Foreign banks are distinguished as either OECD banks or  non-OECD banks. OECD banks include banks and their branches (foreign and  domestic) organized under the laws of countries (other than the United  States) that belong to the OECD-based group of countries. Non-OECD banks  include banks and their branches (foreign and domestic) organized under  the laws of countries that do not belong to the OECD-based group of  countries.</p><p class="depth0">\42\ Long-term claims on, or guaranteed by, non-OECD banks and all  claims on bank holding companies are assigned to the 100 percent risk  category, as are holdings of bank-issued securities that qualify as  capital of the issuing banks. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">b. This category also includes the portions of claims that are  conditionally guaranteed by OECD central governments and U.S. Government  agencies, as well as the portions of local currency claims that are  conditionally guaranteed by non-OECD central governments, to the extent  that subsidiary depository institutions have liabilities booked in that  currency. In addition, this category also includes claims on, and the  portions of claims that are guaranteed by, U.S. government-sponsored  \43\ agencies and claims on, and the portions of claims guaranteed by,  the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank),  the International Finance Corporation, the Interamerican Development  Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the African Development Bank, the  European Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development, the Nordic Investment Bank, and other multilateral lending  institutions or regional development banks in which the U.S. government  is a shareholder or contributing member. General obligation claims on,  or portions of claims guaranteed by the full faith and credit of, states  or other political subdivisions of the U.S. or other countries of the  OECD--based group are also assigned to this category. \44\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\43\ For this purpose, U.S. government-sponsored agencies are  defined as agencies originally established or chartered by the Federal  government to serve public purposes specified by the U.S. Congress but  whose obligations are not explicitly guaranteed by the full faith and  credit of the U.S. government. These agencies include the Federal Home  Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), the Federal National Mortgage  Association (FNMA), the Farm Credit System, the Federal Home Loan Bank  System, and the Student Loan Marketing Association (SLMA). Claims on  U.S. government-sponsored agencies include capital stock in a Federal  Home Loan Bank that is held as a condition of membership in that Bank.</p><p class="depth0">\44\ Claims on, or guaranteed by, states or other political  subdivisions of countries that do not belong to the OECD-based group of  countries are placed in the 100 percent risk category. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">c. This category also includes the portions of claims (including  repurchase transactions) collateralized by cash on deposit in the  subsidiary lending institution or by securities issued or guaranteed by  OECD central governments or U.S. government agencies that do not qualify  for the zero percent risk-weight category; collateralized by securities  issued or guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies; or  collateralized by securities issued by multilateral lending institutions  or regional development banks in which the U.S. government is a  shareholder or contributing member.</p><p class="depth0">d. This category also includes claims \45\ on, or guaranteed by, a  qualifying securities firm \46\ incorporated in the United States or  other member of the OECD-based group of countries provided that: the  qualifying securities firm has a long-term issuer credit rating, or a  rating on at least one issue of long-term debt, in one of the three  highest investment grade rating categories from a nationally recognized  statistical rating organization; or the claim is guaranteed by the  firm's parent company and the parent company has such a rating. If  ratings are available from more than one rating agency, the lowest  rating will be used to determine whether the rating requirement has been  met. This category also includes a collateralized claim on   a qualifying securities firm in such a country, without regard to  satisfaction of the rating standard, provided the claim arises under a  contract that: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\45\ Claims on a qualifying securities firm that are instruments the  firm, or its parent company, uses to satisfy its applicable capital  requirement are not eligible for this risk weight.</p><p class="depth0">\46\ With regard to securities firms incorporated in the United  States, qualifying securities firms are those securities firms that are  broker-dealers registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission  and are in compliance with the SEC's net capital rule, 17 CFR 240.15c3- 1. With regard to securities firms incorporated in other countries in  the OECD-based group of countries, qualifying securities firms are those  securities firms that a banking organization is able to demonstrate are  subject to consolidated supervision and regulation (covering their  direct and indirect subsidiaries, but not necessarily their parent  organizations) comparable to that imposed on banks in OECD countries.  Such regulation must include risk-based capital requirements comparable  to those applied to banks under the Accord on International Convergence  of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards (1988, as amended in 1998)  (Basel Accord). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Is a reverse repurchase/repurchase agreement or securities  lending/borrowing transaction executed under standard industry  documentation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Is collateralized by debt or equity securities that are liquid  and readily marketable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Is marked-to-market daily;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Is subject to a daily margin maintenance requirement under the  standard industry documentation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Can be liquidated, terminated, or accelerated immediately in  bankruptcy or similar proceeding, and the security or collateral  agreement will not be stayed or avoided, under applicable law of the  relevant jurisdiction. \47\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\47\ For example, a claim is exempt from the automatic stay in  bankruptcy in the United States if it arises under a securities contract  or repurchase agreement subject to section 555 or 559 of the Bankruptcy  Code, respectively (11 U.S.C. 555 or 559), a qualified financial  contract under section 11(e)(8) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12  U.S.C. 1821(e)(8)), or a netting contract between financial institutions  under sections 401-407 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  Improvement Act of 1991 (12 U.S.C. 4401-4407), or the Board's Regulation  EE (12 CFR Part 231). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">3. Category 3: 50 percent. This category includes loans fully  secured by first liens \48\ on 1- to 4-family residential properties,  either owner-occupied or rented, or on multifamily residential  properties,\49\ that meet certain criteria.\50\ Loans included in this  category must have been made in accordance with prudent underwriting  standards; \51\ be performing in accordance with their original terms;  and not be 90 days or more past due or carried in nonaccrual status. For  purposes of this 50 percent risk weight category, a loan modified on a  permanent or trial basis solely pursuant to the U.S. Department of  Treasury's Home Affordable Mortgage Program will be considered to be  performing in accordance with its original terms. The following  additional criteria must also be applied to a loan secured by a  multifamily residential property that is included in this category: all  principal and interest payments on the loan must have been made on time  for at least the year preceding placement in this category, or in the  case where the existing property owner is refinancing a loan on that  property, all principal and interest payments on the loan being  refinanced must have been made on time for at least the year preceding  placement in this category; amortization of the principal and interest  must occur over a period of not more than 30 years and the minimum  original maturity for repayment of principal must not be less than 7  years; and the annual net operating income (before debt service)  generated by the property during its most recent fiscal year must not be  less than 120 percent of the loan's current annual debt service (115  percent if the loan is   based on a floating interest rate) or, in the case of a cooperative or  other not-for-profit housing project, the property must generate  sufficient cash flow to provide comparable protection to the  institution. Also included in this category are privately-issued  mortgage-backed securities provided that: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\48\ If a banking organization holds the first and junior lien(s) on  a residential property and no other party holds an intervening lien, the  transaction is treated as a single loan secured by a first lien for the  purposes of determining the loan-to-value ratio and assigning a risk  weight.</p><p class="depth0">\49\ Loans that qualify as loans secured by 1- to 4-family  residential properties or multifamily residential properties are listed  in the instructions to the FR Y-9C Report. In addition, for risk-based  capital purposes, loans secured by 1- to 4-family residential properties  include loans to builders with substantial project equity for the  construction of 1-to 4-family residences that have been presold under  firm contracts to purchasers who have obtained firm commitments for  permanent qualifying mortgage loans and have made substantial earnest  money deposits. Such loans to builders will be considered prudently  underwritten only if the bank holding company has obtained sufficient  documentation that the buyer of the home intends to purchase the home  (i.e., has a legally binding written sales contract) and has the ability  to obtain a mortgage loan sufficient to purchase the home (i.e., has a  firm written commitment for permanent financing of the home upon  completion).</p><p class="depth0">\50\ Residential property loans that do not meet all the specified  criteria or that are made for the purpose of speculative property  development are placed in the 100 percent risk category.</p><p class="depth0">\51\ Prudent underwriting standards include a conservative ratio of  the current loan balance to the value of the property. In the case of a  loan secured by multifamily residential property, the loan-to-value  ratio is not conservative if it exceeds 80 percent (75 percent if the  loan is based on a floating interest rate). Prudent underwriting  standards also dictate that a loan-to-value ratio used in the case of  originating a loan to acquire a property would not be deemed  conservative unless the value is based on the lower of the acquisition  cost of the property or appraised (or if appropriate, evaluated) value.  Otherwise, the loan-to-value ratio generally would be based upon the  value of the property as determined by the most current appraisal, or if  appropriate, the most current evaluation. All appraisals must be made in  a manner consistent with the Federal banking agencies' real estate  appraisal regulations and guidelines and with the banking organization's  own appraisal guidelines. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The structure of the security meets the criteria described in  section III(B)(3) above;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> if the security is backed by a pool of conventional mortgages,  on 1- to 4-family residential or multifamily residential properties,  each underlying mortgage meets the criteria described above in this  section for eligibility for the 50 percent risk category at the time the  pool is originated;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the security is backed by privately-issued mortgage-backed  securities, each underlying security qualifies for the 50 percent risk  category; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the security is backed by a pool of multifamily residential  mortgages, principal and interest payments on the security are not 30  days or more past due. Privately-issued mortgage-backed securities that  do not meet these criteria or that do not qualify for a lower risk  weight are generally assigned to the 100 percent risk category.</p><p class="depth0">Also assigned to this category are revenue (non-general obligation)  bonds or similar obligations, including loans and leases, that are  obligations of states or other political subdivisions of the U.S. (for  example, municipal revenue bonds) or other countries of the OECD-based  group, but for which the government entity is committed to repay the  debt with revenues from the specific projects financed, rather than from  general tax funds.</p><p class="depth0">Credit equivalent amounts of derivative contracts involving standard  risk obligors (that is, obligors whose loans or debt securities would be  assigned to the 100 percent risk category) are included in the 50  percent category, unless they are backed by collateral or guarantees  that allow them to be placed in a lower risk category.</p><p class="depth0">4. Category 4: 100 percent. a. All assets not included in the  categories above are assigned to this category, which comprises standard  risk assets. The bulk of the assets typically found in a loan portfolio  would be assigned to the 100 percent category.</p><p class="depth0">b. This category includes long-term claims on, and the portions of  long-term claims that are guaranteed by, non-OECD banks, and all claims  on non-OECD central governments that entail some degree of transfer  risk. \52\ This category includes all claims on foreign and domestic  private-sector obligors not included in the categories above (including  loans to nondepository financial institutions and bank holding  companies); claims on commercial firms owned by the public sector;  customer liabilities to the organization on acceptances outstanding  involving standard risk claims;\53\ investments in fixed assets,  premises, and other real estate owned; common and preferred stock of  corporations, including stock acquired for debts previously contracted;  all stripped mortgage-backed securities and similar instruments; and  commercial and consumer loans (except those assigned to lower risk  categories due to recognized guarantees or collateral and loans secured  by residential property that qualify for a lower risk weight). This  category also includes claims representing capital of a qualifying  securities firm. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\52\ Such assets include all nonlocal currency claims on, and the  portions of claims that are guaranteed by, non-OECD central governments  and those portions of local currency claims on, or guaranteed by, non- OECD central governments that exceed the local currency liabilities held  by subsidiary depository institutions.</p><p class="depth0">\53\ Customer liabilities on acceptances outstanding involving  nonstandard risk claims, such as claims on U.S. depository institutions,  are assigned to the risk category appropriate to the identity of the  obligor or, if relevant, the nature of the collateral or guarantees  backing the claims. Portions of acceptances conveyed as risk  participations to U.S. depository institutions or foreign banks are  assigned to the 20 percent risk category appropriate to short-term  claims guaranteed by U.S. depository institutions and foreign banks. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">c. Also included in this category are industrial-development bonds  and similar obligations issued under the auspices of states or political  subdivisions of the OECD-based group of countries for the benefit of a  private party or enterprise where that party or enterprise, not the  government entity, is obligated to pay the principal and interest, and  all obligations of states or political subdivisions of countries that do  not belong to the OECD-based group.</p><p class="depth0">d. The following assets also are assigned a risk weight of 100  percent if they have not been deducted from capital: investments in  unconsolidated companies, joint ventures, or associated companies;  instruments that qualify as capital issued by other banking  organizations; and any intangibles, including those that may have been  grandfathered into capital.</p><p class="depth0">D. Off-Balance Sheet Items</p><p class="depth0">The face amount of an off-balance sheet item is generally  incorporated into risk-weighted assets in two steps. The face amount is  first multiplied by a credit conversion factor, except for direct credit  substitutes and recourse obligations as discussed in section III.D.1. of  this appendix. The resultant credit equivalent amount is   assigned to the appropriate risk category according to the obligor or,  if relevant, the guarantor, the nature of any collateral, or external  credit ratings. \54\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\54\ The sufficiency of collateral and guarantees for off-balance- sheet items is determined by the market value of the collateral or the  amount of the guarantee in relation to the face amount of the item,  except for derivative contracts, for which this determination is  generally made in relation to the credit equivalent amount. Collateral  and guarantees are subject to the same provisions noted under section  III.B of this appendix A. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">1. Items with a 100 percent conversion factor. a. Except as  otherwise provided in section III.B.3. of this appendix, the full amount  of an asset or transaction supported, in whole or in part, by a direct  credit substitute or a recourse obligation. Direct credit substitutes  and recourse obligations are defined in section III.B.3. of this  appendix.</p><p class="depth0">b. Sale and repurchase agreements and forward agreements. Forward  agreements are legally binding contractual obligations to purchase  assets with certain drawdown at a specified future date. Such  obligations include forward purchases, forward forward deposits placed,  \55\ and partly-paid shares and securities; they do not include  commitments to make residential mortgage loans or forward foreign  exchange contracts. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\55\ Forward forward deposits accepted are treated as interest rate  contracts. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">c. Securities lent by a banking organization are treated in one of  two ways, depending upon whether the lender is at risk of loss. If a  banking organization, as agent for a customer, lends the customer's  securities and does not indemnify the customer against loss, then the  transaction is excluded from the risk-based capital calculation. If,  alternatively, a banking organization lends its own securities or,  acting as agent for a customer, lends the customer's securities and  indemnifies the customer against loss, the transaction is converted at  100 percent and assigned to the risk weight category appropriate to the  obligor, or, if applicable, to any collateral delivered to the lending  organization, or the independent custodian acting on the lending  organization's behalf. Where a banking organization is acting as agent  for a customer in a transaction involving the lending or sale of  securities that is collateralized by cash delivered to the banking  organization, the transaction is deemed to be collateralized by cash on  deposit in a subsidiary depository institution for purposes of  determining the appropriate risk-weight category, provided that any  indemnification is limited to no more than the difference between the  market value of the securities and the cash collateral received and any  reinvestment risk associated with that cash collateral is borne by the  customer.</p><p class="depth0">d. In the case of direct credit substitutes in which a risk  participation \56\ has been conveyed, the full amount of the assets that  are supported, in whole or in part, by the credit enhancement are  converted to a credit equivalent amount at 100 percent. However, the pro  rata share of the credit equivalent amount that has been conveyed  through a risk participation is assigned to whichever risk category is  lower: the risk category appropriate to the obligor, after considering  any relevant guarantees or collateral, or the risk category appropriate  to the institution acquiring the participation. \57\ Any remainder is  assigned to the risk category appropriate to the obligor, guarantor, or  collateral. For example, the pro rata share of the full amount of the  assets supported, in whole or in part, by a direct credit substitute  conveyed as a risk participation to a U.S. domestic depository  institution or foreign bank is assigned to the 20 percent risk category.  \58\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\56\ That is, a participation in which the originating banking  organization remains liable to the beneficiary for the full amount of  the direct credit substitute if the party that has acquired the  participation fails to pay when the instrument is drawn.</p><p class="depth0">\57\ A risk participation in bankers acceptances conveyed to other  institutions is also assigned to the risk category appropriate to the  institution acquiring the participation or, if relevant, the guarantor  or nature of the collateral.</p><p class="depth0">\58\ Risk participations with a remaining maturity of over one year  that are conveyed to non-OECD banks are to be assigned to the 100  percent risk category, unless a lower risk category is appropriate to  the obligor, guarantor, or collateral. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">e. In the case of direct credit substitutes in which a risk  participation has been acquired, the acquiring banking organization's  percentage share of the direct credit substitute is multiplied by the  full amount of the assets that are supported, in whole or in part, by  the credit enhancement and converted to a credit equivalent amount at  100 percent. The credit equivalent amount of an acquisition of a risk  participation in a direct credit substitute is assigned to the risk  category appropriate to the account party obligor or, if relevant, the  nature of the collateral or guarantees.</p><p class="depth0">f. In the case of direct credit substitutes that take the form of a  syndication where each banking organization is obligated only for its  pro rata share of the risk and there is no recourse to the originating  banking organization, each banking organization will only include its  pro rata share of the assets supported, in whole or in part, by the  direct   credit substitute in its risk-based capital calculation. \59\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\59\ For example, if a banking organization has a 10 percent share  of a $10 syndicated direct credit substitute that provides credit  support to a $100 loan, then the banking organization's $1 pro rata  share in the enhancement means that a $10 pro rata share of the loan is  included in risk weighted assets. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">2. Items with a 50 percent conversion factor. a. Transaction-related  contingencies are converted at 50 percent. Such contingencies include  bid bonds, performance bonds, warranties, standby letters of credit  related to particular transactions, and performance standby letters of  credit, as well as acquisitions of risk participation in performance  standby letters of credit. Peformance standby letters of credit  represent obligations backing the performance of nonfinancial or  commercial contracts or undertakings. To the extent permitted by law or  regulation, performance standby letters of credit include arrangements  backing, among other things, subcontractors' and suppliers' performance,  labor and materials contracts, and construction bids.</p><p class="depth0">b. The unused portion of commitments with an original maturity  exceeding one year, including underwriting commitments, and commercial  and consumer credit commitments also are converted at 50 percent.  Original maturity is defined as the length of time between the date the  commitment is issued and the earliest date on which: (1) The banking  organization can, at its option, unconditionally (without cause) cancel  the commitment;\60\ and (2) the banking organization is scheduled to  (and as a normal practice actually does) review the facility to  determine whether or not it should be extended. Such reviews must  continue to be conducted at least annually for such a facility to  qualify as a short-term commitment. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\60\ In the case of consumer home equity or mortgage lines of credit  secured by liens on 1-4 family residential properties, the bank is  deemed able to unconditionally cancel the commitment for the purpose of  this criterion if, at its option, it can prohibit additional extensions  of credit, reduce the credit line, and terminate the commitment to the  full extent permitted by relevant Federal law. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">c.i. Commitments are defined as any legally binding arrangements  that obligate a banking organization to extend credit in the form of  loans or leases; to purchase loans, securities, or other assets; or to  participate in loans and leases. They also include overdraft facilities,  revolving credit, home equity and mortgage lines of credit, eligible  ABCP liquidity facilities, and similar transactions. Normally,  commitments involve a written contract or agreement and a commitment  fee, or some other form of consideration. Commitments are included in  weighted-risk assets regardless of whether they contain ``material  adverse change'' clauses or other provisions that are intended to  relieve the issuer of its funding obligation under certain conditions.  In the case of commitments structured as syndications, where the banking  organization is obligated solely for its pro rata share, only the  organization's proportional share of the syndicated commitment is taken  into account in calculating the risk-based capital ratio.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Banking organizations that are subject to the market risk rules  are required to convert the notional amount of eligible ABCP liquidity  facilities, in form or in substance, with an original maturity of over  one year that are carried in the trading account at 50 percent to  determine the appropriate credit equivalent amount even though those  facilities are structured or characterized as derivatives or other  trading book assets. Liquidity facilities that support ABCP, in form or  in substance, (including those positions to which the market risk rules  may not be applied as set forth in section 2(a) of appendix E of this  part) that are not eligible ABCP liquidity facilities are to be  considered recourse obligations or direct credit substitutes, and  assessed the appropriate risk-based capital treatment in accordance with  section III.B.3. of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">d. Once a commitment has been converted at 50 percent, any portion  that has been conveyed to U.S. depository institutions or OECD banks as  participations in which the originating banking organization retains the  full obligation to the borrower if the participating bank fails to pay  when the instrument is drawn, is assigned to the 20 percent risk  category. This treatment is analogous to that accorded to conveyances of  risk participations in standby letters of credit. The acquisition of a  participation in a commitment by a banking organization is converted at  50 percent and assigned to the risk category appropriate to the account  party obligor or, if relevant, the nature of the collateral or  guarantees.</p><p class="depth0">e. Revolving underwriting facilities (RUFs), note issuance  facilities (NIFs), and other similar arrangements also are converted at  50 percent regardless of maturity. These are facilities under which a  borrower can issue on a revolving basis short-term paper in its own  name, but for which the underwriting organizations have a legally  binding commitment either to purchase any notes the borrower is unable  to sell by the roll-over date or to advance funds to the borrower.</p><p class="depth0">3. Items with a 20 percent conversion factor. Short-term, self- liquidating trade-related contingencies which arise from the movement of  goods are converted at 20 percent.   Such contingencies generally include commercial letters of credit and  other documentary letters of credit collateralized by the underlying  shipments.</p><p class="depth0">4. Items with a 10 percent conversion factor. a. Unused portions of  eligible ABCP liquidity facilities with an original maturity of one year  or less also are converted at 10 percent.</p><p class="depth0">b. Banking organizations that are subject to the market risk rules  are required to convert the notional amount of eligible ABCP liquidity  facilities, in form or in substance, with an original maturity of one  year or less that are carried in the trading account at 10 percent to  determine the appropriate credit equivalent amount even though those  facilities are structured or characterized as derivatives or other  trading book assets. Liquidity facilities that support ABCP, in form or  in substance, (including those positions to which the market risk rules  may not be applied as set forth in section 2(a) of appendix E of this  part) that are not eligible ABCP liquidity facilities are to be  considered recourse obligations or direct credit substitutes and  assessed the appropriate risk-based capital requirement in accordance  with section III.B.3. of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">5. Items with a zero percent conversion factor. These include unused  portions of commitments (with the exception of eligible ABCP liquidity  facilities) with an original maturity of one year or less, or which are  unconditionally cancelable at any time, provided a separate credit  decision is made before each drawing under the facility. Unused portions  of lines of credit on retail credit cards and related plans are deemed  to be short-term commitments if the banking organization has the  unconditional right to cancel the line of credit at any time, in  accordance with applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">E. Derivative Contracts (Interest Rate, Exchange Rate, Commodity-  (including precious metals) and Equity-Linked Contracts)</p><p class="depth0">1. Scope. Credit equivalent amounts are computed for each of the  following off-balance-sheet derivative contracts:</p><p class="depth0">a. Interest Rate Contracts. These include single currency interest  rate swaps, basis swaps, forward rate agreements, interest rate options  purchased (including caps, collars, and floors purchased), and any other  instrument linked to interest rates that gives rise to similar credit  risks (including when-issued securities and forward forward deposits  accepted).</p><p class="depth0">b. Exchange Rate Contracts. These include cross-currency interest  rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts, currency options  purchased, and any other instrument linked to exchange rates that gives  rise to similar credit risks.</p><p class="depth0">c. Equity Derivative Contracts. These include equity-linked swaps,  equity-linked options purchased, forward equity-linked contracts, and  any other instrument linked to equities that gives rise to similar  credit risks.</p><p class="depth0">d. Commodity (including precious metal) Derivative Contracts. These  include commodity-linked swaps, commodity-linked options purchased,  forward commodity-linked contracts, and any other instrument linked to  commodities that gives rise to similar credit risks.</p><p class="depth0">e. Exceptions. Exchange rate contracts with an original maturity of  fourteen or fewer calendar days and derivative contracts traded on  exchanges that require daily receipt and payment of cash variation  margin may be excluded from the risk-based ratio calculation. Gold  contracts are accorded the same treatment as exchange rate contracts  except that gold contracts with an original maturity of fourteen or  fewer calendar days are included in the risk-based ratio calculation.  Over-the-counter options purchased are included and treated in the same  way as other derivative contracts.</p><p class="depth0">2. Calculation of credit equivalent amounts. a. The credit  equivalent amount of a derivative contract that is not subject to a  qualifying bilateral netting contract in accordance with section  III.E.3. of this appendix A is equal to the sum of (i) the current  exposure (sometimes referred to as the replacement cost) of the  contract; and (ii) an estimate of the potential future credit exposure  of the contract.</p><p class="depth0">b. The current exposure is determined by the mark-to-market value of  the contract. If the mark-to-market value is positive, then the current  exposure is equal to that mark-to-market value. If the mark-to-market  value is zero or negative, then the current exposure is zero. Mark-to- market values are measured in dollars, regardless of the currency or  currencies specified in the contract and should reflect changes in  underlying rates, prices, and indices, as well as counterparty credit  quality.</p><p class="depth0">c. The potential future credit exposure of a contract, including a  contract with a negative mark-to-market value, is estimated by  multiplying the notional principal amount of the contract by a credit  conversion factor. Banking organizations should use, subject to examiner  review, the effective rather than the apparent or stated notional amount  in this calculation. The credit conversion factors are:</p><p class="depth0">Conversion Factors</p><p class="depth0">[In percent] ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Commodity,</p><p class="depth0">Interest     Exchange                 excluding     Precious</p><p class="depth0">Remaining maturity                    rate       rate and      Equity      precious     metals,</p><p class="depth0">gold                     metals    except gold ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- One year or less...............................          0.0          1.0          6.0         10.0          7.0 Over one to five years.........................          0.5          5.0          8.0         12.0          7.0 Over five years................................          1.5          7.5         10.0         15.0          8.0 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">d. For a contract that is structured such that on specified dates  any outstanding exposure is settled and the terms are reset so that the  market value of the contract is zero, the remaining maturity is equal to  the time until the next reset date. For an interest rate contract with a  remaining maturity of more than one year that meets these criteria, the  minimum conversion factor is 0.5 percent.</p><p class="depth0">e. For a contract with multiple exchanges of principal, the  conversion factor is multiplied by the number of remaining payments in  the contract. A derivative contract not included in the definitions of  interest rate, exchange rate, equity, or commodity contracts as set  forth in section III.E.1. of this appendix A is subject to the same  conversion factors as a commodity, excluding precious metals.</p><p class="depth0">f. No potential future exposure is calculated for a single currency  interest rate swap in which payments are made based upon two floating  rate indices (a so called floating/floating or basis swap); the credit  exposure on such a contract is evaluated solely on the basis of the  mark-to-market value.</p><p class="depth0">g. The Board notes that the conversion factors set forth above,  which are based on observed volatilities of the particular types of  instruments, are subject to review and modification in light of changing  volatilities or market conditions.</p><p class="depth0">3. Netting. a. For purposes of this appendix A, netting refers to  the offsetting of positive and negative mark-to-market values when  determining a current exposure to be used in the calculation of a credit  equivalent amount. Any legally enforceable form of bilateral netting  (that is, netting with a single counterparty) of derivative contracts is  recognized for purposes of calculating the credit equivalent amount  provided that:</p><p class="depth0">i. The netting is accomplished under a written netting contract that  creates a single legal obligation, covering all included individual  contracts, with the effect that the banking organization would have a  claim to receive, or obligation to pay, only the net amount of the sum  of the positive and negative mark-to-market values on included  individual contracts in the event that a counterparty, or a counterparty  to whom the contract has been validly assigned, fails to perform due to  any of the following events: default, insolvency, liquidation, or  similar circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The banking organization obtains a written and reasoned legal  opinion(s) representing that in the event of a legal challenge-- including one resulting from default, insolvency, liquidation, or  similar circumstances--the relevant court and administrative authorities  would find the banking organization's exposure to be the net amount  under:</p><p class="depth0">1. The law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is  chartered or the equivalent location in the case of noncorporate  entities, and if a branch of the counterparty is involved, then also  under the law of the jurisdiction in which the branch is located;</p><p class="depth0">2. The law that governs the individual contracts covered by the  netting contract; and</p><p class="depth0">3. The law that governs the netting contract.</p><p class="depth0">iii. The banking organization establishes and maintains procedures  to ensure that the legal characteristics of netting contracts are kept  under review in the light of possible changes in relevant law.</p><p class="depth0">iv. The banking organization maintains in its files documentation  adequate to support the netting of derivative contracts, including a  copy of the bilateral netting contract and necessary legal opinions.</p><p class="depth0">b. A contract containing a walkaway clause is not eligible for  netting for purposes of calculating the credit equivalent amount. \61\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\61\ A walkaway clause is a provision in a netting contract that  permits a non-defaulting counterparty to make lower payments than it  would make otherwise under the contract, or no payment at all, to a  defaulter or to the estate of a defaulter, even if the defaulter or the  estate of the defaulter is a net creditor under the contract. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">c. A banking organization netting individual contracts for the  purpose of calculating credit equivalent amounts of derivative contracts  represents that it has met the requirements of this appendix A and all  the appropriate documents are in the banking   organization's files and available for inspection by the Federal  Reserve. The Federal Reserve may determine that a banking organization's  files are inadequate or that a netting contract, or any of its  underlying individual contracts, may not be legally enforceable under  any one of the bodies of law described in section III.E.3.a.ii. of this  appendix A. If such a determination is made, the netting contract may be  disqualified from recognition for risk-based capital purposes or  underlying individual contracts may be treated as though they are not  subject to the netting contract.</p><p class="depth0">d. The credit equivalent amount of contracts that are subject to a  qualifying bilateral netting contract is calculated by adding (i) the  current exposure of the netting contract (net current exposure) and (ii)  the sum of the estimates of potential future credit exposures on all  individual contracts subject to the netting contract (gross potential  future exposure) adjusted to reflect the effects of the netting  contract. \62\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\62\ For purposes of calculating potential future credit exposure to  a netting counterparty for foreign exchange contracts and other similar  contracts in which notional principal is equivalent to cash flows, total  notional principal is defined as the net receipts falling due on each  value date in each currency. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">e. The net current exposure is the sum of all positive and negative  mark-to-market values of the individual contracts included in the  netting contract. If the net sum of the mark-to-market values is  positive, then the net current exposure is equal to that sum. If the net  sum of the mark-to-market values is zero or negative, then the net  current exposure is zero. The Federal Reserve may determine that a  netting contract qualifies for risk-based capital netting treatment even  though certain individual contracts included under the netting contract  may not qualify. In such instances, the nonqualifying contracts should  be treated as individual contracts that are not subject to the netting  contract.</p><p class="depth0">f. Gross potential future exposure, or Agross is  calculated by summing the estimates of potential future exposure  (determined in accordance with section III.E.2 of this appendix A) for  each individual contract subject to the qualifying bilateral netting  contract.</p><p class="depth0">g. The effects of the bilateral netting contract on the gross  potential future exposure are recognized through the application of a  formula that results in an adjusted add-on amount (Anet). The  formula, which employs the ratio of net current exposure to gross  current exposure (NGR), is expressed as:  Anet = (0.4 x Agross) + 0.6(NGR x</p><p class="depth0">Agross)</p><p class="depth0">h. The NGR may be calculated in accordance with either the  counterparty-by-counterparty approach or the aggregate approach.</p><p class="depth0">i. Under the counterparty-by-counterparty approach, the NGR is the  ratio of the net current exposure for a netting contract to the gross  current exposure of the netting contract. The gross current exposure is  the sum of the current exposures of all individual contracts subject to  the netting contract calculated in accordance with section III.E.2. of  this appendix A. Net negative mark-to-market values for individual  netting contracts with the same counterparty may not be used to offset  net positive mark-to-market values for other netting contracts with the  same counterparty.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Under the aggregate approach, the NGR is the ratio of the sum of  all of the net current exposures for qualifying bilateral netting  contracts to the sum of all of the gross current exposures for those  netting contracts (each gross current exposure is calculated in the same  manner as in section III.E.3.h.i. of this appendix A). Net negative  mark-to-market values for individual counterparties may not be used to  offset net positive current exposures for other counterparties.</p><p class="depth0">iii. A banking organization must use consistently either the  counterparty-by-counterparty approach or the aggregate approach to  calculate the NGR. Regardless of the approach used, the NGR should be  applied individually to each qualifying bilateral netting contract to  determine the adjusted add-on for that netting contract.</p><p class="depth0">i. In the event a netting contract covers contracts that are  normally excluded from the risk-based ratio calculation--for example,  exchange rate contracts with an original maturity of fourteen or fewer  calendar days or instruments traded on exchanges that require daily  payment and receipt of cash variation margin--an institution may elect  to either include or exclude all mark-to-market values of such contracts  when determining net current exposure, provided the method chosen is  applied consistently.</p><p class="depth0">4. Risk Weights. Once the credit equivalent amount for a derivative  contract, or a group of derivative contracts subject to a qualifying  bilateral netting contract, has been determined, that amount is assigned  to the risk category appropriate to the counterparty, or, if relevant,  the guarantor or the nature of any collateral. \63\ However,   the maximum risk weight applicable to the credit equivalent amount of  such contracts is 50 percent. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\63\ For derivative contracts, sufficiency of collateral or  guarantees is generally determined by the market value of the collateral  or the amount of the guarantee in relation to the credit equivalent  amount. Collateral and guarantees are subject to the same provisions  noted under section III.B. of this appendix A. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">5. Avoidance of double counting. a. In certain cases, credit  exposures arising from the derivative contracts covered by section  III.E. of this appendix A may already be reflected, in part, on the  balance sheet. To avoid double counting such exposures in the assessment  of capital adequacy and, perhaps, assigning inappropriate risk weights,  counterparty credit exposures arising from the derivative instruments  covered by these guidelines may need to be excluded from balance sheet  assets in calculating a banking organization's risk-based capital  ratios.</p><p class="depth0">b. Examples of the calculation of credit equivalent amounts for  contracts covered under this section III.E. are contained in Attachment  V of this appendix A.</p><p class="depth0">IV. Minimum Supervisory Ratios and Standards</p><p class="depth0">The interim and final supervisory standards set forth below specify  minimum supervisory ratios based primarily on broad credit risk  considerations. As noted above, the risk-based ratio does not take  explicit account of the quality of individual asset portfolios or the  range of other types of risks to which banking organizations may be  exposed, such as interest rate, liquidity, market or operational risks.  For this reason, banking organizations are generally expected to operate  with capital positions well above the minimum ratios.</p><p class="depth0">Institutions with high or inordinate levels of risk are expected to  operate well above minimum capital standards. Banking organizations  experiencing or anticipating significant growth are also expected to  maintain capital, including tangible capital positions, well above the  minimum levels. For example, most such organizations generally have  operated at capital levels ranging from 100 to 200 basis points above  the stated minimums. Higher capital ratios could be required if  warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual  banking organizations. In all cases, organizations should hold capital  commensurate with the level and nature of all of the risks, including  the volume and severity of problem loans, to which they are exposed.</p><p class="depth0">Upon adoption of the risk-based framework, any organization that  does not meet the interim or final supervisory ratios, or whose capital  is otherwise considered inadequate, is expected to develop and implement  a plan acceptable to the Federal Reserve for achieving an adequate level  of capital consistent with the provisions of these guidelines or with  the special circumstances affecting the individual organization. In  addition, such organizations should avoid any actions, including  increased risk-taking or unwarranted expansion, that would lower or  further erode their capital positions.</p><p class="depth0">A. Minimum Risk-Based Ratio After Transition Period</p><p class="depth0">As reflected in Attachment VI, by year-end 1992, all bank holding  companies \64\ should meet a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital  to weighted risk assets of 8 percent, of which at least 4.0 percentage  points should be in the form of Tier 1 capital. For purposes of section  IV.A., Tier 1 capital is defined as the sum of core capital elements  less goodwill and other intangible assets required to be deducted in  accordance with section II.B.1.b. of this appendix. The maximum amount  of supplementary capital elements that qualifies as Tier 2 capital is  limited to 100 percent of Tier 1 capital. In addition, the combined  maximum amount of subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred  stock that qualifies as Tier 2 capital is limited to 50 percent of Tier  1 capital. The maximum amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses  that qualifies as Tier 2 capital is limited to 1.25 percent of gross  weighted risk assets. Allowances for loan and lease losses in excess of  this limit may, of course, be maintained, but would not be included in  an organization's total capital. The Federal Reserve will continue to  require bank holding companies to maintain reserves at levels fully  sufficient to cover losses inherent in their loan portfolios. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\64\ As noted in section I, bank holding companies with less than  $500 million in consolidated assets would generally be exempt from the  calculation and analysis of risk-based ratios on a consolidated holding  company basis, subject to certain terms and conditions. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Qualifying total capital is calculated by adding Tier 1 capital and  Tier 2 capital (limited to 100 percent of Tier 1 capital) and then  deducting from this sum certain investments in banking or finance  subsidiaries that are not consolidated for accounting or supervisory  purposes, reciprocal holdings of banking organizations' capital  securities, or other items at the direction of the Federal Reserve. The  conditions under which these deductions are to be made and the  procedures for making the deductions are discussed above in section  II(B).</p><p class="depth0">B. Transition Arrangements</p><p class="depth0">The transition period for implementing the risk-based capital  standard ends on December 31, 1992. Initially, the risk-based capital  guidelines do not establish a minimum level   of capital. However, by year-end 1990, banking organizations are  expected to meet a minimum interim target ratio for qualifying total  capital to weighted risk assets of 7.25 percent, at least one-half of  which should be in the form of Tier 1 capital. For purposes of meeting  the 1990 interim target, the amount of loan loss reserves that may be  included in capital is limited to 1.5 percent of weighted risk assets  and up to 10 percent of an organization's Tier 1 capital may consist of  supplementary capital elements. Thus, the 7.25 percent interim target  ratio implies a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to weighted risk assets  of 3.6 percent (one-half of 7.25) and a minimum ratio of core capital  elements to weighted risk assets ratio of 3.25 percent (nine-tenths of  the Tier 1 capital ratio).</p><p class="depth0">Through year-end 1990, banking organizations have the option of  complying with the minimum 7.25 percent year-end 1990 risk-based capital  standard, in lieu of the minimum 5.5 percent primary and 6 percent total  capital to total assets ratios set forth in appendix B of this part. In  addition, as more fully set forth in appendix D to this part, banking  organizations are expected to maintain a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital  to total assets during this transition period.</p><p class="depth0">Attachment I--Sample Calculation of Risk-Based Capital Ratio for Bank</p><p class="depth0">Holding Companies Example of a banking organization with $6,000 in total capital and the</p><p class="depth0">following assets and off-balance sheet items: Balance Sheet Assets:</p><p class="depth0">Cash...................................................       $5,000</p><p class="depth0">U.S. Treasuries........................................       20,000</p><p class="depth0">Balances at domestic banks.............................        5,000</p><p class="depth0">Loans secured by first liens on 1-4 family residential         5,000</p><p class="depth0">properties............................................</p><p class="depth0">Loans to private corporations..........................       65,000</p><p class="depth0">------------</p><p class="depth0">Total Balance Sheet Assets...........................     $100,000</p><p class="depth0">============ Off-Balance Sheet Items:</p><p class="depth0">Standby letters of credit (``SLCs'') backing general         $10,000</p><p class="depth0">obligation debt issues of U.S. municipalities</p><p class="depth0"><em>(``GOs'')</em>.............................................</p><p class="depth0">Long-term legally binding commitments to private              20,000</p><p class="depth0">corporations..........................................</p><p class="depth0">------------</p><p class="depth0">Total Off/Balance Sheet Items........................      $30,000 This bank holding company's total capital to total assets (leverage)</p><p class="depth0">ratio would be: ($6,000/$100,000)=6.00%.

Appendix B to Part 225 [Reserved]    Sec. Appendix C to Part 225--Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement</p><p class="depth0">Policy Statement on Assessment of Financial and Managerial Factors</p><p class="depth0">In acting on applications filed under the Bank Holding Company Act,  the Board has adopted, and continues to follow, the principle that bank  holding companies should serve as a source of strength for their  subsidiary banks. When bank holding companies incur debt and rely upon  the earnings of their subsidiary banks as the means of repaying such  debt, a question arises as to the probable effect upon the financial  condition of the holding company and its subsidiary bank or banks.</p><p class="depth0">The Board believes that a high level of debt at the parent holding  company impairs the ability of a bank holding company to provide  financial assistance to its subsidiary bank(s) and, in some cases, the  servicing requirements on such debt may be a significant drain on the  resources of the bank(s). For these reasons, the Board has not favored  the use of acquisition debt in the formation of bank holding companies  or in the acquisition of additional banks. Nevertheless, the Board has  recognized that the transfer of ownership of small banks often requires  the use of acquisition debt. The Board, therefore, has permitted the  formation and expansion of small bank holding companies with debt levels  higher than would be permitted for larger holding companies. Approval of  these applications has been given on the condition that small bank  holding companies demonstrate the ability to service acquisition debt  without straining the capital of their subsidiary banks and, further,  that such companies restore their ability to serve as a source of  strength for their subsidiary banks within a relatively short period of  time.</p><p class="depth0">In the interest of continuing its policy of facilitating the  transfer of ownership in banks without compromising bank safety and  soundness, the Board has, as described below, adopted the following  procedures and standards for the formation and expansion of small bank  holding companies subject to this policy statement.</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicability of Policy Statement</p><p class="depth0">This policy statement applies only to bank holding companies with  pro forma consolidated assets of less than $500 million that (i) are not  engaged in significant nonbanking activities either directly or through  a nonbank subsidiary; (ii) do not conduct significant off-balance sheet  activities (including securitization and asset management or  administration) either directly or through a nonbank subsidiary; and  (iii) do not have a material amount of debt or equity securities  outstanding (other than trust preferred securities) that are registered  with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Board may in its  discretion exclude any bank holding company, regardless of asset size,  from the policy statement if such action is warranted for supervisory  purposes. \1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ [Reserved] ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">While this policy statement primarily applies to the formation of  small bank holding companies, it also applies to existing small bank  holding companies that wish to acquire an additional bank or company and  to transactions involving changes in control, stock redemptions, or  other shareholder transactions. \2\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ The appropriate Reserve Bank should be contacted to determine  the manner in which a specific situation may qualify for treatment under  this policy statement. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">2. Ongoing Requirements</p><p class="depth0">The following guidelines must be followed on an ongoing basis for  all organizations operating under this policy statement.</p><p class="depth0">A. Reduction in parent company leverage: Small bank holding  companies are to reduce their parent company debt consistent with the  requirement that all debt be retired within 25 years of being incurred.  The Board also expects that these bank holding companies reach a debt to  equity ratio of .30:1 or less within 12 years of the incurrence of the  debt. \3\ The bank holding company must also   comply with debt servicing and other requirements imposed by its  creditors. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\3\ The term debt, as used in the ratio of debt to equity, means any  borrowed funds (exclusive of short-term borrowings that arise out of  current transactions, the proceeds of which are used for current  transactions), and any securities issued by, or obligations of, the  holding company that are the functional equivalent of borrowed funds.</p><p class="depth0">Subordinated debt associated with trust preferred securities  generally would be treated as debt for purposes of paragraphs 2.C.,  3.A., 4.A.i., and 4.B.i. of this policy statement. A bank holding  company, however, may exclude from debt an amount of subordinated debt  associated with trust preferred securities up to 25 percent of the  holding company's equity (as defined below) less goodwill on the parent  company's balance sheet in determining compliance with the requirements  of such paragraphs of the policy statement. In addition, a bank holding  company subject to this policy statement that has not issued  subordinated debt associated with a new issuance of trust preferred  securities after December 31, 2005, may exclude from debt any  subordinated debt associated with trust preferred securities until  December 31, 2010. Bank holding companies subject to this policy  statement also may exclude from debt until December 31, 2010, any  subordinated debt associated with refinanced issuances of trust  preferred securities originally issued on or prior to December 31, 2005,  provided that the refinancing does not increase the bank holding  company's outstanding amount of subordinated debt. Subordinated debt  associated with trust preferred securities will not be included as debt  in determining compliance with any other requirements of this policy  statement.</p><p class="depth0">In addition, notwithstanding any other provision of this policy  statement and for purposes of compliance with paragraphs 2.C., 3.A.,  4.A.i, and 4.B.i. of this policy statement, both a bank holding company  that is organized in mutual form and a bank holding company that has  made a valid election to be taxed under Subchapter S of Chapter 1 of the  U.S. Internal Revenue Code may exclude from debt subordinated debentures  issued to the United States Department of the Treasury under (i) the  Troubled Asset Relief Program established by the Emergency Economic  Stabilization Act of 2008, Division A of Public Law 110-343, 122 Stat.  3765 (2008), and (ii) the Small Business Lending Fund established by the  Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, title IV of Public Law 111-240, 124  Stat. 2504 (2010).</p><p class="depth0">The term equity, as used in the ratio of debt to equity, means the  total stockholders' equity of the bank holding company as defined in  accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In determining  the total amount of stockholders' equity, the bank holding company  should account for its investments in the common stock of subsidiaries  by the equity method of accounting.</p><p class="depth0">Ordinarily the Board does not view redeemable preferred stock as a  substitute for common stock in a small bank holding company.  Nevertheless, to a limited degree and under certain circumstances, the  Board will consider redeemable preferred stock as equity in the capital  accounts of the holding company if the following conditions are met: (1)  The preferred stock is redeemable only at the option of the issuer; and  (2) the debt to equity ratio of the holding company would be at or  remain below .30:1 following the redemption or retirement of any  preferred stock. Preferred stock that is convertible into common stock  of the holding company may be treated as equity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">B. Capital adequacy: Each insured depository subsidiary of a small  bank holding company is expected to be well-capitalized. Any institution  that is not well-capitalized is expected to become well-capitalized  within a brief period of time.</p><p class="depth0">C. Dividend restrictions: A small bank holding company whose debt to  equity ratio is greater than 1.0:1 is not expected to pay corporate  dividends until such time as it reduces its debt to equity ratio to  1.0:1 or less and otherwise meets the criteria set forth in  Secs. 225.14(c)(1)(ii), 225.14(c)(2), and 225.14(c)(7) of Regulation Y.  \4\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\4\ Dividends may be paid by small bank holding companies with debt  to equity at or below 1.0:1 and otherwise meeting the requirements of  Secs. 225.14(c)(1)(ii), 225.14(c)(2), and 225.14(c)(7) if the dividends  are reasonable in amount, do not adversely affect the ability of the  bank holding company to service its debt in an orderly manner, and do  not adversely affect the ability of the subsidiary banks to be well- capitalized. It is expected that dividends will be eliminated if the  holding company is (1) not reducing its debt consistent with the  requirement that the debt to equity ratio be reduced to .30:1 within 12  years of consummation of the proposal or (2) not meeting the  requirements of its loan agreement(s). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Small bank holding companies formed before the effective date of  this policy statement may switch to a plan that adheres to the intent of  this statement provided they comply with the requirements set forth  above.</p><p class="depth0">3. Core Requirements for All Applicants</p><p class="depth0">In assessing applications or notices by organizations subject to  this policy statement, the Board will continue to take into account a  full range of financial and other information about the applicant, and  its current and proposed subsidiaries, including the recent trend and  stability of earnings, past and prospective growth, asset quality, the  ability to meet debt servicing requirements without placing an undue  strain on the resources of the bank(s), and the record and competency of  management. In addition, the Board will require applicants to meet the  following requirements:</p><p class="depth0">A. Minimum down payment: The amount of acquisition debt should not  exceed 75 percent of the purchase price of the bank(s) or company to be  acquired. When the owner(s) of the holding company incurs debt to  finance the purchase of the bank(s) or company, such debt will be  considered acquisition debt even though it does not represent an  obligation of the bank holding company, unless the owner(s) can  demonstrate that such debt can be serviced without reliance on the  resources of the bank(s) or bank holding company.</p><p class="depth0">B. Ability to reduce parent company leverage: The bank holding  company must clearly be able to reduce its debt to equity ratio and  comply with its loan agreement(s) as set forth in paragraph 2A above.</p><p class="depth0">Failure to meet the criteria in this section would normally result  in denial of an application.</p><p class="depth0">4. Additional Application Requirements for Expedited/Waived Processing</p><p class="depth0">A. Expedited notices under Secs. 225.14 and 225.23 of Regulation Y:  A small bank holding company proposal will be eligible for the expedited  processing procedures set forth in Secs. 225.14 and 225.23 of Regulation  Y if the bank holding company is in compliance with the ongoing  requirements of this policy statement, the bank holding company meets  the core requirements for all applicants noted above, and the following  requirements are met:</p><p class="depth0">i. The parent bank holding company has a pro forma debt to equity  ratio of 1.0:1 or less.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The bank holding company meets all of the criteria for expedited  action set forth in Secs. 225.14 or 225.23 of Regulation Y.</p><p class="depth0">B. Waiver of stock redemption filing: A small bank holding company  will be eligible for the stock redemption filing exception for well- capitalized bank holding companies contained in Sec. 225.4(b)(6) if the  following requirements are met:</p><p class="depth0">i. The parent bank holding company has a pro forma debt to equity  ratio of 1.0:1 or less.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The bank holding company is in compliance with the ongoing  requirements of this policy statement and meets the requirements of  Secs. 225.14(c)(1)(ii), 225.14(c)(2), and 225.14(c)(7) of Regulation Y.

Introduction</p><p class="depth0">These Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security  Standards (Guidelines) set forth standards pursuant to sections 501 and  505 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (15 U.S.C. 6801 and 6805). These  Guidelines address standards for developing and implementing  administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the  security, confidentiality, and integrity of customer information.</p><p class="depth0">A. Scope. The Guidelines apply to customer information maintained by  or on behalf of bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries or  affiliates (except brokers, dealers, persons providing insurance,  investment companies, and investment advisors), for which the Board has  supervisory authority.</p><p class="depth0">B. Preservation of Existing Authority. These Guidelines do not in  any way limit the authority of the Board to address unsafe or unsound  practices, violations of law, unsafe or unsound conditions, or other  practices. The Board may take action under these Guidelines  independently of, in conjunction with, or in addition to, any other  enforcement action available to the Board.</p><p class="depth0">C. Definitions. 1. Except as modified in the Guidelines, or unless  the context otherwise requires, the terms used in these Guidelines have  the same meanings as set forth in sections 3 and 39 of the Federal  Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813 and 1831p-1).</p><p class="depth0">2. For purposes of the Guidelines, the following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth0">a. Board of directors, in the case of a branch or agency of a  foreign bank, means the managing official in charge of the branch or  agency.</p><p class="depth0">b. Customer means any customer of the bank holding company as  defined in Sec. 1016.3(i) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">c. Customer information means any record containing nonpublic  personal information, as defined in Sec. 1016.3(p) of this chapter,  about a customer, whether in paper, electronic, or other form, that is  maintained by or on behalf of the bank holding company.</p><p class="depth0">d. Customer information systems means any methods used to access,  collect, store, use, transmit, protect, or dispose of customer  information.</p><p class="depth0">e. Service provider means any person or entity that maintains,  processes, or otherwise is permitted access to customer information  through its provision of services directly to the bank holding company.</p><p class="depth0">f. Subsidiary means any company controlled by a bank holding  company, except a broker, dealer, person providing insurance, investment  company, investment advisor, insured depository institution, or  subsidiary of an insured depository institution.</p><p class="depth0">II. Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information</p><p class="depth0">A. Information Security Program. Each bank holding company shall  implement a comprehensive written information security program that  includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate  to the size and complexity of the bank holding company and the nature  and scope of its activities. While all parts of the bank holding company  are not required to implement a uniform set of policies, all elements of  the information security program must be coordinated. A bank holding  company also shall ensure that each of its subsidiaries is subject to a  comprehensive information security program. The bank holding company may  fulfill this requirement either by including a subsidiary within the  scope of the bank holding company's comprehensive information security  program or by causing the subsidiary to implement a separate  comprehensive information security program in accordance with the  standards and procedures in sections II and III of this appendix that  apply to bank holding companies.</p><p class="depth0">B. Objectives. A bank holding company's information security program  shall be designed to:</p><p class="depth0">1. Ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information;</p><p class="depth0">2. Protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the  security or integrity of such information; and</p><p class="depth0">3. Protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information  that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.</p><p class="depth0">III. Development and Implementation of Information Security Program</p><p class="depth0">A. Involve the Board of Directors. The board of directors or an  appropriate committee of the board of each bank holding company shall:</p><p class="depth0">1. Approve the bank holding company's written information security  program; and</p><p class="depth0">2. Oversee the development, implementation, and maintenance of the  bank holding company's information security program, including assigning  specific responsibility for its implementation and reviewing reports  from management.</p><p class="depth0">B. Assess Risk. Each bank holding company shall:</p><p class="depth0">1. Identify reasonably foreseeable internal and external threats  that could result in unauthorized disclosure, misuse, alteration, or  destruction of customer information or customer information systems.</p><p class="depth0">2. Assess the likelihood and potential damage of these threats,  taking into consideration the sensitivity of customer information.</p><p class="depth0">3. Assess the sufficiency of policies, procedures, customer  information systems, and other arrangements in place to control risks.</p><p class="depth0">C. Manage and Control Risk. Each bank holding company shall:</p><p class="depth0">1. Design its information security program to control the identified  risks, commensurate with the sensitivity of the information as well as  the complexity and scope of the bank holding company's activities. Each  bank holding company must consider whether the following security  measures are appropriate for the bank holding company and, if so, adopt  those measures the bank holding company concludes are appropriate:</p><p class="depth0">a. Access controls on customer information systems, including  controls to authenticate and permit access only to authorized  individuals and controls to prevent employees from providing customer  information to unauthorized individuals who may seek to obtain this  information through fraudulent means.</p><p class="depth0">b. Access restrictions at physical locations containing customer  information, such as buildings, computer facilities, and records storage  facilities to permit access only to authorized individuals;</p><p class="depth0">c. Encryption of electronic customer information, including while in  transit or in storage on networks or systems to which unauthorized  individuals may have access;</p><p class="depth0">d. Procedures designed to ensure that customer information system  modifications are consistent with the bank holding company's information  security program;</p><p class="depth0">e. Dual control procedures, segregation of duties, and employee  background checks for employees with responsibilities for or access to  customer information;</p><p class="depth0">f. Monitoring systems and procedures to detect actual and attempted  attacks on or intrusions into customer information systems;</p><p class="depth0">g. Response programs that specify actions to be taken when the bank  holding company suspects or detects that unauthorized individuals have  gained access to customer information systems, including appropriate  reports to regulatory and law enforcement agencies; and</p><p class="depth0">h. Measures to protect against destruction, loss, or damage of  customer information due to potential environmental hazards, such as  fire and water damage or technological failures.</p><p class="depth0">2. Train staff to implement the bank holding company's information  security program.</p><p class="depth0">3. Regularly test the key controls, systems and procedures of the  information security program. The frequency and nature of such tests  should be determined by the bank holding company's risk assessment.  Tests should be conducted or reviewed by independent third parties or  staff independent of those   that develop or maintain the security programs.</p><p class="depth0">D. Oversee Service Provider Arrangements. Each bank holding company  shall:</p><p class="depth0">1. Exercise appropriate due diligence in selecting its service  providers;</p><p class="depth0">2. Require its service providers by contract to implement  appropriate measures designed to meet the objectives of these  Guidelines; and</p><p class="depth0">3. Where indicated by the bank holding company's risk assessment,  monitor its service providers to confirm that they have satisfied their  obligations as required by paragraph D.2. As part of this monitoring, a  bank holding company should review audits, summaries of test results, or  other equivalent evaluations of its service providers.</p><p class="depth0">E. Adjust the Program. Each bank holding company shall monitor,  evaluate, and adjust, as appropriate, the information security program  in light of any relevant changes in technology, the sensitivity of its  customer information, internal or external threats to information, and  the bank holding company's own changing business arrangements, such as  mergers and acquisitions, alliances and joint ventures, outsourcing  arrangements, and changes to customer information systems.</p><p class="depth0">F. Report to the Board. Each bank holding company shall report to  its board or an appropriate committee of the board at least annually.  This report should describe the overall status of the information  security program and the bank holding company's compliance with these  Guidelines. The reports should discuss material matters related to its  program, addressing issues such as: risk assessment; risk management and  control decisions; service provider arrangements; results of testing;  security breaches or violations and management's responses; and  recommendations for changes in the information security program.</p><p class="depth0">G. Implement the Standards.</p><p class="depth0">1. Effective date. Each bank holding company must implement an  information security program pursuant to these Guidelines by July 1,  2001.</p><p class="depth0">2. Two-year grandfathering of agreements with service providers.  Until July 1, 2003, a contract that a bank holding company has entered  into with a service provider to perform services for it or functions on  its behalf satisfies the provisions of section III.D., even if the  contract does not include a requirement that the servicer maintain the  security and confidentiality of customer information, as long as the  bank holding company entered into the contract on or before March 5,  2001.  Supplement A to Appendix F to Part 225--Interagency Guidance on Response</p><p class="depth0">Programs for Unauthorized Access to Customer Information and Customer</p><p class="depth0">Notice</p><p class="depth0">I. Background</p><p class="depth0">This Guidance \1\ interprets section 501(b) of the Gramm-Leach- Bliley Act (``GLBA'') and the Interagency Guidelines Establishing  Information Security Standards (the ``Security Guidelines'') \2\ and  describes response programs, including customer notification procedures,  that a financial institution should develop and implement to address  unauthorized access to or use of customer information that could result  in substantial harm or inconvenience to a customer. The scope of, and  definitions of terms used in, this Guidance are identical to those of  the Security Guidelines. For example, the term ``customer information''  is the same term used in the Security Guidelines, and means any record  containing nonpublic personal information about a customer, whether in  paper, electronic, or other form, maintained by or on behalf of the  institution. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ This Guidance is being jointly issued by the Board of Governors  of the Federal Reserve System (Board), the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC),  and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS).</p><p class="depth0">\2\ 12 CFR part 30, app. B (OCC); 12 CFR part 208, app. D-2 and part  225, app. F (Board); 12 CFR part 364, app. B (FDIC); and 12 CFR part  570, app. B (OTS). The ``Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information  Security Standards'' were formerly known as ``The Interagency Guidelines  Establishing Information Security Standards.'' ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">A. Interagency Security Guidelines</p><p class="depth0">Section 501(b) of the GLBA required the Agencies to establish  appropriate standards for financial institutions subject to their  jurisdiction that include administrative, technical, and physical  safeguards, to protect the security and confidentiality of customer  information. Accordingly, the Agencies issued Security Guidelines  requiring every financial institution to have an information security  program designed to:</p><p class="depth0">1. Ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information;</p><p class="depth0">2. Protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the  security or integrity of such information; and</p><p class="depth0">3. Protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information  that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.</p><p class="depth0">B. Risk Assessment and Controls</p><p class="depth0">1. The Security Guidelines direct every financial institution to  assess the following risks, among others, when developing its  information security program:</p><p class="depth0">a. Reasonably foreseeable internal and external threats that could  result in unauthorized disclosure, misuse, alteration, or destruction of  customer information or customer information systems;</p><p class="depth0">b. The likelihood and potential damage of threats, taking into  consideration the sensitivity of customer information; and</p><p class="depth0">c. The sufficiency of policies, procedures, customer information  systems, and other arrangements in place to control risks. \3\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\3\ See Security Guidelines, III.B. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">2. Following the assessment of these risks, the Security Guidelines  require a financial institution to design a program to address the  identified risks. The particular security measures an institution should  adopt will depend upon the risks presented by the complexity and scope  of its business. At a minimum, the financial institution is required to  consider the specific security measures enumerated in the Security  Guidelines, \4\ and adopt those that are appropriate for the  institution, including: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\4\ See Security Guidelines, III.C. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">a. Access controls on customer information systems, including  controls to authenticate and permit access only to authorized  individuals and controls to prevent employees from providing customer  information to unauthorized individuals who may seek to obtain this  information through fraudulent means;</p><p class="depth0">b. Background checks for employees with responsibilities for access  to customer information; and</p><p class="depth0">c. Response programs that specify actions to be taken when the  financial institution suspects or detects that unauthorized individuals  have gained access to customer information systems, including  appropriate reports to regulatory and law enforcement agencies. \5\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\5\ See Security Guidelines, III.C. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">C. Service Providers</p><p class="depth0">The Security Guidelines direct every financial institution to  require its service providers by contract to implement appropriate  measures designed to protect against unauthorized access to or use of  customer information that could result in substantial harm or  inconvenience to any customer. \6\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\6\ See Security Guidelines, II.B. and III.D. Further, the Agencies  note that, in addition to contractual obligations to a financial  institution, a service provider may be required to implement its own  comprehensive information security program in accordance with the  Safeguards Rule promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission (``FTC''),  16 CFR part 314. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">II. Response Program</p><p class="depth0">Millions of Americans, throughout the country, have been victims of  identity theft. \7\ Identity thieves misuse personal information they  obtain from a number of sources, including financial institutions, to  perpetrate identity theft. Therefore, financial institutions should take  preventative measures to safeguard customer information against attempts  to gain unauthorized access to the information. For example, financial  institutions should place access controls on customer information  systems and conduct background checks for employees who are authorized  to access customer information. \8\ However, every financial institution  should also develop and implement a risk-based response program to  address incidents of unauthorized access to customer information in  customer information systems \9\ that occur nonetheless. A response  program should be a key part of an institution's information security  program. \10\ The program should be appropriate to the size and  complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its  activities. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\7\ The FTC estimates that nearly 10 million Americans discovered  they were victims of some form of identity theft in 2002. See The  Federal Trade Commission, Identity Theft Survey Report, (September  2003), available at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2003/09/synovatereport.pdf.</p><p class="depth0">\8\ Institutions should also conduct background checks of employees  to ensure that the institution does not violate 12 U.S.C. 1829, which  prohibits an institution from hiring an individual convicted of certain  criminal offenses or who is subject to a prohibition order under 12  U.S.C. 1818(e)(6).</p><p class="depth0">\9\ Under the Guidelines, an institution's customer information  systems consist of all of the methods used to access, collect, store,  use, transmit, protect, or dispose of customer information, including  the systems maintained by its service providers.

Therefore, consistent with the  obligations in the Guidelines that relate to these arrangements, and  with existing guidance on this topic issued by the Agencies, \11\ an  institution's contract with its service provider should require the  service provider to take appropriate actions to address incidents of  unauthorized access to the financial institution's customer information,  including notification to the institution as soon as possible of any  such incident, to enable the institution to expeditiously implement its  response program. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\11\ See Federal Reserve SR Ltr. 00-04, Outsourcing of Information  and Transaction Processing, Feb. 9, 2000; OCC Bulletin 2001-47, ``Third- Party Relationships Risk Management Principles,'' Nov. 1, 2001; FDIC FIL  68-99, Risk Assessment Tools and Practices for Information System  Security, July 7, 1999; OTS Thrift Bulletin 82a, Third Party  Arrangements, Sept. 1, 2004. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">A. Components of a Response Program</p><p class="depth0">1. At a minimum, an institution's response program should contain  procedures for the following:</p><p class="depth0">a. Assessing the nature and scope of an incident, and identifying  what customer information systems and types of customer information have  been accessed or misused;</p><p class="depth0">b. Notifying its primary Federal regulator as soon as possible when  the institution becomes aware of an incident involving unauthorized  access to or use of sensitive customer information, as defined below;</p><p class="depth0">c. Consistent with the Agencies' Suspicious Activity Report  (``SAR'') regulations, \12\ notifying appropriate law enforcement  authorities, in addition to filing a timely SAR in situations involving  Federal criminal violations requiring immediate attention, such as when  a reportable violation is ongoing; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\12\ An institution's obligation to file a SAR is set out in the  Agencies' SAR regulations and Agency guidance. See 12 CFR 21.11  (national banks, Federal branches and agencies); 12 CFR 208.62 (State  member banks); 12 CFR 211.5(k) (Edge and agreement corporations); 12 CFR  211.24(f) (uninsured State branches and agencies of foreign banks); 12  CFR 225.4(f) (bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries); 12  CFR part 353 (State non-member banks); and 12 CFR 563.180 (savings  associations). National banks must file SARs in connection with computer  intrusions and other computer crimes. See OCC Bulletin 2000-14,  ``Infrastructure Threats--Intrusion Risks'' (May 15, 2000); Advisory  Letter 97-9, ``Reporting Computer Related Crimes'' (November 19, 1997)  (general guidance still applicable though instructions for new SAR form  published in 65 FR 1229, 1230 (January 7, 2000)).

Notifying customers when warranted.</p><p class="depth0">2. Where an incident of unauthorized access to customer information  involves customer information systems maintained by an institution's  service providers, it is the responsibility of the financial institution  to notify the institution's customers and regulator. However, an  institution may authorize or contract with its service provider to  notify the institution's customers or regulator on its behalf.</p><p class="depth0">III. Customer Notice</p><p class="depth0">Financial institutions have an affirmative duty to protect their  customers' information against unauthorized access or use. Notifying  customers of a security incident involving the unauthorized access or  use of the customer's information in accordance with the standard set  forth below is a key part of that duty. Timely notification of customers  is important to manage an institution's reputation risk. Effective  notice also may reduce an institution's legal risk, assist in  maintaining good customer relations, and enable the institution's  customers to take steps to protect themselves against the consequences  of identity theft. When customer notification is warranted, an  institution may not forgo notifying its customers of an incident because  the institution believes that it may be potentially embarrassed or  inconvenienced by doing so.</p><p class="depth0">A. Standard for Providing Notice</p><p class="depth0">When a financial institution becomes aware of an incident of  unauthorized access to sensitive customer information, the institution  should conduct a reasonable investigation to promptly determine the  likelihood that the information has been or will be misused. If the  institution determines   that misuse of its information about a customer has occurred or is  reasonably possible, it should notify the affected customer as soon as  possible. Customer notice may be delayed if an appropriate law  enforcement agency determines that notification will interfere with a  criminal investigation and provides the institution with a written  request for the delay. However, the institution should notify its  customers as soon as notification will no longer interfere with the  investigation.</p><p class="depth0">1. Sensitive Customer Information</p><p class="depth0">Under the Guidelines, an institution must protect against  unauthorized access to or use of customer information that could result  in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. Substantial harm  or inconvenience is most likely to result from improper access to  sensitive customer information because this type of information is most  likely to be misused, as in the commission of identity theft. For  purposes of this Guidance, sensitive customer information means a  customer's name, address, or telephone number, in conjunction with the  customer's social security number, driver's license number, account  number, credit or debit card number, or a personal identification number  or password that would permit access to the customer's account.  Sensitive customer information also includes any combination of  components of customer information that would allow someone to log onto  or access the customer's account, such as user name and password or  password and account number.</p><p class="depth0">2. Affected Customers</p><p class="depth0">If a financial institution, based upon its investigation, can  determine from its logs or other data precisely which customers'  information has been improperly accessed, it may limit notification to  those customers with regard to whom the institution determines that  misuse of their information has occurred or is reasonably possible.  However, there may be situations where the institution determines that a  group of files has been accessed improperly, but is unable to identify  which specific customers' information has been accessed. If the  circumstances of the unauthorized access lead the institution to  determine that misuse of the information is reasonably possible, it  should notify all customers in the group.</p><p class="depth0">B. Content of Customer Notice</p><p class="depth0">1. Customer notice should be given in a clear and conspicuous  manner. The notice should describe the incident in general terms and the  type of customer information that was the subject of unauthorized access  or use. It also should generally describe what the institution has done  to protect the customers' information from further unauthorized access.  In addition, it should include a telephone number that customers can  call for further information and assistance. \14\ The notice also should  remind customers of the need to remain vigilant over the next twelve to  twenty-four months, and to promptly report incidents of suspected  identity theft to the institution. The notice should include the  following additional items, when appropriate: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\14\ The institution should, therefore, ensure that it has  reasonable policies and procedures in place, including trained  personnel, to respond appropriately to customer inquiries and requests  for assistance. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">a. A recommendation that the customer review account statements and  immediately report any suspicious activity to the institution;</p><p class="depth0">b. A description of fraud alerts and an explanation of how the  customer may place a fraud alert in the customer's consumer reports to  put the customer's creditors on notice that the customer may be a victim  of fraud;</p><p class="depth0">c. A recommendation that the customer periodically obtain credit  reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency and have  information relating to fraudulent transactions deleted;</p><p class="depth0">d. An explanation of how the customer may obtain a credit report  free of charge; and</p><p class="depth0">e. Information about the availability of the FTC's online guidance  regarding steps a consumer can take to protect against identity theft.  The notice should encourage the customer to report any incidents of  identity theft to the FTC, and should provide the FTC's Web site address  and toll-free telephone number that customers may use to obtain the  identity theft guidance and report suspected incidents of identity  theft. \15\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\15\ Currently, the FTC Web site for the ID Theft brochure and the  FTC Hotline phone number are http://www.consumer.gov/idtheft and 1-877- IDTHEFT. The institution may also refer customers to any materials  developed pursuant to section 151(b) of the FACT Act (educational  materials developed by the FTC to teach the public how to prevent  identity theft). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">2. The Agencies encourage financial institutions to notify the  nationwide consumer reporting agencies prior to sending notices to a  large number of customers that include contact information for the  reporting agencies.</p><p class="depth0">C. Delivery of Customer Notice</p><p class="depth0">Customer notice should be delivered in any manner designed to ensure  that a customer can reasonably be expected to receive it. For example,  the institution may choose to contact all customers affected by  telephone or   by mail, or by electronic mail for those customers for whom it has a  valid e-mail address and who have agreed to receive communications  electronically.
