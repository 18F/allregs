However, the Director shall not waive the use of  the formula or reduce the proposed assessment on the basis of an  argument that a reduction in the proposed penalty could be used to abate  violations of the Act, this chapter, any applicable program, or any  condition of any permit or exploration approval. The basis for every  waiver shall be fully explained and documented in the records of the  case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> to determine the  appropriate penalty. When the Director has elected to waive the use of  the formula, he or she shall give a written explanation of the basis for  the assessment made to the person to whom the notice or order was  issued.</p>
