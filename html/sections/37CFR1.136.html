                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> If an applicant is required to reply within a nonstatutory or shortened statutory time period, applicant may extend the time period for reply up to the earlier of the expiration of any maximum period set by statute or five months after the time period set for reply, if a petition for an extension of time and the fee set in Sec.  1.17(a) are filed, unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an applicant is required to reply within a nonstatutory or shortened statutory time period, applicant may extend the time period for reply up to the earlier of the expiration of any maximum period set by statute or five months after the time period set for reply, if a petition for an extension of time and the fee set in Sec.  1.17(a) are filed, unless:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Applicant is notified otherwise in an Office action;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The reply is a reply brief submitted pursuant to Sec.  41.41 of this title;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The reply is a request for an oral hearing submitted pursuant to Sec.  41.47(a) of this title;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The reply is to a decision by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board pursuant to Sec.  41.50 or Sec.  41.52 of this chapter or to Sec.  90.3 of this chapter; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The application is involved in a contested case (Sec.  41.101(a) of this title) or a derivation proceeding (Sec.  42.4(b) of this title).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The date on which the petition and the fee have been filed is the date for purposes of determining the period of extension and the corresponding amount of the fee. The expiration of the time period is determined by the amount of the fee paid. A reply must be filed prior to the expiration of the period of extension to avoid abandonment of the application (Sec.  1.135), but in no situation may an applicant reply later than the maximum time period set by statute, or be granted an extension of time under paragraph (b) of this section when the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section are available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A written request may be submitted in an application that is an authorization to treat any concurrent or future reply, requiring a petition for an extension of time under this paragraph for its timely submission, as incorporating a petition for extension of time for the appropriate length of time. An authorization to charge all required fees, fees under Sec.  1.17, or all required extension of time fees will be treated as a constructive petition for an extension of time in any concurrent

or future reply requiring a petition for an extension of time under this paragraph for its timely submission. Submission of the fee set forth in Sec.  1.17(a) will also be treated as a constructive petition for an extension of time in any concurrent reply requiring a petition for an extension of time under this paragraph for its timely submission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When a reply cannot be filed within the time period set for such reply and the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section are not available, the period for reply will be extended only for sufficient cause and for a reasonable time specified. Any request for an extension of time under this paragraph must be filed on or before the day on which such reply is due, but the mere filing of such a request will not effect any extension under this paragraph. In no situation can any extension carry the date on which reply is due beyond the maximum time period set by statute. Any request under this paragraph must be accompanied by the petition fee set forth in Sec.  1.17(g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If an applicant is notified in a ``Notice of Allowability'' that an application is otherwise in condition for allowance, the following time periods are not extendable if set in the ``Notice of Allowability'' or in an Office action having a mail date on or after the mail date of the ``Notice of Allowability'':</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The period for submitting the inventor's oath or declaration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The period for submitting formal drawings set under Sec.  1.85(c); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The period for making a deposit set under Sec.  1.809(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> See Sec.  1.550(c) for extensions of time in ex parte reexamination proceedings, Sec.  1.956 for extensions of time in inter partes reexamination proceedings; Sec. Sec.  41.4(a) and 41.121(a)(3) of this chapter for extensions of time in contested cases before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board; Sec.  42.5(c) of this chapter for extensions of time in trials before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board; and Sec.  90.3 of this chapter for extensions of time to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or to commence a civil action.
