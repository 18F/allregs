                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Agency staff determination responsibility. All federal agency  staff determinations of title VI compliance shall be made by, or be  subject to the review of, the agency's civil rights office. Where  federal agency responsibility for approving applications or specific  projects has been assigned to regional or area offices, the agency shall  include personnel having title VI review responsibility on the staffs of  such offices and such personnel shall perform the functions described in  paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application review. Prior to approval of federal financial  assistance, the federal agency shall make written determination as to  whether the applicant is in compliance with title VI (see 28 CFR 50.3(c)  II A). The basis for such a determination under ``the agency's own  investigation'' provision (see 28 CFR 50.3(c) II A(2)), shall be  submission of an assurance of compliance and a review of the data  submitted by the applicant. Where a determination cannot be made from  this data, the agency shall require the submission of necessary  additional information and shall take other steps necessary for making  the determination. Such other steps may include, for example,  communicating with local government officials or minority group  organizations and field reviews. Where the requested assistance is for  construction, a pre-approval review should determine whether the  location and design of the project will provide service on a  nondiscriminatory basis and whether persons will be displaced or  relocated on a nondiscriminatory basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Post-approval review. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Federal agencies shall establish and  maintain an effective program of post-approval compliance reviews  regarding approved new applications (see 28 CFR 50.3(c) II A),  applications for continuation or renewal of assistance (28 CFR 50.3(c)  II B) and all other federally assisted programs. Such reviews are to  include periodic submission of compliance reports by recipients to the  agencies and, where appropriate, field reviews of a representative  number of major recipients. In carrying out this program, agency  personnel shall follow agency manuals which establish appropriate review  procedures and standards of evaluation. Additionally, agencies should  consider incorporating a title VI component into general program reviews  and audits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The results of post-approval reviews shall be committed to  writing and shall include specific findings of fact and recommendations.  A determination of the compliance status of the recipient reviewed shall  be made as promptly as possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notice to assistant attorney general. Federal agencies shall  promptly notify the Assistant Attorney General of instances of probable  noncompliance determined as the result of application reviews or post- approval compliance reviews.</p>
