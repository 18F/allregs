Note also that the additional specifications in this paragraph (g) do not apply for nozzles used primarily for dispensing gasoline into motor vehicles rather than marine vessels.) Every retailer and wholesale purchaser-consumer shall use nozzles meeting these specifications for any new construction or for nozzle replacements. This does not require replacement of existing nozzles for refueling marine vessels before they would be replaced for other reasons.

The flow rate may be controlled through any means in the pump/dispenser system, provided the nozzle flow rate does not exceed 10 gallons per minute (37.9 liters per minute). After January 1, 1998 this requirement applies to every retailer and wholesale purchaser-consumer. Any dispensing pump that is dedicated exclusively to heavy-duty vehicles, boats, or airplanes is exempt from this requirement.
