Egg producers not subject to the provisions of the Act pursuant to Sec. 1250.348 shall file with all handlers to whom they sell eggs a statement certifying their exemption from the provisions of the Act in accordance with the criterion of Sec. 1250.348. Certification shall be made on forms approved and provided by the Egg Board to collecting handlers for use by exempt producers. The certification form shall be filed with each handler on or before January 1 of each year as long as the producer continues to do business with the handler. A copy of the certificate of exemption shall be forwarded to the Egg Board by the handler within 30 days of receipt. The certification shall list the following: the name and address of the producer, the basis for producer exemption according to the requirements of Sec. 1250.348, and the signature of the producer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Organic Production. A producer who operates under an approved National Organic Program (NOP) (7 CFR part 205) system plan; only produces products that are eligible to be labeled as 100 percent organic under the NOP, except as provided for in paragraph (b)(6) of this section; and is not a split operation shall be exempt from the payment of assessments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To apply for an exemption under this section, a producer shall submit a request for exemption to the Board on a form provided by the Board at any time initially and annually thereafter on or before January 1 as long as the producer continues to be eligible for the exemption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The request shall include the following: the producer's name and address, a copy of the organic farm or organic handling operation certificate provided by a USDA-accredited certifying agent as defined in section 2103 of the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 6502), a signed certification that the applicant meets all of

the requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section for an assessment exemption, and such other information as may be required by the Board and with the approval of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the producer complies with the requirements of this section, the Board will grant an assessment exemption and issue a certificate of exemption to the producer. For exemption requests received on or before August 15, 2005, the Board will have 60 days to approve the exemption request; after August 15, 2005, the Board will have 30 days to approve the exemption request.
