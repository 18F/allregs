                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Use. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where the recipient or subrecipient is leasing the  structure, or portions thereof, grant funds may be used to pay for 100  percent of the costs of leasing a structure or structures, or portions  thereof, to provide housing or supportive services to homeless persons  for up to 3 years. Leasing funds may not be used to lease units or  structures owned by the recipient, subrecipient, their parent  organization(s), any other related organization(s), or organizations  that are members of a partnership, where the partnership owns the  structure, unless HUD authorized an exception for good cause.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any request for an exception must include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A description of how leasing these structures is in the best  interest of the program;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Supporting documentation showing that the leasing charges paid  with grant funds are reasonable for the market; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A copy of the written policy for resolving disputes between  the landlord and tenant, including a recusal for officers, agents, and  staff who work for both the landlord and tenant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Leasing structures. When grants are used to  pay rent for all or part of a structure or structures, the rent paid  must be reasonable in relation to rents being charged in the area for  comparable space. In addition, the rent paid may not exceed rents  currently being charged by the same owner for comparable unassisted  space.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Leasing individual units. When grants are used to pay rent for  individual housing units, the rent paid must be reasonable in relation  to rents being charged for comparable units, taking into account the  location, size, type, quality, amenities, facilities, and management  services. In addition, the rents may not exceed rents currently being  charged for comparable units, and the rent paid may not exceed HUD- determined fair market rents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Utilities. If electricity, gas, and water are included in the  rent, these utilities may be paid from leasing funds. If utilities are  not provided by the landlord, these utility costs are an operating cost,  except for supportive service facilities. If the structure is being used  as a supportive service facility, then these utility costs are a  supportive service cost.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Security deposits and first and last month's rent. Recipients  and subrecipients may use grant funds to pay security deposits, in an  amount not to exceed 2 months of actual rent. An advance payment of the  last month's rent may be provided to the landlord in addition to the  security deposit and payment of the first month's rent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Occupancy agreements and subleases. Occupancy agreements and  subleases are required as specified in Sec.  578.77(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Calculation of occupancy charges and rent. Occupancy charges and  rent from program participants must be calculated as provided in Sec.   578.77.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Program income. Occupancy charges and rent collected from  program participants are program income and may be used as provided  under Sec.  578.97.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Transition. Beginning in the first year awards are made under  the Continuum of Care program, renewals of grants for leasing funds  entered into under the authority of title IV, subtitle D of the Act as  it existed before May 20, 2009, will be renewed either as grants for  leasing or as rental assistance, depending on the characteristics of the  project. Leasing funds will be renewed as rental assistance if the funds  are used to pay rent on units where the lease is between the program  participant and the landowner or sublessor. Projects requesting leasing  funds will be renewed as leasing if the funds were used to lease a unit  or structure and   the lease is between the recipient or subrecipient and the landowner.</p>
