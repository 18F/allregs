Sec. 670.400 and 670.410 is assigned to a center based on an assignment plan developed by the Secretary. The assignment plan identifies a target for the maximum percentage of students at each center who come from the State or region nearest the center, and the regions surrounding the center. The assignment plan is based on an analysis of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The number of eligible individuals in the State and region where the center is located and the regions surrounding where the center is located;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The demand for enrollment in Job Corps in the State and region where the center is located and in surrounding regions; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The size and enrollment level of the center.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligible applicants are assigned to centers closest to their homes, unless it is determined, based on the special needs of applicants, including vocational interests and English literacy

needs, the unavailability of openings in the closest center, or parent or guardian concerns, that another center is more appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A student who is under the age of 18 must not be assigned to a center other than the center closest to home if a parent or guardian objects to the assignment.</p>
