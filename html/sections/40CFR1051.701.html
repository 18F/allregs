                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You may average, bank, and trade emission credits for purposes  of certification as described in this subpart to show compliance with  the standards of this part. To do this you must certify your engines to  Family Emission Limits (FELs) and show that your average emission levels  for all your engine families together are below the emission standards  in subpart B of this part, or that you have sufficient credits to offset  a credit deficit for the model year (as calculated in Sec.  1051.720).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following averaging set restrictions apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> to show compliance  with the standards in Sec.  1051.105(a)(2) in a later model year, and  vice versa.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There are separate averaging, banking, and trading programs for  snowmobiles, ATVs, and off-highway motorcycles. You may not average or  exchange banked or traded credits from engine families of one type of  vehicle with those from engine families of another type of vehicle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> does not restrict you from averaging together engine families  that use test procedures that we determine provide equivalent emission  results.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You may not average or exchange banked or traded exhaust credits  with evaporative credits, or vice versa.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The definitions of Subpart I of this part apply to this subpart.  The following definitions also apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Actual emission credits means emission credits you have  generated that we have verified by reviewing your final report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Average standard means a standard that allows you comply by  averaging all your vehicles under this part. See subpart B of this part  to determine which standards are average standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Averaging set means a set of engines in which emission credits  may be exchanged only with other engines in the same averaging set.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Broker means any entity that facilitates a trade of emission  credits between a buyer and seller.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Buyer means the entity that receives emission credits as a  result of a trade.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Reserved emission credits means emission credits you have  generated that we have not yet verified by reviewing your final report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Seller means the entity that provides emission credits during a  trade.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Trade means to exchange emission credits, either as a buyer or  seller.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In your application for certification, base your showing of  compliance on projected production volumes for vehicles whose point of  first retail sale is in the United States. As described in Sec.   1051.730, compliance with the requirements of this subpart is determined  at the end of the model year based on actual production volumes for  vehicles whose point of first retail sale is in the United States. Do  not include any of the following vehicles to calculate emission credits:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Vehicles exempted under subpart G of this part or under 40 CFR  part 1068.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exported vehicles.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Vehicles not subject to the requirements of this part, such as  those excluded under Sec.  1051.5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Vehicles for which the location of first retail sale is in a  state that has applicable state emission regulations for that model  year. However, this restriction does not apply if we determine that the  state standards and requirements are equivalent to those of this part  and that these vehicles sold in such a state will not generate credits  under the state program. For example, you may not include vehicles  certified for California if it has more stringent emission standards for  these vehicles or those vehicles generate or use emission credits under  the California program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any other vehicles, where we indicate elsewhere in this part  1051 that they are not to be included in the calculations of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You may not use emission credits generated under this subpart to  offset any emissions that exceed an FEL or standard, except as specified  in Sec.  1051.225(f)(1). This applies for all testing, including  certification testing, in-use testing, selective enforcement audits, and  other production-line testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Emission credits may be used in the model year they are  generated or in future model years. Emission credits may not be used for  past model years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> You may increase or decrease an FEL during the model year by  amending your application for certification under Sec.  1051.225.
