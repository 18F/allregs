Exhibit A to Subpart G of Part 1940--Departmental Regulation</p><p class="depth0">Number: 9500-3.</p><p class="depth0">Subject: Land Use Policy.</p><p class="depth0">Date: March 22, 1983.</p><p class="depth0">OPI: Land Use Staff, Soil Conservation Service.</p><p class="depth0">Section
1. Purpose2. Cancellation3. Policy4. Abbreviations5. Definitions6. Responsibilities7. Appendix A</p><p class="depth0">1. Purpose</p><p class="depth0">The Nation's farmlands, forest lands, rangelands, flood plains, and wetlands are unique natural resources providing food, fiber, wood, and water necessary for the continued welfare of the people of the United States and protection from floods. Each year, large amounts of these lands are converted to other uses. Continued conversion of the Nation's farmlands, forest lands, and rangelands may impair the ability of the United States to produce sufficient food, fiber, and wood to meet domestic needs and the demands of export markets. Continued conversion of the Nation's wetlands may reduce the availability of adequate supplies of suitable-quality water, indigenous wildlife species, and the productive capacity of the Nation's fisheries. Continued encroachments on flood plains decrease the natural flood-control capacity of these land areas, create needs for expensive manmade flood-control measures and disaster-relief activities, and endanger both lives and property.</p><p class="depth0">Land use allocation decisions are matters of concern to USDA. Decisions concerning land use arise from needs to accommodate needed growth and development; prevent unwarranted and costly sprawl; avoid unwarranted conversion of farm, range, and forest lands and wetlands from existing uses and unwarranted encroachment on flood plains; maintain and enhance agricultural and forest production capabilities; maintain wildlife, fish, and seafood habitat; provide or improve community services and facilities; assure appropriate environmental quality; and assure adequate supplies of suitable-quality water. These needs are highly interdependent and often compete with each other for the limited supply of available land and water.</p><p class="depth0">It is Departmental policy to promote land use objectives responsive to current and long-term economic, social, and environmental needs. This policy recognizes the rights and responsibilities of State and local governments for regulating the uses of land under their jurisdiction. It also reflects the Department's responsibility to (a) assure that the United States retains a farm, range, and forest land base sufficient to produce adequate supplies, at reasonable production costs of high-quality food, fiber, wood, and other agricultural products that may be needed; (b) assist individual landholders and State and local governments in defining and meeting needs for growth and development in such ways that the most productive farm, range, and forest lands are protected from unwarranted conversion to other uses; and (c) assure appropriate levels of environmental quality.</p><p class="depth0">In accordance with the authority contained in 7 U.S.C. 1010 and 7 U.S.C. 2204 and consistent with 7 CFR 2.19(f) and provisions of the Farmland Protection Policy Act, Subtitle I, Title XV, Pub. L. 97-98, the Department sets forth this statement of policy on land use.</p><p class="depth0">2. Cancellations</p><p class="depth0">This regulation supersedes Secretary's Memorandum 9500-2 dated March 10, 1982.</p><p class="depth0">3. Policy</p><p class="depth0">Federal agencies, in implementing programs, make decisions that affect current

and potential uses of land. The Department will:</p><p class="depth0">a. Promote and support planning procedures that allow landholders, interest groups, and State and local governments to have input at all appropriate stages of the decisionmaking process for public projects, programs, or activities; that recognize the rights and responsibilities of landholders in making private land use decisions; and that recognize the responsibility of governments in influencing how land may be used to meet public needs.</p><p class="depth0">b. Assure that programs of the agencies within the Department discourage the unwarranted conversion to other uses of prime and unique farmlands, farmlands of statewide or local importance, and prime rangelands, as defined in appendix A; the unwarranted alteration of wetlands or flood plains; or the unwarranted expansion of the peripheral boundaries of existing settlements.</p><p class="depth0">c. Manage both its land use-related programs and USDA-administered land in such manner as to (1) demonstrate leadership in meeting short- and long-term needs for growth and development, while assuring adequate supplies of needed food, fiber, and forest products; (2) assure appropriate levels of environmental quality and adequate supplies of water; and (3) discourage unwarranted expansion of peripheral boundaries of existing settlements. Whenever practicable, management of USDA-administered lands shall be coordinated with the management of adjacent private and other public lands.</p><p class="depth0">d. Conduct multidisciplinary land use research and education programs responsive to identified State, local, and national needs and, when requested, assist State and local governments, citizens groups, and individual landholders in determining alternative land use values, thereby enabling local officials to make judicious choices to meet growth and development needs and to protect the community's farm- and forest-related economic base.</p><p class="depth0">e. Assist landowners and State and Federal agencies in the reclamation of abandoned surface-mined lands. This reclamation will help eliminate safety, health, and environmental problems.</p><p class="depth0">f. Assist in planning for the extraction of coal and other nonrenewable resources in such manner as to facilitate restoration. This restoration would reestablish or enhance food, fiber, or forest productivity or contribute to other beneficial uses of the land as mining is completed in defined areas as sites.</p><p class="depth0">g. Advocate among Federal agencies:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The retention of important farmlands, rangelands, forest lands, and wetlands, whenever proposed conversions to other uses (a) are caused or encouraged by actions or programs of a Federal agency or (b) require licensing or approval by a Federal agency, unless other needs clearly override the benefits derived from retention of such lands; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Actions that reduce the risk of flood loss and soil erosion; that minimize impacts of floods on human safety, health, and welfare; that preserve natural flood-control and other beneficial functions and values of wetlands and flood plains; and that reduce future need for expensive manmade flood-control systems, disaster-relief assistance, or Federal rehabilitation assistance in the event of flooding.</p><p class="depth0">4.

Responsibilities</p><p class="depth0">a. The Office of the Secretary is responsible for (1) encouraging, assisting, and coordinating efforts of other Federal departments and agencies to implement policies and procedures supportive of the objectives of this regulation; (2) resolving issues and acting on recommendations raised to the Secretary's Policy and Coordination Council by the Departmental committees; and (3) raising unresolved issues and recommending actions to the appropriate Cabinet Council.</p><p class="depth0">b. The NRE Committee, created under the Secretary's memorandum dated July 22, 1981, will provide departmentwide leadership for the implementation of this policy statement. In implementing this policy, the NRE Committee will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Recommend Departmental guidelines to the Secretary and schedule reviews of each agency's procedures for implementation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Monitor implementation of this policy;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Encourage, support, and provide guidance to State- and local-level USDA committees in implementing this policy;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Coordinate the work of USDA agencies in carrying out the provisions of this regulation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Advise the Secretary annually as to progress and problems encountered.</p><p class="depth0">c. Each USDA agency will review and make the necessary administrative changes in existing and proposed rules, regulations, guides, practices, or policies and propose needed legislative changes to bring agency programs into compliance with the provisions of this regulation.</p><p class="depth0">d. Each USDA agency having programs that will be affected by this regulation shall develop implementing procedures, consistent with the guidelines provided by the NRE Committee, and shall provide to all offices of the agency copies of this policy statement,

Departmental guidelines, and agency procedures to implement this policy.</p><p class="depth0">e. USDA agencies will encourage State and local governments and individual landholders to retain important farmlands, rangelands, forest lands, and wetlands and to avoid encroachments on flood plains when practicable alternatives exist to meet developmental needs. Appropriate agencies will assist State and local governments, citizens groups, and individual landholders in identifying options and determining alternative land use values as the basis for making judicious choices in meeting growth and development needs.</p><p class="depth0">f. USDA agencies will encourage other Federal, State, and local government agencies to exchange information on plans or projects that may impact on important farmlands, rangelands, forest lands, wetlalds, or flood plains and to involve appropriate USDA agencies early in the planning process. USDA agencies will participate in a timely manner at appropriate stages in the planning process on Federal or federally assisted projects or activities when requested. Where opportunity for such participation is not forthcoming, the Department may intercede, consistent with policy contained in this regulation, at appropriate stages in the decisionmaking process through review and comments on plans, as provided for in authorized administrative review procedures for such projects, activities, or actions.</p><p class="depth0">g. When land held either in public or private ownership will be directly affected by USDA actions, the implementing agency will notify the affected landholders at the earliest time practicable of the proposed action and provide such landholders an opportunity to review the elements of the action and to comment on the action's feasibility and alternatives to it.</p><p class="depth0">h. Agencies of USDA will assure that their actions, investments, and programs on non-Federal lands will conform, to the extent practicable, with the uses permitted under land use regulations adopted by State or local governments.</p><p class="depth0">i. When land use regulations or decisions are inconsistent with USDA policies and procedures for the protection of important farmlands, rangelands, forest lands, wetlands, or flood plains, USDA agencies shall not assist in actions that would convert these lands to other uses or encroach upon flood plains, unless (1) there is a demonstrated, significant need for the project, program, or facility, and (2) there are no practicable alternative actions or sites that would avoid the conversion of these lands or, if conversion is unavoidable, reduce the number of acres to be converted or encroached upon directly and indirectly.</p><p class="depth0">7. Appendix A--Definitions</p><p class="depth0">The following definitions apply to this Departmental Regulation.</p><p class="depth0">1. important farmlands \1\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ 7 CFR 657.5.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">a. Prime Farmlands \1\</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General Criteria. Prime farmland is land that has the best combination of physical and chemical characteristics for producing food, feed, forage, fiber, and oilseed crops and is also available for these uses (the land could be cropland, pastureland, rangeland, forest land, or other land, but not urban built-up land or water). It has the soil quality, growing season, and moisture supply needed to produce, economically, sustained high yields of crops when treated and managed, including water management, according to acceptable farming methods. In general, prime farmlands have an adequate and dependable water supply from precipitation or irrigation, a favorable temperature and growing season, acceptable acidity or alkalinity, acceptable salt and sodium content, and few or no rocks. They are permeable to water and air. Prime farmlands are not excessively erodible or saturated with water for a long period of time, and they either do not flood frequently or are protected from flooding. Examples of soils that qualify as prime farmland are Palouse silt loam, 0- to 7-percent slopes; Brookston silty clay loam, drained; and Tama silty clay loam, 0- to 5-percent slopes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Specific Criteria. Prime farmlands must meet all the following criteria. Terms used in this section are defined in these USDA publications: ``Soil Taxonomy, Agriculture Handbook 436,'' ``Soil Survey Manual, Agriculture Handbook 18,'' ``Rainfall-Erosion Losses from Cropland, Agriculture Handbook 282,'' ``Wind Erosion Forces in the United States and Their Use in Predicting Soil Loss, Agriculture Handbook 346,'' and ``Saline and Alkali Soils, Agriculture Handbook 60.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The soils have:</p><p class="depth0">1. Aquic, udic, ustic, or xeric moisture regimes and sufficient available water capacity within a depth of 40 inches, or in the root zone (root zone is the part of the soil that is penetrated by plant roots) if the root zone is less than 40 inches deep, to produce the commonly grown cultivated crops (cultivated crops include but are not limited to grain, forage, fiber, oilseed, sugar beets, sugarcane, vegetables, tobacco, orchard, vineyard, and bush fruit crops) adapted to the region in 7 or more years out of 10; or</p><p class="depth0">2. Xeric or ustic moisture regimes in which the available water capacity is limited, but the area has a developed irrigation water supply that is dependable (a dependable water supply is one in which enough water is

available for irrigation in 8 out of 10 years for the crops commonly grown) and of adequate quality; or</p><p class="depth0">3. Acidic or torric moisture regimes, and the area has a developed irrigation water supply that is dependable and of adequate quality; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The soils have a temperature regime that is frigid, mesic, thermic, or hyperthermic (pergelic and cryic regimes are excluded). These are soils that, at a depth of 20 inches, have a mean annual temperature higher than 32 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition, the mean summer temperature at this depth in soils with an 0 horizon is higher than 47 degrees Fahrenheit; in soils that have no 0 horizon, the mean summer temperature is higher than 59 degrees Fahrenheit; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The soils have a pH between 4.5 and 8.4 in all horizons within a depth of 40 inches or in the root zone if the root zone is less than 40 inches deep; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The soils either have no water table or have a water table that is maintained at a sufficient depth during the cropping season to allow cultivated crops common to the area to be grown; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The soils can be managed so that in all horizons within a depth of 40 inches or in the root zone if the root zone is less than 40 inches deep, during part of each year the conductivity of the saturation extract is less than 4 mmhoc/cm and the exchangeable sodium percentage is less than 15; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The soils are not flooded frequently during the growing season (less often than once in 2 years); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The product of K (erodibility factor) times the percent slope is less than 2.0, and the product of I (soils erodibility) times C (climatic factor) does not exceed 60; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> The soils have a permeability rate of at least 0.06 inch per hour in the upper 20 inches, and the mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is less than 59 degrees Fahrenheit or higher; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Less that 10 percent of the surface layer (upper 6 inches) in these soils consists of rock fragments coarser than 3 inches.</p><p class="depth0">b. Unique Farmland \1\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ See footnote 1 on previous page.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General Criteria. Unique farmland is land other than prime farmland that is used for the production of specific high-value food and fiber crops. It has the special combination of soil quality, location, growing season, and moisture supply needed to produce, economically, sustained high-quality and/or high yields of a specific crop when treated and managed according to acceptable farming methods. Examples of such crops are citrus, tree nuts, olives, cranberries, fruit, and vegetables.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Specific Characteristics. Unique farmland is used for a specific high-value food or fiber crop. It has a moisture supply that is adequate for the specific crop; the supply is from stored moisture, precipitation, or a developed irrigation system. It combines favorable factors of soil quality, growing season, temperature, humidity, air drainage, elevation, aspect, or other conditions, such as nearness to market, that favor the growth of a specific food or fiber crop.</p><p class="depth0">c. Additional Farmland of Statewide Importance \1\</p><p class="depth0">This is land, in addition to prime and unique farmlands, that is of statewide importance for the production of food, feed, fiber, forage, and oilseed crops. Criteria for defining and delineating this land are to be determined by the appropriate State agency or agencies. Generally, additional farmlands of statewide importance include those that are nearly prime farmland and that economically produce high yields of crops when treated and managed according to acceptable farming methods. Some may produce as high a yield as prime farmlands if conditions are favorable. In some States, additional farmlands of statewide importance may include tracts of land that have been designated for agriculture by State law.</p><p class="depth0">d. Additional Farmland of Local Importance \1\</p><p class="depth0">In some local areas, there is concern for certain additional farmlands for the production of food, feed, fiber, forage, and oilseed crops, even though these lands are not identified as having national or statewide importance. Where appropriate, these lands are to be identified by the local agency or agencies concerned.</p><p class="depth0">2. prime forest lands \2\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ Prime Forest Land Definition and Criteria, U.S. Forest Service, May 26, 1977.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Because of the multiple use of forested lands, several categories, e.g., timber, wildlife, and recreation, may be developed. For purposes of this regulation only, the following timberland definitions will apply.</p><p class="depth0">a. Prime Timberland \2\</p><p class="depth0">Prime timberland is land that has soil capable of growing wood at the rate of 85 cubic feet or more/acre/year (at culmination of mean annual increment) in natural stands and is not in urban or built-up land uses or water. Generally speaking, this is land currently in forest, but does not exclude qualifying lands that could realistically be returned to forest. Delineation of these lands will be in accordance with national criteria.</p><p class="depth0">b. Unique Timberland \2\</p><p class="depth0">Unique timberlands are lands that do not qualify as prime timberland on the basis of producing less than 85 cubic feet/acre/year, but are growing sustained yields of specific high-value species or species capable of producing specialized wood products under a silvicultural system that maintains soil productivity and protects water quality. Delineation of these lands will be in accordance with national criteria.</p><p class="depth0">c. Timberland of Statewide Importance \2\</p><p class="depth0">This is land, in addition to prime and unique timberlands, that is of statewide importance for the growing of wood. Criteria for defining and delineating these lands are to be determined by State forestry planning committees or appropriate State organizations.</p><p class="depth0">d. Timberlands of Local Importance \2\</p><p class="depth0">In some local areas, there is concern for certain additional forest lands for the growing of wood, even though these lands are not identified as having national or statewide importance. Where appropriate, these lands are to be identified by a local agency or agencies concerned.</p><p class="depth0">3. wetlands \3\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\3\ Definitions contained in Executive Orders 11988 and 11990.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Wetlands are those areas that are inundated by surface or ground water with a frequency sufficient to support and, under normal circumstances, do or would support a prevalence of vegetative or aquatic life that requires saturated or seasonally saturated soil conditions for growth and reproduction. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas, such as sloughs, potholes, wet meadows, river overflows, mudflats, and natural ponds.</p><p class="depth0">4. flood plains \3\</p><p class="depth0">The term flood plain means the lowland and relatively flat areas adjoining inland and coastal waters, including floodprone areas of offshore islands, including, at a minimum, those that are subject to a 1-percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.</p><p class="depth0">5. prime rangeland \4\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\4\ USDA proposed definition for intradepartmental use only.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Prime rangeland is rangeland which, because of its soil, climate, topography, vegetation, and location, has the highest quality or value for grazing animals. The (potential) natural vegetation is palatable, nutritious, and available to the kinds of herbivores common to the area.


Sec. Exhibit B to Subpart G of Part 1940--Development and Implementation</p><p class="depth0">of Natural Resource Management Guide</p><p class="depth0">1. The State Director shall complete the natural resource management guide within 12 months from the effective date of this subpart and issue the guide as a State supplement after prior approval by the Administrator. A summary of the basic content, purposes, and uses of the guide is contained in Sec. 1940.305 of this subpart. The guide shall be prepared in draft form and be provided for review and comment to USDA agencies, appropriate Federal and State agencies, State and regional review agencies assigned the consulation requirements of Executive Order 12372, as well as interested localities, groups, and citizens. Also at least one public information meeting shall be held on the draft which shall be followed by a 30-day period for the submission of public comments. Public notification of this meeting shall be made in the same manner as the notification process for a scoping meeting. (See Sec. 1940.320(c) of this subpart). Additionally, the public shall be informed that copies of the draft guide will be made available from the State Office upon request. After completion of this public review, the draft will be revised as necessary in light of the comments received and provided as a final draft State Supplement to the Administrator for review and approval. Any concerns and comments of the Administrator will be addressed by the State Director and the guide completed. Upon the Administrator's approval and the fulfillment of the requirements of paragraph 4. of this exhibit, the natural resource management guide shall then become part of any program investment strategies developed by the State Director for the purpose of addressing the rural needs of the State. Although a 12-month period has been established for the completion of a natural resource management guide, this deadline is not to be construed as curtailing or postponing the implementation of existing environmental laws, regulations, Executive orders or the Departmental Regulation 9500-3, Land Use Policy, with respect to individual project reviews, nor giving anyone any rights or claims with respect to the completion or content of the guide.</p><p class="depth0">2. The natural resource management guide needs to be developed in full recognition of its role as an internal Agency planning tool and with sensitivity to the Agency's mission.</p><p class="depth0">3. After the Administrator approves the natural resource management guide, it will become effective 4 months from that date. This interim period shall be used to inform local, State, and Federal agencies, localities, organizations, and interested citizens of the content of the guide. In this manner, those

parties intending to seek FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 assistance or to coordinate FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 assistance programs with their own programs will be able to gain for their planning needs an understanding of our guide.</p><p class="depth0">4. Completed natural resource management guides shall be reviewed every 2 years and updated by the State Director to reflect newly identified geographical areas of concern or policy revisions at the lational, State, regional or local level. They will also be revised, as necessary, through appropriate guidance from the Administrator. Revisions shall be transmitted to the Administrator for postapproval and shall be considered approved if either no comments are raised by the Administrator within 30 days of receipt of the State Director's transmittal letter or the administrator specifically approves them before the 30 days expire. Public review of a revision will not be required. However, if in the opinion of the State Director the proposed revision will substantially change the previously adopted natural resource management guide, a public review shall be conducted of the revision in the same manner as that described in paragraph 1 of this exhibit for the development of the original guide. Such review shall occur prior to the transmittal of the revision to the Administrator. If the State Director believes that at the expiration of any 2-year review period there is need to update the guide, a statement to this effect shall be filed with the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0">5. The foundation for the natural resource management guide is the identification of the types of land uses or environmental factors deserving attention and their geographical location within the State. An inventory or listing shall be developed, therefore, of the important land uses within the State. This inventory will be accomplished by assembling existing data and information compiled by those Federal, State, and local agencies that have jurisdiction or expertise regarding the land uses or environmental factors. At a minimum, the inventory shall consist of available documents, listings, maps, or graphic materials describing the location of the following:</p><p class="depth0">a. National Register of Historic Places to include monthly supplements as designated by the Department of the Interior (DOI), and the State Historic Preservation Plans. This list is issued as a State supplement to subpart F or part 1901 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth0">b. Rivers designated as part of the Wild and Scenic Rivers System and rivers under study for inclusion in the system, as published by DOI;</p><p class="depth0">c. Important farmlands;</p><p class="depth0">d. Prime rangelands.</p><p class="depth0">e. Prime forestlands;</p><p class="depth0">f. Wetland inventory;</p><p class="depth0">g. Floodplain inventory as issued by the Federal Emergency Management Administration;</p><p class="depth0">h. Endangered Species and Critical Habitats as listed or proposed for listing by the Department of Commerce (DOC) and DOI;</p><p class="depth0">i. Sole source aquifer recharge areas as designated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA);</p><p class="depth0">j. Air Quality Control Regions as designated by EPA;</p><p class="depth0">k. National Registry of Natural Landmarks at published by DOI;</p><p class="depth0">l. Coastal Barrier Resources System;</p><p class="depth0">m. State inventories or planning documents identifying important land uses, particularly those not covered by the above items, such as wildlife refuges, important habitats, and areas of high water quality, or scenic or recreational value;</p><p class="depth0">n. Agricultural districts or other similar zoning classifications for agricultural land protection; and</p><p class="depth0">o. Coastal Zone Management Areas.</p><p class="depth0">6. The Administrator shall be responsible for assisting State Directors in obtaining listings and inventories of resources protected by Federal statutes and regulations. The State Director has the responsibility for assembling documents on important environmental resources or areas identified in State and substate laws, regulations, plans, and policies.</p><p class="depth0">7. Development of the inventory by the State Director will require consultation and assistance from a variety of agencies and experts. This consultation should begin with Department agencies and be accomplished through appropriate, State-level USDA committees. The objective should be to determine the land classification data that has been compiled and that which is in the process of being compiled either by USDA agencies or their counterparts at the state level. The Memorandum of Understanding executed in May 1979 between the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 should be utilized as the basis for seeking SCS's assistance in this data collection effort. (See FmHA Instruction 2000-D, exhibit A, which is available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Office.) Direct contacts should then be made with State agencies, in particular with the appropriate office of State planning, to determine the availability of State inventories and State land use policies and priorities. Similar discussions should be held with substate regional planning agencies and clearinghouses with assistance being provided in this effort by District Directors. County Supervisors shall contact local officials and shall be responsible for being familiar with and for assembling similar inventories, land use policies, or protective requirements developed by the local government agencies

within the supervisor's territorial jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0">8. Another important element of the natural resource management guide shall be the examination of any major environmental impacts on the State or a substate area resulting from the cumulative effects of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354-assisted project over the last several years. In this examination, particular emphasis should be given to the cumulative impacts of water resource projects such as irrigation systems. This should be done in consultation with experts within the appropriate State agencies and the U.S. Geological Survey. The housing programs should also be given a particular emphasis with respect to their cumulative impacts. More detailed guidance on the accomplishment of this cumulative impact section of the natural resource management guide, as well as the overall content of the guide, shall be provided by the Administrator. In preparing the State's natural resource management guide and in assembling inventories of critical resources, Agency staff should not lose sight of the basic purposes of this effort. The development of lengthy and complex guides and the amassing of huge inventories is not our goal. In the end, the material must be useable and serve as a tool for better decisionmaking. The basic purposes of this guide and inventory, then, are to provide a basis for developing comprehensive, statewide, rural development investment strategies that (i) do not conflict with Federal, State, and local mandates to preserve and protect important land and environmental resources, (ii) that do not create short- or long-term development pressures which would lead to the unnecessary conversion of these resources, and (iii) which effectively support and enhance Federal, State, and local plans to preserve these resources.


Sec. Exhibit C to Subpart G of Part 1940--Implementation Procedures for</p><p class="depth0">the Farmland Protection Policy Act; Executive Order 11988, Floodplain</p><p class="depth0">Management; Executive Order 11990, Protection of Wetlands; and</p><p class="depth0">Departmental Regulation 9500-3, Land Use Policy</p><p class="depth0">1. Background. The Subtitle I of the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981, Pub. L. 97-98, created the Farmland Protection Policy Act. The Act requires the consideration of alternatives when an applicant's proposal would result in the conversion of important farmland to nonagricultural uses. The Act also requires that Federal programs, to the extent practicable, be compatible with State, local government, and private programs and policies to protect farmland. The Soil Conservation Service (SCS), as required by the Act, has promulgated implementation procedures for the Act at 7 CFR part 658 which are hereafter referred to as the SCS rule. This rule applies to all federal agencies. The Departmental Regulation 9500-3, Land Use Policy (the Departmental Regulation), also requires the consideration of alternatives but is much broader than the Act in that it addresses the conversion of land resources other than farmland. The Departmental Regulation is included as exhibit A to this subpart and affects only USDA agencies. For additional requirements that apply to some Farmer Program loans and guarantees and loans to an Indian Tribe or Tribal Corporation and that cover the conservation of wetlands and highly erodible land, see exhibit M of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">2. Implementation. Each proposed lease or disposal of real property by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and application for financial assistance or subdivision approval will be reviewed to determine if it would result in the conversion of a land resource addressed in the Act, Executive Orders, or Departmental Regulation and as further specified below. Those actions that are determined to result in the lease, disposal or financing of an existing farm, residential, commercial or industrial property with no reasonably foreseeable change in land use and those actions that solely involve the renovation of existing structures or facilities would require no further review. \1\ Since these actions have no potential to convert land uses, this finding would simply be made by the preparer in completing the environmental assessment for the action. Also, actions that convert important farmland through the construction of on-farm structures necessary for farm operations are exempt from the farmland protection provisions of this exhibit. For other actions, the following implementation steps must be taken:---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ See special procedures in item 3 of this exhibit if the existing structure or real property is located in a floodplain or wetland.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">a. Determine whether important land resources are involved. The Act comes into play whenever there is a potential to affect important farmland. The Departmental Regulation covers important farmland as well as the following land resources: prime forest land, prime rangeland, wetlands and floodplains. Hereafter, these land resources are referred to collectively as important land resources. Definitions for these land resources are contained in the appendix to the Departmental Regulation. The SCS rule also defines important farmland for purposes of the Act. Since the SCS's definition of prime farmland differs from the Departmental Regulation's definition, both definitions must be

used and if either or both apply, the provisions of this exhibit must be implemented. It is important to note the definition of important farmland in both the SCS rule and the Departmental Regulation because it includes not only prime and unique farmland but additional farmland that has been designated by a unit of State or local government to be of statewide or local importance and such designation has been concurred in by the Secretary acting through SCS. In completing the environmental assessment or Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1940-22, ``Environmental Checklist For Categorical Exclusions,'' the preparer must determine if the project is either located in or will affect one or more of the land resources covered by the SCS rule or the Departmental Regulation. Methods for determining the location of important land resources on a project-by-project basis are discussed immediately below. As reflected several times in this discussion, SCS personnel can be of great assistance in making agricultural land and natural resource evaluation, particularly when there is no readily available documentation of important land resources within the project's area of environmental impact. It should be remembered that FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and SCS have executed a Memorandum of Understanding in order to facilitate site review assistance. (See FmHA Instruction 2000-D, exhibit A, available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Important Farmland, Prime Forest Land, Prime Rangeland--The preparer of the environmental review document will review available SCS important farmland maps to determine if the general area within which the project is located contains important farmland. Because of the large scale of the important farmland maps, the maps should be used for general review purposes only and not to determine if sites of 40 acres or less contain important farmland. If the general area contains important farmland or if no important farmland map exists for the project area, the preparer of the environmental review will request SCS's opinion on the presence of important farmland by completing Form AD-1006, ``Farmland Conversion Impact Rating,'' according to its instructions, and transmitting it to the SCS local field office having jurisdiction over the project area. This request will also indicate that SCS's opinion is needed regarding the application to the project site of both definitions of prime farmland, the one contained within its rule and the one contained within the Departmental Regulation. SCS's opinion is controlling with respect to the former definition and advisory with respect to the latter. No request need be sent to SCS for an action meeting one of the exemptions contained in item number 2 of this exhibit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Floodplain--Review the most current Flood Insurance Rate Map or Flood Insurance Study issued for the project area by the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA). Information on the most current map available or how to obtain a map free of charge is available by calling FEMA's toll free number 800-638-6620. When more specific information is needed on the location of a floodplain, for example, the project site may be near the boundary of a floodplain; or for assistance in analyzing floodplain impacts, it is often helpful to contact FEMA's regional office staff. Exhibit J of this subpart contains a listing of these regional offices and the appropriate telephone numbers.</p><p class="depth0">If a FEMA floodplain map has not been prepared for a project area, detailed assistance is normally available from the following agencies: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), SCS, Corps of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), or appropriate regional or State agencies established for flood prevention purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Wetlands--FWS is presently preparing wetland maps for the nation. Each FWS regional office has a staff member called a Wetland Coordinator. These individuals can provide updated information concerning the status of wetland mapping by FWS and information on State and local wetland surveys. Exhibit K of this subpart contains a listing of Wetland Coordinators arranged by FWS regional office and geographical area of jurisdiction. If the proposed project area has not been inventoried, information can be obtained by using topographic and soils maps or aerial photographs. State-specific lists of wetland soils and wetland vegetation are also available from the FWS Regional Wetland coordinators. A site visit can disclose evidence of vegetation typically associated with wetland areas. Also, the assistance of FWS field staff in reviewing the site can often be the most effective means. Because of the unique wetland definition used in exhibit M of this subpart, SCS wetland determinations are required for implementing the wetland conservation requirements of that exhibit.</p><p class="depth0">b. Findings (1) Scope--Although information on the location and the classification of important land resources should be gathered from appropriate expert sources, as well as their views on possible ways to avoid or reduce the adverse effects of a proposed conversion, it must be remembered that it is FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's responsibility to weigh and judge the feasibility of alternatives and to determine whether any proposed land use change is in accordance with the implementation requirements of the Act and the Departmental Regulation. Consequently, after

reviewing as necessary, the project site, applicable land classification data, or the results of consultations with appropriate expert agenices, the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 preparer must determine, as the second implementation step, whether the applicant's proposal:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Is compatible with State, unit or local government, and private programs and policies to protect farmland; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Either will have no effect on important land resources; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If there will be a direct or indirect conversion of such a resource, (i) whether practicable alternatives exist to avoid the conversion; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If there are no alternatives, whether there are practicable measures to reduce the amount of the conversion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determination of No Effect-- If the preparer determines that there is no potential for conversion and that the proposal is compatible, this determination must be so documented in the environmental assessment for a Class II action or the appropriate compliance blocks checked in the Class I assessment or Checklist for Categorical Exclusions based on whichever document is applicable to the action being reviewed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Determination of Effect or Incompatibility-- Whenever the preparer determines that an applicant's proposal may result in the direct or indirect conversion of an important land resource or may be incompatible with State, unit of local government, or private programs and policies to protect farmland, the following further steps must be taken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Search for Practicable Alternatives \2\--In consultation with the applicant and the interested public, the preparer will carefully analyze the availability of practicable alternatives that avoid the conversion or incompatibility Possible alternatives include:---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ When the action involves the disposal of real property determined not suitable for disposition to persons eligible for FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's financial assistance programs, the consideration of alternatives is limited to those that would result in the best price.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The selection of an alternative site;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The selection of an alternative means to meet the applicant's objectives; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The denial of the application, i.e., the no-action alternative.</p><p class="depth0">When the resource that may be converted is important farmland, the preparer will follow the Land Evaluation and Site Assessment (LESA) point system contained within the SCS rule in order to evaluate the feasibility of alternatives. When the proposed site receives a total score of less than 160 points, no additional sites need to be evaluated. Rather than use the SCS LESA point system, the State Director has the authority to use State or local LESA systems that have been approved by the governing body of such jurisdiction and the SCS state conservationist. After this authority is exercised, it must be used for all applicable FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 actions within the jurisdiction of that approved LESA system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Inform the Public--The Department Regulation requires us in section 6, Responsibilities, to notify the affected landholders at the earliest time practicable of the proposed action and to provide them an opportunity to review the elements of the action and to comment on the action's feasibility and alternatives to it. This notification requirement only applies to Class I and Class II actions and not to categorical exclusions that lose their status as an exclusion for any of the reasons stated in Sec. 1940.317(e) of this subpart. The notification will be published and documented in the manner specified in Sec. 1940.331 of this subpart and will contain the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A brief description of the application or proposal and its location;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The type(s) and amount of important land resources to be affected;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A statement that the application or proposal is available for review at an FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 field office (specify the one having jurisdiction over the project area); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A statement that any person interested in commenting on the application or proposal's feasibility and alternatives to it may do so by providing such comments to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 within 30 days following the date of publication. (Specify the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office processing the application or proposal for receipt of comments.)</p><p class="depth0">Further consideration of the application or proposal must be delayed until expiration of the public comment period. Consequently, publication of the notice as early as possible in the review process is both in the public's and the applicant's interest. Any comments received must be considered and addressed in the subsequent Agency analysis of alternatives and mitigation measures. It should be understood that scheduling a public information meeting is not required but may be helpful based on the number of comments received and types of issues raised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Determine Whether Practicable Alternative Exists--(i) Alternative exists--If the preparer concludes that a practicable alternative exists, the preparer will complete step 2b(3)(e)(ii) of this exhibit and transmit the assessment for the approving official's review in the manner specified in Sec. 1940.316 of this subpart. If the findings of this review are similar to the preparer's recommendation, FmHA or its successor agency under

Public Law 103-354 will inform the applicant of such findings and processing of the application will be discontinued. Should the applicant still desire to pursue the proposal, the applicant is certainly free to do so but not with the further assistance of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. Should the applicant be interested in amending the application to reflect the results of the alternative analysis, the preparer will work closely with the applicant to this end. Upon receipt of the amended application, the preparer must reinstitute this implementation process at that point which avoids the duplication of analysis and data collection undertaken in the original review process.</p><p class="depth0">If the results of the approving official(s) review differs from the preparer's recommendations, the former will ensure that the findings are appropriately documented in step 2b(3)(e)(ii) of this exhibit and any remaining consideration given to mitigation measures, step 2b(3)(d) of this exhibit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> No Practicable Alternative Exists--On the other hand, if the preparer concludes that there is no practicable alternative to the conversion, the preparer must then continue with step 2b(3)(d) of this exhibit, immediately below.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Search for Mitigation Measures-- Once the preparer determines that there is no practicable alternative to avoiding the conversion or incompatibility, including the no-action alternative, all practicable measures for reducing the direct and indirect amount of the conversion must be included in the application. Some examples of mitigation measures would include reducing the size of the project which thereby reduces the amount of the important land resource to be converted. This is a particularly effective mitigation measure when the resource is present in a small area, as is often the case with wetlands or floodplains. A corresponding method of mitigation would be to maintain the project size or number of units but decrease the amount of land affected by increasing the density of use. Finally, mitigation can go as far as the selection of an alternative site. For example, in a housing market area composed almost entirely of important farmland, any new proposed subdivision site would result in conversion. However, a proposed site within or contiguous to an existing community has much less conversion potential, especially indirect potential, than a site a mile or two from the community. The LESA system can also be used to identify mitigation measures when the conversion of important farmland cannot be avoided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Document Findings-- Upon completion of the above steps, a written summary of the steps taken and the reasons for the recommendations reached shall be included in the environmental assessment along with either one of the following recommendations as applicable. The following example assumes that important farmland is the affected resource and that the inappropriate phrase within the brackets would be deleted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The application would result in the direct or indirect conversion of important farmland and (is/is not) compatible with State, unit of local government, or private programs and policies to protect farmland. It is recommended that FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 determine, based upon the attached analysis, that there is no practicable alternative to this and that the application contains all practicable measures for reducing the amount of conversion (or limiting the extent of any identified incompatibility.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The application would result in direct or indirect conversion of important farmland and (is/is not) incompatible with State, unit of local government, or private programs and policies to protect farmland. It is recommended that FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 determine, based upon the attached analysis, that there is a practicable alternative to this action, and the processing of this application be discontinued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Implement findings--The completed environmental assessment and the Agency's determination of compliance with the Act, the Departmental Regulation and Executive orders will be processed and made according to Sec. 1940.316 of this subpart. Whenever this determination is as stated in step 2b(3)(e)(i) above, the action will be so structured as to ensure that any recommended mitigation measures are accomplished. See Sec. 1940.318(g) of this subpart. Whenever the determination is as stated in step 2b(3)(e)(ii) above, the applicant shall be so informed and processing of the application discontinued. Any further FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 involvement will be as specified in Item 2b(3)(c)(i) of this exhibit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Geographical Area--The geographical area that must be considered when a floodplain is affected varies with the type of action under consideration. Normally the implementation procedures beginning in Item 2a of this exhibit are required when the action will impact, directly or indirectly, the 100-year floodplain. However, when the action is determined by the preparer to be a critical action, the minimum floodplain of concern is the 500-year floodplain. A critical action is an action which, if located or carried out within a floodplain, poses a greater than normal risk for flood-caused loss of life or property. Critical actions include but are not limited to actions which create or extend the useful life of the following facilities:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Those facilities which produce, use, or store highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic or water-reactive materials;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Schools, hospitals, and nursing homes which are likely to contain occupants who may not be sufficiently mobile to avoid the loss of life or injury during flood and storm events;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Emergency operation centers or data storage centers which contain records or services that any become lost or inoperative during flood and storm events; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Multi-family housing facilities designed primarily (over 50 percent) for handicapped individuals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Threshold of Impact--The Executive orders differ from the Act and the Departmental Regulation in that the Executive orders' requirements apply not only to the conversion of floodplains or wetlands but to any impacts upon them. Impacts are defined as changes in the natural values and functions of a wetland or floodplain. Therefore, there would be an impact to a floodplain whenever either (a) the action or its related activities would be located within a floodplain, or (b) the action through its indirect impacts has the potential to result in development within a floodplain. The only exception to this statement is when the preparer determines that the locational impact is minor to the extent that the floodplain's or wetland's natural values and functions are not affected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Non-FmHA or its Successor Agency under Public Law 103-354-Owned Properties--The Executive orders can apply to actions that are already located in floodplains or wetlands; that is, where the conversion has already occurred. The implementation procedures beginning in item 2a of this exhibit must be accomplished for any action located in a floodplain or wetland and involving either (a) the purchase of an existing structure or facility or (b) the rehabilitation, renovation, or adaptive reuse of an existing structure or facility when the work to be done amounts to a substantial improvement. A substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either (a) before the improvement or repair is started, or (b) if the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred. The term does not include (a) any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing State or local health sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions or (b) any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> FmHA or its Successor Agency under Public Law 103-354-Owned Real Property--The requirement in paragraph 3 b (1) immediately above also applies to any substantial improvements made to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354-owned real property with the exception of the public notice requirements of this exhibit. Irrespective of any improvements, whenever FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 real property located in a floodplain or wetland is proposed for lease or sale, the official responsible for the conveyance must determine if the property can be safely used. If not, the property should not be sold or leased. Otherwise, the conveyance must specify those uses that are restricted under identified Federal, State, and local floodplains or wetlands regulations as well as other appropriate restrictions, as determined by the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 official responsible for the conveyance, to the uses of the property by the leasee or purchaser and any successors, except where prohibited by law. Appropriate restrictions will be developed in consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) as specified in the Memorandum of Understanding with FWS contained in subpart LL of part 2000 of this chapter. Applicable restrictions will be incorporated into quitclaim deeds with the consent and approval of the Regional Attorney, Office of the General Counsel. Upon application by the owner of any property so affected and upon determination by the appropriate FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 official that the condition for which a deed restriction was imposed no longer exists, the restriction clause may be released. A listing of any restrictions shall be included in any notices announcing the proposed sale or lease of the property. At the time of first inquiry, prospective purchasers must be informed of the property's location in a floodplain or wetland and the use restrictions that will apply. A written notification to this effect must be provided to the prospective purchaser who must acknowledge the receipt of the notice. See Item 3 d of this exhibit and subpart C of part 1955 of this chapter for guidance on the proper formats to be used with respect to notices and deed restrictions. The steps and analysis conducted to comply with the requirements of this paragraph must be documented in the environmental review document for the proposed lease or sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Alternative Sites--As with the Act and the Departmental Regulation, the main focus of the review process must be to locate an alternative that avoids the impact to a floodplain or wetland. When this is not practicable, mitigation measures must be developed to reduce the impact which in the case of a floodplain or wetland can include finding another site, i.e., a safer site. The latter would be a site at a higher elevation within the floodplain and/or exposed to lower velocity floodflows.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Nonstructural Mitigation Measures--Mitigation measures under the Executive orders are intended to serve the following three purposes: reduce the risks to human safety, reduce the possible damage to structures, and reduce the disruption to the natural values and functions of floodplains and wetlands. More traditional structural measures, such as filling in the floodplain, cannot accomplish these three purposes and, in fact, conflict with the third purpose. Nonstructural flood protection methods, consequently, must be given priority consideration. These methods are intended to preserve, restore, or imitate natural hydrologic conditions and, thereby, eliminate or reduce the need for structural alteration of water bodies or their associated floodplains and wetlands. Such methods may be either physical or managerial in character. Nonstructural flood protection methods are measures which:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Control the uses and occupancy of floodplains and wetlands, e.g., floodplain zoning and subdivision regulations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Preserve floodplain and wetland values and functions through public ownership; e.g., fee title, easements and development rights;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Delay or reduce the amount of runoff from paved surfaces and roofed structures discharged into a floodway, e.g., construction of detention basins and use of flow restricting barriers on roofs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Maintain natural rates of infiltration in developed or developing areas, e.g., construction of seepage or recharge basins and minimization of paved areas;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Protect streambanks and shorelines with vegetative and other natural cover, e.g., use of aquatic and water-loving woody plants;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Restore and preserve floodplain and wetland values and functions and protect life and property through regulation, e.g., flood-proofing building codes which require all structures and installations to be elevated on stilts above the level of the base flood; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Control soil erosion and sedimentation, e.g., construction of sediment basins, stabilization of exposed soils with sod and minimization of exposed soil.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Avoid Filling in Floodplains--As indicated above, the Executive orders place a major emphasis on not filling in floodplains in order to protect their natural values and functions. Executive Order 11988 states ``agencies shall, wherever practicable, elevate structures above the base flood level rather than filling in the land.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Additional Notification Requirement. (1) Final Notice--Where it is not possible to avoid an impact to a floodplain or wetland and after all practicable mitigation measures have been identified and agreed to by the prospective applicant, a final notice of the proposed action must be published. This notice will either be part of the notice required for the completion of a Class II assessment or a separate notice if a Class I assessment or an EIS has been completed for the action. The notice will be published and distributed in the manner specified in Sec. 1940.331 of this subpart and contain the following information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A description of the proposd action, its location, and the surrounding area;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A description of the floodplain or wetland impacts and the mechanisms to be used to mitigate them;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A statement of why the proposed action must be located in a floodplain or a wetland;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> A description of all significant facts considered in making this determination;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> A statement indicating whether the actions conform to applicable State or local floodplain protection standards; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> A statement listing other involved agencies and individuals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Private Party Notification--For all actions to be located in floodplains or wetlands in which a private party is participating as an applicant, purchaser, or financier, it shall be the responsibility of the approving official to inform in writing all such parties of the hazards associated with such locations.</p><p class="depth0">4. The Relationship of the Executive Orders to the National Flood Insurance Program. The National Flood Insurance Program establishes the floodplain management criteria for participating communities as well as the performance standards for building in floodplains so that the structure is protected against flood risks. As such, flood insurance should be viewed only as a financial mitigation measure that must be utilized only after FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 determines that there is no practicable alternative for avoiding construction in the floodplain and that all practicable mitigation measures have been included in the proposal. That is, for a proposal to be located in the floodplain, it is not sufficient simply to require insurance. The Agency's flood insurance requirements are explained in subpart B of part 1806 of this chapter (FmHA Instruction 426.2). It should be understood that an applicant proposing to build in the floodplain is not even eligible for FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 financial assistance unless the project area is participating in the National Flood Insurance Program.

Sec. Exhibit D to Subpart G of Part 1940--Implementation Procedures for</p><p class="depth0">the Endangered Species Act</p><p class="depth0">1. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall implement the consultation procedures required under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act as specified

in 50 CFR 402. It is important to note that these consultation procedures apply to the disposal of real property by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and to all FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 applications for financial assistance and subdivision approval, including those applications which are exempt from environmental assessments. (See Sec. 1940.310.) Unless repeated in this paragraph, the definitions for the terms utilized are found in 50 CFR 402.02.</p><p class="depth0">2. State Directors shall ensure that State, District, and County Offices maintain current publications of listed and proposed species as well as critical habitats found in their respective jurisdictions.</p><p class="depth0">3. When an application to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 involves financial assistance or permit approval from another Federal agency(s), the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 reviewer shall work with the other Agency to determine a lead Agency for the consultation process. When FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 is not the lead Agency, the reviewer shall ensure that the lead Agency informs the approporiate Area Manager, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), or Regional Director, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's involvement.</p><p class="depth0">4. Each disposal action, application for financial assistance or subdivision approval shall be reviewed by the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 official responsible for completing environmental assessments in order to determine if the proposal either may affect a listed species or critical habitat or is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of a proposed critical habitat.</p><p class="depth0">a. For applications subject to environmental assessments, this review shall be accomplished as part of the assessment.</p><p class="depth0">b. For those applications that are excluded from an environmental assessment, this review shall be documented as part of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1940-22, ``Environmental Checklist For Categorical Exclusions,'' and shall be accomplished as early as possible after receipt of the application and prior to approval of the application.</p><p class="depth0">c. For applications subject to an environmental impact statement, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall request from the Area Manager, FWS, and the Regional Director, NMFS, a list of the proposed and listed species that may be in the area of the proposal. Within 30 days, the FWS and NMFS will respond to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 with this list. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall then conduct, as part of the process of preparing the draft environmental impact statement, a biological assessment of these species to determine which species are in the area of the proposal and how they may be affected. This biological assessment should be completed within 180 days or a time mutually agreed upon between FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and FWS or NMFS. Upon completion of the biological assessment, if FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 determines either that the proposal may affect a listed species or critical habitat or is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of proposed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat, the formal consultation procedures shall be initiated as specified in paragraph 7b below. To the extent practical, these procedures shall be concluded and their results reflected in the draft EIS. For all draft EISs in which FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 determines there will be no effect upon a listed or proposed species or critical habitat and FWS or NMFS indicated the presence of such species upon the initial inquiry, a copy of the draft shall be provided to that agency for review and comment.</p><p class="depth0">5. As indicated in paragraph 4 above, the focus of this review process is to determine if the proposal will affect a listed species or critical habitat or is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of a proposed critical habitat. Because this impact terminology is specific to the Act, it is important to understand its meaning.</p><p class="depth0">a. To jeopardize the continued existence of a species means to engage in a project which reasonably would be expected to reduce the reproduction, numbers, or distribution of a listed species to such an extent as to appreciably reduce the likelihood of the survival and recovery of that species in the wild. The level of reduction necessary to constitute jeopardy would be expected to vary among listed species.</p><p class="depth0">b. The destruction or adverse modification of a critical habitat means a direct or indirect alteration of critical habitat which appreciably diminishes the value of that habitat for survival and recovery of a listed species. Such alterations include but are not limited to those diminishing the following requirements for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Space for individual and population growth and for normal behavior;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Food, water, air, light, minerals, or other nutritional or physiological requirements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Cover or shelter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Sites for breeding, reproduction, or rearing of offspring; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Habitats that are protected from disturbances or are representative of the geographical distribution of listed species.</p><p class="depth0">6. It is also important to note that the consultation procedures differ when the subject of the consultation is a listed species or critical habitat as opposed to a proposed species or critical habitat. The latter are defined as those that the Secretary of Interior or Commerce are considering for listing and have so proposed through notification in the Federal Register. When listed species or critical habitats are invloved, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall initiate formal consultation procedures whenever it determines that a proposed project may affect them, either beneficially or adversely. For proposed species or critical habitats, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall first determine if the proposed project is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of proposed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. Whenever this determination is made, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall confer with the appropriate agency identified in paragraph 7 of this exhibit and, in so doing, shall focus on (i) determining the status of the listing process, and (ii) attempting to cooperatively develop alternatives or measures for inclusion in the project that avoid or mitigate the identified adverse impacts. The results of this process shall be documented in the environmental review being done for the proposed project and, if this review is an environmental assessment, shall be an important factor in determining the need for an environmental impact statement. No action shall be taken by the approving official on the application unitl the requirement to confer on proposed species or critical habitat has been completed. Paragraphs 7 through 9 of this exhibit outline the formal consultation procedure for listed species or critical habitats.</p><p class="depth0">7. In initiating the review process for a project, the list of species and critical habitats, including proposed, shall be examined to determine the potential for impacts. Projects planned within established communities are less likely to affect listed or proposed species or their critical habitat. Projects to be located in remote areas, heavily forested areas and/or previously undisturbed areas are more likely to affect these species. For projects located in such areas, the reviewer shall, at a minimum, discuss the project's potential impact on listed or proposed species with officials of the appropriate State wildlife protection agency or the Area Manager, FWS, or the Regional Director, NMFS, as appropriate. The latter organization generally has responsibility for marine species. The specific list of species under NMFS's jurisdiction can be found at 50 CFR 222.23(a) and 227.4. Such discussions shall be considered as informal consultations and are not a substitute for the required consultation process outlined below.</p><p class="depth0">a. Whenever the reviewer, after reviewing the list and contacting appropriate experts, formally determines that the proposal will have no effect on a listed or proposed species or its critical habitat, these review procedures are completed, unless new information comes to light as discussed in paragraph 9 of this exhibit, or consultation is requested by the appropriate Area Manager, FWS, or Regional Director, NMFS.</p><p class="depth0">b. If the reviewer determines there may be an effect on a listed species or a critical habitat or is unable to make a clear determination, the reviewer shall so inform the SEC (assuming the reviewer is not the SEC). The latter shall either (i) convey a written request for consultation, along with available information to the appropriate Area Manager, FWS or Regional Director, NMFS, for the Federal region where the proposal will be carried out, or (ii) request Program Support Staff (PSS) to perform such consultation. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall initiate this formal consultation process and not the applicant. See paragraph 4.c. of this exhibit for initiating consultation where an environmental impact statement is being done for the application. Until the consultation process is completed, as outlined in 50 CFR 402.04, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall not approve the application. Should the need for consultation be identified after application approval, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall refrain from making any irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources which would foreclose the consideration of modifications or alternatives to the identified activity or program.</p><p class="depth0">8. Several possible responses may result from initiation of the formal consultation process with each requiring further specific actions.</p><p class="depth0">a. Whenever the Area Manager, FWS, or Regional Director, NMFS, informs FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 that insufficient information exists to conclude the consultation process, the SEC with assistance as feasible from the FWS or NMFS and State sources of expertise shall then obtain additional information and conduct, as needed, biological surveys or studies to determine how the proposal may affect listed species or their critical habitat. The cost and performance of such studies shall be handled in the same manner as in the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement. (See Sec. 1940.336 of this subpart.)</p><p class="depth0">b. Whenever the Area Manager, FWS, or Regional Director, NMFS, responds that the proposal will either promote the conservation of a listed species or is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed

or proposed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of its critical habitat, the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 reviewer shall formally make a similar determination, attaching the response as documentation. This concludes the formal consultation process unless new information comes to light as discussed in paragraph 9 of this exhibit.</p><p class="depth0">c. Whenever the results of the consultation process include recommendations by the Area Manager, FWS, or Regional Director, NMFS, for modifications to the project which would enhance the conservation and protection of a listed species or its critical habitat, the State Director shall review these recommendations and require that they be incorporated into the project as either design changes or special conditions to the offer of assistance. If the State Director does not believe the recommendations can be so adopted, the Administrator shall be requested to review the recommendations and to assist in the further resolution of the matter.</p><p class="depth0">d. Whenever the appropriate Area Manager, FWS, or Regional Director, NMFS, determines that the proposal is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of its critical habitat, the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 applicant shall be so informed and the project denied on this basis. However, if the State Director believes that funding or approval of the application is (i) of national, regional, or great local significance, and (ii) that there are no reasonable and prudent alternatives to avoiding the listed species impact, the State Director can request the Administrator, through PSS, to review the proposal and the results of the consultation process. Based upon this review, the Administrator shall either inform the State Director that a request for an exemption from section 7 of the Endangered Species Act is not warranted and the application shall be denied or, if the Administrator believes it is warranted, shall request an exemption from the Endangered Species Committee established by section 7(e) of the Act. No action shall be taken by the State Director on the application until the Administrator informs the State Director of the results of the exemption request.</p><p class="depth0">9. Once completed, the consultation process shall be reinitiated by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 or upon request of the appropriate Area Manager, FWS, or Regional Director, NMFS, if:</p><p class="depth0">a. New information or modification of the proposal reveals impacts that may affect listed or proposed species or their habitats; or</p><p class="depth0">b. A new species is listed that may be affected by the proposal.</p><p class="depth0">10. In completing the above compliance procedures, particularly when consulting with the referenced agencies, formally or informally, the preparer of the environmental review document will request information on whether any Category I or Category II species may be present within the project area. These are candidate species; they are presently under consideration for listing under section 4 of the Endangered Species Act. Category I species are those for which FWS currently has substantial date on hand to support the biological appropriateness of proposing to list the species as endangered or threatened. Currently data are being gathered concerning essential habitat needs and, for some species, data concerning the precise boundaries of critical habitat designations. Development and publication of proposed rules on such species is anticipated. Category II comprises species for which information now in the possession of the FWS indicates that proposing to list the species as endangered or threatened is possibly appropriate but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threat(s) are not currently available to presently support proposed rules. Whenever a Category I or II species may be affected, the preparer of the environmental review document will determine if the proposed project is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the species. Whenever this determination is made, the same compliance procedures specified in paragraph 6 of this exhibit for a proposed species will be followed. The purpose of the requirements of this paragraph is to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act as well as Departmental Regulation 9500-4, Fish and Wildlife Policy, which specifies that USDA agencies will avoid actions which may cause a species to become threatened or endangered.

Sec. Exhibit E to Subpart G of Part 1940--Implementation Procedures for</p><p class="depth0">the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act</p><p class="depth0">1. Each application for financial assistance or subdivision approval as well as the proposed disposal of real property by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall be reviewed to determine if it will affect a river or portion of it which is either included in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, designated for potential addition to the system, or identified in the Nationwide Inventory prepared by the National Park Service (NPS) in the Department of the Interior. The Nationwide Inventory identifies those river segments that, after preliminary review, appear to qualify for inclusion in the system. (For purposes of this subpart, river segments in the Nationwide Inventory

shall be treated the same as segments within the system with the exception of paragraph 8.) For applications subject to environmental assessments, the review shall be accomplished as part of the assessment. For applications that are excluded from an environmental assessment, this review shall be documented as part of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1940-22, ``Environmental Checklist For Categorical Exclusions,'' within the reviewing office and shall be accomplished as early as possible after receipt of the application and prior to approval of the application. The FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 official responsible for completing the environmental assessment shall accomplish this review. (See Sec. 1940.316 of this subpart.)</p><p class="depth0">2. In order to effectively implement this review, State Directors shall ensure that State, District and County Offices maintain current listings of rivers within their respective States that are included in or designated for potential addition to the system as well as those identified in the Nationwide Inventory prepared by NPS.</p><p class="depth0">3. For applications for water resources projects, as defined in Sec. 1940.302(i) of this subpart, the purpose of this review shall be to determine whether the proposal would have a direct and adverse effect on the values which served as the basis for the river's inclusion in the system or designation for potential addition. For other applications, the purpose of the review shall be to determine if the proposal would invade the river area or unreasonably diminish the scenic, recreational, and fish and wildlife values present in the area. To make these determinations, the reviewer shall consult with the appropriate regional office of NPS if the proposal (i) would be located within one-quarter mile of the banks of the river, (ii) involves withdrawing water from the river or discharging water to the river via a point source, or (iii) would be visible from the river. The appropriate regional office of the Forest Service (FS) shall be contacted under similar circumstances when the effected river is on FS lands. Consultation shall be initiated by a written request for comments on the potential impacts accompanied by a description of the project and its location. The reviewer shall consult in other instances when the likelihood of an impact on a river in the system is identified as part of the environmental review. When the reviewer determines there is no potential impact on such a river, the documentation of this determination concludes the review process, unless reinitiation is required under paragraph 10 of this exhibit. In all other cases, the review is completed as specified below in paragraphs 4 through 9 of this exhibit.</p><p class="depth0">4. If the review is at the County or District Office level, the reviewer can request the State Director (see Sec. 1940.307 of this subpart) to perform the above consultation. The State Director can in turn make a similar request of the National Office. If not requested to perform the consultation for applications approvable at the County and District Office levels, the SEC shall be informed whenever NPS or FS advises that there is a potential for an adverse impact on a river within the system or that protective measures need to be included or designed into the proposal. In all cases, consultation shall be initiated by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and not the applicant. Until consultation is complete, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall not approve the application. Should the need for consultation be identified after application approval, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall, if still within its power at the time of identification, refrain from making any irreversible or irretrievable commitments of resources which would foreclose the consideration of modifications or alternatives to the project.</p><p class="depth0">5. If NPS or FS advises there is no potential for an adverse effect as described in paragraph 3 of this exhibit, this review process is concluded, unless the need to reinitiate arises. (See paragraph 10 of this exhibit.)</p><p class="depth0">6. Whenever the results of the consultation process include recommendations by NPS or FS to modify the proposal in order to avoid an adverse effect, as described in paragraph 3 above, the State Director shall review these recommendations and require that they be incorporated into the project as either design changes or special conditions to the offer of assistance. If the State Director does not believe that the Regional Director's recommendations can be so adopted, the Administrator shall be requested to review the recommendations and to assist in the further resolution of the matter.</p><p class="depth0">7. If NPS or FS advises that the proposal will have an unavoidable adverse effect, as described in paragraph 3 of this exhibit, on a river segment which is either included in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System or designated for potential addition to the system, the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 applicant will be informed by the reviewing office and the application denied on this basis. However, if the State Director disagrees with this determination, the State Director can request the Administrator to review the proposal and attempt to further resolve the matter. The specific reasons for disagreement along with supporting documentation must be included in such a request. Based upon a review of this request, the Administrator shall either inform the State Director that no further consultation is warranted and the application shall be denied or shall request the headquarters staff of NPS or FS to further review the matter. No action shall be taken

by the State Director on the application until the Administrator informs the State Director of the results of this further review and consultation.</p><p class="depth0">8. If NPS or FS advises that the proposal will have an adverse effect, as described in paragraph 3 of this exhibit, on a river segment identified in the Nationwide Inventory, the reviewer shall further consult with NPS or FS in order to formulate adequate measures or modification to avoid or mitigate the potential adverse effect. The purposes of such measures or modifications is to ensure that the proposal does not effectively foreclose the designation of a wild, scenic, or recreational river segment. Once concurrence is reached and documented with NPS or FS regarding modifications, the State Director shall require that they be incorporated into the proposal as either design changes or special conditions to the offer of assistance. If the State Director is not able to reach an agreement with NPS or FS on appropriate modifications, the Administrator shall be requested to assist in the further resolution of the matter.</p><p class="depth0">9. If an application involves financial assistance or permit approval from another Federal Agency, the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 reviewer shall work with the other agency(s) to determine a lead Agency for the consultation process. When FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 is not the lead Agency, the reviewer shall ensure that the lead Agency informs NPS or FS of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's involvement.</p><p class="depth0">10. Once completed, the consultation process shall be reinitiated by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 if new information or modification of the proposal reveals impacts to a river within the System or Nationwide Inventory.


Sec. Exhibit F to Subpart G of Part 1940--Implementation Procedures for</p><p class="depth0">the Coastal Barrier Resources Act</p><p class="depth0">1. The Act applies to barrier islands that Congress has designated for inclusion in the Coastal Barrier Resources System. Since coastal barriers are only found in East and Gulf Coast States, no other State Offices fall under the requirements of the Act and, therefore, need be concerned with these implementation procedures.</p><p class="depth0">2. On coastal barriers that are included in the system, the Act prohibits any new expenditures or new financial assistance by the Federal Government. There are some limited exceptions that are contained in Section 6 of the Act and listed in exhibit L of this subpart. Consequently, all of the following actions must be reviewed by the environmental reviewer to determine if they would be located within the System: any application for financial assistance, any proposed direct expenditure of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 funds for construction or maintenance purposes, any request for subdivision approval, and any proposed disposal of real property that includes any form of financial assistance or subsidy to the purchaser. The boundaries of the system can be determined by reviewing a series of maps passed with the legislation and distributed by the Department of the Interior. Each State Director is responsible for ensuring that those field offices having components of the system within their jurisdictions are aware of the system's boundaries therein.</p><p class="depth0">3. Exhibit L lists the six categories of exceptions, that is, those actions that may be taken within the system. No exception may be implemented, however, without first consulting with the Secretary of the Interior. It should also be noted that the sixth category is more limited than the first five. Besides meeting the consultation requirement for this sixth category, the sponsoring Agency must also determine whether the proposed exception is consistent with the purposes of the Act.</p><p class="depth0">4. For those actions that are reviewed and determined not to be within the System, the environmental reviewer must document this result by checking the appropriate compliance blocks on either Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1940-22, ``Environmental Checklist for Categorical Exclusions,'' or Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1940-21, ``Environmental Assessment for Class I actions,'' or by so stating this result in the environmental assessment for Class II Actions (exhibit H), depending upon whichever format is applicable to the action under review.</p><p class="depth0">5. For those actions that would be located within the system, one of the following two steps must be taken:</p><p class="depth0">a. If the environmental reviewer concludes that the action does not meet the criteria for an exception, as listed in exhibit L, the reviewer shall so inform the approving official and a final determination made in the manner indicated in Sec. 1940.316 of this subpart. If this determination is consistent with the environmental reviewer's conclusion, the action must be denied by the approving official and the affected applicant or party informed of the reason for denial. If it is determined that the action may qualify for an exception, the steps identified in Item b immediately below must be implemented prior to a decision on this question.</p><p class="depth0">b. If the environmental reviewer concludes that the proposed action may meet the exception criteria, the approving official must be so informed. Whenever the approving official agrees or makes a similar determination as a result of the review conducted in Item a immediately above, consultation shall be

initiated with the Secretary of the Interior by either the State Director or the Administrator for a National Office activity. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall request the Secretary's views as to whether the exception criteria are met and shall provide the Secretary with the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A detailed description of the action and its location;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A description of the affected environment within the System and the impacts of the proposed action;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The applicable exception criteria and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's reasons for believing they apply to this action; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If a Section 6(a)(6) exception is claimed, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's reasons for believing the action to be consistent with the purposes of the Act.</p><p class="depth0">Should the Secretary concur in the exception criteria being met, that portion of the environmental assessment relating to compliance with the Act shall be completed and the corresponding documentation attached. Should the Secretary not concur, a final decision on the approval or denial of the action must be made by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Exhibit G to Subpart G of Part 1940 [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Exhibit H to Subpart G of Part 1940--Environmental Assessment for</p><p class="depth0">Class II Actions</p><p class="depth0">In completing this assessment, it is important to understand the comprehensive nature of the impacts which must be analyzed. Consideration must be given to all potential impacts associated with the construction of the project, its operation and maintenance, the operation of all identified primary beneficiaries, and the attainment of the project's major objectives, whether they be an increased housing stock, community improvement, economic development, or greater agricultural productivity. This last category, the attainment of the project's major objectives, often induces or supports changes in population densities, land uses, community services, transportation systems and resource consumption. The scope of the assessment is broadened even further when there are related activities involved. The impacts of these activities must also be assessed.</p><p class="depth0">The preparer will consult as indicated in Sec. 1940.318(b) of this subpart with appropriate experts from Federal, State, and local agencies, universities, and other organizations or groups whose views could be helpful in the assessment of potential impacts. In so doing, each discussion which is utilized in reaching a conclusion with respect to the degree of an impact will be summarized in the assessment as accurately as possible and include the name, title, phone number, and organization of the individual contacted, plus the date of contact. Related correspondence should be attached to the assessment.</p><p class="depth0">The FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 environmental assessment shall be prepared in the following format. It shall address the listed items and questions and contain as attachments the indicated descriptive materials, as well as the environmental information submitted by the applicant, Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1940-20, ``Request for Environmental Information.''</p><p class="depth0">The assessment has been designed to cover the wide variety of projects and environments with which the Agency deals. Consequently, not every issue or potential impact raised in the assessment may be relevant to each project. The purpose of the format is to give the preparer an understanding of a standard range of impacts, environmental factors, and issues which may be encountered. In preparing an assessment, each topic heading identified by a Roman numeral and each environmental factor listed under topic heading IV, such as air quality, for example, must be addressed.</p><p class="depth0">The amount of analysis and material that must be provided will depend upon the type and size of the project, the environment in which it is located, and the range and complexity of the potential impacts. The amount of analysis and detail provided, therefore, must be commensurate with the magnitude of the expected impact. The analysis of each environmental factor (i.e., water quality) must be taken to the point that a conclusion can be reached and supported concerning the degree of the expected impact with respect to that factor.</p><p class="depth0">For example, a small community center may not require detailed information on air emissions or solid waste management, but an industrial facility would. Similarly, an irrigation project for a farming operation would concentrate on such factors as water quality and fish and wildlife, rather than land use changes. The extension of a water or sewer system or the approval of a subdivision, on the other hand, would have to give close attention to all factors, with potential land use changes being a particularly important one.</p><p class="depth0">I. Project Description and Need</p><p class="depth0">Identify the name, project number, location, and specific elements of the project along with their sizes, and, when applicable, their design capacities. Indicate the purpose of the project, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's position regarding the need for it, and the extent or area of land to be considered as the project site.</p><p class="depth0">II. Primary Beneficiaries and Related Activities</p><p class="depth0">Identify any existing businesses or major developments that will benefit from the project and those which will expand or locate in the area because of the project. Specify by name, product, service, and operations involved.</p><p class="depth0">Identify any related activities which are defined as interdependent parts of a FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 action. Such undertakings are considered interdependent parts whenever they either make possible or support the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 action or are themselves induced or supported by the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 action or another related activity. These activities may have been completed in the very recent past and are now operational, or they may reasonably be expected to be accomplished in the near future. Related activities may or may not be federally permitted or assisted. When they are, identify the involved Federal Agency(s).</p><p class="depth0">In completing the remainder of the assessment, it must be remembered that the impacts to be addressed are those which stem from the project, the primary beneficiaries, and the related activities.</p><p class="depth0">III. Description of Project Area</p><p class="depth0">Describe the project site and its present use. Describe the surrounding land uses; indicate the directions and distances involved. The extent of the surrounding land to be considered depends on the extent of the impacts of the project, its related activities, and the primary beneficiaries. Unique or sensitive areas must be pointed out. These include residential, schools, hospitals, recreational, historical sites, beaches, lakes, rivers, parks, floodplains, wetlands, dunes, estuaries, barrier islands, natural landmarks, unstable soils, steep slopes, aquifer recharge areas, important farmlands and forestlands, prime rangelands, endangered species habitats or other delicate or rare ecosystems.</p><p class="depth0">Attach adequate location maps of the project area, as well as (1) a U.S. Geological Survey ``15 minute'' (``7\1/2\ minute,'' if available,) topographic map which clearly delineates the area and the location of the project elements, (2) the Department of Housing and Urban Development's floodplain map(s) for the project area, (3) site photos, (4), if completed, a standard soil survey for the project, and (5), if available, an aerial photograph of the site. When necessary for descriptive purposes or environmental analysis, include land use maps or other graphic information. All graphic materials shall be of high quality resolution.</p><p class="depth0">IV. Environmental Impact</p><p class="depth0">1. Air Quality. Discuss, in terms of the amounts and types of emissions to be produced, all aspects of the project including beneficiaries' operations and known indirect effects (such as increased motor vehicle traffic) which will affect air quality. Indicate the existing air quality in the area. Indicate if topographical or meteorological conditions hinder or affect the dispersal of air emissions. Evaluate the impact on air quality given the types and amounts of projected emissions, the existing air quality, and topographical and meterological conditions. Discuss the project's consistency with the State's air quality implementation plan for the area, the classification of the air quality control region within which the project is located, and the status of compliance with air quality standards within that region. Cite any contacts with appropriate experts and agencies which must issue necessary permits.</p><p class="depth0">2. Water Quality. Discuss, in terms of amounts and types of effluents, all aspects of the project including primary beneficiaries' operations and known indirect effects which will affect water quality. Indicate the existing water quality of surface and/or underground water to be affected. Evalute the impacts of the project on this existing water quality. Indicate if an aquifer recharge area is to be adversely affected. If the project lies within or will affect a sole source aquifer recharge area as designated by EPA, contact the appropriate EPA regional office to determine if its review is necessary. If it is, attach the results of its review.</p><p class="depth0">Indicate the source and available supply of raw water and the extent to which the additional demand will affect the raw water supply. Describe the wastewater treatment system(s) to be used and indicate their capacity and their adequacy in terms of the degree of treatment provided. Discuss the characteristics and uses of the receiving waters for any sources of discharge. If the treatment systems are or will be inadequate or overloaded, describe the steps being taken for necessary improvements and their completion dates. Compare such dates to the completion date of the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 project. Analyze the impacts on the receiving water during any estimated period of inadequate treatment.</p><p class="depth0">Discuss the project's consistency with the water quality planning for the area, such as EPA's Section 208 area-wide waste treatment management plan. Discuss the project's consistency with applicable State water quality standards to include a discussion of whether or not the project would either impair any such standard or fail to meet antidegradation requirements for point or

nonpoint sources. Describe how surface runoff is to be handled and the effect of erosion on streams.</p><p class="depth0">Evaluate the extent to which the project may create shortages for or otherwise adversely affect the withdrawal capabilities of other present users of the raw water supply, particularly in terms of possible human health, safety, or welfare problems.</p><p class="depth0">For projects utilizing a groundwater supply, evaluate the potential for the project to exceed the safe pumping rate for the aquifer to the extent that it would (1) adversely affect the pumping capability of present users, (2) increase the likelihood of brackish or saltwater intrusion, thereby decreasing water quality, or (3) substantially increase surface subsidence risks.</p><p class="depth0">For projects utilizing a surface water supply, evaluate the potential for the project to (1) reduce flows below the minimum required for the protection of fish and wildlife or (2) reduce water quality standards below those established for the stream classification at the point of withdrawal or the adjacent downstream section.</p><p class="depth0">Cite contacts with appropriate experts and agencies that must issue necessary permits.</p><p class="depth0">3. Solid Waste Management. Indicate all aspects of the project including primary beneficiaries' operations, and known indirect effects which will necessitate the disposal of solid wastes. Indicate the kinds and expected quantities of solid wastes involved and the disposal techniques to be used. Evaluate the adequacy of these techniques especially in relationship to air and water quality. Indicate if recycling or resource recovery programs are or will be used. Cite any contacts with appropriate experts and agencies that must issue necessary permits.</p><p class="depth0">4. Land Use. Given the description of land uses as previously indicated, evaluate (a) the effect of changing the land use of the project site and (b) how this change in land use will affect the surrounding land uses and those within the project's area of environmental impact. Particularly address the potential impacts to those unique or sensitive areas discussed under Section III, Description of Project Area, which are not covered by the specific analyses required in Sections V-XI. Describe the existing land use plan and zoning restrictions for the project area. Evaluate the consistency of the project and its impacts on these plans. For all actions subject to the requirements of exhibit M of this subpart indicate (a) whether or not highly erodible land, wetland or converted wetland is present, (b) if any exemption(s) applies to the requirements of exhibit M, (c) the status of the applicant's eligibility for an FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan under exhibit M and (d) any steps the applicant must take prior to loan approval to retain or retain its eligibility. Attach a completed copy of Form SCS-CPA-26, ``Highly Erodible Land and Wetland Conservation Determination,'' for the action.</p><p class="depth0">5. Transportation. Describe available facilities such as highways and rail. Discuss whether the project will result in an increase in motor vehicle traffic and the existing roads' ability to safely accommodate this increase. Indicate if additional traffic control devices are to be installed. Describe new traffic patterns which will arise because of the project. Discuss how these new traffic patterns will affect the land uses described above, especially residential, hospitals, schools, and recreational. Describe the consistency of the project's transportation impacts with the transportation plans for the area and any air quality control plans. Cite any contact with appropriate experts.</p><p class="depth0">6. Natural Environment. Indicate all aspects of the project including construction, beneficiaries' operations, and known indirect effects which will affect the natural environment including wildlife, their habitats, and unique natural features. Cite contacts with appropriate experts. If an area listed on the National Registry of Natural Landmarks may be affected, consult with the Department of Interior and document these consultations and any agreements reached regarding avoidance or mitigation of potential adverse impacts.</p><p class="depth0">7. Human Population. Indicate the number of people to be relocated and arrangements being made for this relocation. Discuss how impacts resulting from the project such as changes in land use, transportation changes, air emissions, noise, odor, etc. will affect nearby residents and users of the project area and surrounding areas. Discuss whether the proposal will accommodate any population increases and, if so, describe the potential impacts of these increases on the area's public and community services such as schools, health care, social services, and fire protection. Cite contacts with appropriate experts.</p><p class="depth0">8. Construction. Indicate the potential effects of construction of the project on air quality, water quality, noise levels, solid waste disposal, soil erosion and siltation. Describe the measures that will be employed to limit adverse effects. Give particular consideration to erosion, stream siltation, and clearing operations.</p><p class="depth0">9. Energy Impacts. Indicate the project's and its primary beneficiaries' effects on the area's existing energy supplies.

Sec. Exhibit M to Subpart G of Part 1940--Implementation Procedures for</p><p class="depth0">the Conservation of Wetlands and Highly Erodible Land Affecting Farmer</p><p class="depth0">Program Loans and Loans to Indian Tribes and Tribal Corporations</p><p class="depth0">1. Background. This exhibit implements the requirements of Subtitle B, Highly Erodible Land Conservation, and Subtitle C, Wetland Conservation, of Title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985, Pub. L. 99-198. The purposes of these Subtitles are to: Reduce soil loss due to wind and water erosion; protect the Nation's long term capability to produce food and fiber; reduce sedimentation; improve water quality; assist in preserving the Nation's wetlands; create better habitat for fish and wildlife through improved food and cover; and curb production of surplus commodities by removing certain incentives for persons to produce agricultural commodities on highly erodible land or converted wetland.</p><p class="depth0">2. Applicability. The provisions of this exhibit apply to insured and guaranteed Farmer Program loans and loans to Indian Tribes and Tribal Corporations, subordinations, transfers and assumptions of such loans and leases and credit sales of inventory property. For the purpose of this exhibit, ``Farmer Program loans'' means Farm Operating Loans, Farm Ownership Loans, Emergency Loans, and Soil and Water Loans. As used in this exhibit, the word loan is meant to include guarantee as well. Applicant means an applicant for either an insured or guaranteed loan and borrower means a recipient of either an insured or guaranteed loan.</p><p class="depth0">3. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 prohibited activities. Unless otherwise exempted by the provisions of this exhibit, the proceeds of any Farmer Program loan or loan to an Indian Tribe or Tribal Corporation made or guaranteed by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will not be used either (a) for a purpose that will contribute to excessive erosion of highly erodible land, or (b) for a purpose that will contribute to conversion of wetlands to produce an agricultural commodity. (See Sec. 12.2(a)(1) of subpart A of part 12 of subtitle A of title 7, which is attachment 1 of this exhibit and is available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office, for the definition of an agricultural commodity.) Consequently, any applicant proposing to use loan proceeds for an activity contributing to either such purpose, will not be eligible for the requested loan. Any borrower that uses loan proceeds in a manner that contributes to either such purpose will be in default on the loan.</p><p class="depth0">a. U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) definitions. In implementing this exhibit, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will use the USDA's definitions of the terms found at Sec. 12.2 of subpart A of part 12 of subtitle A of title 7 (attachment 1 of this exhibit which is available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office).</p><p class="depth0">b. Highly erodible land conservation. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will conclude that excessive erosion of highly erodible land results or would result whenever (1) a field on which highly erodible land is predominant, as determined by the Soil Conservation Service (SCS), is or would be used to produce an agricultural commodity without conformance to a conservation system approved either by SCS or the appropriate conservation district, as evidenced by a statement from SCS, and (2) such field is not exempt from the provisions of this exhibit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> a wetland has or will be drained, dredged, filled, leveled, or otherwise manipulated (including any activity that results in impairing or reducing the flow, circulation, or reach of water) that makes possible the production of an agricultural commodity without further application of the manipulations described herein if (a) such production

would not have been possible but for such action and (b) before such action such land was wetland and was neither highly erodible land nor highly erodible cropland; and (2) neither the affected wetland nor the activity affecting the wetland is exempt from the provisions of this exhibit.</p><p class="depth0">d. Use of loan proceeds. To use loan proceeds for a purpose that contributes to either the excessive erosion of highly erodible land or the conversion of wetlands to produce an agricultural commodity means that loan proceeds will or have been used in a way that contributes to either excessive erosion of highly erodible land or the conversion of wetlands to produce an agricultural commodity by paying the costs of any of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The purchase of the affected land;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Necessary planning, feasibility, or design studies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Obtaining any necessary permits;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The purchase, contract, lease or renting of any equipment or materials necessary to carry out the land modification or conversion to include all associated operational costs such as fuel and equipment maintenance costs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Any labor costs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The planting, cultivating, harvesting, or marketing of any agricultural commodity produced on nonexempt highly erodible land to include any associated operational or material costs such as fuel, seed, fertilizer, and pesticide costs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Within the crop year in which the wetland conversion was completed plus the next ten crop years thereafter, the planting, cultivating, harvesting, or marketing of any agricultural commodity produced on the affected land to include any associated operational or materials costs such as fuel, seed, fertilizer and pesticide costs; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> For the same time period as in subparagraph 3d(7) above, any costs associated with using for on-farm purposes an agricultural commodity grown on the affected land.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Additionally, if loan proceeds will be or have been substituted to pay other costs at anytime during the life of the loan so that non-loan funds can be used to pay any of the above costs, it is deemed that loan proceeds will be or have been used for a purpose that contributes to the prohibited activities described in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0">4. Prohibited activities under other USDA financial assistance programs. Unless otherwise exempted, a person becomes ineligible for a variety of USDA financial assistance programs if that person produces in any crop year an agricultural commodity on either a field on which highly erodible land is predominant or a converted wetland. This ineligibility extends to any commodity produced during the crop year that the prohibited action occurs. The programs for which the person would be ineligible include price support payments, farm storage facility loans, disaster payments, crop insurance, payments made for the storage of an agricultural commodity, and payments received under a Conservation Reserve Program Contract. Farmer Program applicants and borrowers and applicants for, and borrowers of, loans to Indian Tribes and Tribal Corporations, therefore, can be affected not only by the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 prohibited activities but also by the broad USDA sweep of the Subtitles B and C restrictions. Should such an applicant rely or plan to rely on any of these other USDA financial assistance programs as a source of funds to repay its FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan(s) and then fail to meet the other program(s)' eligibility criteria related to wetland or highly erodible land conservation, repayment ability to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 or the lender of and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 guaranteed loan may be jeopardized. Consequently, those applicants who are applying for a loan and those borrowers who receive a loan after the effective date of Subtitles B and C, as designated in part 12 of subtitle A of title 7, and who include in their projected sources of repayment, potential funds from any USDA program subject to some form of Subtitle B or C restrictions will have to demonstrate as part of their applications, and for borrowers, as part of their farm plan of operation, their ability to meet the other program(s)' eligibility criteria. Failure to meet the criteria will require the applicant or borrower either to document an alternative, equivalent source of revenues or, if possible, agree to undertake any steps necessary to gain eligibility for the other program(s). See paragraph 6 of this exhibit for a discussion of such steps.</p><p class="depth0">5. Applicant's responsibilities.</p><p class="depth0">a. Required information. Every applicant for a Farmer Program loan or a loan to an Indian Tribe or Tribal Corporation will be required to provide the following information and, as applicable, certification as part of the application for financial assistance. An application will not be considered to be complete until this information and certification are provided to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. Once an applicant has provided FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 with information from SCS on the presence of any highly erodible land, wetland, or converted wetland this information need not be provided again for a subsequent loan unless there is either a change in the property upon which FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan proceeds will be applied or a change in the previous information, such as a change in the status of an exemption. There is a continuing responsibility

on FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 borrowers using other USDA financial assistance programs for repayment purposes to provide the County Supervisor with an executed copy of any similar certification required by the other USDA agency at the time of each required certification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A statement from the SCS indicating whether or not the applicant's farm property or properties contain either highly erodible land, wetland, or converted wetland and, if so, whether or not the applicant qualifies for a particular exemption to the provisions of this exhibit and as further detailed in paragraph 11 below. The property or properties will be listed and described in accordance with the Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Service's (ASCS) farm records system. SCS's execution of Form SCS-CPA-26, ``Highly Erodible Land and Wetland Conservation Determination,'' is necessary to meet this information requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If either highly erodible land, wetland, or converted wetland is present, the applicant's properly executed original or carbon copy of Form AD-1026, ``Highly Erodible Land and Wetland Conservation Certification.''</p><p class="depth0">b. Required actions. If at any time during the application review process any of the information or basis for an applicant's certification changes, the applicant (or the lender in the case of a guaranteed loan) must immediately notify FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. If an applicant intends to produce an agricultural commodity on a nonexempt field on which highly erodible land is predominant, the applicant must develop a conservation system approved by SCS or the appropriate conservation district, demonstrate that it is or will be in compliance with the system at the time the field is to be used, and provide SCS's concurrence with this position.</p><p class="depth0">6. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's application review. The FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 County Supervisor will review the information provided by the applicant from SCS regarding the presence of any highly erodible land, wetland, or converted wetland and any possible exemptions and take the actions warranted by the presence of one or more of the circumstances described below. In carrying out these actions, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will consider the technical decisions rendered by the SCS and the ASCS, as assigned to these agencies by subparts A, B, and C of part 12 of subtitle A of title 7 and further explained in this exhibit, to be final and controlling in the remaining FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 decisionmaking process for this exhibit. It must also be understood that the definition of a wetland used by SCS in implementing this exhibit applies only to this exhibit and not to other wetland protection provisions of subpart G of part 1940.</p><p class="depth0">a. No highly erodible land, wetland, or converted wetland present. The requested loan can be approved under the provisions of this exhibit and, except for documenting this result in accordance with paragraph 8 of this exhibit, no further action is required.</p><p class="depth0">b. Converted wetland present. The County Supervisor will consult with the applicant (and lender, in the case of a guaranteed loan) and the appropriate local office of the ASCS in order to determine if the converted wetland qualifies for the exemption specified in subparagraph c (1) of paragraph 11 of this exhibit. If so, no further action is necessary with respect to the converted wetland except for documenting the result. If the converted wetland does not qualify for an exemption, the County Supervisor will complete one or both of the following steps as the identified circumstances dictate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Step one. Review both the date that the wetland was converted and the proposed use of loan proceeds in order to determine if loan proceeds will be used for a prohibited activity as defined in subparagraph d of paragraph 3 of this exhibit. If not, the County Supervisor will so document this as specified in paragraph 8 of this exhibit; complete step two immediately below; and, if an insured loan will be approved, notify the applicant in writing, coincident with the transmittal of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1940-1, ``Request For Obligation of Funds,'' and by using Form Letter 1940-G-1, ``Notification of The Requirements of exhibit M of FmHA Instruction 1940-G,'' that the loan approval instruments will contain compliance requirements affecting the applicant's converted wetland. If loan proceeds will be used for a prohibited activity, the applicant (and lender, in the case of a guaranteed loan) will be advised of the applicant's ineligibility for the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan being requested. The applicant (and lender, in the case of a guaranteed loan) will be advised of any modifications to the application that could cure the ineligibility. Not growing an agricultural commodity on the converted wetland would cure the ineligibility, but the substitution of non-FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 funds to grow an agricultural commodity on the converted wetland would not.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Step two. The County Supervisor will review the applicant's sources of loan repayment to determine if they include funds from a USDA financial assistance program(s) subject to wetland conservation restrictions. If so, the County Supervisor will implement the actions in subparagraph e of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0">c. Highly erodible land or wetland present. The County Supervisor will discuss with the

applicant (and lender, in the case of a guaranteed loan) and review the intended uses of the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan proceeds as evidenced in any relevant application materials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Proceeds to be used for prohibited activity. If proceeds would be used for a prohibited activity, the applicant (and lender, in the case of a guaranteed loan) will be advised of its ineligibility for the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan. The applicant (and lender, in the case of a guaranteed loan) will be informed of any modifications to its application that could cure the ineligibility, including financially feasible eligible loan purposes that could be helpful in implementing a conservation plan or installing a conservation system, should either be an appropriate cure. Substitution of non-FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 monies to accomplish the prohibited activity would not cure the ineligibility, but actual elimination of the activity from the applicant's farm plan of operation would.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Proceeds not to be used for a prohibited activity. If loan proceeds are not planned to be used for a prohibited activity, the County Supervisor will perform the following tasks:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Document the above determination in the applicant's file as specified in paragraph 8 of this exhibit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If an insured loan will be approved and the requirements of subparagraph c (2)(c) of this paragraph do not apply, notify the applicant in writing, coincident with the transmittal of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1940-1, ``Request For Obligation of Funds,'' and by using Form Letter 1940-G-1, ``Notification of The Requirements of Exhibit M of FmHA Instruction 1940-G,'' that the loan approval instruments will contain compliance requirements affecting the applicant's highly erodible land and/or wetland.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Review the term of the proposed loan and take the following actions, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Loan term exceeds January 1, 1990, but not January 1, 1995. If the term of the proposed loan expires within this period and the applicant intends to produce an agricultural commodity on highly erodible land that is exempt from the restrictions of this exhibit until either 1990 or two years after the SCS has completed a soil survey for the borrower's land, whichever is later, the County Supervisor will determine if it is financially feasible for the applicant, prior to loss of the exemption, to actively apply a conservation plan approved by SCS or the appropriate conservation district. See Sec. 12.23 of subpart A of part 12 of subtitle A of title 7, which is attachment 1 of this exhibit and is available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office, for a definition of actively applying a conservation plan. Prior to loan approval, the applicant, the lender, (if a guaranteed loan is involved), FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and SCS will resolve any doubts as to what extent production would be able to continue under application of a conservation plan and as to the financial implications on loan repayment ability from both the potential costs of actively applying the conservation plan and the potential loss of revenues from any reduced acreage production base. The loan approval official will determine the financial implications of actively applying a conservation plan to the applicant's highly erodible land by developing a projected farm plan of operation or other farm financial projections that reflect adequate repayment on the full scheduled installments for all debt obligations at the time the conservation plan is being actively applied. If in making this determination, loan repayment ability cannot be demonstrated, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will deny the loan application. If loan repayament ability can be demonstrated and an insured loan will be approved, the applicant will be advised in writing, coincident with the transmittal of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1940-1, ``Request For Obligation of Funds,'' and using Form Letter 1940-G-1, ``Notification of The Requirements of Exhibit M of FmHA Instruction 1940-G,'' that the loan approval instruments will contain compliance requirements affecting the applicant's highly erodible land. The applicant will also be advised that a statement from the SCS issued prior to either January 1, 1990, or two years after the SCS has completed a soil survey of the applicant's land (whichever is later) and stating that the applicant is actively applying an approved conservation plan will be considered adequate demonstration of compliance on the highly erodible land affected by the 1990 deadline.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Loan term exceeds January 1, 1995. If the term of the proposed loan would exceed this date and the borrower intends to produce an agricultural commodity on highly erodible land that is exempt from the restrictions of the exhibit up until that date (see subparagraph b (4) of paragraph 11 of this exhibit) the County Supervisor will determine if it is financially feasible for the applicant, after January 1, 1985, to produce an agricultural commodity on the highly erodible land in compliance with a conservation system approved by SCS or the appropriate conservation district. Prior to loan approval, the applicant, the lender (if a guaranteed loan is involved), FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and SCS will resolve any doubts as to what extent production would be able to continue under a conservation system and as to the financial implications on loan repayment ability from both the potential costs of the conservation

system and the potential loss of revenues from any reduced acreage production base. The loan approval official will determine the financial implications of compliance with a conservation system using the financial projection method(s) indicated in subparagraph c (2)(c)(i) of this paragraph. If loan repayment ability cannot be demonstrated, the application will be denied. If loan repayment ability can be demonstrated and an insured loan will be approved, the applicant will be advised in writing, coincident with the transmittal of Form 1940-1, ``Request for Obligation of Funds,'' and using Form Letter 1940-G-1, ``Notification of The Requirements of Exhibit M of FmHA Instruction 1940-G,'' that the loan approval instruments will contain compliance requirements affecting the applicant's highly erodible land. The applicant will also be advised that a statement from SCS issued prior to January 1, 1995, and stating that the applicant is in compliance with an approved conservation system will be considered adequate demonstration of compliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Implement the actions in subparagraph e of this paragraph if the applicant plans to repay a portion of the loan with funds from a USDA financial assistance program subject to wetland or highly erodible land conservation restrictions.</p><p class="depth0">d. Highly erodible land present that was or is planted in alfalfa. If the applicant plans to cultivate highly erodible land for the purpose of producing an agricultural commodity and that highly erodible land during each of the 1981 to 1985 crop years was planted in alfalfa in a crop rotation determined by SCS to be adequate for the protection of highly erodible land, the applicant is exempt until June 1, 1988, from the requirement to fully implement an approved conservation system on the highly erodible land. The County Supervisor, following procedures similar to those indicated in subparagraph c (2)(c)(i) of this paragraph, will determine if it is financially feasible for the applicant to apply a conservation system to the highly erodible land prior to the loss of the exemption on June 1, 1988. If loan repayment ability cannot be demonstrated, the application will be denied. If loan repayment ability can be demonstrated and an insured loan will be approved, the applicant will be advised in writing that the loan approval instruments will contain compliance requirements affecting the applicant's highly erodible land. The applicant will also be advised that a statement from SCS issued prior to June 1, 1988 and stating that the applicant is in compliance with an approved conservation system will be considered adequate demonstration of compliance with this requirement.</p><p class="depth0">e. Highly erodible land, wetland, or converted wetland present and applicant intends to use the USDA financial assistance program(s), including crop insurance, to repay FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan. The County Supervisor will consult with the applicant (and lender, in the case of a guaranteed loan) and the other USDA agency(s) to determine if the applicant is eligible for the latter's financial assistance. If not eligible, the applicant will have to demonstrate that an alternative source(s) of repayment will be available in order for further processing of the application to proceed.</p><p class="depth0">7.

These instruments must be modified as specified in subparagraph b(1)(c) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0">8. Required FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 documentation. The actions taken and determinations made by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to comply with the provisions of this exhibit will be documented as part of the environmental review of the application. All actions subject to this exhibit will undergo at a minimum the completion of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1940-22, ``Environmental Checklist for Categorical Exclusions.'' On the reverse of this form, the preparer will document as applicable (a) whether or not highly erodible land, wetland, or converted wetland is present, (b) if any exemption(s) applies, (c) the status of the applicant's eligibility for an FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan under this exhibit, and (d) any steps the applicant must take prior to loan approval to retain or regain its eligibility. If the application under review meets the definition of a Class I action as defined in Sec. 1940.311 of this subpart, the above documentation will be included as an exhibit to Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1940-21, ``Environmental Assessment for Class I Action.'' If the application meets the definition of a Class II action as defined in Sec. 1940.312 of this subpart, the required documentation will be included within the Class II assessment under the discussion of land use impacts. See paragraph IV.4. of exhibit H of this subpart. Once an applicant's farm property has undergone an environmental review covering the provisions of this exhibit, the County Supervisor reviewing a subsequent loan request need not require the applicant to obtain further site information from SCS as long as there is no change in the farm property to be affected or any applicable exemptions.</p><p class="depth0">9. Borrowers' responsibilities. In addition to complying with any loan requirements resulting from FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's implementation of this exhibit, a borrower must within ten days of receipt inform, in writing, the lender of a guaranteed loan and the County Supervisor for an insured loan of any ineligibility determinations received from other USDA agencies for violations of wetland or highly erodible land conservation restrictions. A borrower also has the responsibility to consult with the lender or County Supervisor, as applicable, if at any time the borrower is uncertain as to the borrower's duties and responsibility under the loan provisions.</p><p class="depth0">10. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and lender monitoring. As an element of insured loan servicing, to include development of a farm plan of operation for an upcoming crop year, scheduled farm visits, or other contracts with borrowers, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 staff will review and analyze the borrower's compliance with the provisions of this exhibit and any related loan requirements. If at anytime FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 becomes aware of the borrower's violation of these provisions or related loan requirements, the borrower will be informed that the affected loan(s) is in default. In addition to directly monitoring borrowers, the County Supervisor will receive and review the monitoring results of other USDA agencies having restrictions on wetland and highly erodible land conservation. Whenever these results indicate that a borrower may have violated the loan conditions, the County Supervisor will further analyze the matter and respond, as indicated in this paragraph, should a violation be determined. Lenders of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 guaranteed loans must also monitor compliance as part of their servicing responsibilities.</p><p class="depth0">11. Exemptions and determining their applicability. Following is a list of exemptions from the provisions of this exhibit as well a description of how FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will apply the exemptions to a proposed loan or activity under a loan. This list is intended to provide guidance on implementing the exemptions contained in subparts A, B, and C of part 12 of subtitle A of title 7 (attachment 1 of this exhibit which is available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office) and does not modify or limit any of those exemptions.</p><p class="depth0">a. Exemption from wetland and highly erodible land conservation. Any loan which was closed prior to December 23, 1985, or any loan for which either Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1940-1, ``Request for Obligation of Funds,'' Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-14, ``Conditional Commitment for Guarantee,'' or Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1980-15, ``Conditional Commitment for Contract of Guarantee (Line of Credit),'' was executed prior to December 23, 1985, is exempt from the provisions of this exhibit.</p><p class="depth0">b. Exemptions from highly erodible land conservation. The following exemptions exist from the restrictions on highly erodible land conservation. Whenever the County Supervisor is required to consult with another USDA agency in applying these exemptions, the County Supervisor's review of a properly completed Form SCS-CPA-26 will be considered adequate consultation if the needed information is presented on the form and no questions are raised by the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any land upon which an agricultural commodity was planted before December 23, 1985, is exempt for that particular planting. The County Supervisor will consult with the appropriate local ASCS office in applying this exemption and the ASCS determination is controlling for purposes of this exhibit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any land planted with an agricultural commodity during a crop year beginning before December 23, 1985, is exempt for that particular planting. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will consult with the ASCS State Executive Director and the latter's position will be controlling in determining the date that the crop year began.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any land that during any one of the crop years of 1981 through 1985 was either (a) cultivated to produce an agricultural commodity, or (b) set aside, diverted or otherwise not cropped under a program administered by USDA to reduce production of an agricultural commodity, is exempt until the later of January 1, 1990, or the date that is two years after the date that the SCS has completed a soil survey of the land. To apply this exemption, the County Supervisor will consult with ASCS to determine from the latter's records whether or not the land was cultivated or set aside during the required period. The ASCS determination will be controlling. However, the date of completion for any SCS soil survey will be determined by SCS and used by the County Supervisor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Beginning on January 1, 1990, or two years after SCS has completed a soil survey for the land, whichever is later, and extending to January 1, 1995, any land that qualified for the exemption in subparagraph b (3) of this paragraph is further exempt if a person is actively applying to it a conservation plan that is based on the local SCS technical guide and properly approved by the appropriate SCS conservation district or the SCS. To apply this exemption as well as the exemptions specified in subparagraphs b (5), (6), (7), and (8) of this paragraph, the County Supervisor will consult with the appropriate local SCS office and the SCS position will be controlling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Highly erodible land within a conservation district and under a conservation system that has been approved by a conservation district after the district has determined that the conservation system is in conformity with technical standards set forth in the SCS technical guide for such district is exempt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Highly erodible land not within a conservation district but under a conservation system determined by SCS to be adequate for the production of a specific agricultural commodity or commodities on any highly

erodible land is exempt for the production of that commodity or commodities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Highly erodible land that is planted in reliance on a SCS determination that such land was not highly erodible is exempt. The exemption is lost, however, for any agricultural commodity planted after SCS determines that such land is highly erodible land.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Highly erodible land planted or to be planted in an agricultural commodity that was planted in alfalfa during each of the 1981 and 1985 crop years in a crop rotation determined by SCS to be adequate for the protection of highly erodible land is exempt until June 1, 1988, from the requirement that the highly erodible land be planted in compliance with an approved conservation system.</p><p class="depth0">c. Exemptions from wetland conservation. The following exemptions exist from the restrictions on wetland conservation. Whenever the County Supervisor is required to consult with another USDA agency in applying these exemptions, the County Supervisor's review of a properly completed Form SCS-CPA-26 will be considered adequate consultation if the needed information is presented on the form and no questions are raised by the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A converted wetland is exempt if the conversion of such wetland was completed or commenced before December 23, 1985. The County Supervisor will consult with ASCS whose determination as to when conversion of a wetland commenced will be final for FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 purposes. Additionally, the County Supervisor will request evidence of ASCS's consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on each commenced determination reached for an FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 applicant or borrower. SCS will determine if a wetland is a converted wetland using the criteria contained in Sec. 12.32 of subpart C of part 12 of subtitle A of title 7 (attachment 1 of this exhibit which is available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office). Under these criteria, however, a converted wetland determined to be exempt may not always remain exempt. The criteria include the provision that if crop production is abandoned on a converted wetland and the land again meets the wetland criteria, that land has reverted to a wetland and is no longer exempt. For purposes of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 inventory farm properties, crop production will be considered to have been abandoned on a converted wetland either at the earlier of the time the former owner so abandoned crop production or at the time FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 caused crop production to be abandoned after the property came into FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's inventory. While in its inventory FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will not lease the converted wetland for the purpose of producing an agricultural commodity. Whether or not the wetland criteria are met on the abandoned land will be determined by SCS immediately before FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's lease or sale of the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The following are not considered to be a wetland under the provisions of this exhibit: (a) An artificial lake, pond, or wetland created by excavating or diking non-wetland to collect and retain water for purposes such as water for livestock, fish production, irrigation (including subsurface irrigation), a settling basin, colling, rice production, or flood control; (b) a wet area created by a water delivery system, irrigation, irrigation system, or application of water for irrigation and (c) lands in Alaska identified by SCS as having a predominance of permafrost soils. The County Supervisor will consult with SCS regarding the application of this exemption as well as the remaining exemptions in this paragraph and the SCS position will be controlling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A wetland is exempt if the production of an agricultural commodity is possible (a) as a result of a natural condition, such as drought, and (b) without action by the producer that destroys a natural wetland characteristic. This exemption is lost whenever condition (a) or (b) no longer exists.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Production of an agricultural commodity on a converted wetland is exempt is SCS determines that the effect of such action, individually and in connection with all other similar actions authorized in the area by USDA agencies, on the hydrological and biological aspect of wetland is minimal.</p><p class="depth0">12. Appeals. Any applicant or borrower that is directly and adversely affected by an administrative decision made by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 under this exhibit may appeal that decision under the provisions of subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter (see especially Sec. 1900.55).</p><p class="depth0">13. Working with other USDA agencies.</p><p class="depth0">a. Coordination. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Directors will consult with SCS State Conservationists and ASCS State Executive Directors to assess and coordinate loan processing workloads in order to minimize delays in responding to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 requests for site information or for the application of the exemptions contained in paragraph 11 of this exhibit. State Directors will ensure that FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 field staff understand and can use the ASCS farm records system and will request ASCS training as needed. Also, management systems for sharing the information discussed in subparagraph b of this paragraph will be established.</p><p class="depth0">b. Information exchange. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Directors will develop with ASCS State Executive Directors a system for FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to routinely receive notification whenever a violation has occurred under ASCS's wetland and highly erodible land conservation restrictions. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Directors will in turn provide to any interested USDA agency the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Upon request, copies of site information or exemption decision made by SCS for FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 application reviews;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Upon request, copies of exemption decisions made by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Notice of any violations of the provisions of this exhibit identified by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 as a result of the monitoring activities identified in paragraph 10 of this exhibit.</p><p class="depth0">14. Relationship of the requirements of this exhibit to the wetland protection requirements of exhibit C of this subpart. The provisions of this exhibit determine (a) whether or not an applicant for a Farmer Program insured or guaranteed loan or a loan to an Indian Tribe or Tribal Corporation is eligible to be considered for such a loan, and (b) whether or not a recipient of such a loan is properly using the loan proceeds with respect to the requirements of this exhibit. On the other hand, the requirements in exhibit C of this subpart regarding wetland protection cover all FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan and grant programs and address not questions of eligibility but the potential environmental impacts of a proposed action on a wetland and alternatives to the action. Consequently, those applications covered by this exhibit and which may be approved under this exhibit must also meet the requirements of exhibit C of this subpart. For example, an application covered by this exhibit (M) that proposed to convert a wetland into a tree farm would be exempt from this exhibit (M) because trees are not an agricultural commodity, i.e., there is no conversion in order to produce an agricultural commodity. However, before FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 could make the loan, the requirements of exhibit C of this subpart would have to be met to include an FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 finding that no practicable alternative exists to the conversion of the wetland. In summary, any proposed wetland conversion that is not prohibited by this exhibit (M) must next meet the requirements of exhibit C of this subpart before FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 approval of the requested financial assistance could be provided.
