                            <p class="depth0">When a NASA employee on temporary duty travel is authorized to  travel by Government motor vehicle and the official authorizing the  travel determines that there will be a significant savings in time, a  Government motor vehicle may be issued at the close of the preceding  working day and taken to the employee's residence prior to the  commencement of official travel. Similarly, when a NASA employee is  scheduled to return from temporary duty travel after the close of  working hours and the official authorizing the travel determines that  there will be a significant savings in time, the motor vehicle may be  taken to the employee's   residence and returned the next regular working day.

Appendix A to Part 1204--Items To Cover in Memoranda of Agreement</p><p class="depth0">The items to be covered in Memoranda of Agreement between NASA  Installations and state and areawide OMB Circular A-95 clearinghouses  for coordinating NASA and civilian planning:</p><p class="depth0">1. Clearinghouses will be contacted at the earliest practicable  point in project planning. Generally, this will be during the  preparation of Preliminary Engineering Reports, or possibly earlier if  meaningful information is available that could practically serve as an  input in the decision-making process. It should be noted that  clearinghouses are generally comprehensive planning agencies. As such,  they are often the best repositories of information required for  development planning and constitute a resource that can often save  Federal planners substantial time and effort, if consulted early enough.  In addition to providing information necessary for preliminary  engineering, clearinghouses can make useful inputs to the development of  environmental impact statements, as well as in reviewing draft  statements. Thus, consultation at the earliest stage in planning can  have substantial payoffs in installation development.</p><p class="depth0">2. Clearinghouses will be afforded a minimum time of 30 days in  which to review and comment on a proposed project and a maximum time of  45 days in which to complete such review.</p><p class="depth0">3. The minimum information to be provided to the clearinghouse will  consist of project description, scope and purpose, summary technical  data, maps and diagrams where relevant, and any data which would show  the relationship of the proposed project or action to applicable land  use plans, policies, and controls for the affected area.</p><p class="depth0">4. Establish procedures for notifying clearinghouses of the actions  taken on projects, such as implementation, timing, postponement,  abandonment, and explaining, where appropriate, actions taken contrary  to clearinghouse recommendations.</p>
