Alternatively, you may use an operating  range that has been previously established and approved by your  permitting authority within the past 5 years. You must monitor the  pressure drop daily, maintain the pressure drop for each baghouse within  the established operating range, and record the pressure drop  measurement in a daily log. You must perform routine maintenance on each  baghouse and record maintenance activities in a   baghouse maintenance log. Baghouse maintenance logs must include, but  are not limited to, inspections, criteria for changing bag filters, and  dates on which the bag filters are replaced. Both logs must be  maintained in a suitable permanent form and kept available for  inspection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If you own or operate a sintering machine at your facility, you  must comply with the PM emissions limit in 40 CFR 60.172(a) and the  opacity emissions limit in 40 CFR 60.174(a) for that sintering machine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If you own or operate a sintering machine at your facility, you  must install and operate a continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS)  for each sintering machine according to the requirements in 40 CFR  60.175(a). Each COMS must meet Performance Specification 1 (40 CFR part  60, appendix B).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For each furnace at your facility subject to an emissions limit  in paragraph (b) of this section, you must demonstrate initial  compliance with the applicable PM emissions limit in paragraph (b) of  this section based on the results of a performance test for that  furnace. If you own or operate a sintering machine, you must also  demonstrate initial compliance with the PM and opacity emissions limits  in paragraph (d) of this section based on the results of a performance  test for that sintering machine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may certify initial compliance for a furnace (and sintering  machine, if applicable) based on the results of a previous performance  test conducted during the past 5 years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you have not conducted a performance test to demonstrate  compliance with the applicable emissions limits during the past 5 years,  you must conduct a performance test within 180 days of your compliance  date and report the results in your notification of compliance status.  If a furnace subject to an emissions limit in paragraph (b) of this  section is not operating on the compliance date and subsequently resumes  operation, you must conduct a performance test within 180 days of  startup and report the results in your notification of compliance  status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> through (v) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Method 1 or 1A (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) to select sampling  port locations and the number of traverse points in each stack or duct.  Sampling sites must be located at the outlet of the control device (or  at the outlet of the emissions source if no control device is present)  prior to any releases to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F, or 2G (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) to  determine the volumetric flow rate of the stack gas.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Method 3, 3A, or 3B (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) to determine  the dry molecular weight of the stack gas. You may use ANSI/ASME PTC  19.10-1981, ``Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses (incorporated by reference-- see Sec. 63.14) as an alternative to EPA Method 3B.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Method 4 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) to determine the moisture  content of the stack gas.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Method 5 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) to determine the PM  concentration for a negative pressure baghouse, Method 5D (40 CFR part  60, appendix A) for a positive pressure baghouse, or an alternative  method previously approved by your permitting authority. A minimum of  three valid test runs are needed to comprise a PM performance test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You must conduct each PM test for a sintering machine according  to Sec. 63.7(e)(1) and 40 CFR 60.176(b)(1) using the test methods in  paragraph (f)(3) of this section. You must determine the PM  concentration using EPA Method 5 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A). You may  use ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981, ``Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses''  (incorporated by reference--see Sec. 63.14) as an alternative to EPA  Method 3B.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> You must conduct each opacity test for a sintering machine  according to the requirements in Sec. 63.6(h)(7). You must determine the  opacity of emissions using EPA Method 9 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> For each furnace subject to an emissions limit in paragraph (b)  of this section, you must conduct subsequent performance tests according  to the requirements in paragraph (f)(3) of this section to demonstrate  compliance   with the applicable PM emissions limit for the furnace every 5 years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> You must submit a notification to your permitting authority of  any deviation from the requirements of this subpart within 30 days after  the deviation. The notification must describe the probable cause of the  deviation and any corrective actions or preventative measures taken.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> You must submit semiannual monitoring reports to your permitting  authority containing the results for all monitoring required by this  subpart. All deviations that occur during the reporting period must be  clearly identified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> You must keep records of all required monitoring data and  support information. Support information includes all calibration and  maintenance records and all original strip chart recordings for  continuous monitoring instrumentation and copies of all reports required  by this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)(3)</em> or  (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must maintain all equipment covered under this subpart in  such a manner that the performance or operation of such equipment does  not cause a deviation from the applicable requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must keep a maintenance record for each item of air  pollution control equipment. At a minimum, this record must show the  dates of performing maintenance and the nature of preventative  maintenance activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> through (iii) of this section. For the purpose of  complying with this paragraph, an emergency situation is any situation  arising from sudden and reasonably unforeseeable events beyond the  control of the facility owner or operator that require immediate  corrective action to restore normal operation, and that cause the  affected source to exceed applicable emission limitation under this  subpart, due to unavoidable increases in emissions attributable to the  emergency. An emergency must not include noncompliance to the extent it  is caused by improperly designed equipment, lack of preventive  maintenance, careless or improper operation, or operator error.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> During the period of the emergency you must implement all  reasonable steps to minimize levels of emissions that exceeded the  emission standards or other applicable requirements in this subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You must document through signed contemporaneous logs or other  relevant evidence that an emergency occurred and you can identify the  probable cause, your facility was being operated properly at the time  the emergency occurred, and the corrective actions taken to minimize  emissions as required by paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You must submit a notice of the emergency to the permitting  authority within two working days of the time when emission limitations  were exceeded due to the emergency (or an alternative timeframe  acceptable to the permitting authority). This notice must contain a  description of the emergency, any steps taken to mitigate emissions, and  corrective actions taken.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> As an alternative to the requirements in paragraph (k)(3) of  this section, you must comply with the startup, shutdown, and  malfunction requirements in 40 CFR 63.6(e)(3).</p>
