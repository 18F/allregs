In  determining the aggregate balances for purposes of this limitation, a  credit union may exclude any loan made to finance the construction of a  single-family residence if a prospective homeowner has contracted to  purchase the property   and may also exclude a loan to finance the construction of one single- family residence per member-borrower or group of associated member- borrowers, irrespective of the existence of a contractual commitment  from a prospective homeowner to purchase the property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The borrower must have a minimum of 25% equity interest in the  project being financed, the value of which is determined by the market  value of the project at the time the loan is made, except that this  requirement will not apply in the case of a loan made to finance the  construction of a single-family residence if a prospective homeowner has  contracted to purchase the property and in the case of one loan to a  member-borrower or group of associated member-borrowers to finance the  construction of a single-family residence, irrespective of the existence  of a contractual commitment from a prospective homeowner to purchase the  property. Instead, the collateral requirements of Sec. 723.7 will apply;  and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The funds may be released only after on-site, written  inspections by qualified personnel and according to a preapproved draw  schedule and any other conditions as set forth in the loan  documentation.
