Upon adequate showing of need to serve a larger sector, or more than a single sector, greater beamwidth or multiple antennas may be authorized. Applicants shall request, and authorization for stations in this service will specify, the polarization of each transmitted signal. Booster station antennas having narrower beamwidths and reduced sidelobe radiation may be required in congested areas, or to resolve interference problems.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Stations must employ an antenna that meets the performance standards for Category B. In areas subject to frequency congestion, where proposed facilities would be precluded by continued use of a Category B antenna, a Category A antenna must be employed. The Commission may require the use of a high performance antenna where interference problems can be resolved by the use of such antennas.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Licensees shall comply with the antenna standards table shown in this paragraph in the following manner:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> With either the maximum beamwith to 3 dB points requirement or with the minimum antenna gain requirement; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> With the minimum radiation suppression to angle requirement.</p><p class="depth5">Antenna Standards--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth5">Maximum                   Minimum radiation suppression to angle in degrees from</p><p class="depth5">beamwidth                            centerline of main beam in decibels</p><p class="depth5">to 3 dB    Minimum  -----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth5">points    antenna</p><p class="depth5">Frequency (MHz)                      Category     \1\        gain     5[deg]  10[deg]  15[deg]  20[deg]   30[deg]  100[deg]  140[deg]</p><p class="depth5">(included    (dbi)       to       to       to       to       to        to        to</p><p class="depth5">angle in             10[deg]  15[deg]  20[deg]  30[deg]  100[deg]  140[deg]  180[deg]</p><p class="depth5">degrees)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1,990 to 2,110.......................................

Such approvals shall be conditioned to a standard antenna as required in paragraph (a) of this section when an applicant of a new TV auxiliary broadcast or Cable Television Relay station indicates that the use of the existing antenna system will cause interference and the use of a category A or B antenna will remedy the interference.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> As a further exception to the provision of paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission may approve antenna systems not conforming to the technical standards where a persuasive showing is made that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Indicates in detail why an antenna system complying with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section cannot be installed, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Includes a statement indicating that frequency coordination as required in Sec.  74.604 (a) was accomplished.
