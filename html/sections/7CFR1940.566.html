The criteria used in the basic formula are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> State's percentage of the National number of rural occupied  substandard units, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> State's percentage of the National number of rural households  below 50 percent of area median income.   Data source for each of these criteria is based on the latest census  data available. Each criterion is assigned a specific weight according  to its relevance in determining need. The percentage representing each  criterion is multiplied by the weight factor and summed to arrive at a  basic State factor (SF).  SF = (criterion No. 1 x weight of 50%) + (criterion No. 2 x weight of  50%)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> of this subpart. The  percentage range used for section 504 Housing Repair Loans is plus or  minus 15.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Base allocation. Not used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> of this  subpart. Jurisdictions receiving formula allocations do not receive  administrative allocations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Mid-year: If used in a particular fiscal year, available funds  unobligated as of the pooling date are pooled and redistributed based on  the formula used to allocate funds initially.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Year-end: Pooled funds are placed in a National Office reserve  and are available as determined administratively.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> of  this subpart. At the option of the State Director, section 504 loan  funds may be suballocated to the District Offices. When performing a  suballocation, the State Director will use the same basic formula  criteria, data source and weight for suballocating funds within the  State as used by the National Office in allocating to the States as  described in Sec. 1940.566 (b) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Other documentation.
