                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A refiner that has been approved by EPA for small refiner gasoline sulfur standards under Sec. 80.240 may apply, under Sec. 80.551, for an extension of the duration of its small refiner gasoline sulfur standards through the calendar year 2010 annual averaging period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As part of its application, the refiner must submit an application for a motor vehicle diesel fuel baseline in accordance with the provisions of Sec. Sec. 80.595 and 80.596. The application must also include information, as provided in Sec. 80.594, demonstrating that starting no later than June 1, 2006, 95 percent of the motor vehicle diesel fuel produced by the refiner will comply with the 15 ppm sulfur content standard under Sec. 80.520(a)(1), and that the volume of motor vehicle diesel fuel produced will comply with the volume requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Administrator may approve an application for extension of the small refiner gasoline sulfur standards if the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section and Sec. Sec. 80.595 and 80.596 are satisfied. In approving an application for extension, the Administrator shall establish a motor vehicle diesel fuel volume baseline under Sec. Sec. 80.595 and 80.596.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Beginning June 1, 2006, and continuing through December 31, 2010, 95 percent of the motor vehicle diesel fuel produced by a refiner that has received an extension of its small refiner gasoline sulfur standards under this section must be accurately designated under Sec. 80.598 as meeting the 15 ppm sulfur content standard under Sec. 80.520(a)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The total volume of motor vehicle diesel fuel produced for use in the United States and designated as meeting the 15 ppm sulfur content standard under paragraph (d) of this section must meet or exceed 85 percent of the baseline volume established under paragraph (c) of this section, except that for the first compliance period from June 1, 2006 through June 30, 2007, the total volume must meet or exceed 92 percent of the baseline volume.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Compliance with the volume requirements in paragraph (e) of this section shall be determined each compliance period. Annual compliance periods shall be from July 1 through June 30. For the year 2006, the compliance period shall be from June 1, 2006 through June 30, 2007 and for the year 2009 the compliance period shall be from July 1, 2009 through May 31, 2010.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If a refiner fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, or if approval of the application, including the baseline, was based on false or inaccurate information, the extension of the applicable small refiner gasoline sulfur standards under this section shall be void ab initio, and all gasoline produced by the refinery must meet the gasoline sulfur standards under subpart H of this Part as if there had been no extension of the small refiner gasoline sulfur standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If for any compliance period a refiner fails to meet the volume requirements in paragraph (e) of this section, the extension of the small refiner gasoline sulfur standards shall be void for that compliance period and for all succeeding compliance periods and all gasoline produced by the refinery must meet the gasoline sulfur standards under subpart H of this part as if there had been no extension of the small refiner gasoline sulfur standards under this section for such compliance periods.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> A refiner that is approved for an extension of the interim small refiner gasoline sulfur standards under this section must meet all applicable recordkeeping and reporting requirements

of Sec. Sec. 80.592, 80.593, and 80.594, and shall meet all the recordkeeping and reporting requirements under Sec. Sec. 80.210, 80.365 and 80.370. Any foreign refiner shall meet all additional requirements under Sec. Sec. 80.620 and 80.410.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> A refiner approved for the small refiner gasoline sulfur standards extension under this section may not generate or use credits under Sec. 80.531(a) or (e), or Sec. 80.532.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> A refiner may petition the Administrator to vacate an extension of the small refiner gasoline sulfur content standards. EPA may grant such a petition, effective July 1 of the compliance period following receipt of such petition (or effective June 1, 2006, if applicable). Upon such effective date, all gasoline produced by the refiner must meet the gasoline sulfur content standards under subpart H of this part as if there had been no extension of the small refiner gasoline sulfur content standards under this section. Upon such effective date, the refiner shall not be subject to the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> The provisions of this section shall apply separately for each refinery of a refiner.
