                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Basic requirement. If any of your employees has been occupationally exposed to anyone with a known case of active tuberculosis (TB), and that employee subsequently develops a tuberculosis infection, as evidenced by a positive skin test or diagnosis by a physician or other licensed health care professional, you must record the case on the OSHA 300 Log by checking the ``respiratory condition'' column.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Implementation-(1) Do I have to record, on the Log, a positive TB skin test result obtained at a pre-employment physical? No, you do not have to record it because the employee was not occupationally exposed to a known case of active tuberculosis in your workplace.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> May I line-out or erase a recorded TB case if I obtain evidence that the case was not caused by occupational exposure? Yes, you may line-out or erase the case from the Log under the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The worker is living in a household with a person who has been diagnosed with active TB;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Public Health Department has identified the worker as a contact of an individual with a case of active TB unrelated to the workplace; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A medical investigation shows that the employee's infection was caused by exposure to TB away from work, or proves that the case was not related to the workplace TB exposure.
