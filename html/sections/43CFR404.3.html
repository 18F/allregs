                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This program addresses domestic, municipal, and industrial water supply needs in rural areas of the Reclamation States. Reclamation's experience, technical expertise, and financial resources assist rural communities to identify their water supply problems and needs, and evaluate options for addressing those needs. Using a regional or watershed perspective, Reclamation assists in planning projects that maximize regional and national benefits. Through this program, Reclamation works in cooperation with non-Federal project sponsors in Reclamation States on a cost-share basis to:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Investigate and identify opportunities to ensure safe and adequate rural water supplies for domestic, municipal, and industrial use in rural areas and small communities, including Indian tribes;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Plan the design and construction of rural water supply projects through the conduct of appraisal investigations and feasibility studies; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Oversee, as appropriate, the construction of rural water supply projects that the Secretary recommends to Congress, which are subsequently authorized and funded for construction by Congress.</p>
