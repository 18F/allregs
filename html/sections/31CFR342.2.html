                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Savings notes were issued only in registered form and  are nontransferable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Term. A savings note was dated as of the first day of the month  in which payment of the purchase price was received by an issuing agent.  A note had an original maturity period of 4 years and 6 months and has  been granted two 10-year extensions of maturity and an additional  extension of 5 years and 6 months with interest; it will reach final  maturity 30 years from its issue date. A note cannot be called by the  Secretary of the Treasury prior to maturity and was not redeemable  during the first year from issue date. Thereafter, a note may be  redeemed at the option and request of the owner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Denominations and purchase prices. Savings notes were issued on  a discount basis. The denominations and purchase prices were as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Purchase</p><p class="depth2">Denomination                             price ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $25.......................................................        $20.25 50........................................................         40.50 75........................................................         60.75 100.......................................................         81.00 ------------------------------------------------------------------------   Interest is paid as a part of the redemption value. A note increased in  value one year after issue date and increases at the beginning of each  half-year period thereafter until final maturity, at which time interest  ceases to accrue. Interest on a note which is redeemed before maturity  ceases to accrue at the end of the interest period next preceding the  redemption date, except that if the note is redeemed on a date on which  the redemption value increases, interest ceases to accrue on that date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Inscription and issue. At the time of issue, the authorized  issuing agent:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inscribed on the face of each note the name and address of the  owner and the name of the beneficiary, if any, or the names of the  coowner;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Entered the issue date in the right-hand portion of the note in  the space provided for that purpose; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Imprinted thereunder, by use of the agent's validation indicia  for the issue of Series E savings bonds, the date the note was actually  inscribed. A note is valid only if an authorized issuing agent received  payment therefor and duly inscribed, dated, imprinted validation indicia  on the note and delivered it.</p>
