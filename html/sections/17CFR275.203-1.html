Subject to paragraph (b), to apply for registration with the Commission as an investment adviser, you must complete Form ADV [17 CFR 279.1] by following the instructions in the form and you must file Part 1A of Form ADV and the firm brochure(s) required by Part 2A of Form ADV electronically with the Investment Adviser Registration Depository (IARD) unless you have received a hardship exemption under Sec. 275.203-3. You are not required to file with the Commission the brochure supplements required by Part 2B of Form ADV.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Transition to electronic filing. If you apply for registration after January 1, 2011, you must file a brochure(s) that satisfies the requirements of Part 2A of Form ADV electronically with the IARD, unless you have received a continuing hardship exemption under Sec. 275.203-3.</p><p class="depth2">Note to paragraphs (a) and (b):</p><p class="depth2">Information on how to file with the IARD is available on the Commission's Web site at http://www.sec.gov/iard. If you are not required to deliver a brochure to any clients, you are not required to prepare or file a brochure with the Commission. If you are not required to deliver a brochure supplement to any clients for any particular supervised person, you are not required to prepare a brochure supplement for that supervised person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When filed. Each Form ADV is considered filed with the Commission upon acceptance by the IARD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Filing fees. You must pay FINRA (the operator of the IARD) a filing fee. The Commission has approved the amount of the filing fee. No portion of the filing fee is refundable. Your completed application for registration will not be accepted by FINRA, and thus will not be considered filed with the Commission, until you have paid the filing fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> ``Private adviser'' transition rule. If you are exempt from registration with the Commission as an investment adviser under, and are not registered in reliance on, section 203(b)(3) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80b-3(b)(3)) on July 20, 2011, you are exempt from registration with the Commission as an investment adviser until March 30, 2012, provided that you:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During the course of the preceding twelve months, have had fewer than fifteen clients; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Neither hold yourself out generally to the public as an investment adviser nor act as an investment adviser to any investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a), or a company which has elected to be a business

development company pursuant to section 54 of that Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-54) and has not withdrawn its election.
