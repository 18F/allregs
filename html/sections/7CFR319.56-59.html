                                Sec. 319.56-59  Fresh citrus fruit from Uruguay.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Sweet oranges (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck), lemons (C. limon (L.)  Burm. f.), mandarins (C. reticulata Blanco, C. clementina Hort. ex  Tanaka, C. deliciosa Ten., and C. unshiu Marcow), Citrus hybrids,  Fortunella japonica (Thunb.) Swingle, and F. margarita (Lour.) Swingle  may be imported into the continental United States from Uruguay only  under the conditions described in this section. These species are  referred to collectively in this section as ``citrus fruit.'' These  conditions are designed to prevent the introduction of the following  quarantine pests: Anastrepha fraterculus, Ceratitis capitata,  Cryptoblabes gnidiella, Elsino[euml] australis, Gymnandrosoma  aurantianum, and Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Commercial consignments. Citrus fruit from Uruguay may be  imported in commercial consignments only.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The national plant protection  organization (NPPO) of Uruguay must provide a bilateral workplan to  APHIS that details the activities that the Uruguayan NPPO will, subject  to APHIS' approval of the workplan, carry out to meet the requirements  of this section. APHIS will be directly involved with the Uruguayan NPPO  in monitoring and auditing implementation of the systems approach.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All places of production and packinghouses that participate in  the export program must be registered with the Uruguayan NPPO.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The fruit must be grown at places of production that meet the  requirements of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The fruit must be packed for export to the United States in a  packinghouse that meets the requirements of paragraph (f) of this  section. The place of production where the fruit was grown must remain  identifiable when   the fruit leaves the grove, at the packinghouse, and throughout the  export process. Boxes containing fruit must be marked with the identity  and origin of the fruit. Safeguarding in accordance with paragraph  (f)(3) of this section must be maintained at all times during the  movement of the fruit to the United States and must be intact upon  arrival of the fruit in the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Monitoring and oversight. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Uruguayan NPPO must visit and  inspect registered places of production monthly, starting at least 30  days before harvest and continuing until the end of the shipping season,  to verify that the growers are complying with the requirements of  paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In addition to conducting fruit inspections at the  packinghouses, the Uruguayan NPPO must monitor packinghouse operations  to verify that the packinghouses are complying with the requirements of  paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Uruguayan NPPO finds that a place of production or  packinghouse is not complying with the relevant requirements of this  section, no fruit from the place of production or packinghouse will be  eligible for export to the United States until APHIS and the Uruguayan  NPPO conduct an investigation and appropriate remedial actions have been  implemented.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Grove monitoring and pest control. Trapping must be conducted in  the places of production to demonstrate that the places of production  have a low prevalence of A. fraterculus and C. capitata. If the  prevalence rises above levels specified in the bilateral workplan,  remedial measures must be implemented. The Uruguayan NPPO must keep  records of fruit fly detections for each trap and make the records  available to APHIS upon request. The records must be maintained for at  least 1 year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Orchard sanitation. Places of production must be maintained free  of fallen fruit and plant debris. Fallen fruit may not be included in  field containers of fruit brought to the packinghouse to be packed for  export.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Packinghouse procedures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The packinghouse must be equipped  with double self-closing doors at the entrance to the packinghouse and  at the interior entrance to the area where fruit is packed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any vents or openings (other than the double self-closing doors)  must be covered with 1.6 mm or smaller screening in order to prevent the  entry of pests into the packinghouse.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fruit must be packed within 24 hours of harvest in a pest- exclusionary packinghouse or stored in a degreening chamber in a pest- exclusionary packinghouse. The fruit must be safeguarded by an insect- proof screen or plastic tarpaulin while in transit to the packinghouse  and while awaiting packing. Fruit must be packed in insect-proof cartons  or containers, or covered with insect-proof mesh or a plastic tarpaulin,  for transport to the United States. These safeguards must remain intact  until the arrival of the fruit in the continental United States or the  consignment will not be allowed to enter the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> During the time the packinghouse is in use for exporting citrus  fruit to the continental United States, the packinghouse may only accept  fruit from registered places of production.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Culling must be performed in the packinghouse to remove any  symptomatic or damaged fruit. Fruit must be practically free of leaves,  twigs, and other plant parts, except for stems that are less than 1 inch  long and attached to the fruit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Fruit must be washed, brushed, surface disinfected in accordance  with part 305 of this chapter, treated with an APHIS-approved fungicide  in accordance with labeled instructions, and waxed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Treatment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Citrus fruit other than lemons may be imported  into the continental United States only if it is treated in accordance  with part 305 of this chapter for A. fraterculus and C. capitata.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Lemons may be shipped without a treatment if harvested green  and if the phytosanitary certificate accompanying the lemons contains an  additional declaration stating that the lemons were harvested green  between May 15 and August 31.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the lemons are harvested between September 1 and May 14, or  if   the fruit is harvested yellow, the lemons must be treated in accordance  with part 305 of this chapter for C. capitata.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Phytosanitary certificate. Each consignment of citrus fruit must  be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate of inspection issued by  the Uruguayan NPPO stating that the fruit in the consignment is free of  all pests of quarantine concern and has been produced in accordance with  the requirements of the systems approach in 7 CFR 319.56-59.
