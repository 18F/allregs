The lists are intended to be  representative, but not exhaustive. The appearance of an item in a list  warrants the inclusion of the item in the account mentioned only when  the text of the account also indicates inclusion inasmuch as the same  item frequently appears in more than one list. The proper entry in each  instance must be determined by the texts of the accounts.</p>
