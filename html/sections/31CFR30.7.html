                                Sec. 30.7  Q-7: How does a TARP recipient comply with the certification
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Certification. The compensation committee must provide the  certifications required by Sec. 30.4 (Q-4) of this part stating that it  has reviewed, with the TARP recipient's senior risk officers, the SEO  compensation plans to ensure that these plans do not encourage SEOs to  take unnecessary and excessive risks, the employee compensation plans to  limit any unnecessary risks these plans pose to the TARP recipient, and  the employee compensation plans to eliminate any features of these plans  that would encourage the manipulation of reported earnings of the TARP  recipient to enhance the compensation of any employee. For any period  during which no obligation arising from financial assistance provided  under the TARP remains outstanding, the requirements under this  paragraph shall be modified to be consistent with Sec. 30.4(d) (Q- 4(d)). Providing a statement similar to the following and in the manner  provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, as applicable, would  satisfy this standard: ``The compensation committee certifies that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It has reviewed with senior risk officers the senior executive  officer (SEO) compensation plans and has made all reasonable efforts to  ensure that these plans do not encourage SEOs to take unnecessary and  excessive risks that threaten the value of [identify TARP recipient];</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It has reviewed with senior risk officers the employee  compensation plans and has made all reasonable efforts to limit any  unnecessary risks these plans pose to the [identify TARP recipient]; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> It has reviewed the employee compensation plans to eliminate any  features of these plans that would encourage the manipulation of  reported earnings of [identify TARP recipient] to enhance the  compensation of any employee.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disclosure. At least once per TARP recipient fiscal year, the  compensation committee must provide a narrative description identifying  each SEO compensation plan and explaining how the SEO compensation plan  does not encourage the SEOs to take unnecessary and excessive risks that  threaten the value of the TARP recipient. The compensation committee  must also identify each employee compensation plan, explain how any  unnecessary risks posed by the employee compensation plan have been  limited, and further explain how the employee compensation plan does not  encourage the manipulation of reported earnings to enhance the  compensation of any employee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Location. For TARP recipients with securities registered with  the SEC pursuant to the Federal securities law, the compensation  committee must provide these certifications and disclosures in the  Compensation Committee Report required pursuant to Item 407(e) of  Regulation S-K under the Federal securities laws (17 CFR 229.407(e)) and  to Treasury. These disclosures must be provided in the Compensation  Committee Report for any disclosure pertaining to any fiscal year any  portion of which is a TARP period (for a TARP recipient with an  obligation), or for any disclosure pertaining to any fiscal year  including a date on or before the sunset date (for a TARP recipient that  has never had an obligation). Within 120 days of the completion of a  fiscal year during any part of which is a TARP period (for a TARP  recipient with an obligation), or the completion of a fiscal year  including a date on or before the sunset date (for a TARP recipient that  has never had an obligation), a TARP recipient that is a smaller  reporting company must provide the certifications of the compensation  committee to its primary regulatory agency and to Treasury.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Application to private TARP recipients. The rules provided in  paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section are also applicable to TARP  recipients that do not have securities registered with the SEC pursuant  to the Federal securities laws. Within 120 days of the completion of the  fiscal year during any part of which is a TARP period (for a TARP  recipient with an obligation), or the completion of a fiscal year  including a date on or before the sunset date (for a TARP recipient that  has never had an obligation), a private TARP recipient   must provide the certification of the compensation committee (or board  of directors, as applicable under Sec. 30.4 (Q-4)) to its primary  regulatory agency and to Treasury.</p>
