                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Authorization Validated End-User (VEU) permits the export, reexport,  and transfer to validated end-users of any eligible items that will be  used in a specific eligible destination. Validated end-users are those  who have been approved in advance pursuant to the requirements of this  section. To be eligible for authorization VEU, exporters, reexporters,  and potential validated end-users must adhere to the conditions and  restrictions set forth in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section. If  a request for VEU authorization for a particular end-user is not  granted, no new license requirement is triggered. In addition, such a  result does not render the end-user ineligible for license approvals  from BIS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Eligible end-users. The only end-users to whom eligible items  may be exported, reexported, or transferred under VEU are those  validated end-users identified in Supplement No. 7 to Part 748,  according to the provisions in this section and those set forth in  Supplement Nos. 8 and 9 to this part that have been granted VEU status  by the End-User Review Committee (ERC) according to the process set  forth in Supplement No. 9 to this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Requests for authorization must be submitted in the form of an  advisory opinion request, as described in Sec. 748.3(c)(2), and should  include a list of   items (items for purposes of authorization VEU include commodities,  software and technology, except as excluded by paragraph (c) of this  section), identified by ECCN, that exporters or reexporters intend to  export, reexport or transfer to an eligible end-user, once approved. To  ensure a thorough review, requests for VEU authorization must include  the information described in Supplement No. 8 to this part. Requests for  authorization will be accepted from exporters, reexporters or end-users.  Submit the request to: The Office of Exporter Services, Bureau of  Industry and Security, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and  Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230. Mark the  package ``Request for Authorization Validated End-User.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In evaluating an end-user for eligibility under authorization  VEU, the ERC will consider a range of information, including such  factors as: the entity's record of exclusive engagement in civil end-use  activities; the entity's compliance with U.S. export controls; the need  for an on-site review prior to approval; the entity's capability of  complying with the requirements of authorization VEU; the entity's  agreement to on-site reviews to ensure adherence to the conditions of  the VEU authorization by representatives of the U.S. Government; and the  entity's relationships with U.S. and foreign companies. In addition,  when evaluating the eligibility of an end-user, the ERC will consider  the status of export controls and the support and adherence to  multilateral export control regimes of the government of the eligible  destination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The VEU authorization is subject to revision, suspension or  revocation entirely or in part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Information submitted in a VEU request is deemed to constitute  continuing representations of existing facts or circumstances. Any  material or substantive change relating to the authorization must be  promptly reported to BIS, whether VEU authorization has been granted or  is still under consideration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Eligible destinations. Authorization VEU may be used for the  following destinations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The People's Republic of China.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> India.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Item restrictions. Items controlled under the EAR for missile  technology (MT) and crime control (CC) reasons may not be exported or  reexported under this authorization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> End-use restrictions. Items obtained under authorization VEU may  be used only for civil end-uses and may not be used for any activities  described in part 744 of the EAR. Exports, reexports, or transfers made  under authorization VEU may only be made to an end-user listed in  Supplement No. 7 to this part if the items will be consigned to and for  use by the validated end-user. Eligible end-users who obtain items under  VEU may only:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Use such items at the end-user's own facility located in an  eligible destination or at a facility located in an eligible destination  over which the end-user demonstrates effective control;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Consume such items during use; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Transfer or reexport such items only as authorized by BIS.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (d): Authorizations set forth in Supplement No. 7  to this part are country-specific. Authorization as a validated end-user  for one country specified in paragraph (b) of this section does not  constitute authorization as a validated end-user for any other country  specified in that paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Certification and recordkeeping. Prior to an initial export or  reexport to a validated end-user under authorization VEU, exporters or  reexporters must obtain certifications from the validated end-user  regarding end-use and compliance with VEU requirements. Such  certifications must include the contents set forth in Supplement No. 8  to this part. Certifications and all records relating to VEU must be  retained by exporters or reexporters in accordance with the  recordkeeping requirements set forth in part 762 of the EAR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Reporting and review requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Reports. Reexporters  who make use of authorization VEU are required to submit annual reports  to BIS. These reports must include, for each validated end-user to whom  the exporter or reexporter exported or reexported eligible items:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The name and address of each validated end-user to whom eligible  items were reexported;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The eligible destination to which the items were reexported;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The quantity of such items;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The value of such items; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The ECCN(s) of such items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reports are due by February 15 of each year, and must cover the  period of January 1 through December 31 of the prior year. Reports must  be sent to: Office of Exporter Services, Bureau of Industry and  Security, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution  Avenue, NW., Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230. Mark the package  ``Authorization Validated End-User Reports''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reviews. Records related to activities covered by authorization  VEU that are maintained by exporters, reexporters, and validated end- users who make use of authorization VEU will be reviewed on a periodic  basis. Upon request by BIS, exporters, reexporters, and validated end- users must allow review of records, including on-site reviews covering  the information set forth in paragraphs (e) and (f)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Notification requirement. Exporters and reexporters shipping  under Authorization VEU and persons transferring (in-country) under  Authorization VEU are required to provide the VEUs to which they are  shipping or transferring notice of the shipment or transfer. Such  notification must be conveyed to the VEU in writing and must include a  list of the VEU-authorized contents of the shipment or transfer and a  list of the ECCNs under which the VEU-authorized items in the shipment  or transfer are classified, as well as a statement that the items are  being, will be, or were shipped or transferred pursuant to Authorization  VEU. Notification of the export, reexport or transfer (in-country) to  the VEU must be made within a timeframe agreed to in writing by the VEU  and the person exporting, reexporting or transferring (in-country). The  VEU and the person exporting, reexporting or transferring (in-country)  must agree to the notification timeframe prior to the initial shipment  or transfer under Authorization VEU. Depending on the agreement between  the VEU and the person exporting, reexporting or transferring (in- country), a notification may be for individual shipments or for multiple  shipments. Exporters, reexporters and VEUs are required to maintain the  notifications they send or receive in accordance with their  recordkeeping requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Termination of Conditions on VEU Authorizations. VEUs that are  subject to item-specific conditions and have received items subject to  such conditions under Authorization VEU are no longer bound by the  conditions associated with the items if the items no longer require a  license for export or reexport to the PRC or India, as applicable, or  become eligible for shipment under a license exception to the  destination. Items that become eligible for a License Exception are  subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable License Exception  and the restrictions in Sec. 740.2 of the EAR. Items that become  eligible for export without a license and that remain subject to the EAR  may only be exported, reexported, transferred (in-country) or disposed  of in accordance with the requirements of the EAR. Termination of VEU  conditions does not relieve a validated end-user of its responsibility  for violations that occurred prior to the availability of a license  exception or prior to the removal of license requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Records. Records of items that were shipped under Authorization  VEU prior to the removal of a license requirement or the availability of  a license exception remain subject to the review requirements of  paragraph (f)(2) of this section on and after the date that the license  requirement was removed or the license exception became applicable.

This explanation must contain an analysis of the item in  terms of the technical control parameters specified in the appropriate  ECCN. If you have not identified a recommended classification in Block  22(a), you must state the reason you cannot determine the appropriate  classification, identifying anything in the regulations that you believe  precluded you from determining the correct classification.</p><p class="depth0">If additional space is necessary, use Block 24 on Form BIS-748P-A or  B.</p><p class="depth0">This Block should be completed if your application includes a 9x515  or ``600 series'' item that is equivalent to a transaction previously  approved under an ITAR license or other approval.

The classification of the 9x515 or ``600 series'' item  in question will no longer be the same because the item would no longer  be ``subject to the ITAR,'' but all other aspects of the description of  the item must be the same in order to be reviewed under this expedited  process under paragraph (x) of Supplement No. 2 to part 748 of the EAR.</p><p class="depth0">Block 25: You, as the applicant or duly authorized agent of the  applicant, must manually sign in this Block.

Supplement No. 5 to Part 748--U.S. Import Certificate and Delivery</p><p class="depth0">Verification Procedure</p><p class="depth0">The United States participates in an Import Certificate/Delivery  Verification procedure. Under this procedure, U.S. importers are  sometimes required to provide their foreign suppliers with an U.S.  International Import Certificate that is validated by the U.S.  Government. This certificate tells the government of the exporter's  country that the items covered by the certificate will be imported into  the U.S. Economy and will not be reexported except as authorized by U.S.  export control regulations. In addition, in some cases, the exporter's  government may require a delivery verification. Under this procedure,  the U.S. Customs Service validates a certificate confirming that the  items have entered the U.S. economy. The U.S. importer must return this  certificate to the foreign exporter.</p><p class="depth0">This supplement establishes the procedures and requirements of BIS  with respect to both of these programs. Paragraph (a) of this supplement  contains the requirements and procedures of the U.S. International  Import Certificate procedure. Paragraph (b) of this supplement contains  the requirements and procedures of the Delivery Verification procedure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> U.S. International Import Certificates. If you are a U.S.  importer, a foreign supplier may request you to obtain a U.S. import  certificate. The reason for this request is that the exporter's  government requires a U.S. import certificate as a condition to issuing  an export license. To obtain such a certificate you will have to fill in  and execute the U.S. International Import Certificate form (Form BIS- 645P/ATF-4522/DSP-53) and submit it to the U.S. government agency that  has jurisdiction over the items you are importing. In doing so, you will  be making a representation to the United States Government that you will  import the items described in the certificate into the United States or  if not so imported, you will not divert, transship or reexport them to  another destination with the explicit approval of the U.S. government  agency that has jurisdiction over those items. (Representations that  items will be entered into the U.S. do not preclude the temporary  unloading of items in a foreign trade zone for subsequent entry into the  economy of the U.S.) If the items described in the certificate are  subject to U.S. Department of Commerce jurisdiction, the Department will  validate the certificate and return it to you. You may then send the  certificate to your foreign supplier. In this way the government of the  exporting country is assured that the items will become subject to the  export control laws of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Items for which the U.S. Department of Commerce issues U.S.  International Import   Certificates and forms to use. The Department of Commerce issues U.S.  International Import Certificates for the following types of items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Items controlled for National Security reasons. Items under the  export licensing jurisdiction of BIS that are identified as controlled  for national security reasons on the Commerce Control List (Supplement  No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR). You will need to submit in triplicate a  completed Form BIS-645P/ATF-4522/DSP-53;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Nuclear equipment and materials. Items subject to the export  licensing jurisdiction of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for nuclear  equipment and materials. (see 10 CFR part 110). You will need to submit  in quadruplicate a completed Form BIS-645P/ATF-4522/DSP-53; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Munitions Items. Items listed on the U.S. Munitions List (see  22 CFR part 121) that do not appear on the more limited U.S. Munitions  Import List (27 CFR 47.21). You will need to submit in triplicate a  completed Form BIS-645P. For triangular transactions (See paragraph  (a)(5) of this supplement) involving items on the U.S. Munitions List,  you must contact the Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade  Controls and use Form BIS-645P/ATF-4522/DSP-53. You should contact the  Treasury Department, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms for items  appearing on the U.S. Munitions Import List. You will need to use Form  ATF-4522.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where to submit forms. U.S. International Import Certificates  and requests to amend certificates may be presented for validation  either in person or by mail at the following locations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> By courier to the Bureau of Industry and Security, Room 2099B,  14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20230, Attn:  Import Certificate Request; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In person or by mail at one of the following Department of  Commerce U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service District Offices:  Boston, MA Buffalo, NY Chicago, IL Cincinnati, OH Cleveland, OH Dallas, TX Detroit, MI Houston, TX Kansas City, MO Los Angeles, CA Miami, FL New Orleans, LO New York, NY Philadelphia, PA Phoenix, AZ Pittsburgh, PA Portland, OR St. Louis, MO San Francisco, CA Savannah, GA Seattle, WA Trenton, NJ</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> U.S. International Import Certificate validity periods. The U.S.  International Import Certificate must be submitted to the foreign  government within six months from the date of certification by the U.S.  Department of Commerce. The expiration of this six-month period in no  way affects the responsibility of the importer to fulfill the  commitments made in obtaining the certificate. If the certificate is not  presented to the government of the exporting country before the  expiration of its validity period, the exporter must apply for a new  certificate. The original unused U.S. International Import Certificate  must be returned to BIS at the address specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i)  of this supplement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Statements on the certificate or amendments are representations  to the U.S. Government which continue in effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All statements and representations made in a U.S. International  Import Certificate or an amendment thereto, will be deemed to be  continuing in nature until the transaction described in the certificate  is completed and the items are delivered into the economy of the  importing country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any change of fact or intention in regard to the transaction  described in the certificate shall be promptly disclosed to BIS by the  U.S. importer by presentation of an amended certificate. The amended  certificate must describe all of the changes and be accompanied by the  original certificate bearing the certification of BIS. If the original  certificate has been transferred to the foreign exporter, you must,  where possible, attempt to obtain the original certificate prior to  applying for an amendment. If the original certificate is unobtainable  because the foreign exporter has submitted it to the appropriate foreign  government, or for any other reason, then you must submit a written  statement with your amendment giving the reasons for your failure to  submit the original certificate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Certificates for Triangular transaction (items will not enter  the U.S. or applicant is not sure that they will enter the United  States).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In accordance with international practice, BIS will, upon  request, stamp the certificate with a triangular symbol as notification  to the government of the exporting country that the U.S. importer is  uncertain whether the items will be imported into the U. S. or knows  that the items will not be imported into the U.S., but that, in any  case, the items will not be delivered to any other destination except in  accordance with the EAR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The triangular symbol on a certificate U.S. International  Import Certificate is not, in and of itself, an approval by BIS to  transfer or sell items to a foreign consignee. Note that a triangular  Certificate will not be issued covering foreign excess property sold  abroad by the U.S. Department of Defense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Approval to export items to a foreign consignee prior to  delivery under a U.S. International Import Certificate. The written  approval of BIS is required before items covered by a U.S. International  Import Certificate (whether or not bearing a triangular symbol) may be  shipped to a destination   other than the U.S. or Canada or sold to a foreign purchaser, and before  title to or possession of such items may be transferred to a foreign  transferee. This requirement does not apply after the items have been  delivered in accordance with the undertaking set forth in the  Certificate or if at the time of such shipment, sale, passage of  possession or passage of title, a License Exception or a NLR provision  of the EAR would authorize the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this supplement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The letter must contain the certificate number; date issued;  location of the issuing office; names, addresses, and identities of all  parties to the complete transaction; and the quantity, dollar value, and  description of the items. The letter must be accompanied by the U.S.  International Import Certificate, and all other documentation required  by the EAR for the item and country of ultimate destination, as  identified in part 748 of the EAR. If requirements stated in part 748 of  the EAR do not apply to your transaction, you must identify the intended  end-use of the items in your letter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Where the letter request is approved and is supported by a  foreign import certificate, no further approval from BIS is required for  the purchaser or transferee to resell or again transfer the items.  However, where BIS approves a request that was not supported by a  foreign import certificate, the person to whom approval is granted is  required to inform the purchaser or transferee, in writing, that the  items are to be shipped to the approved destination only and that no  other disposition of the items is permitted without the approval of BIS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If the transaction is approved, a validated letter of approval  will be sent to the U.S. purchaser for retention in his records. Where a  DV or other official government confirmation of delivery is required,  the letter will so indicate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If the items covered by a certificate have been imported into a  destination other than the U.S. and the foreign exporter of the items  requests a Delivery Verification, the person who obtained the  certificate must obtain a DV from the person to whom the items were  delivered in the actual importing country. (If a DV is unobtainable,  other official government confirmation of delivery must be obtained.)  The DV or other official government confirmation of delivery must be  submitted to BIS together with an explanatory letter giving the U.S.  International Import Certificate number, date issued, and location of  issuing office. BIS will then issue Form ITA-6008, Delivery Compliance  Notice, in two copies, the original of which must be forwarded to the  country of origin in order to serve as evidence to the exporting country  that the requirements of the U.S. Government have been satisfied with  respect to delivery of the items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Delivery, sale, or transfer of items to another U.S. purchaser.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Items covered by a U.S. International Import Certificate may not  be sold, and title to or possession of such items may not be  transferred, to another U.S. purchaser or transferee before the items  are delivered to the U.S. (or to an approved foreign destination, as  provided by paragraph (a)(5) of this supplement), except in accordance  with the provisions described in paragraph (a)(6) of this supplement.  The provisions of this paragraph do not apply after the items have been  delivered in accordance with the undertaking set forth in the  certificate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Resale or transfer to another U.S. purchaser or transferee  requires the prior approval of BIS only in cases where the buyer or  transferee is listed in Supplement No. 1 to part 766 of the EAR.  However, you, as the person who obtained the certificate are required to  notify BIS of any change in facts or intentions relating to the  transaction, and in all cases you will be held responsible for the  delivery of the items in accordance with the EAR. You are required in  all cases to secure, prior to sale or transfer, and to retain in your  files in accordance with the recordkeeping provisions contained in part  762 of the EAR, written acceptance by the purchaser or transferee of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All obligations undertaken by, and imposed under the EAR, upon  the holder of the certificate; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An undertaking that all subsequent sales or transfers will be  made subject to the same conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The responsibility of the certificate holder for obtaining a DV  also applies to those cases where the items are resold to a U.S.  purchaser (See paragraph (b)(1) of this supplement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Reexport or transshipment of items after delivery to U.S.  Items imported into the U.S. under the provisions of a U.S.  International Import Certificate may not be reexported to any  destination under the intransit provisions of License Exception TMP (see  Sec. 740.9(b)(1) of the EAR). However, all other provisions of the EAR  applicable to items of domestic origin shall apply to the reexport of  items of foreign origin shipped to the U.S. under a U.S. International  Import Certificate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Lost or destroyed U.S. International Import Certificates. If  a U.S. International Import Certificate is lost or destroyed, a  duplicate copy may be obtained by the person in the U.S. who executed  the original U.S. International Import Certificate by submitting to any  of the offices listed in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this supplement new Form  BIS-645P/ATF-4522/DSP-53 in the same way as an   original request, except that the forms shall be accompanied by a letter  detailing the circumstances under which the original certificate was  lost or destroyed and certifying:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> That the original U.S. International Import Certificate No. ---- --, dated ------, issued to (name and address of U.S. importer) for  import from (foreign exporter's name and address) has been lost or  destroyed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> That if the original U.S. International Import Certificate is  found, the applicant agrees to return the original or duplicate of the  certificate to the Bureau of Industry and Security.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Unused U.S. International Import Certificates.

U.S. importers may be  requested by their foreign suppliers to furnish them with a certified  Form BIS-647P, Delivery Verification Certificate, covering items  imported into the U.S. These requests are made by foreign governments to  assure that strategic items shipped to the U.S. are not diverted from  their intended destination. In these instances, the issuance of an  export license by the foreign country is conditioned upon the subsequent  receipt of a Delivery Verification Certificate from the U.S. importer.  Accordingly, your compliance with your foreign exporter's request for a  Delivery Verification is necessary to ensure your foreign exporter  fulfills its government obligations and is able to participate in future  transactions with you. Failure to comply may subject your exporter to  penalties that may prevent future trade.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The responsibility of a person or firm executing a U.S.  International Import Certificate for providing the foreign exporter with  confirmation of delivery of the items includes instances where the items  are resold or transferred to another U.S. person or firm prior to actual  delivery to the U.S. or to an approved foreign destination. The person  who executed the U.S. International Import Certificate shall secure in  writing from the U.S. purchaser or transferee, and retain in your files  in accordance with the recordkeeping provisions stated in part 762 of  the EAR:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Acceptance of the obligation to provide the purchaser or  transferee with either the Delivery Verification (or other official  government confirmation of delivery if a Delivery Verification is  unobtainable) or assurance that this document was submitted to BIS; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An undertaking that each succeeding U.S. transferee or  purchaser will assume the same obligation or assurance. In each case the  seller or transferor must transmit to the U.S. purchaser or transferee  the U.S. International Import Certificate number covering the export  from the foreign country and request that they pass it on to any other  U.S. purchasers or transferees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of this  supplement and complete all blocks (except those below the line titled  ``To be completed by U.S. Customs Service'') on the form.

Upon completion Form BIS-647P must be  presented, in duplicate, to a U.S. customs office. The U.S. customs  office will certify Form BIS-647P only where the import is made under a  warehouse or consumption entry.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Disposition of certified Delivery Verification Certificates. The  importer must send the original certified Delivery Verification  Certificate to the foreign exporter or otherwise dispose of it in  accordance with the instructions of the exporting country. The duplicate  copy will be retained by the U.S. customs office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(i)</em> Issuance of a U.S. Delivery Compliance Notice in lieu of a  Delivery Verification Certificate. If you are requested to provide a  Delivery Verification Certificate but do not wish to disclose the name  of your customer to the foreign exporter (e.g., in the event that the  items are resold or transferred to another person or firm before the  items enter the U.S.), you may submit an originally completed Form BIS- 647P together with an explanatory letter requesting a Delivery  Compliance Notice, to BIS at the address listed in (a)(2)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this  supplement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> BIS will provide you with a notice signifying that the items  were imported into the U.S. and that a satisfactory DV has been  submitted to BIS.
