                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each locomotive, locomotive consist, or train on any track segment equipped with a PTC system shall be controlled by a locomotive equipped with an onboard PTC apparatus that is fully operative and functioning in accordance with the applicable PTCSP approved under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions. (1) Prior to December 31, 2015, each railroad required to install PTC shall include in its PTCIP specific goals for progressive implementation of onboard systems and deployment of PTC-equipped locomotives such that the safety benefits of PTC

are achieved through incremental growth in the percentage of controlling locomotives operating on PTC lines that are equipped with operative PTC onboard equipment. The PTCIP shall include a brief but sufficient explanation of how those goals will be achieved, including assignment of responsibilities within the organization. The goals shall be expressed as the percentage of trains operating on PTC-equipped lines that are equipped with operative onboard PTC apparatus responsive to the wayside, expressed as an annualized (calendar year) percentage for the railroad as a whole.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prior to December 31, 2015, each railroad required to install PTC shall include in its PTCIP specific goals for progressive implementation of onboard systems and deployment of PTC-equipped locomotives such that the safety benefits of PTC

The progress reports shall be filed not later than December 31, 2017 and, if all necessary locomotives are not yet equipped, on December 31, 2019.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Freight yard movements. For the purpose of freight switching service or freight transfer train service, a locomotive, locomotive consist, or train may operate without onboard PTC apparatus installed or operational where an onboard PTC apparatus is otherwise required by this part only if all of the following six requirements and conditions are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The locomotive, locomotive consist, or train must be engaged in freight switching service or freight transfer train service, including yard, local, industrial, and hostling service, movements in connection with the assembling or disassembling of trains, and work trains;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The movement must originate either:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In a yard; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Within 20 miles of a yard with the yard as the final destination point;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The locomotive, locomotive consist, or train shall not travel to a point in excess of 20 miles from its point of entry onto the PTC-equipped main line track;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The speed of the locomotive, locomotive consist, or train shall not exceed restricted speed, except if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> No other locomotive, locomotive consist, or train is operating on any part of the route without an operational onboard PTC apparatus;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> No working limits are established under part 214 of this chapter on any part of the route; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Either an air brake test under part 232 of this chapter is performed, in which case the locomotive, locomotive consist, or train may proceed at a speed not to exceed 30 miles per hour; or an air brake test under part 232 of this chapter is not performed, in which case the locomotive, locomotive consist, or train may proceed at a speed not to exceed 20 miles per hour;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The speed of the locomotive, locomotive consist, or train shall not exceed restricted speed on PTC-equipped track where the route terminates; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The route of the locomotive or train is protected against conflicting operations by the PTC system and sufficient operating rules to protect against train-to-train collisions, as specified in the PTCSP.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> FRA may, in its discretion, approve yard movement procedures other than the yard movement procedures in paragraphs (b)(5)(i) through (b)(5)(vi) of this section in a PTCSP or an RFA that provide an equivalent or greater level of safety as the requirements of paragraphs (b)(5)(i) through (b)(5)(vi) of this section, where such procedures are similar to those of paragraphs (b)(5)(i) through (b)(5)(vi) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> A locomotive, locomotive consist, or train with an operative onboard PTC apparatus may assist a locomotive, locomotive consist, or train operating without an operative onboard PTC apparatus for purposes such as locomotive malfunction, rescue of locomotive or cars, or to add or remove power, provided that such a movement is made at restricted speed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When a train movement is conducted under the exceptions described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, that movement shall be made in accordance with Sec. 236.1029.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Onboard PTC apparatus. (1) The onboard PTC apparatus shall be so arranged that each member of the crew assigned to perform duties in the locomotive can receive the same PTC information displayed in the same manner and execute any functions necessary to that crew member's duties. The locomotive engineer shall not be required to perform functions related to the PTC system while the train is moving that have the potential to distract the locomotive engineer from performance of other safety-critical duties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The onboard PTC apparatus shall be so arranged that each member of the crew assigned to perform duties in the locomotive can receive the same PTC information displayed in the same manner and execute any functions necessary to that crew member's duties.

The controlling locomotive shall be equipped with a fully operative interface that complies with paragraph (d)(1) of this section and is consistent with appendix E of this part.
