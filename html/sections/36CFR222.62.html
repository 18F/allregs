                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any person claiming ownership under State branding and estray  laws of branded or unbranded horses or burros within a wild horse or  burro territory or range on the National Forest System where such  animals are not authorized must present evidence of ownership to justify  a roundup before permission will be granted to gather such animals.  Claims of ownership with supporting evidence were required to be filed  during a claiming period which expired November 15, 1973. Unauthorized  privately owned horses or burros entering the National Forest System  after November 15, 1973, which become intermingled with wild horses or  burros, may be claimed by filing an application with the District  Ranger. All authorizations to gather claimed animals shall be in writing  in accordance with instructions as the Chief, Forest Service, may  prescribe. After such public notice as an authorized officer deems  appropriate to inform interested parties, gathering operations may be  authorized. The authorization shall provide that the gathering or  roundup be consistent with regulations, and will (1) establish a  specific reasonable period of time to allow the gathering of claimed  animals and (2) stipulate other conditions, including visual observation  by Forest Service personnel deemed necessary to ensure humane treatment  of associated wild free-roaming horses and burros and to protect other  resources involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Prior to removal of claimed animals which have been captured  from the National Forest System, claimants shall substantiate their  claim of ownership in accordance with whatever criteria are  cooperatively agreed to between the Forest Service and the State agency  administering the State estray laws. In the absence of an agreement,  ownership claims shall be substantiated in accordance with State law and  subject to approval of the Forest Service.</p>
