                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must submit a written request for reinstatement to the EPA  debarring official stating what you believe the conditions were that led  to your conviction, and how those conditions have been corrected,  relieved or addressed. Your request must include documentation  sufficient to support all material assertions you make. The debarring  official must determine that all the technical and non-technical causes,  conditions and consequences of your actions have been sufficiently  addressed so that the Government can confidently conduct future business  activities with you, and that your future operations will be conducted  in compliance with the CAA and CWA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You may begin the reinstatement process by having informal  discussions with the EPA representative named in your notification of  listing. Having informal dialogue with that person will make you aware  of the EPA concerns that must be addressed. The EPA representative is  not required to negotiate conditions for your reinstatement. However,  beginning the reinstatement process with informal dialogue increases the  chance of achieving a favorable outcome, and avoids unnecessary delay  that may result from an incomplete or inadequate reinstatement request.  It may also allow you to resolve your disqualification by reaching an  agreement with the EPA debarring official under informal procedures.  Using your informal option first does not prevent you from submitting a  formal reinstatement request with the debarring official at any time.</p>
