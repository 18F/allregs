                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A capital grant may be used to procure one or more  vans, as stated in a NOFA, to provide transportation or outreach for the  purpose of providing supportive services. The grant may cover the  purchase price, sales taxes, and title and licensing fees. Title to the  van must vest solely in the applicant, and the applicant must insure the  van to the same extent they would insure a van bought with their own  funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Who can apply for a van. VA will only award vans to applicants  who currently have an operational grant under this part, or in  conjunction with a new application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Application packages for van(s). In order to receive a van, the  application must demonstrate the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Clear need for the van(s);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specific use of the van(s);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Frequency of use of the van(s);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Qualifications of the van driver(s);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Training of the van driver(s);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Type of van(s) to be obtained; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Adequate financial support will be available for the completion  of the project or for the purchase and maintenance, repair, and  operation of the van(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Rating criteria. Applications will be scored using the selection  criteria listed in this section. To be eligible for a van grant, an  applicant must receive at least 80 points (out of a possible 100) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Need. VA will award up to 60 points based on the extent to which  the applicant demonstrates a substantial unmet need for transportation  due to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Lack of alternative public transportation,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Project location,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Expired life use of current van, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Special disabled individual transportation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Activity. VA will award up to 20 points based on the extent to  which the applicant demonstrates:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Frequency of use,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Type of use, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Type of van, e.g., whether there is a justification for a van  with a wheelchair lift or other modifications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Operator qualification. VA will award up to 20 points based on  the extent to which the applicant demonstrates a job description for the  van operator that details:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Requirements of the position, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Training that will be provided to the driver.
