If the employee does not have the required  enrollment, the agency must notify him or her that it has received the  court or administrative order and give the employee until the end of the  following pay period to change his or her enrollment or provide  documentation to the employing office that he or she has other coverage  for the child or children. If the employee does not comply within these  time frames, the employing office must enroll the employee involuntarily  as stated in paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the employee is not enrolled or does not enroll, the agency  must enroll him or her for self and family coverage in the option that  provides the lower level of coverage in the Service Benefit Plan.
