                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Initial opportunity to enroll. An employee who becomes eligible may elect to enroll or not to enroll within 60 days after becoming eligible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Effective date--generally. Except as otherwise provided, an enrollment or change of enrollment takes effect on the first day of the first pay period that begins after the date the employing office receives an appropriate request to enroll or change the enrollment and that follows a pay period during any part of which the employee is in pay status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Belated enrollment. When an employing office determines that an employee was unable, for cause beyond his or her control, to enroll or change the enrollment within the time limits prescribed by this section, the employee may enroll or change the enrollment within 60 days after the employing office advises the employee of its determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Enrollment by proxy. Subject to the discretion of the employing office, an employee's representative, having written authorization to do so, may enroll or change the enrollment for the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Decreasing enrollment type. (1) Subject to two exceptions, an employee may decrease enrollment type at any time. Exceptions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An employee participating in health insurance premium conversion may decrease enrollment type during an open season or because of and consistent with a qualifying life event as defined in part 892 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An employee who is subject to a court or administrative order as discussed in paragraph (g)(3) of this section may not decrease enrollment type in a way that eliminates coverage of a child identified in the order as long as the court or administrative order is still in effect and the employee has at least one child identified in the order who is still eligible under the FEHB Program, unless the employee provides documentation to the agency that he or she has other coverage for the child(ren). The employee may not elect self only as long as he or she has one child identified as covered, but may elect self plus one.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A decrease in enrollment type takes effect on the first day of the first pay period that begins after the date the employing office receives an appropriate request to change the enrollment, except that at the request of the enrollee and upon a showing satisfactory to the employing office that there was no family member eligible for coverage under the self plus one or self and family enrollment, or only one family member eligible for coverage under the self and family enrollment, as appropriate, the employing office may make the change effective on the first day of the pay period following the one in which there was, in the case of a self plus one enrollment, no family member or, in the case of a self and family enrollment, only one or no family member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Open season. (1) An open season will be held each year from the Monday of the second full workweek in November through the Monday of the second full workweek in December.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Director of the Office of Personnel Management may modify the dates specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section or hold additional open seasons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> With one exception, during an open season, an eligible employee may enroll and an enrolled employee may decrease or increase enrollment type, may change from one plan or option to another, or may make any combination of these changes. Exception: An employee who is subject to a court or administrative order as discussed in paragraph (g)(3) of this section may not cancel his or her enrollment, decrease enrollment type, or change to a comprehensive medical plan that does not

serve the area where his or her child or children live as long as the court or administrative order is still in effect, and the employee has at least one child identified in the order who is still eligible under the FEHB Program, unless the employee provides documentation to the agency that he or she has other coverage for the child(ren). The employee may not elect self only as long as he or she has one child identified as covered, but may elect self plus one.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(i)</em> An open season new enrollment takes effect on the first day of the first pay period that begins in the next following year and which follows a pay period during any part of which the employee is in a pay status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An open season new enrollment takes effect on the first day of the first pay period that begins in the next following year and which follows a pay period during any part of which the employee is in a pay status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An open season change of enrollment takes effect on the first day of the first pay period which begins in January of the next following year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> When a belated open season enrollment or change of enrollment is accepted by the employing office under paragraph (c) of this section, it takes effect as required by paragraph (f)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Change in family status. (1) An eligible employee may enroll and an enrolled employee may decrease or increase enrollment type, change from one plan or option to another, or make any combination of these changes when the employee's family status changes, including a change in marital status or any other change in family status. The employee must enroll or change the enrollment within the period beginning 31 days before the date of the change in family status, and ending 60 days after the date of the change in family status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An enrollment or change of enrollment made in conjunction with the birth of a child, or the addition of a child as a new family member in some other manner, takes effect on the first day of the pay period in which the child is born or becomes an eligible family member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(i)</em> If an employing office receives a court or administrative order on or after October 30, 2000, requiring an employee to provide health benefits for his or her child or children, the employing office will determine if the employee has a self plus one or self and family enrollment, as appropriate, in a health benefits plan that provides full benefits in the area where the child or children live. If the employee does not have the required enrollment, the agency must notify him or her that it has received the court or administrative order and give the employee until the end of the following pay period to change his or her enrollment or provide documentation to the employing office that he or she has other coverage for the child or children. If the employee does not comply within these time frames, the employing office must enroll the employee involuntarily as stated in paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If an employing office receives a court or administrative order on or after October 30, 2000, requiring an employee to provide health benefits for his or her child or children, the employing office will determine if the employee has a self plus one or self and family enrollment, as appropriate, in a health benefits plan that provides full benefits in the area where the child or children live. If the employee does not have the required enrollment, the agency must notify him or her that it has received the court or administrative order and give the employee until the end of the following pay period to change his or her enrollment or provide documentation to the employing office that he or she has other coverage for the child or children. If the employee does not comply within these time frames, the employing office must enroll the employee involuntarily as stated in paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the employee is not enrolled or does not enroll, the agency must enroll him or her for self plus one or self and family coverage, as appropriate, in the option that provides the lower level of coverage in the Service Benefit Plan. If the employee is enrolled but does not increase the enrollment type in a way that is sufficient to cover the child or children, the employing office must change the enrollment to self plus one or self and family, as appropriate, in the same option and plan, as long as the plan provides full benefits in the area where the child or children live. If the employee is enrolled in a comprehensive medical plan that does not serve the area in which the child or children live, the employing office must change the enrollment to self plus one or self and family, as appropriate, in the option that provides the lower level of coverage in the Service Benefit Plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Subject to two exceptions, the effective date of an involuntary enrollment under paragraph (g)(3) of this section is the 1st day of the pay period that begins after the date the employing office completes the enrollment request. Exceptions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the court or administrative order requires an earlier effective date, the effective date will be the 1st day of the pay period that includes that date. Effective dates may not be retroactive to a date more than 2 years earlier, or prior to October 30, 2000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If after an involuntary enrollment becomes effective and the employing office finds that circumstances beyond the employee's control prevented him or her from enrolling or

changing the enrollment within the time limits in this section, the employee may change the enrollment prospectively within 60 days after the employing office advises the employee of its finding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Change in employment status. An eligible employee may enroll and an enrolled employee may decrease or increase enrollment type, change from one plan or option to another, or make any combination of these changes when the employee's employment status changes. Except as otherwise provided, an employee must enroll or change the enrollment within 60 days after the change in employment status. Employment status changes include, but are not limited to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A return to pay status following loss of coverage under either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Section 890.304(a)(1)(v) due to the expiration of 365 days in leave without pay (LWOP) status, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 890.502(b)(5) due to the termination of coverage during LWOP status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reemployment after a break in service of more than 3 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Restoration to a civilian position after serving in the uniformed services under conditions that entitle him or her to benefits under part 353 of this chapter, or similar authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(i)</em> A change from a temporary appointment in which the employee is eligible to enroll under 5 U.S.C. 8906a, which requires payment of the full premium with no Government contribution, to an appointment that entitles the employee to receive the Government contribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A change from a temporary appointment in which the employee is eligible to enroll under 5 U.S.C. 8906a, which requires payment of the full premium with no Government contribution, to an appointment that entitles the employee to receive the Government contribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A change in entitlement to Government contribution as a result of becoming eligible for coverage under Sec. 890.102(j).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Separation from Federal employment when the employee or the employee's spouse is pregnant and the employee supplies medical documentation of the pregnancy.

The effective date of an enrollment or a change of enrollment under this paragraph (h)(5) is the first day of the pay period which the employing office receives an appropriate request to enroll or change the enrollment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A transfer from a post of duty within a State of the United States or the District of Columbia to a post of duty outside a State of the United States or the District of Columbia, or the reverse. An employee who enrolls or changes the enrollment under this paragraph (h)(6) must do so within the period beginning 31 days before leaving the old post of duty and ending 60 days after arriving at the new post of duty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> A change, without a break in service or after a separation of 3 days or less, to part-time career employment as defined in 5 U.S.C. 3401(2) and 5 CFR part 340, subpart B, or a change from such part-time career employment to full-time employment that entitles the employee to the full Government contribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Loss of coverage under this part or under another group insurance plan. An eligible employee may enroll and an enrolled employee may decrease or increase enrollment type, change from one plan or option to another, or make any combination of these changes when the employee or an eligible family member of the employee loses coverage under this part or another group health benefits plan.

For an employee who loses coverage under this paragraph (i)(4):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the discontinuance is at the end of a contract year, the employee must change the enrollment during the open
