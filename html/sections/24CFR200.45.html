                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Preapplication conference. Except for mortgages insured under section 241(f) or 242 of the Act, the local HUD Office will determine whether participation in such a conference is required as a condition to submission of an initial application for either a site appraisal and market analysis (SAMA) letter (for new construction), a feasibility letter (for substantial rehabilitation), or for a firm commitment. The project sponsor may elect (after the preapplication conference if required) to submit an application for a SAMA or a feasibility letter (as appropriate), or for a firm commitment for insurance depending upon the completeness of the drawings, specifications and other

required exhibits. An application for a SAMA or feasibility letter may be submitted by the project sponsor. An application for a firm commitment for insurance must be submitted by both the project sponsor and an approved mortgagee. Applications shall be submitted to the local HUD Office on HUD-approved forms. No application will be considered unless accompanied by all exhibits required by the form and program handbooks. At the option of the local HUD Office, the SAMA/Feasibility letter stage of processing can be combined with the firm commitment stage of processing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Firm commitment requirement. An application for a firm commitment must be made by an approved mortgagee for any project for which a mortgagor seeks mortgage insurance under the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Staged applications. Staged applications leading to an application for firm commitment shall be made as determined appropriate by the Commissioner, and in accordance with such terms and conditions established by the Commissioner. The intermediate stages to firm commitment may include a site appraisal and market analysis (SAMA) letter stage or a feasibility letter stage and a conditional commitment. The conditional commitment stage applies only to mortgages to be insured pursuant to section 223(f) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effect of SAMA letter, feasibility letter, and firm commitment--(1) SAMA letter. (i) The issuance of a SAMA letter indicates completion of the site appraisal and market analysis stage to determine initial acceptability of the site and recognition of a specific market need. The SAMA letter is not a commitment to insure a mortgage for the proposed project and does not bind the Commissioner to issue a firm commitment to insure. The SAMA letter precedes the later submission of acceptable plans and specifications for the proposed project and is limited to advising the applicant as to the following determinations of the Commissioner, which shall not be changed to the detriment of an applicant, if the application for a firm commitment is received before expiration of the SAMA letter:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The land value fully improved (with off-site improvements installed);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The acceptability of the proposed project site, the proposed composition, number and size of the units and the market for the number of proposed units. Where the application is not acceptable as submitted, but can be made acceptable by a change in the number, size, or composition of the units, the SAMA letter may establish the specific lesser number of units which would be acceptable and any acceptable alternative plan for the composition and size of units; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The acceptability of the unit rents proposed. Where rent levels are unacceptable, the SAMA letter may establish specific rents which are acceptable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> After receiving a SAMA letter, the sponsor shall submit design drawings and specifications in a timeframe prescribed by the Commissioner. The Commissioner will review and comment on design development and the drawings and specifications. The comments will be provided to the sponsor for use in preparing a firm commitment application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Feasibility letter. The issuance of a feasibility letter indicates approval of the preliminary work write-up and outline specifications and completion of technical processing involving the estimated rehabilitation cost of the project, the ``as is'' value of the site, the detailed estimates of operating expenses and taxes, the specific unit rents, the vacancy allowance, and the estimated mortgage amount. The issuance of a feasibility letter is not a commitment to insure a mortgage for the proposed project and does not bind the Commissioner to issue a firm commitment to insure. Determinations found in a feasibility letter are not to be binding upon the Department and may be changed in whole or in part at any later point in time. The letter may even be unilaterally terminated by the Commissioner if found necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Conditional commitment. The issuance of a Section 223(f) conditional commitment indicates completion of

technical processing involving the estimated value of the property, the detailed estimates of rents, operating expenses and taxes and an estimated mortgage amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Term of SAMA letter, feasibility letter, and conditional commitment. A SAMA letter, a feasibility letter, and a conditional commitment shall be effective for whatever term is specified in the respective letter or commitment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Rejection of an application. A significant deviation in an application from the Commissioner's terms or conditions in an earlier stage application commitment or agreement shall be grounds for rejection. The fees paid to such date shall be considered as having been earned notwithstanding such rejection.
