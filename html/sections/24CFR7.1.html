It is HUD's  policy to provide equality of opportunity in employment in the  Department for all persons; to prohibit discrimination on the basis of  race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability in all  aspects of its personnel policies, programs, practices, and operations  and in all its working conditions and relationships   with current or former employees and applicants for employment; to  prohibit discrimination against any employee because he or she has made  a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an  investigation, proceeding, or hearing concerning an equal employment  opportunity complaint; and to promote the full realization of equal  opportunity in employment through continuing programs of equal  employment opportunity at every level within the Department. Procedures  for filing EEO claims are found in the EEOC regulations at 29 CFR part  1614.
