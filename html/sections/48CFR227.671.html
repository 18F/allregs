                            <p class="depth0">In furtherance of the Military Assistance Program or for other  national defense purposes, the Government may undertake to develop or  encourage the development of foreign additional sources of supply. The  development of such sources may be accomplished by an agreement, often  called a foreign licensing agreement or technical assistance agreement,  wherein a domestic concern, referred to in this subpart as a ``primary  source,'' agrees to furnish to a foreign concern or government, herein  referred to as a ``second source;'' foreign patent rights; technical  assistance in the form of data, know-how, trained personnel of the  primary source, instruction and guidance of the personnel of the second  source, jigs, dies, fixtures, or other manufacturing aids, or such other  assistance, information, rights, or licenses as are needed to enable the  second source to produce particular supplies or perform particular  services. Agreements calling for one or more of the foregoing may be  entered into between the primary source and the Government, a foreign  government, or a foreign concern. The consideration for providing such  foreign license and technical assistance may be in the form of a lump  sum payment, payments for each item manufactured by the second source,  an agreement to exchange data and patent rights on improvements made to  the article or service, capital stock transactions, or any combination  of these. The primary source's bases for computing such consideration  may include actual costs; charges for the use of patents, data, or know- how reflecting the primary source's investment in developing and  engineering and production techniques; and the primary source's  ``price'' for setting up a second source. Such agreements often refer to  the compensation to be paid as a royalty or license fee whether or not  patent rights are involved.</p>
