                            <p class="depth0">Before we issue you a certificate of conformity, you may amend your  application to include new or modified engine configurations, subject to  the provisions of this section. After we have issued your certificate of  conformity, but before the end of the model year, you may send us an  amended application requesting that we include new or modified engine  configurations within the scope of the certificate, subject to the  provisions of this section. You must amend your application if any  changes occur with respect to any information that is included or should  be included in your application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must amend your application before you take any of the  following actions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Add an engine configuration to an engine family. In this case,  the engine configuration added must be consistent with other engine  configurations in the engine family with respect to the criteria listed  in Sec.  1036.230.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Change an engine configuration already included in an engine  family in a way that may affect emissions, or change any of the  components you described in your application for certification. This  includes production and design changes that may affect emissions any  time during the engine's lifetime.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Modify an FEL and FCL for an engine family as described in  paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To amend your application for certification, send the relevant  information to the Designated Compliance Officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Describe in detail the addition or change in the engine model or  configuration you intend to make.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Include engineering evaluations or data showing that the amended  engine family complies with all applicable requirements. You may do this  by showing that the original emission-data engine is still appropriate  for showing that the amended family complies with all applicable  requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the original emission-data engine for the engine family is  not appropriate to show compliance for the new or modified engine  configuration, include new test data showing that the new or modified  engine configuration meets the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> We may ask for more test data or engineering evaluations. You  must give us these within 30 days after we request them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For engine families already covered by a certificate of  conformity, we will determine whether the existing certificate of  conformity covers your newly added or modified engine. You may ask for a  hearing if we deny your request (see Sec.  1036.820).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> is deemed to be consent to recall all engines that we  determine do not meet applicable emission standards or other  requirements and to remedy the nonconformity at no expense to the owner.  If you do not provide information required under paragraph (c) of this  section within 30 days after we request it, you must stop producing the  new or modified engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em>. You may ask us to approve a  change to your FEL in the following cases:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may ask to raise your FEL for your engine family at any  time. In your request, you must show that you will still be able to meet  the emission standards as specified in subparts B and H of this part.  Use the appropriate FELs/FCLs with corresponding production volumes to  calculate emission credits for the model year, as described in subpart H  of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may ask to lower the FEL for your engine family only if you  have test data from production engines showing that emissions are below  the proposed lower FEL (or below the proposed FCL for CO2).  The lower FEL/FCL applies only to engines you produce after we approve  the new FEL/FCL. Use the appropriate FELs/FCLs with corresponding  production volumes to calculate emission credits for the model year, as  described in subpart H of this part.
