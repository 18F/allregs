                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirement. The employer shall ensure that emergency  medical services and first aid are readily accessible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Advice and consultation. The employer shall ensure that  healthcare professionals are readily available for advice and  consultation on matters of workplace health.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> First aid providers. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employer shall ensure that there is  an adequate number of employees trained as first aid providers at each  worksite during each workshift unless:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> There is an on-site clinic or infirmary with first aid providers  during each workshift; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The employer can demonstrate that outside first aid providers  (i.e., emergency medical services) can reach the worksite within five  (5) minutes of a report of injury or illness. The employer must take  appropriate steps to ascertain that emergency medical assistance will be  readily available promptly if an injury or illness occurs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employer shall ensure that a first aid provider is able to  reach an injured/ill employee within five (5) minutes of a report of a  serious injury, illness, or accident such as one involving cardiac  arrest, acute breathing problems, uncontrolled bleeding, suffocation,  electrocution, or amputation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The employer shall use the following factors in determining the  number and location of employees who must have first aid training: size  and location of each worksite; the number of employees at each worksite;  the hazards present at each worksite; and the distance of each worksite  from hospitals, clinics, and rescue squads.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The employer shall ensure that first aid providers are trained  to render first aid, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The employer shall ensure that each first aid provider maintains  current first aid and CPR certifications, such as issued by the Red  Cross, American Heart Association, or other equivalent organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> First aid supplies. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employer shall provide and maintain  adequate first aid supplies that are readily accessible to each  worksite. An employer's on-site infirmary or clinic containing first aid  supplies that are readily accessible to each worksite complies with this  requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employer shall ensure that the placement, content, and  amount of first aid supplies are adequate for the size and location of  each worksite, the number of employees at each worksite, the hazards  present at each worksite, and the distance of each worksite from  hospitals, clinics, and rescue squads.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The employer shall ensure that first aid supplies are placed in  a weatherproof container.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The employer shall maintain first aid supplies in a dry,  sterile, and serviceable condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The employer shall replenish first aid supplies as necessary to  ensure that there is an adequate supply when needed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The employer shall inspect first aid supplies at sufficient  intervals to ensure that they are adequate and in a serviceable  condition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Quick-drenching and flushing facilities. Where the potential  exists for an employee to be splashed with a substance that may result  in an acute or serious injury, the employer shall provide facilities for  quick-drenching or flushing the eyes and body. The employer shall ensure  that such a facility is located for immediate emergency use within close  proximity to operations where such substances are being used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Basket stretchers. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employer shall provide an adequate  number of basket stretchers, or the equivalent, readily accessible to  where work is being performed on a vessel or vessel section. The  employer is not required to provide basket stretchers or the equivalent  where emergency response services have basket stretchers or the  equivalent that meet the requirements of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employer shall ensure each basket stretcher, or the  equivalent, is equipped with:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Permanent lifting bridles that enable the basket stretcher, or  the equivalent, to be attached to hoisting gear capable of lifting at  least 5,000 pounds (2,270 kg);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Restraints that are capable of securely holding the injured/ill  employee while the basket stretcher, or the equivalent, is lifted or  moved; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A blanket or other suitable covering for the injured/ill  employee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The employer shall store basket stretchers, or the equivalent,  and related equipment (i.e., restraints, blankets) in a clearly marked  location in a   manner that prevents damage and protects the equipment from  environmental conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The employer shall inspect stretchers, or the equivalent, and  related equipment at intervals that ensure the equipment remains in a  safe and serviceable condition, but at least once a year.</p><p class="depth3">Appendix A to Sec. 1915.87--First Aid Kits and Automated External</p><p class="depth3">Defibrillators (Non-Mandatory)</p><p class="depth3">1. First aid supplies are required to be adequate and readily  accessible under paragraphs Sec. 1915.87(a) and (d). An example of the  minimal contents of a generic first aid kit for workplace settings is  described in ANSI/ISEA Z308.1-2009, ``Minimum Requirements for Workplace  First Aid Kits and Supplies'' (incorporated by reference as specified in  Sec. 1915.5). The contents of the kit listed in this ANSI standard  should be adequate for small worksites. When larger operations or  multiple operations are being conducted at the same worksite, employers  should determine the need for additional first aid kits, additional  types of first aid equipment and supplies, and additional quantities and  types of supplies and equipment in the first aid kits.</p><p class="depth3">2. In a similar fashion, employers that have unique or changing  first aid needs at their worksite may need to enhance their first aid  kits. The employer can use the OSHA 300 Log, OSHA 301 Incident Report  form, or other reports to identify these unique problems. Consultation  from the local fire or rescue department, appropriate healthcare  professional or local emergency room may be helpful to employers in  these circumstances. By assessing the specific needs of their worksite,  employers can ensure that reasonably anticipated supplies are available.  Employers should assess the specific needs of their worksite  periodically, and augment first aid kits appropriately.</p><p class="depth3">3. If it is reasonably anticipated that employees will be exposed to  blood or other potentially infectious materials while using first aid  supplies, employers must provide appropriate personal protective  equipment (PPE) in compliance with the provisions of the Occupational  Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens standard, Sec. 1910.1030(d)(3). This  standard lists appropriate PPE for this type of exposure, such as  gloves, gowns, face shields, masks, and eye protection.</p><p class="depth3">4. Employers who provide automated external defibrillators (AEDs) at  their workplaces should designate who will use AEDs and train those  employees so they know how to correctly use the AEDs. Although a growing  number of AEDs are now designed to be used by any person, even without  training, training reinforces proper use and promotes the usefulness of  AEDs as part of an effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation plan. For  AEDs to be effective, employers should:</p><p class="depth3">a. Ensure that AEDs are located so they can be utilized within three  to five minutes of a report of an accident or injury;</p><p class="depth3">b. Ensure that employees use AEDs in accordance with manufacturers'  specifications; and</p><p class="depth3">c. Inspect, test, and maintain AEDs in accordance with  manufacturers' specifications.</p>
