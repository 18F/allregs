                            <p class="depth0">The rule in this part comprises the following three hazard  evaluation modules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Explosive Hazard Evaluation (EHE) module.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The EHE module provides a single, consistent, Department-wide  approach for the evaluation of explosive hazards. This module is used  when there is a known or suspected presence of an explosive hazard. The  EHE module is composed of three factors, each of which has two to four  data elements that are intended to assess the specific conditions at an  MRS. These factors are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Explosive hazard, which has the data elements Munitions Type and  Source of Hazard and constitutes 40 percent of the EHE module score.  (See appendix A to this part, tables 1 and 2.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Accessibility, which has the data elements Location of  Munitions, Ease of Access, and Status of Property and constitutes 40  percent of the EHE module score. (See appendix A, tables 3, 4, and 5.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Receptors, which has the data elements Population Density,  Population Near Hazard, Types of Activities/Structures, and Ecological  and/or Cultural Resources and constitutes 20 percent of the EHE module  score. (See appendix A, tables 6, 7, 8, and 9.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Based on MRS-specific information, each data element is assigned  a numeric score, and the sum of these score is the EHE module score. The  EHE module score results in an MRS being placed into one of the  following ratings. (See appendix A, table 10.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> EHE Rating A (Highest) is assigned to MRSs with an EHE module  score from 92 to 100.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> EHE Rating B is assigned to MRSs with an EHE module score from  82 to 91.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> EHE Rating C is assigned to MRSs with an EHE module score from  71 to 81.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> EHE Rating D is assigned to MRSs with an EHE module score from  60 to 70.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> EHE Rating E is assigned to MRSs with an EHE module score from  48 to 59.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> EHE Rating F is assigned to MRSs with an EHE module score from  38 to 47.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> EHE Rating G (Lowest) is assigned to MRSs with an EHE module  score less than 38.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> There are also three other possible outcomes for the EHE module:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Evaluation pending. This category is used when there are known  or suspected UXO or DMM, but sufficient information is not available to  populate the nine data elements of the EHE module.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> No longer required. This category is reserved for MRSs that no  longer require an assigned priority because the Department has conducted  a response, all objectives set out in the decision document for the MRS  have been achieved, and no further action, except for long-term  management and recurring reviews, is required.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> No known or suspected explosive hazard. This category is  reserved for MRSs that do not require evaluation under the EHE module.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The EHE module rating shall be considered with the CHE and HHE  module ratings to determine the MRS priority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> MRSs lacking information for determining an EHE module rating  shall be programmed for additional study and evaluated as soon as  sufficient data are available. Until an EHE module rating is assessed,  MRSs shall be rated as ``evaluation pending'' for the EHE module.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Chemical Warfare Materiel Hazard Evaluation (CHE) module. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  The CHE module provides an evaluation of the chemical hazards associated  with the physiological effects of CWM. The CHE module is used only when  CWM are known or suspected of being present at an MRS. Like the EHE  module, the CHE module has three factors, each of which has two to four  data elements that are intended to assess the conditions at an MRS.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> CWM hazard, which has the data elements CWM Configuration and  Sources of CWM and constitutes 40 percent of the CHE score. (See  appendix A to this part, tables 11 and 12.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Accessibility, which focuses on the potential for receptors to  encounter the CWM known or suspected to be present on an MRS. This  factor consists of three data elements, Location of CWM, Ease of Access,  and Status of Property, and constitutes 40 percent of the CHE score.  (See appendix A, tables 13, 14, and 15.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Receptor, which focuses on the human and ecological  populations that may be impacted by the presence of CWM. It has the data  elements Population Density, Population Near Hazard, Types of  Activities/Structures, and Ecological and/or Cultural Resources and  constitutes 20 percent of the CHE score. (See appendix A, tables 16, 17,  18, and 19.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Similar to the EHE module, each data element is assigned a  numeric score, and the sum of these scores (i.e., the CHE module score)  is used to determine the CHE rating. The CHE module score results in an  MRS being placed into one of the following ratings. (See appendix A,  table 20.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> CHE Rating A (Highest) is assigned to MRSs with a CHE score from  92 to 100.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> CHE Rating B is assigned to MRSs with a CHE score from 82 to  91.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> CHE Rating C is assigned to MRSs with a CHE score from 71 to  81.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> CHE Rating D is assigned to MRSs with a CHE score from 60 to  70.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> CHE Rating E is assigned to MRSs with a CHE score from 48 to 59.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> CHE Rating F is assigned to MRSs with a CHE score from 38 to  47.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> CHE Rating G (Lowest) is assigned to MRSs with a CHE score  less than 38.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> There are also three other potential outcomes for the CHE  module:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Evaluation pending. This category is used when there are known  or suspected CWM, but sufficient information is not available to  populate the nine data elements of the CHE module.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> No longer required. This category is reserved for MRSs that no  longer require an assigned priority because the Department has conducted  a response, all objectives set out in the decision document for the MRS  have been achieved, and no further action, except for long-term  management and recurring reviews, is required.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> No known or suspected CWM hazard. This category is reserved  for MRSs that do not require evaluation under the CHE module.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The CHE rating shall be considered with the EHE module and HHE  module ratings to determine the MRS priority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> MRSs lacking information for assessing a CHE module rating shall  be programmed for additional study and evaluated as soon as sufficient  data are available. Until a CHE module rating is assigned, the MRS shall  be rated as ``evaluation pending'' for the CHE module.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Health Hazard Evaluation (HHE) module.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The HHE provides a consistent Department-wide approach for  evaluating the relative risk to human health and the environment posed  by MC. The HHE builds on the RRSE framework that is used in the  Installation Restoration Program (IRP) and has been   modified to address the unique requirements of MRSs. The HHE module  shall be used for evaluating the potential hazards posed by MC and other  chemical contaminants. The HHE module is intended to evaluate MC at  sites. Any incidental nonmunitions-related contaminants may be addressed  incidental to a munitions response under the MMRP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The module has three factors:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Contamination Hazard Factor (CHF), which indicates MC, and any  nonmunitions-related incidental contaminants present; this factor  contributes a level of High (H), Middle (M), or Low (L) based on  Significant, Moderate, or Minimal contaminants present, respectively.  (See appendix A to this part, table 21.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Receptor Factor (RF), which indicates the receptors; this  factor contributes a level of H, M, or L based on Identified, Potential,  or Limited receptors, respectively. (See appendix A, table 21.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Migration Pathway Factor (MPF), which indicates environmental  migration pathways, and contributes a level of H, M, or L based on  Evident, Potential or Confined pathways, respectively. (See appendix A,  table 21.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The H, M, and L levels for the CHF, RF, and MPF are combined in  a matrix to obtain composite three-letter combination levels that  integrate considerations of all three factors. (See appendix A, table  22.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The three-letter combination levels are organized by frequency,  and the resulting frequencies result in seven HHE ratings. (See appendix  A, table 23.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> HHE Rating A (Highest) is assigned to MRSs with an HHE  combination level of high for all three factors.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> HHE Rating B is assigned to MRSs with a combination level of  high for CHF and RF and medium for MPF (HHM).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> HHE Rating C is assigned to MRSs with a combination level of  high for the CHF and RF and low for MPF (HHL), or high for CHF and  medium for the RF and MPF (HMM).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> HHE Rating D is assigned to MRSs with a combination level of  high for the CHF, medium for the RF, and low for the MPF (HML), or  medium for all three factors (MMM).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> HHE Rating E is assigned to MRSs with a combination level of  high for the CHF and low for the RF and MPF (HLL), or medium for the CHF  and RF and low for the MPF (MML).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> HHE Rating F is assigned to MRSs with a combination level of  medium for the CHF and low for the RF and MPF (MLL).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> HHE Rating G (Lowest) is assigned to MRSs with a combination  level of low for all three factors (LLL).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The HHE three-letter combinations are replaced by the seven HHE  ratings. (See appendix A, table 24.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> There are also three other potential outcomes for the HHE  module:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Evaluation pending. This category is used when there are known  or suspected MC, and any incidental nonmunitions-related contaminants  present, but sufficient information is not available to determine the  HHE module rating.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> No longer required. This category is reserved for MRSs that no  longer require an assigned MRS priority because the Department has  conducted a response, all objectives set out in the decision document  for the MRS have been achieved, and no further action, except for long- term management and recurring reviews, is required.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> No known or suspected munitions constituent hazard. This  rating is reserved for MRSs that do not require evaluation under the HHE  module.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The HHE module rating shall be considered with the EHE and CHE  module ratings to determine the MRS priority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> MRSs lacking information sufficient for assessing an HHE module  rating shall be programmed for additional study and evaluated as soon as  sufficient data are available. Until an HHR module rating is assigned,  the MRS shall be classified as ``evaluation pending'' for the HHE  module.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Determining the MRS priority. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An MRS priority is determined  based on integrating the ratings from the EHE, CHE, and HHE modules.  Until all three hazard evaluation modules have been evaluated, the MRS  priority shall be based on the results of the modules completed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each MRS is assigned to one of eight MRS priorities based on the  ratings of the three hazard evaluation modules, where Priority 1  indicates the highest potential hazard and Priority 8 the lowest  potential hazard. Under the rule in this part, only MRSs with CWM can be  assigned to Priority 1 and no MRS with CWM can be assigned to Priority  8. (See appendix A to this part, table 25.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An ``evaluation pending'' rating is used to indicate that an MRS  requires further evaluation. This designation is only used when none of  the three modules has a numerical rating (i.e., 1 through 8) and at  least one module is rated ``evaluation pending.'' The Department shall  develop program metrics focused on reducing the number of MRSs with a  status of ``evaluating pending'' for any of the three modules. (See  appendix A, table 25.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A ``no longer required'' rating is used to indicate that an MRS  no longer requires prioritization. The MRS will receive this rating when  none of the three modules has a numerical (i.e., 1 through 8) or an  ``evaluation pending'' designation, and at least one of the modules is  rated ``no longer required.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A rating of ``no known or suspected hazard'' is used to indicate  that an MRS has no known or expected hazard. This designation is used  only when the hazard evaluation modules are rated as ``no known or  suspected explosive hazard,'' ``no known or suspected CWM hazard,'' and  ``no known or suspected MC hazard.'' (See appendix A, table 25.)</p>
