                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All applicants for new, additional, or different AM station  facilities and all licensees requesting authority to change the  transmitting system site of an existing station must specify an antenna  system, the efficiency of which complies with the requirements for the  class and power of station. (See Sec. Sec.  73.186 and 73.189.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An application for authority to install an AM broadcast antenna  must specify a definite site and include full details of the antenna  system design and expected performance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All data necessary to show compliance with the terms and  conditions of the construction permit must be filed with the application  for the station license to cover the construction. If the station has  constructed a directional antenna, a directional proof of performance  must be filed. See Sec. Sec.  73.150 through 73.157.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The simultaneous use of a common antenna or antenna structure by  more than one AM station or by a station of any other type or service  may be authorized provided:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Engineering data are submitted showing that satisfactory  operation of each station will be obtained without adversely affecting  the operation of the other station(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The minimum field strength for each AM station complies with  Sec.  73.189(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Should any changes be made or otherwise occur which would  possibly alter the resistance of the antenna system, the licensee must  commence the determination of the operating power by a method described  in Sec.  73.51(a)(1) or (d). (If the changes are due to the addition of  antennas to the AM tower, see Sec.  1.30003.) Upon completion of any  necessary repairs or adjustments, or upon completion of authorized  construction or modifications, the licensee must make a new  determination of the antenna resistance using the procedures described  in Sec.  73.54. Operating power should then be determined by a direct  method as described in Sec.  73.51. Notification of the value of  resistance of the antenna system must be filed with the FCC in  Washington, DC as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whenever the measurements show that the antenna or common point  resistance differs from that shown on the station authorization by more  than 2%, FCC Form 302 must be filed with the information and measurement  data specified in Sec.  73.54(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whenever AM stations use direct reading power meters pursuant to  Sec.  73.51, a letter notification to the FCC in Washington, DC,  Attention: Audio Division, Media Bureau, must be filed in accordance  with Sec.  73.54(e).
