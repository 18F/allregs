If  the contractor will collect information requiring answers to identical  questions from 10 or more people, no plan, questionnaire, interview  guide, or other similar device for collecting information may be used  without first obtaining clearance from the Chief Acquisition Officer  (CAO) or the CAO's designee within the Department of Education (ED) and  the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Contractors and Contracting  Officers' Representatives shall be guided by the provisions of 5 CFR  part 1320, Controlling Paperwork Burdens on the Public, and should seek  the advice of the Department's Paperwork Clearance Officer to determine  the procedures for acquiring CAO and OMB clearance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The contractor shall obtain the required clearances through the  Contracting Officer's Representative before expending any funds or  making public contacts for the collection of information described in  paragraph (a) of this clause. The authority to expend funds and proceed  with the collection shall be in writing by the contracting officer. The  contractor must plan at least 120 days for CAO and OMB clearance.  Excessive delay caused by the Government that arises out of causes  beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the contractor  will be considered in accordance with the Excusable Delays or Default  clause of this contract.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)</p>
