                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must issue a bill of lading. The bill of lading must contain the terms and conditions of the contract. A bill of lading may be combined with an order for service to include all the items required by Sec. 375.501 of this subpart. You must furnish a partially complete copy of the bill of lading to the individual shipper before the vehicle leaves the residence at origin. The partially complete bill of lading must contain all relevant shipment information, except the actual shipment weight and any other information necessary to determine the final charges for all services performed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> On a bill of lading, you must include the following 14 items:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Your name and address, or the name and address of the motor carrier issuing the bill of lading.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The names and addresses of any other motor carriers, when known, who will participate in transportation of the shipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The name, address, and telephone number of your office (or the office of your agent) where the individual shipper can contact you in relation to the transportation of the shipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The form of payment you and your agents will honor at delivery. The payment information must be the same that was entered on the estimate and order for service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When you transport on a collect-on-delivery basis, the name, address, and if furnished, the telephone number, facsimile number, or e-mail address of a person to notify about the charges. The notification may also be made by overnight courier or certified mail, return receipt requested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For non-guaranteed service, the agreed date or period of time for pickup of the shipment and the agreed date or period of time for the delivery of the shipment. The agreed dates or periods for pickup and delivery entered upon the bill of lading must conform to the agreed dates or periods of time for pickup and delivery entered upon the order for service or a proper amendment to the order for service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> For guaranteed service, subject to tariff provisions, the dates for pickup and delivery, and any penalty or per diem entitlements due the individual shipper under the agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The actual date of pickup.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The company or carrier identification number of the vehicle(s) upon which you load the individual shipper's shipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The terms and conditions for payment of the total charges, including notice of any minimum charges.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> The maximum amount you will demand at the time of delivery to obtain possession of the shipment, when you transport under a collect-on-delivery basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> The valuation statement provided in the Surface Transportation Board's released rates order requires individual shippers either to choose Full Value Protection for your liability or waive the Full Value Protection in favor of the STB's released rates. The released rates may be increased annually by the motor carrier based on the U.S. Department of Commerce's Cost of Living Adjustment. Contact the STB for a copy of the Released Rates of Motor Carrier Shipments of Household Goods. If the individual shipper waives your Full Value Protection in writing on the STB's valuation statement, you must include the charges, if any, for optional valuation coverage (other than Full Value Protection).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Evidence of any insurance coverage sold to or procured for the individual shipper from an independent insurer, including the amount of the premium for such insurance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Each attachment to the bill of lading. Each attachment is an integral part of the bill of lading contract. If not provided elsewhere to the shipper, the following three items must be added as an attachment to the bill of lading.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The binding or non-binding estimate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The order for service.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The inventory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A copy of the bill of lading must accompany a shipment at all times while in your (or your agent's) possession. Before the vehicle leaves the residence of origin, the bill of lading must be in the possession of the driver responsible for the shipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You must retain bills of lading for each move you perform for at least one

year from the date you created the bill of lading.
