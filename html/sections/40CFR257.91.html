                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Performance standard. The owner or operator of a CCR unit must  install   a groundwater monitoring system that consists of a sufficient number of  wells, installed at appropriate locations and depths, to yield  groundwater samples from the uppermost aquifer that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Accurately represent the quality of background groundwater that  has not been affected by leakage from a CCR unit. A determination of  background quality may include sampling of wells that are not  hydraulically upgradient of the CCR management area where:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Hydrogeologic conditions do not allow the owner or operator of  the CCR unit to determine what wells are hydraulically upgradient; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sampling at other wells will provide an indication of  background groundwater quality that is as representative or more  representative than that provided by the upgradient wells; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Accurately represent the quality of groundwater passing the  waste boundary of the CCR unit. The downgradient monitoring system must  be installed at the waste boundary that ensures detection of groundwater  contamination in the uppermost aquifer. All potential contaminant  pathways must be monitored.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The number, spacing, and depths of monitoring systems shall be  determined based upon site-specific technical information that must  include thorough characterization of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Aquifer thickness, groundwater flow rate, groundwater flow  direction including seasonal and temporal fluctuations in groundwater  flow; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Saturated and unsaturated geologic units and fill materials  overlying the uppermost aquifer, materials comprising the uppermost  aquifer, and materials comprising the confining unit defining the lower  boundary of the uppermost aquifer, including, but not limited to,  thicknesses, stratigraphy, lithology, hydraulic conductivities,  porosities and effective porosities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The groundwater monitoring system must include the minimum  number of monitoring wells necessary to meet the performance standards  specified in paragraph (a) of this section, based on the site-specific  information specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The groundwater  monitoring system must contain:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A minimum of one upgradient and three downgradient monitoring  wells; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Additional monitoring wells as necessary to accurately represent  the quality of background groundwater that has not been affected by  leakage from the CCR unit and the quality of groundwater passing the  waste boundary of the CCR unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The owner or operator of multiple CCR units may install a  multiunit groundwater monitoring system instead of separate groundwater  monitoring systems for each CCR unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The multiunit groundwater monitoring system must be equally as  capable of detecting monitored constituents at the waste boundary of the  CCR unit as the individual groundwater monitoring system specified in  paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section for each CCR unit based on  the following factors:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Number, spacing, and orientation of each CCR unit;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Hydrogeologic setting;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Site history; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Engineering design of the CCR unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the owner or operator elects to install a multiunit  groundwater monitoring system, and if the multiunit system includes at  least one existing unlined CCR surface impoundment as determined by  Sec. 257.71(a), and if at any time after October 19, 2015 the owner or  operator determines in any sampling event that the concentrations of one  or more constituents listed in appendix IV to this part are detected at  statistically significant levels above the groundwater protection  standard established under Sec. 257.95(h) for the multiunit system,  then all unlined CCR surface impoundments comprising the multiunit  groundwater monitoring system are subject to the closure requirements  under Sec. 257.101(a) to retrofit or close.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Monitoring wells must be cased in a manner that maintains the  integrity of the monitoring well borehole. This casing must be screened  or perforated and packed with gravel or sand, where necessary, to enable  collection of groundwater samples. The annular   space (i.e., the space between the borehole and well casing) above the  sampling depth must be sealed to prevent contamination of samples and  the groundwater.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator of the CCR unit must document and include  in the operating record the design, installation, development, and  decommissioning of any monitoring wells, piezometers and other  measurement, sampling, and analytical devices. The qualified  professional engineer must be given access to this documentation when  completing the groundwater monitoring system certification required  under paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The monitoring wells, piezometers, and other measurement,  sampling, and analytical devices must be operated and maintained so that  they perform to the design specifications throughout the life of the  monitoring program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The owner or operator must obtain a certification from a  qualified professional engineer stating that the groundwater monitoring  system has been designed and constructed to meet the requirements of  this section. If the groundwater monitoring system includes the minimum  number of monitoring wells specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this  section, the certification must document the basis supporting this  determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The owner or operator of the CCR unit must comply with the  recordkeeping requirements specified in Sec. 257.105(h), the  notification requirements specified in Sec. 257.106(h), and the  internet requirements specified in Sec. 257.107(h).
