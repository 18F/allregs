To fulfill this requirement, not later  than three business days after the institution's receipt of the written  notification from the FDIC under Sec. 371.1(c) of this part, the  institution must provide the FDIC with (i) a directory of the electronic  files that will be used by the institution to maintain the position  level data found in Table A1 and (ii) a point of contact at the  institution should the FDIC have follow-up questions concerning this  information. In addition, for such data, the institution must produce at  the close of processing of the institution's business day a report in a  format acceptable to the FDIC that aggregates the current market value  and the amount of QFCs by each of the fields in Table A1. The  institution must produce the report within 60 days of a written  notification by the FDIC for the period specified in the notification.  Notwithstanding the above requirements, for institutions in a troubled  condition with less than twenty open QFC positions upon receipt of the  written notification from the FDIC or the institution's appropriate  Federal banking agency under part   371 and this appendix, the data required in Table A1 are not required to  be recorded and maintained in electronic form as would otherwise be  required by this part, so long as all required information is capable of  being updated on a daily basis.
