Reasonable extensions, for exceptional circumstances only,

may be requested in writing by the Contractor and granted in writing by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall support its proposal with adequate supporting data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The proposed rates shall be based on the Contractor's actual cost experience for that period. The appropriate Government representative and the Contractor shall establish the final indirect cost rates as promptly as practical after receipt of the Contractor's proposal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Allowability of costs and acceptability of cost allocation methods shall be determined in accordance with FAR subpart 31.3 in effect on the date of this contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Predetermined rate agreements in effect on the date of this contract shall be incorporated into the contract Schedule. The Contracting Officer (or cognizant Federal agency official) and Contractor shall negotiate rates for subsequent periods and execute a written indirect cost rate agreement setting forth the results. The agreement shall specify (1) the agreed-upon predetermined indirect cost rates, (2) the bases to which the rates apply, (3) the period for which the rates apply, and (4) the specific items treated as direct costs or any changes in the items previously agreed to be direct costs.

If for any fiscal year (or other period specified in the Schedule) the parties fail to agree to predetermined indirect cost rates, the allowable indirect costs shall be obtained by applying final indirect cost rates established in accordance with the Allowable Cost and Payment clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Allowable indirect costs for the period from the beginning of performance until the end of the Contractor's fiscal year (or other period specified in the Schedule) shall be obtained using the predetermined indirect cost rates and the bases shown in the Schedule.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)
