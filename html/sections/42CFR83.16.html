This proposed decision will take into consideration the evaluations of NIOSH and the report and recommendations of the Board, and may also take into consideration information presented or submitted to the Board and the deliberations of the Board.

HHS will transmit a report of the decision to the petitioner(s), including an iteration of the relevant criteria, as specified under Sec.  83.13(c), and a summary of the information and findings on which the decision is based. HHS will also publish a notice summarizing the decision in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If, under Sec.  83.15(e), the Board recommends that the Secretary designate a class covered by the petition as an addition to the Cohort, and if, under paragraph (b) of Sec.  83.16, the Secretary decides to deny adding the class, as defined by the Board, to the Cohort, then the Secretary will submit to Congress a determination that the statutory criteria specified under 42 U.S.C. 7384q(b)(1) and (2) have not been met for adding the class to the Cohort. The Secretary will submit this determination to Congress within 30 calendar days following receipt by the Secretary of the recommendation of the Board.
