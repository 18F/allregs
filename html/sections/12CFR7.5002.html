                                Sec. 7.5002  Furnishing of products and services by electronic means
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Use of electronic means and facilities. A national bank may  perform, provide, or deliver through electronic   means and facilities any activity, function, product, or service that it  is otherwise authorized to perform, provide, or deliver, subject to  Sec. 7.5001(b) and applicable OCC guidance. The following list provides  examples of permissible activities under this authority. This list is  illustrative and not exclusive; the OCC may determine that other  activities are permissible pursuant to this authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Acting as an electronic finder by:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Establishing, registering, and hosting commercially enabled web  sites in the name of sellers;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Establishing hyperlinks between the bank's site and a third- party site, including acting as a ``virtual mall'' by providing a  collection of links to web sites of third-party vendors, organized by- product type and made available to bank customers;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Hosting an electronic marketplace on the bank's Internet web  site by providing links to the web sites of third-party buyers or  sellers through the use of hypertext or other similar means;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Hosting on the bank's servers the Internet web site of:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A buyer or seller that provides information concerning the  hosted party and the products or services offered or sought and allows  the submission of interest, bids, offers, orders and confirmations  relating to such products or services; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A governmental entity that provides information concerning the  services or benefits made available by the governmental entity, assists  persons in completing applications to receive such services or benefits  and permits persons to transmit their applications for such services or  benefits;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Operating an Internet web site that permits numerous buyers and  sellers to exchange information concerning the products and services  that they are willing to purchase or sell, locate potential counter- parties for transactions, aggregate orders for goods or services with  those made by other parties, and enter into transactions between  themselves;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Operating a telephone call center that provides permissible  finder services; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Providing electronic communications services relating to all  aspects of transactions between buyers and sellers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Providing electronic bill presentment services;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Offering electronic stored value systems;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Safekeeping for personal information or valuable confidential  trade or business information, such as encryption keys; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Issuing electronic letters of credit within the scope of 12 CFR  7.1016.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applicability of guidance and requirements not affected. When a  national bank performs, provides, or delivers through electronic means  and facilities an activity, function, product, or service that it is  otherwise authorized to perform, provide, or deliver, the electronic  activity is not exempt from the regulatory requirements and supervisory  guidance that the OCC would apply if the activity were conducted by non- electronic means or facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> State laws. As a general rule, and except as provided by Federal  law, State law is not applicable to a national bank's conduct of an  authorized activity through electronic means or facilities if the State  law, as applied to the activity, would be preempted pursuant to  traditional principles of Federal preemption derived from the Supremacy  Clause of the U.S. Constitution and applicable judicial precedent.  Accordingly, State laws that stand as an obstacle to the ability of  national banks to exercise uniformly their Federally authorized powers  through electronic means or facilities, are not applicable to national  banks.
