Such chlorinated  polyethylene contains a maximum of 60 percent by weight of total  chlorine, as determined by ASTM 1method D1303-55 (Reapproved 1979),  ``Standard Test Method for Total Chlorine in Vinyl Chloride Polymers and  Copolymers,'' which is incorporated by reference (Copies may be obtained  from the American Society for Testing Materials, 100 Barr Harbor Dr.,  West Conshohocken, Philadelphia, PA 19428-2959, or may be examined at  the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
