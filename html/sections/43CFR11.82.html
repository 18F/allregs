                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirement. The authorized official shall develop a reasonable  number of possible alternatives for (i) the restoration or  rehabilitation of the injured natural resources to a condition where  they can provide the level of services available at baseline, or (ii)  the replacement and/or acquisition of equivalent natural resources  capable of providing such services. For each possible alternative  developed, the authorized official will identify an action, or set of  actions, to be taken singly or in combination by the trustee agency to  achieve the baseline restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or  acquisition of equivalent natural resources. The authorized official  shall then select from among the possible alternatives the alternative  that he determines to be the most appropriate based on the guidance  provided in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Steps. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The authorized official shall develop a reasonable  number of possible alternatives that would restore, rehabilitate,  replace, and/or acquire the equivalent of the injured resources. Each of  the possible alternatives may, at the discretion of the authorized  official, consist of actions, singly or in combination, that would  achieve those purposes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Restoration or rehabilitation actions are those actions  undertaken to return injured resources to their baseline condition, as  measured in terms of the physical, chemical, or biological properties  that the injured resources would have exhibited or the services that  would have been provided by those resources had the discharge of oil or  release of the hazardous substance under investigation not occurred.  Such actions would be in addition to response actions completed or  anticipated pursuant to the National Contingency Plan (NCP).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Replacement or acquisition of the equivalent means the  substitution for injured resources with resources that provide the same  or substantially similar services, when such substitutions are in  addition to any substitutions made or anticipated as part of response  actions and when such substitutions exceed the level of response actions  determined appropriate to the site pursuant to the NCP.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Possible alternatives are limited to those actions that (i)  restore or rehabilitate the injured natural resources to a condition  where they can provide the level of services available at baseline, or  (ii) replace and/or acquire equivalent natural resources capable of  providing such services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Services provided by the resources. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In developing each of  the possible alternatives, the authorized official shall list the  proposed actions that would restore, rehabilitate, replace, and/or  acquire the equivalent of the services provided by the injured natural  resources that have been lost, and the period of time over which these  services would continue to be lost.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The authorized official shall identify services previously  provided by the resources in their baseline condition in   accordance with Sec. 11.72 of this part and compare those services with  services now provided by the injured resources, that is, the with-a- discharge-or-release condition. All estimates of the with-a-discharge- or-release condition shall incorporate consideration of the ability of  the resources to recover as determined in Sec. 11.73 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Range of possible alternatives. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The possible alternatives  considered by the authorized official that return the injured resources  to their baseline level of services could range from intensive action on  the part of the authorized official to return the various resources and  services provided by those resources to baseline conditions as quickly  as possible, to natural recovery with minimal management actions.  Possible alternatives within this range could reflect varying rates of  recovery, combinations of management actions, and needs for resource  replacements or acquisitions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An alternative considering natural recovery with minimal  management actions, based upon the ``No Action-Natural Recovery''  determination made in Sec. 11.73(a)(1) of this part, shall be one of  the possible alternatives considered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Factors to consider when selecting the alternative to pursue.  When selecting the alternative to pursue, the authorized official shall  evaluate each of the possible alternatives based on all relevant  considerations, including the following factors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Technical feasibility, as that term is used in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The relationship of the expected costs of the proposed actions  to the expected benefits from the restoration, rehabilitation,  replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cost-effectiveness, as that term is used in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The results of any actual or planned response actions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Potential for additional injury resulting from the proposed  actions, including long-term and indirect impacts, to the injured  resources or other resources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The natural recovery period determined in Sec. 11.73(a)(1) of  this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Ability of the resources to recover with or without alternative  actions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Potential effects of the action on human health and safety.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Consistency with relevant Federal, State, and tribal policies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Compliance with applicable Federal, State, and tribal laws.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A Federal authorized official shall not select an alternative  that requires acquisition of land for Federal management unless the  Federal authorized official determines that restoration, rehabilitation,  and/or other replacement of the injured resources is not possible.
