The term employer means a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has 15 or more employees for each working day in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year, and any agent of such person, except that, from July 26, 1992 through July 25, 1994, an employer means a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has 25 or more employees for each working day in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding year and any agent of such person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The term employer means a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has 15 or more employees for each working day in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year, and any agent of such person, except that, from July 26, 1992 through July 25, 1994, an employer means a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has 25 or more employees for each working day in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding year and any agent of such person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions. The term employer does not include--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The United States, a corporation wholly owned by the government of the United States, or an Indian tribe; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A bona fide private membership club (other than a labor organization) that is exempt from taxation under section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Employee means an individual employed by an employer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Definition of ``disability''--(1) In general. Disability means, with respect to an individual--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Disability means, with respect to an individual--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A record of such an impairment; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Being regarded as having such an impairment as described in paragraph (l) of this section. This means that the individual has been subjected to an action prohibited by the ADA as amended because of an actual or perceived impairment that is not both ``transitory and minor.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An individual may establish coverage under any one or more of these three prongs of the definition of disability, i.e., paragraphs (g)(1)(i) (the ``actual disability'' prong), (g)(1)(ii) (the ``record of'' prong), and/or (g)(1)(iii) (the ``regarded as'' prong) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where an individual is not challenging a covered entity's failure to make reasonable accommodations and does not require a reasonable accommodation, it is generally unnecessary to proceed under the ``actual disability'' or ``record of'' prongs, which require a showing of an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity or a record of such an impairment. In these cases, the evaluation of coverage can be made solely under the ``regarded as'' prong of the definition of disability, which does not require a showing of an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity or a record of such an impairment. An individual may choose, however, to proceed under the ``actual disability'' and/or ``record of'' prong regardless of whether the individual is challenging a covered entity's failure to make reasonable accommodations or requires a reasonable accommodation.</p><p class="depth3">Note to paragraph (g): See Sec. 1630.3 for exceptions to this definition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Physical or mental impairment means--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more body systems, such as neurological, musculoskeletal, special sense organs, respiratory (including speech organs), cardiovascular, reproductive, digestive, genitourinary, immune, circulatory, hemic, lymphatic, skin, and endocrine; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any mental or psychological disorder, such as an intellectual disability

(formerly termed ``mental retardation''), organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and specific learning disabilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Major life activities--(1) In general. Major life activities include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Major life activities include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, sitting, reaching, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, interacting with others, and working; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The operation of a major bodily function, including functions of the immune system, special sense organs and skin; normal cell growth; and digestive, genitourinary, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, cardiovascular, endocrine, hemic, lymphatic, musculoskeletal, and reproductive functions. The operation of a major bodily function includes the operation of an individual organ within a body system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In determining other examples of major life activities, the term ``major'' shall not be interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for disability. ADAAA section 2(b)(4) (Findings and Purposes). Whether an activity is a ``major life activity'' is not determined by reference to whether it is of ``central importance to daily life.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Substantially limits--(1) Rules of construction. The following rules of construction apply when determining whether an impairment substantially limits an individual in a major life activity:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Rules of construction. The following rules of construction apply when determining whether an impairment substantially limits an individual in a major life activity:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The term ``substantially limits'' shall be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADA. ``Substantially limits'' is not meant to be a demanding standard.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An impairment is a disability within the meaning of this section if it substantially limits the ability of an individual to perform a major life activity as compared to most people in the general population. An impairment need not prevent, or significantly or severely restrict, the individual from performing a major life activity in order to be considered substantially limiting. Nonetheless, not every impairment will constitute a disability within the meaning of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The primary object of attention in cases brought under the ADA should be whether covered entities have complied with their obligations and whether discrimination has occurred, not whether an individual's impairment substantially limits a major life activity. Accordingly, the threshold issue of whether an impairment ``substantially limits'' a major life activity should not demand extensive analysis.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity requires an individualized assessment. However, in making this assessment, the term ``substantially limits'' shall be interpreted and applied to require a degree of functional limitation that is lower than the standard for ``substantially limits'' applied prior to the ADAAA.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The comparison of an individual's performance of a major life activity to the performance of the same major life activity by most people in the general population usually will not require scientific, medical, or statistical analysis. Nothing in this paragraph is intended, however, to prohibit the presentation of scientific, medical, or statistical evidence to make such a comparison where appropriate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity shall be made without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures. However, the ameliorative effects of ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses shall be considered in determining whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> An impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> An impairment that substantially limits one major life activity need not substantially limit other major life activities in order to be considered a substantially limiting impairment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> The six-month ``transitory'' part of the ``transitory and minor'' exception to ``regarded as'' coverage in Sec. 1630.15(f) does not apply to the definition of ``disability'' under paragraphs

(g)(1)(i) (the ``actual disability'' prong) or (g)(1)(ii) (the ``record of'' prong) of this section. The effects of an impairment lasting or expected to last fewer than six months can be substantially limiting within the meaning of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Non-applicability to the ``regarded as'' prong. Whether an individual's impairment ``substantially limits'' a major life activity is not relevant to coverage under paragraph (g)(1)(iii) (the ``regarded as'' prong) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Predictable assessments--(i) The principles set forth in paragraphs (j)(1)(i) through (ix) of this section are intended to provide for more generous coverage and application of the ADA's prohibition on discrimination through a framework that is predictable, consistent, and workable for all individuals and entities with rights and responsibilities under the ADA as amended.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The principles set forth in paragraphs (j)(1)(i) through (ix) of this section are intended to provide for more generous coverage and application of the ADA's prohibition on discrimination through a framework that is predictable, consistent, and workable for all individuals and entities with rights and responsibilities under the ADA as amended.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Applying the principles set forth in paragraphs (j)(1)(i) through (ix) of this section, the individualized assessment of some types of impairments will, in virtually all cases, result in a determination of coverage under paragraphs (g)(1)(i) (the ``actual disability'' prong) or (g)(1)(ii) (the ``record of'' prong) of this section. Given their inherent nature, these types of impairments will, as a factual matter, virtually always be found to impose a substantial limitation on a major life activity. Therefore, with respect to these types of impairments, the necessary individualized assessment should be particularly simple and straightforward.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For example, applying the principles set forth in paragraphs (j)(1)(i) through (ix) of this section, it should easily be concluded that the following types of impairments will, at a minimum, substantially limit the major life activities indicated: Deafness substantially limits hearing; blindness substantially limits seeing; an intellectual disability (formerly termed mental retardation) substantially limits brain function; partially or completely missing limbs or mobility impairments requiring the use of a wheelchair substantially limit musculoskeletal function; autism substantially limits brain function; cancer substantially limits normal cell growth; cerebral palsy substantially limits brain function; diabetes substantially limits endocrine function; epilepsy substantially limits neurological function; Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection substantially limits immune function; multiple sclerosis substantially limits neurological function; muscular dystrophy substantially limits neurological function; and major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia substantially limit brain function. The types of impairments described in this section may substantially limit additional major life activities not explicitly listed above.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Condition, manner, or duration--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At all times taking into account the principles in paragraphs (j)(1)(i) through (ix) of this section, in determining whether an individual is substantially limited in a major life activity, it may be useful in appropriate cases to consider, as compared to most people in the general population, the condition under which the individual performs the major life activity; the manner in which the individual performs the major life activity; and/or the duration of time it takes the individual to perform the major life activity, or for which the individual can perform the major life activity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Consideration of facts such as condition, manner, or duration may include, among other things, consideration of the difficulty, effort, or time required to perform a major life activity; pain experienced when performing a major life activity; the length of time a major life activity can be performed; and/or the way an impairment affects the operation of a major bodily function. In addition, the non-ameliorative effects of mitigating measures, such as negative side effects of medication or burdens associated with following a particular treatment regimen, may be considered when determining whether an individual's impairment substantially limits a major life activity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In determining whether an individual has a disability under the ``actual disability'' or ``record of'' prongs of the definition of disability, the focus

is on how a major life activity is substantially limited, and not on what outcomes an individual can achieve. For example, someone with a learning disability may achieve a high level of academic success, but may nevertheless be substantially limited in the major life activity of learning because of the additional time or effort he or she must spend to read, write, or learn compared to most people in the general population.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Given the rules of construction set forth in paragraphs (j)(1)(i) through (ix) of this section, it may often be unnecessary to conduct an analysis involving most or all of these types of facts. This is particularly true with respect to impairments such as those described in paragraph (j)(3)(iii) of this section, which by their inherent nature should be easily found to impose a substantial limitation on a major life activity, and for which the individualized assessment should be particularly simple and straightforward.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Examples of mitigating measures--Mitigating measures include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Medication, medical supplies, equipment, or appliances, low-vision devices (defined as devices that magnify, enhance, or otherwise augment a visual image, but not including ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses), prosthetics including limbs and devices, hearing aid(s) and cochlear implant(s) or other implantable hearing devices, mobility devices, and oxygen therapy equipment and supplies;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use of assistive technology;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Reasonable accommodations or ``auxiliary aids or services'' (as defined by 42 U.S.C. 12103(1));</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Learned behavioral or adaptive neurological modifications; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Psychotherapy, behavioral therapy, or physical therapy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses--defined. Ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses are lenses that are intended to fully correct visual acuity or to eliminate refractive error.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Has a record of such an impairment--(1) In general. An individual has a record of a disability if the individual has a history of, or has been misclassified as having, a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. An individual has a record of a disability if the individual has a history of, or has been misclassified as having, a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Broad construction. Whether an individual has a record of an impairment that substantially limited a major life activity shall be construed broadly to the maximum extent permitted by the ADA and should not demand extensive analysis. An individual will be considered to have a record of a disability if the individual has a history of an impairment that substantially limited one or more major life activities when compared to most people in the general population, or was misclassified as having had such an impairment. In determining whether an impairment substantially limited a major life activity, the principles articulated in paragraph (j) of this section apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reasonable accommodation. An individual with a record of a substantially limiting impairment may be entitled, absent undue hardship, to a reasonable accommodation if needed and related to the past disability. For example, an employee with an impairment that previously limited, but no longer substantially limits, a major life activity may need leave or a schedule change to permit him or her to attend follow-up or ``monitoring'' appointments with a health care provider.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> ``Is regarded as having such an impairment.'' The following principles apply under the ``regarded as'' prong of the definition of disability (paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section) above:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 1630.15(f), an individual is ``regarded as having such an impairment'' if the individual is subjected to a prohibited action because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment, whether or not that impairment substantially limits, or is perceived to substantially limit, a major life activity. Prohibited actions include but are not limited to refusal to hire, demotion, placement on involuntary leave, termination, exclusion for failure to meet a qualification standard, harassment, or denial of any other term, condition, or privilege of employment</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 1630.15(f), an individual is ``regarded as having such an impairment'' any time a covered entity takes a prohibited action

against the individual because of an actual or perceived impairment, even if the entity asserts, or may or does ultimately establish, a defense to such action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Establishing that an individual is ``regarded as having such an impairment'' does not, by itself, establish liability. Liability is established under title I of the ADA only when an individual proves that a covered entity discriminated on the basis of disability within the meaning of section 102 of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. 12112.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> The term ``qualified,'' with respect to an individual with a disability, means that the individual satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education and other job-related requirements of the employment position such individual holds or desires and, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of such position. See Sec. 1630.3 for exceptions to this definition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Essential functions--(1) In general. The term essential functions means the fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds or desires. The term ``essential functions'' does not include the marginal functions of the position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The term essential functions means the fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds or desires. The term ``essential functions'' does not include the marginal functions of the position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A job function may be considered essential for any of several reasons, including but not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The function may be essential because the reason the position exists is to perform that function;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The function may be essential because of the limited number of employees available among whom the performance of that job function can be distributed; and/or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The function may be highly specialized so that the incumbent in the position is hired for his or her expertise or ability to perform the particular function.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Evidence of whether a particular function is essential includes, but is not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The employer's judgment as to which functions are essential;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Written job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The amount of time spent on the job performing the function;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The terms of a collective bargaining agreement;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The work experience of past incumbents in the job; and/or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Reasonable accommodation. (1) The term reasonable accommodation means:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term reasonable accommodation means:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Modifications or adjustments to a job application process that enable a qualified applicant with a disability to be considered for the position such qualified applicant desires; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Modifications or adjustments to the work environment, or to the manner or circumstances under which the position held or desired is customarily performed, that enable an individual with a disability who is qualified to perform the essential functions of that position; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Modifications or adjustments that enable a covered entity's employee with a disability to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment as are enjoyed by its other similarly situated employees without disabilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reasonable accommodation may include but is not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Job restructuring; part-time or modified work schedules; reassignment to a vacant position; acquisition or modifications of equipment or devices; appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials, or policies; the provision of qualified readers or interpreters; and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation it may be necessary for the covered entity to initiate an informal, interactive process with the individual with a disability in need of the accommodation. This process should identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A covered entity is required, absent undue hardship, to provide a reasonable accommodation to an otherwise qualified individual who meets the definition of disability under the ``actual disability'' prong (paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section), or ``record of'' prong (paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section), but is not required to provide a reasonable accommodation to an individual who meets the definition of disability solely under the ``regarded as'' prong (paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Undue hardship--(1) In general. Undue hardship means, with respect to the provision of an accommodation, significant difficulty or expense incurred by a covered entity, when considered in light of the factors set forth in paragraph (p)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Undue hardship means, with respect to the provision of an accommodation, significant difficulty or expense incurred by a covered entity, when considered in light of the factors set forth in paragraph (p)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Factors to be considered. In determining whether an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on a covered entity, factors to be considered include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The nature and net cost of the accommodation needed under this part, taking into consideration the availability of tax credits and deductions, and/or outside funding;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The overall financial resources of the facility or facilities involved in the provision of the reasonable accommodation, the number of persons employed at such facility, and the effect on expenses and resources;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The overall financial resources of the covered entity, the overall size of the business of the covered entity with respect to the number of its employees, and the number, type and location of its facilities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The type of operation or operations of the covered entity, including the composition, structure and functions of the workforce of such entity, and the geographic separateness and administrative or fiscal relationship of the facility or facilities in question to the covered entity; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The impact of the accommodation upon the operation of the facility, including the impact on the ability of other employees to perform their duties and the impact on the facility's ability to conduct business.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Qualification standards means the personal and professional attributes including the skill, experience, education, physical, medical, safety and other requirements established by a covered entity as requirements which an individual must meet in order to be eligible for the position held or desired.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Direct Threat means a significant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of the individual or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation. The determination that an individual poses a ``direct threat'' shall be based on an individualized assessment of the individual's present ability to safely perform the essential functions of the job. This assessment shall be based on a reasonable medical judgment that relies on the most current medical knowledge and/or on the best available objective evidence. In determining whether an individual would pose a direct threat, the factors to be considered include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The duration of the risk;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The nature and severity of the potential harm;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The likelihood that the potential harm will occur; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The imminence of the potential harm.
