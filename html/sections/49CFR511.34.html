                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Procedure for request. A party may serve upon any other party a  written request for the admission, for the purposes of the pending  proceeding only, of the truth of any matters within the scope of Sec.  511.31(c)(1) set forth in the request that relate to statements or  opinions of fact or of the application of law to fact, including the  genuineness of documents described in the request. Copies of documents  shall be served with the request unless they have been, or are otherwise  furnished or made   available for inspection and copying. The request may, without leave of  the Presiding Officer, be served upon any party after filing of the  answer. Each matter as to which an admission is requested shall be  separately set forth.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedure for response. The matter as to which an admission is  requested is deemed admitted unless within thirty (30) days after  service of the request, or within such shorter or longer time as the  Presiding Officer may allow, the party to whom the request is directed  serves upon the party requesting the admission a written answer or  objection addressed to the matter, signed by the party or the party's  representatives. If objection is made, the reasons therefore shall be  stated.  The answer shall specifically admit or deny the matter or set forth in  detail the reasons why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or  deny the matter. A denial shall fairly meet the substance of the  requested admission. When good faith requires that a party qualify an  answer or deny only a part of the matter as to which an admission is  requested, the party shall specify the portion that is true and qualify  or deny the remainder. An answering party may not give lack of  information or knowledge as a reason for failure to admit or deny,  unless the party states that he or she has made reasonable inquiry and  that the information known or readily available to him or her is  insufficient to enable him or her to admit or deny. A party who  considers that a matter as to which an admission has been requested  presents a genuine issue for hearing may not, on that ground alone,  object to the request but may deny the matter or set forth reasons why  the party cannot admit or deny it. The party who has requested an  admission may move to determine the sufficiency of the answer or  objection thereto in accordance with Sec. 511.36. If the Presiding  Officer determines that an answer does not comply with the requirements  of this section, he or she may order that the matter be deemed admitted  or that an amended answer be served.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of admission. Any matter admitted under this section is  conclusively established unless the Presiding Officer on motion permits  withdrawal or amendment of such admission. The Presiding Officer may  permit withdrawal or amendment when the presentation of the merits of  the action will be served thereby and the party that obtained the  admission fails to satisfy the Presiding Officer that withdrawal or  amendment will prejudice that party in maintaining an action or defense  on the merits.</p>
