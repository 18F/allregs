                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. A knee joint patellofemorotibial polymer/metal/ metal constrained cemented prosthesis is a device intended to be  implanted to replace a knee joint. The device prevents dislocation in  more than one anatomic plane and has components that are linked  together. This generic type of device includes prostheses that have a  femoral component, a tibial component, a cylindrical bolt and  accompanying locking hardware that are all made of alloys, such as  cobalt-chromium-molybdenum, and a retropatellar resurfacing component  made of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene. The retropatellar  surfacing component may be attached to the resected patella either with  a metallic screw or bone cement. All stemmed metallic components within  this generic type are intended for use with bone cement (Sec.  888.3027).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class III.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Date PMA or notice of completion of a PDP is required. A PMA or  a notice of completion of a PDP is required to be filed with the Food  and Drug Administration on or before December 26, 1996 for any knee  joint patellofemorotibial polymer/metal/metal constrained cemented  prosthesis that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, or  that has, on or before December 26, 1996 been found to be substantially  equivalent to a knee joint patellofemorotibial polymer/metal/metal  constrained cemented prosthesis that was in commercial distribution  before May 28, 1976. Any other knee joint patellofemorotibial polymer/ metal/metal constrained cemented prosthesis shall have an approved PMA  or a declared completed PDP in effect before being placed in commercial  distribution.
