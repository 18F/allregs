                                Sec. 229.36  Atlantic Pelagic Longline Take Reduction Plan (PLTRP).
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose and scope. The purpose of this section is to implement  the PLTRP to reduce incidental mortality and serious injury of long- finned and short-finned pilot whales and Risso's dolphins in the  Atlantic pelagic longline fishery off the U.S. east coast, a component  of the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico large pelagics longline  fishery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Persons subject to this section. The regulations in this section  apply to the owner and operator of any vessel that has been issued or is  required to be issued an Atlantic HMS tunas, swordfish, or shark permit  under Sec. 635.4 of this title and that has pelagic longline gear  onboard as described under Sec. 635.21(c) of this title.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Geographic scope. The geographic scope of the PLTRP is the  Atlantic Federal EEZ off the U.S. East Coast. The regulations specified  in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section apply throughout the  Atlantic Federal EEZ off the U.S. East Coast. The regulation specified  in paragraph (e) of this section applies to all U.S. Atlantic pelagic  longline vessels operating in the EEZ portion of the Mid-Atlantic Bight.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. In addition to the definitions contained in the  MMPA and Sec. Sec. 216.3 and 229.2 of this chapter, the following  definitions apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cape Hatteras Special Research Area (CHSRA) means all waters  inside and including the rectangular boundary described by the following  lines: 35 N. lat., 75 W. long., 36 25' N. lat., and 74 35' W. long.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Mid-Atlantic Bight means the area bounded by straight lines  connecting   the mid-Atlantic states' internal waters and extending to 71 W. long.  between 35 N. lat. and 43 N. lat.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Observer means an individual authorized by NMFS, or a designated  contractor, placed aboard a commercial fishing vessel to record  information on marine mammal interactions, fishing operations, marine  mammal life history information, and other scientific data; to collect  biological specimens; and to perform other scientific investigations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Pelagic longline has the same meaning as in Sec. 635.2 of this  title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Marine Mammal Handling and Release Placard. The placard,  ``Marine Mammal Handling/Release Guidelines: A Quick Reference for  Atlantic Pelagic Longline Gear,'' must be kept posted inside the  wheelhouse and on the working deck. You may contact the NMFS Southeast  Regional Office at (727) 824-5312 to request additional copies of the  placard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> CHSRA--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Special observer requirements. If you deploy or fish  with pelagic longline gear in the CHSRA, or intend to do so, you must  call NMFS Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC), 1-888-254-2558, at  least 48 hours, but no more than 96 hours, prior to embarking on your  fishing trip. This requirement is in addition to any existing selection  and notification requirement for observer coverage by the Pelagic  Observer Program. If, upon calling in, you are informed by the NMFS  SEFSC that no observer will be assigned and that no special research  requirements will apply for that trip, then you need not wait until your  stated date and time of departure and may depart on your fishing trip  immediately. If you are assigned an observer, you must take the observer  during that fishing trip. If you do not take the observer, you are  prohibited from deploying or fishing with pelagic longline gear in the  CHSRA for that fishing trip. You must comply with all provisions of  Sec. 229.7, Monitoring of incidental mortalities and serious injuries.  In addition, all provisions of 50 CFR 600.746, Observers, apply. No  waivers will be granted under Sec. 229.7(c)(3) or Sec. 600.746(f). A  vessel that would otherwise be required to carry an observer, but is  inadequate or unsafe for purposes of carrying an observer and for  allowing operation of normal observer functions, is prohibited from  deploying or fishing with pelagic longline gear in the CHSRA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Special research requirements. In addition to observing normal  fishing activities, observers may conduct additional scientific  investigations aboard your vessel designed to support the goals of the  PLTRP. The observer will inform you of the specific additional  investigations that may be conducted during your trip. An observer may  direct you to modify your fishing behavior, gear, or both. Instead of  carrying an observer, you may be required to carry and deploy gear  provided by NMFS or an observer or modify your fishing practices. By  calling in per Sec. 229.36(d)(1), you are agreeing to take an observer.  You are also acknowledging you are both willing and able to participate  in research, as per this paragraph, in the CHSRA consistent with the  PLTRP without any compensation. If you are assigned any special research  requirements, you must participate in the research for the duration of  the assignment. If you do not participate in the research, you are  prohibited from deploying or fishing with pelagic longline gear in the  CHSRA for that fishing trip.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exception for transit. If pelagic longline gear is appropriately  stowed, a vessel may transit through the CHSRA without meeting the  observer and research requirements specified in Sec. 229.36(d)(1) and  Sec. 229.36(d)(2). For the purpose of this paragraph, transit means  non-stop progression through the area. Pelagic longline gear is  appropriately stowed if all gangions, hooks, and buoys are disconnected  from the mainline; hooks are not baited; longline left on the drum is  covered with a tarp; and all other gear components are either stowed  below deck or secured on deck and covered with a tarp.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Gear restrictions. No person may deploy a pelagic longline that  exceeds 20 nautical miles (nm) (37.04 km) in length in the Mid-Atlantic  Bight, including in the CHSRA, unless they have a written letter of  authorization from the Director, NMFS Southeast Fishery Science Center  to use a pelagic   longline exceeding 20 nm (37.04 km) in the CHSRA in support research for  reducing bycatch of marine mammals in the pelagic longline fishery.
