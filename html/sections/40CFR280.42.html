By December 22, 1998, all existing hazardous substance UST systems must

meet the release detection requirements for new systems in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Release detection at new hazardous substance UST systems must meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Secondary containment systems must be designed, constructed and installed to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Contain regulated substances released from the tank system until they are detected and removed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Prevent the release of regulated substances to the environment at any time during the operational life of the UST system; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Be checked for evidence of a release at least every 30 days.</p><p class="depth4">Note. The provisions of 40 CFR 265.193, Containment and Detection of Releases, may be used to comply with these requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Double-walled tanks must be designed, constructed, and installed to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Contain a release from any portion of the inner tank within the outer wall; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Detect the failure of the inner wall.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> External liners (including vaults) must be designed, constructed, and installed to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Contain 100 percent of the capacity of the largest tank within its boundary;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Prevent the interference of precipitation or ground-water intrusion with the ability to contain or detect a release of regulated substances; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Surround the tank completely (i.e., it is capable of preventing lateral as well as vertical migration of regulated substances).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Underground piping must be equipped with secondary containment that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section (e.g., trench liners, jacketing of double-walled pipe). In addition, underground piping that conveys regulated substances under pressure must be equipped with an automatic line leak detector in accordance with Sec.  280.44(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Other methods of release detection may be used if owners and operators:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Demonstrate to the implementing agency that an alternate method can detect a release of the stored substance as effectively as any of the methods allowed in Sec. Sec.  280.43(b) through (h) can detect a release of petroleum;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provide information to the implementing agency on effective corrective action technologies, health risks, and chemical and physical properties of the stored substance, and the characteristics of the UST site; and,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Obtain approval from the implementing agency to use the alternate release detection method before the installation and operation of the new UST system.</p>
