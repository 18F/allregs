                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Evidence submitted with the request. When filing a request for  reconsideration, a party should present evidence and allegations of fact  or law related to the issue in dispute and explain why it disagrees with  the initial determination, including the redetermination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This evidence must include any missing documentation identified  in the notice of redetermination, consistent with Sec. 405.956(b)(6).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Absent good cause, failure to submit all evidence, including  documentation requested in the notice of redetermination prior to the  issuance of the notice of reconsideration precludes subsequent  consideration of that evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Evidence submitted after the request. Each time a party submits  additional evidence after filing the request for reconsideration, the  QIC's 60 calendar day decisionmaking timeframe is automatically extended  by up to 14 calendar days for each submission. This extension does not  apply to timely submissions of documentation specifically requested by a  QIC, unless the documentation was originally requested in the notice of  redetermination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exception for beneficiaries and State Medicaid Agencies that  file reconsideration requests. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Beneficiaries and State Medicaid  Agencies that file requests for reconsideration are not required to  comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. However,  the automatic 14 calendar day extension described in paragraph (b) of  this section applies to each evidence submission made after the request  for reconsideration is filed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Beneficiaries who are represented by providers or suppliers must  comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
