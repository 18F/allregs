                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The equipment regulated under this section consists  of all equipment in a subscriber's home, provided and maintained by the  operator, that is used to receive the basic service tier, regardless of  whether such equipment is additionally used to receive other tiers of  regulated programming service and/or unregulated service. Such equipment  shall include, but is not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Converter boxes;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Remote control units; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Inside wiring.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subscriber charges for such equipment shall not exceed charges  based on actual costs in accordance with the requirements set forth in  this section.</p><p class="depth3">Subscriber charges for such equipment shall not exceed charges based  on actual costs in accordance with the requirements set forth below.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unbundling. A cable operator shall establish rates for remote  control units, converter boxes, other customer equipment, installation,  and additional connections separate from rates for basic tier service.  In addition, the rates for such equipment and installations shall be  unbundled one from the other.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Equipment basket. A cable operator shall establish an Equipment  Basket, which shall include all costs associated with providing customer  equipment and installation under this section. Equipment Basket costs  shall be limited to the direct and indirect material and labor costs of  providing, leasing, installing, repairing, and servicing customer  equipment, as determined in accordance with the cost accounting and cost  allocation requirements of Sec.  76.924, except that operators do not  have to aggregate costs in a manner consistent with the accounting  practices of the operator on April 3, 1993. The Equipment Basket shall  not include general administrative overhead including marketing  expenses. The Equipment Basket shall include a reasonable profit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Customer equipment. Costs of customer equipment included in the  Equipment Basket may be aggregated, on a franchise, system, regional, or  company level, into broad categories. Except to the extent indicated in  paragraph (c)(2) of this section, such categorization may be made,  provided that each category includes only equipment of the same type,  regardless of the levels of functionality of the equipment within each  such broad category. When submitting its equipment costs based on  average charges, the cable operator must provide a general description  of the averaging methodology employed and a justification that its  averaging methodology produces reasonable equipment rates. Equipment  rates should be set at the same organizational level at which an  operator aggregates its costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Basic service tier only equipment. Costs of customer equipment  used by basic-only subscribers may not be aggregated with the costs of  equipment used by non-basic-only subscribers. Costs of customer  equipment used by basic-only subscribers may, however, be aggregated,  consistent with an operator's aggregation under paragraph (c)(1) of this  section, on a franchise, system, regional, or company level. The  prohibition against aggregation applies to subscribers, not to a  particular type of equipment. Alternatively, operators may base its  basic-only subscriber cost aggregation on the assumption that all basic- only subscribers use equipment that is the lowest level and least  expensive model of equipment offered by the operator, even if some  basic-only subscribers actually have higher level, more expensive  equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Installation costs. Installation costs, consistent with an  operator's aggregation under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, may be  aggregated, on a franchise, system, regional, or company level. When  submitting its installation costs based on average charges, the cable  operator must provide a general description of the averaging methodology  employed and a justification that its averaging methodology produces  reasonable equipment rates. Installation rates should be set at the same  organizational level at which an operator aggregates its costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Hourly service charge. A cable operator shall establish charges  for equipment and installation using the Hourly Service Charge (HSC)  methodology. The HSC shall equal the operator's annual Equipment Basket  costs, excluding the purchase cost of customer equipment, divided by the  total person hours involved in installing, repairing, and servicing  customer equipment during the same period. The HSC is calculated  according to the following formula:  [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]  Where, EB = annual Equipment Basket Cost; CE = annual purchase cost of</p><p class="depth2">all customer equipment; and H = person hours involved in</p><p class="depth2">installing and repairing equipment per year. The purchase cost</p><p class="depth2">of customer equipment shall include the cable operator's</p><p class="depth2">invoice price plus all other costs incurred with respect to</p><p class="depth2">the equipment until the time it is provided to the customer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Installation charges. Installation charges shall be either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The HSC multiplied by the actual time spent on each individual  installation; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The HSC multiplied by the average time spent on a specific type  of installation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Remote charges. Monthly charges for rental of a remote control  unit shall consist of the average annual unit purchase cost of remotes  leased, including acquisition price and incidental costs such as sales  tax, financing and storage up to the time it is provided to the  customer, added to the product of the HSC times the average number of  hours annually repairing or servicing a remote, divided by 12 to  determine the monthly lease rate for a remote according to the following  formula:  [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]  Where, HR = average hours repair per year; and UCE = average annual unit</p><p class="depth2">cost of remote.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Other equipment charges. The monthly charge for rental of  converter boxes and other customer equipment shall be calculated in the  same manner as for remote control units. Separate charges may be  established for each category of other customer equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Additional connection charges. The costs of installation and  monthly use of additional connections shall be recovered as charges  associated with the installation and equipment cost categories, and at  rate levels determined by the actual cost methodology presented in the  foregoing paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section. An operator may  recover additional programming costs and the costs of signal boosters on  the customers premises, if any, associated with the additional  connection as a separate monthly unbundled charge for additional  connections.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Charges for equipment sold. A cable operator may sell customer  premises equipment to a subscriber. The equipment price shall recover  the operator's cost of the equipment, including costs associated with  storing and preparing the equipment for sale up to the time it is sold  to the customer, plus a reasonable profit. An operator may sell service  contracts for the maintenance and repair of equipment sold to  subscribers. The charge for a service contract shall be the HSC times  the estimated average number of hours for maintenance and repair over  the life of the equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Promotions. A cable operator may offer equipment or installation  at charges below those determined under   paragraphs (e) through (g) of this section, as long as those offerings  are reasonable in scope in relation to the operator's overall offerings  in the Equipment Basket and not unreasonably discriminatory. Operators  may not recover the cost of a promotional offering by increasing charges  for other Equipment Basket elements, or by increasing programming  service rates above the maximum monthly charge per subscriber prescribed  by these rules. As part of a general cost-of-service showing, an  operator may include the cost of promotions in its general system  overhead costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Franchise fees. Equipment charges may include a properly  allocated portion of franchise fees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Company-wide averaging of equipment costs. For the purpose of  developing unbundled equipment charges as required by paragraph (b) of  this section, a cable operator may average the equipment costs of its  small systems at any level, or several levels, within its operations.  This company-wide averaging applies only to an operator's small systems  as defined in Sec.  76.901(c); is permitted only for equipment charges,  not installation charges; and may be established only for similar types  of equipment. When submitting its equipment costs based on average  charges to the local franchising authority or the Commission, an  operator that elects company-wide averaging of equipment costs must  provide a general description of the averaging methodology employed and  a justification that its averaging methodology produces reasonable  equipment rates. The local authority or the Commission may require the  operator to set equipment rates based on the operator's level of  averaging in effect on April 3, 1993, as required by Sec.  76.924(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Cable operators shall set charges for equipment and  installations to recover Equipment Basket costs. Such charges shall be  set, consistent with the level at which Equipment Basket costs are  aggregated as provided in Sec.  76.923(c). Cable operators shall  maintain adequate documentation to demonstrate that charges for the sale  and lease of equipment and for installations have been developed in  accordance with the rules set forth in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Timing of filings. An operator shall file FCC Form 1205 in order  to establish its maximum permitted rates at the following times:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the operator sets its initial rates under either the  benchmark system or through a cost-of-service showing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Within 60 days of the end of its fiscal year, for an operator  that adjusts its rates under the system described in Section 76.922(d)  that allows it to file up to quarterly;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> On the same date it files its FCC Form 1240, for an operator  that adjusts its rates under the annual rate adjustment system described  in Section 76.922(e). If an operator elects not to file an FCC Form 1240  for a particular year, the operator must file a Form 1205 on the  anniversary date of its last Form 1205 filing; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When seeking to adjust its rates to reflect the offering of new  types of customer equipment other than in conjunction with an annual  filing of Form 1205, 60 days before it seeks to adjust its rates to  reflect the offering of new types of customer equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Introduction of new equipment. In setting the permitted charge  for a new type of equipment at a time other than at its annual filing,  an operator shall only complete Schedule C and the relevant step of the  Worksheet for Calculating Permitted Equipment and Installation Charges  of a Form 1205. The operator shall rely on entries from its most  recently filed FCC Form 1205 for information not specifically related to  the new equipment, including but not limited to the Hourly Service  Charge. In calculating the annual maintenance and service hours for the  new equipment, the operator should base its entry on the average annual  expected time required to maintain the unit, i.e., expected service  hours required over the life of the equipment unit being introduced  divided by the equipment unit's expected life.
