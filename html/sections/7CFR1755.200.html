It is not necessary to remove the filling compound from cable conductors before splicing. However, it is permissible to wipe individual conductors with clean paper towels or clean cloth rags. No cleaning chemicals, etc., shall be used. Caution shall be exercised to maintain individual cable pair and binder group identity. Binder group identity shall be maintained by using color coded plastic tie wraps. Individual pair identification shall be maintained by carefully twisting together the two conductors of each pair.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Expanded plastic insulated conductor (PIC) precautions. Solid PIC and expanded (foam or foam skin) PIC are spliced in the same manner, using the same tools and materials and, in general, should be treated the same. However, the insulation on expanded PIC is much more fragile than solid PIC. Twisting or forming expanded PIC into extremely compact splice bundles and applying excessive amounts of tension when tightening tie wraps causes shiners and, thus shall be avoided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Splice connectors.

used on outside plant projects financed by RUS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Only RUS accepted filled splice connectors shall be

The splice connector manufacturer's recommendations shall be followed concerning connector selection and use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Caution shall be exercised to maintain conductor and pair association both during and after splicing operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Splicing operations that involve pairs containing working services shall utilize splice connectors that permit splicing without the interruption of service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Piecing out conductors. Conductors may be pieced-out to provide additional slack or to repair damaged conductors. However, the conductors shall be pieced-out with conductors having the same gauge and type and color of insulation. The conductors used for piecing-out shall be from cables having RUS acceptance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Splice organization. Spliced pair bundles shall be arranged in firm lay-ups with minimum conductor tension in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Binder tape. Perforated nonhygroscopic and nonwicking binder tape should be applied to splices housed in filled splice cases. The binder tape allows the flow of filling compound while holding the splice bundles near the center of the splice case to allow adequate coverage of filling compound.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Cable tags. Cables shall be identified by a tag indicating the cable manufacturer's name, cable size, date of placement, and generic route information. Information susceptible to changes caused by future cable throws and rearrangements should not be included. Tags on load coil stubs shall include the serial number of the coil case, the manufacturer's name, and the inductance value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Screened cable. Screened PIC cable is spliced in the same manner as nonscreened PIC cable. However, special considerations are necessary due to differences in the cable design. The transmit and receive bundles of the cable shall be separated and one of the bundles shall be wrapped with shielding material in accordance with the cable manufacturer's recommendations. When acceptable to the cable manufacturer, it is permissible to use either the scrap screening tape removed from the cable during the sheath opening process provided the screening tape is edge coated or new pressure sensitive aluminum foil tape over polyethylene tape.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Service wire connections. (i) Buried service wires may be spliced directly to cable conductors inside pedestals using the same techniques required for branch cables. Buried service wires may also be terminated on terminal blocks inside pedestals in areas where high service order activity or fixed count cable administration policies require terminal blocks. However, only RUS accepted terminal blocks equipped with grease or gel filled terminations to provide moisture and corrosion resistance shall be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Buried service wires may be spliced directly to cable conductors inside pedestals using the same techniques required for branch cables.

Copper cable testing shall be performed in accordance with RUS Bulletin 345-63, ``RUS Standard for Acceptance Tests and Measurements of Telephone Plant,'' PC-4, (Incorporated by reference at Sec. 1755.97).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> Cable acceptance. Installed cable shall be tested and pass the inventory and acceptance testing specified in the Telephone System Construction Contract (Labor and Materials), RUS Form 515. The tests and inspections shall be witnessed by the borrower's resident project representative. All conductors shall be free from grounds, shorts, crosses, splits, and opens.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Splice arrangements for copper cables--(1) Service distribution closures. (i) Ready access closures permit cable splicing activities and the installation of filled terminal blocks for service wire connections in the same closure. Ready access designs shall allow service technicians direct access to the cable core as well as the terminal block.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Service distribution closures.

Predetermined cable pairs shall be spliced to the terminal leads or

stub cable in advance of service assignments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Aerial splices. Aerial splice cases accommodate straight splices, branch splices, load coils, and service distribution terminals. Aerial splicing arrangements having more than 4 cables spliced in the same splice case are not recommended. Stub cabling to a second splice case to avoid a congested splice is acceptable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Buried splices.

Direct buried splices shall be filled and shall be used only when above ground splicing in pedestals is not practicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Direct buried splice cases accommodate straight splices, branch splices, and load coils.

Where a firm base for burying a splice cannot be obtained, a treated plank or equivalent shall be placed beneath the splice case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Each buried splice shall be identified for future locating. One method of marking the splice point is the use of a warning sign. Another method is the burying of an electronic locating device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> BD-type pedestals. (i) BD-type pedestals are housings primarily intended to house, organize, and protect cable terminations incorporating splice connectors, ground lugs, and load coils.

Restricted access inserts may be used to protect splices susceptible to unnecessary handling where subsequent work activities are required or expected to occur after splices have been completed. Restricted access inserts also provide moisture protection in areas susceptible to temporary flooding. A typical restricted access insert is shown in Figure 1:

the point where the outside plant cables enter the building.

A loss of 0.2 dB in a splice corresponds to a light transmission efficiency of approximately 95.5 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fiber core alignment. Fiber splicing techniques shall be conducted in such a manner that the cores of the fibers will be aligned as perfectly as possible to allow maximum light transmission from one fiber to the next. Without proper alignment, light will leave the fiber core and travel through the fiber cladding. Light outside the fiber core is not a usable light signal. Core misalignment is illustrated in Figure 6:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR26JA95.007</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Splice loss. (i) Splice loss can also be caused by fiber defects such as nonidentical core diameters, cores not in center of the fiber, and noncircular cores. Such defects are depicted in Figure 7:

Minor damage may change the transmission characteristics of the fibers to the extent that the cable section will have to be replaced;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The cable manufacturer's recommendations concerning pulling tension shall be observed. The maximum pulling tension for most fiber optic cable is 2669 newtons (600 pound-force);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The cable manufacturer's recommendations concerning bending radius shall be observed. Unless the cable manufacturer's recommendation is more stringent, the minimum bending radius for fiber optic cable shall be 20 times the cable diameter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The cable manufacturer's recommendations concerning buffer tube bending radius shall be observed. Unless the cable manufacturer's recommendation is more stringent, the minimum bending radius for buffer tubes is usually between 38 millimeters (mm) (1.5 in.) and 76 mm (3.0 in.). The bending limitations on buffer tubes are intended to prevent kinking.
