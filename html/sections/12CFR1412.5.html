                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A System institution may agree to make or may make a golden parachute payment if and to the extent that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The FCA, with the written concurrence of the Corporation, determines that such a payment or agreement is permissible; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Such an agreement is made in order to hire a person to become an IRP either at a time when the System institution satisfies or in an effort to prevent it from imminently satisfying any of the criteria set forth in Sec.  1412.2(f)(1)(ii), and the FCA and the Corporation consent in writing to the amount and terms of the golden parachute payment. Such consent by the Corporation and the FCA shall not improve the IRP's position in the event of the insolvency of the institution since such consent can neither bind a receiver nor affect the provability of receivership claims. In the event that the institution is placed into receivership or conservatorship, the Corporation and/or the FCA shall not be obligated to pay the promised golden parachute and the IRP shall not be accorded preferential treatment on the basis of such prior approval; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Such a payment is made pursuant to an agreement which provides for a reasonable severance payment, not to exceed 18-months' salary, to an IRP in the event of a change in control of the System institution; provided, however, that the System institution shall obtain the consent of the FCA prior to making such a payment and this paragraph (a)(3) shall not apply to any change in control of System institution which results from an assisted transaction as described in section 5.61 of the Farm Credit Act; 12 U.S.C. 2277a-10 or the System institution being placed into conservatorship or receivership; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A System institution or IRP making a request pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section shall demonstrate that it is not aware of any information, evidence, documents or other materials which would indicate that there is a reasonable basis to believe, at the time such payment is proposed to be made, that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The IRP has committed any fraudulent act or omission, breach of trust or fiduciary duty, or insider abuse with regard to the System institution that has had or is likely to have a material adverse effect on the institution;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The IRP is substantially responsible for the insolvency of, the appointment of a conservator or receiver for, or the troubled condition, as defined by

applicable regulations concerning the System institution;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The IRP has materially violated any applicable Federal or state law or regulation that has had or is likely to have a material effect on the System institution; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The IRP has violated or conspired to violate section 215, 657, 1006, 1014, or 1344 of title 18 of the United States Code or section 1341 or 1343 of such title affecting a Farm Credit System institution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In making a determination under paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section the FCA and the Corporation may consider:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether, and to what degree, the IRP was in a position of managerial or fiduciary responsibility;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The length of time the IRP was affiliated with the System institution, and the degree to which the proposed payment represents reasonable compensation earned over the period of employment and reasonable payment for services rendered; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any other factors or circumstances which would indicate that the proposed payment would be contrary to the intent of the Act or this part.</p>
