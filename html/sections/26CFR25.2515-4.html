                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The rules provided in section 2515(b) (see Sec. 25.2515-3) are not applied in determining whether a gift has been made at the termination of a tenancy to the extent that the consideration furnished for the creation of the tenancy was treated as a gift or if the consideration for the creation of the tenancy was furnished by a third party. Consideration furnished for the creation of the tenancy was treated as a gift if it was furnished either (1) during calendar years prior to 1955, or (2) during the calendar year 1955 and subsequent calendar years and calendar quarters and the donor spouse exercised the election to treat the furnishing of consideration as a gift. (For the definition of calendar quarter see Sec. 25.2502-1(c)(1).) See paragraph (b) of this section for the manner of computing the value of gifts resulting from the termination of the tenancy under these circumstances. See paragraph (c) of this section for the rules to be applied where part of the total consideration for the creation of the tenancy and additions to the value thereof was not treated as a gift and part either was treated as a gift or was furnished by a third party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Value of gift when entire consideration is of the type described in paragraph (a) of this section. If the entire consideration for the creation of a tenancy by the entirety was treated as a gift or contributed by a third party, the determination of the amount, if any, of a gift made at the termination of the tenancy will be made by the application of the general principles set forth in Sec. 25.2511-1. Under those principles, when a spouse surrenders a property interest in a tenancy, the creation of which was treated as a gift, and in return receives an amount (whether in the form of cash, property, or an interest in property) less than

the value of the property interest surrendered, that spouse is deemed to have made a gift in an amount equal to the difference between the value at the time of termination, of the property interest surrendered by such spouse and the amount received in exchange. Thus, if the husband's interest in such a tenancy at the time of termination is worth $44,971 and the wife's interest therein at the time is worth $55,029, the property is sold for $100,000, and each spouse received $50,000 out of the proceeds of the sale, the wife has made a gift to the husband of $5,029. The principles applied in paragraph (c) of Sec. 25.2515-2 for the method of determining the value of the respective interests of the spouses at the time of the creation of a tenancy by the entirety are equally applicable in determining the value of each spouse's interest in the tenancy at termination, except that the actuarial factors to be applied are those for the respective spouses at the ages attained at the date of termination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Valuation of gift where both types of consideration are involved. If the consideration furnished consists in part of the type described in paragraph (a) of Sec. 25.2515-3 (consideration furnished by the spouses after 1954, and not treated as a gift in the calendar quarter or calendar year in which it was furnished) and in part of the type described in paragraph (a) of this section (consideration furnished by the spouses and treated as a gift or furnished by a third party), the amount of the gift is determined as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> By applying the principles set forth in paragraph (b) of Sec. 25.2515-3 to that portion of the total proceeds of termination which the consideration described in paragraph (a) of Sec. 25.2515-3 bears to the total consideration furnished;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> By applying the principles set forth in paragraph (b) of this section to the remaining portion of the total proceeds of termination; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> By subtracting the proceeds of termination received by the donor from the total of the amounts which under the principles referred to in subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph are to be compared with the proceeds of termination received by a spouse in determining whether a gift was made by that spouse. For example, assume that consideration of $30,000 was furnished by the husband in 1954. Assume also that on February 1, 1955, the husband contributed $12,000 and the wife $8,000, the husband's contribution not being treated as a gift (see paragraph (b) of Sec. 25.2515-1). Assume further that between 1957 and 1965 the property appreciated in value by $40,000 and was sold in 1965 for $90,000 (of which the husband received $40,000 and the wife $50,000). The principles set forth in paragraph (b) of Sec. 25.2515-3 are applied to $36,000 (20,000/50,000x$90,000) in arriving at the amount which is compared with the proceeds of termination received by a spouse. Applying the principles set forth in paragraph (b) of Sec. 25.2515-3, this amount in the case of the husband is $21,600 (12,000/20,000x$36,000). Similarly, the principles set forth in paragraph (b) of this section are applied to $54,000 ($90,000-36,000), the remaining portion of the proceeds of termination, in arriving at the amount which is compared with the proceeds of termination received by a spouse. If in this case either spouse, without the consent of the other spouse, can bring about a severance of his interest in the tenancy, the amount determined under paragraph (b) of this section in the case of the husband would be $27,000 (\1/2\ of $54,000). The total of the two amounts which are to be compared with the proceeds of termination received by the husband is $48,600 ($21,600+27,000). This sum of $48,600 is then compared with the $40,000 proceeds received by the husband, and the termination of the tenancy has resulted, for gift tax purposes, in a transfer of $8,600 by the husband to his wife in 1965. See paragraph (d) of this section for an additional example illustrating the application of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The application of paragraph (c) of this section may further be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth2">Example. X died in 1948 and devised real property to Y and Z (Y's wife) as tenant by the entirety. Under the law of the jurisdiction, both spouses are entitled to share equally in the income from, or the enjoyment of, the property, but neither spouse, acting alone, may defeat the right of the survivor of them to the whole of the property. The fair market value of the property at the

time of X's death was $100,000 and this amount is the consideration which X furnished toward the creation of the tenancy. In 1955, at which time the fair market value of the property was the same as at the time of X's death, improvements of $50,000 were made to the property, of which Y furnished $40,000 out of his own funds and Z furnished $10,000 out of her own funds. Y did not elect to treat his transfer to the tenancy as resulting in the making of a gift in 1955. In 1956 the property was sold for $300,000 and Y and Z each received $150,000 of the proceeds. At the time the property was sold Y and Z were 45 and 40 years of age, respectively, on their birthdays nearest the date of sale. The value of the gift made by Y to Z is $19,942, computed as follows:</p><p class="depth2">Amount determined under principles set forth in Sec. 25.2515-3:$50,000 (consideration not treated as gift in year furnished)/$150,000</p><p class="depth2">(total consideration furnished)x$300,000 (proceeds of</p><p class="depth2">termination)=$100,000 (proceeds of termination to which</p><p class="depth2">principles set forth in Sec. 25.2515-3 apply)$40,000 (consideration furnished by H and not treated as gift)/$50,000</p><p class="depth2">(total consideration not treated as gift)x$100,000=$80,000</p><p class="depth2">Amount determined under principles set forth in paragraph (b) of this section:$300,000 (total proceeds of termination)--$100,000 (proceeds to which</p><p class="depth2">principles set forth in Sec. 25.2515-3 apply)=$200,000</p><p class="depth2">(proceeds to which principles set forth in paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth2">apply) 0.44971 (factor for Y's latest)x$200,000=$89,942
