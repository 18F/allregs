                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirement for written requests. Individuals desiring to gain  access to a record pertaining to them in a system of records maintained  by SSS must submit their request in writing in accord with the  procedures set forth in paragraph (b) below.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedures--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Content of the request. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The request for  access to a record in a system of records shall be addressed to the  records manager, at the address cited above, and shall name the system  of records or contain a description of such system of records. The  request should state that the request is pursuant to the Privacy Act of  1974. In the absence of specifying solely the Privacy Act of 1974 and,  if the request may be processed under both the Freedom of Information  Act and the Privacy Act and the request specifies both or neither act,  the procedures under the Privacy Act of 1974 will be employed. The  individual will be advised that the procedures of the Privacy Act will  be utilized, of the existence and the general effect of the Freedom of  Information Act, and the difference between procedures under the two  acts (e.g. fees, time limits, access). The request should contain  necessary information to verify the identity of the requester (see  Sec. 1665.2(b)(2)(vi)). In addition, the requester should include any  other information which may assist in the rapid identification of the  record for which access is being requested (e.g., maiden name, dates of  employment, etc.) as well as any other identifying information contained  in and required by SSS Notice of Systems of Records.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the request for access follows a prior request under  Sec. 1665.1, the same identifying information need not be included in  the request for access if a reference is made to that prior  correspondence, or a copy of the SSS response to that request is  attached.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the individual specifically desires a copy of the record,  the request should so specify.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> SSS action on request. A request for access will ordinarily be  answered within 10 days, except when the records manager determines that  access cannot be afforded in that time, in which case the requester will  be informed of the reason for the delay and an estimated date by which  the request will be answered. Normally access will be granted within 30  days from the date the request was received by the Selective Service  System. At a minimum, the answer to the request for access shall include  the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A statement that there is a record as requested or a statement  that there is not a record in the system of records maintained by SSS;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A statement as to whether access will be granted only by  providing copy of the record through the mail; or the address of the  location and the date and time at which the record may be examined. In  the event the requester is unable to meet the specified date and time,  alternative arrangements may be made with the official specified in  Sec. 1665.2(b)(1);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A statement, when appropriate, that examination in person will  be the sole means of granting access only when the records manager has  determined that it would not unduly impede the requester's right of  access;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The amount of fees charged, if any (see Sec. 1665.6) (Fees are  applicable only to requests for copies);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The name, title, and telephone number of the SSS official having  operational control over the record; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The documentation required by SSS to verify the identity of the  requester. At a minimum, SSS's verification standards include the  following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Current or former SSS employees. Current or former SSS employees  requesting access to a record pertaining to them in a system of records  maintained by SSS may, in addition to the other requirements of this  section, and at the sole discretion of the official having operational  control over the record, have his or her identity verified by visual  observation. If the current or former SSS employee cannot be so  identified by the official having operational control over the records,  identification documentation will be required. Employee identification  cards, annuitant identification, drivers licenses, or the employee copy  of any official personnel document in the record are examples of  acceptable identification validation.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Other than current or former SSS employees. Individuals other  than current or former SSS employees requesting access to a record  pertaining to them in a system of records maintained by SSS must produce  identification documentation of the type described herein, prior to  being granted access. The extent of the identification documentation  required will depend on the type of record to be accessed. In most  cases, identification verification will be accomplished by the  presentation of two forms of identification. Any additional requirements  are specified in the system notices published pursuant to 5 U.S.C.  552a(e)(4).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Access granted by mail. For records to be accessed by mail, the  records manager shall, to the extent possible, establish identity by a  comparison of signatures in situations where the data in the record is  not so sensitive that unauthorized access could cause harm or  embarrassment to the individual to whom they pertain. No identification  documentation will be required for the disclosure to the requester of  information required to be made available to the public by 5 U.S.C. 552.  When in the opinion of the records manager the granting of access  through the mail could reasonably be expected to result in harm or  embarrassment if disclosed to a person other than the individual to whom  the record pertains, a notarized statement of identity or some similar  assurance of identity will be required.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Unavailability of identification documentation. If an individual  is unable to produce adequate identification documentation the  individual will be required to sign a statement asserting identity and  acknowledging that knowingly or willfully seeking or obtaining access to  a record about another person under false pretenses may result in a fine  of up to $5,000. In addition, depending upon the sensitivity of the  records sought to be accessed, the official having operational control  over the records may require such further reasonable assurances as may  be considered appropriate e.g., statements of other individuals who can  attest to the identity of the requester. No verification of identity  will be required of individuals seeking access to records which are  otherwise available to any person under 5 U.S.C. 552, Freedom of  Information Act.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Access by the parent of a minor, or legal guardian. A parent of  a minor, upon presenting suitable personal identification, may access on  behalf of the minor any record pertaining to the minor   maintained by SSS in a system of records. A legal guardian may similarly  act on behalf of an individual declared to be incompetent due to  physical or mental incapacity or age by a court of competent  jurisdiction. Absent a court order or consent, a parent or legal  guardian has no absolute right to have access to a record about a child.  Minors are not precluded from exercising on their own behalf rights  given to them by the Privacy Act.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Granting access when accompanied by another individual. When an  individual requesting access to his or her record in a system of records  maintained by SSS wishes to be accompanied by another individual during  the course of the examination of the record, the individual making the  request shall submit to the official having operational control of the  record, a signed statement authorizing that person access to the record.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Denial of access for inadequate identification documentation. If  the official having operational control over the records in a system of  records maintained by SSS determines that an individual seeking access  has not provided sufficient identification documentation to permit  access, the official shall consult with the records manager prior to  finally denying the individual access.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> Review of decision to deny access. Whenever the records manager  determines, in accordance with the procedures herein, that access cannot  be granted the response will also include a statement of the procedures  to obtain a review of the decision to deny in accord with Sec. 1665.5.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Exceptions. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Nothing in these regulations shall be  construed to entitle an individual the right to access to any  information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or  proceeding. The mere fact that records in a system of records are  frequently the subject of litigation does not bring those systems of  records within the scope of this provision. This provision is not  intended to preclude access by an individual to the records which are  available to that individual under the other processes such as the  Freedom of Information Act or the rules of civil procedure.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Within any system of records pertaining to possible violations  of the Military Selective Service Act, the identity of or any  information pertaining to any individual who provides information  relating to a suspected violator will not be revealed to the suspected  violator. This exemption is made under the provision of 5 U.S.C.  552a(k)(2).</p>
