                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Recurring reports of abuse and misuse of methamphetamine (also  known as desoxyephedrine) inhalers show that they have a potentiality  for harmful effect and that they should not be freely available to the  public through over-the-counter sale. From complaints by law-enforcement  officials, health officials, individual physicians, parents, and others  as well as from Food and Drug Administration investigations, it is  evident that the wicks from these inhalers are being removed and the  methamphetamine they contain is being used as a substitute for  amphetamine tablets. Amphetamine tablets and amphetamine inhalers have  been restricted to prescription sale because of their potentiality for  harm to the user.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It is the considered opinion of the Food and Drug Administration  that, in order to adequately protect the public health, inhalers  containing methamphetamine or methamphetamine salts (d-desoxyephedrine,  or dl-desoxyephedrine, or their salts), as well as amphetamine inhalers  should be restricted to prescription sale and should be labeled with the  statement ``Rx only.''
