                            <p class="depth0">An acknowledgment is a proceeding by which a person who has executed  an instrument goes before a competent officer or court and declares it  to be his act and deed to entitle it to be recorded or to be received in  evidence without further proof of execution. An acknowledgment is almost  never made under oath and should not be confused with an oath (see Sec.  92.18(a) for definition of oath). Moreover, an acknowledgment is not the  same as an attestation, the latter being the act of witnessing the  execution of an instrument and then signing it as a witness. Instruments  requiring acknowledgment generally are those relating to land, such as  deeds, mortgages, leases, contracts for the sale of land, and so on.</p>
