                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definition. For the purposes of this subpart, valid existing rights are defined as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For certain ``Wild'' River segments. The rights associated with all mining claims on National Forest System lands within the SRNRA in ``wild'' segments of the Wild and Scenic Smith River, Middle Fork Smith River, North Fork Smith River, Siskiyou Fork Smith River, South Fork Smith River, and their designated tributaries, except Peridotite Creek, Harrington Creek, and the lower 2.5 miles of Myrtle Creek, which:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Were properly located prior to January 19, 1981;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Were properly maintained thereafter under the applicable law;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Were supported by a discovery of a valuable mineral deposit within the meaning of the United States mining laws prior to January 19, 1981, which discovery has been continuously maintained since that date; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Continue to be valid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For Siskiyou Wilderness. The rights associated with all mining claims on National Forest System lands within the SRNRA in the Siskiyou Wilderness except, those within the Gasquet-Orleans Corridor addition or those rights covered by paragraph (a)(1) of this section which:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Were properly located prior to September 26, 1984;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Were properly maintained thereafter under the applicable law;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Were supported by a discovery of a valuable mineral deposit within the meaning of the United States mining laws prior to September 26, 1984, which discovery has been continuously maintained since that date; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Continue to be valid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For all other lands. The rights associated with all mining claims on National Forest System lands in that portion of the SRNRA not covered by paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section which:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Were properly located prior to November 16, 1990;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Were properly maintained thereafter under the applicable law;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Were supported by a discovery of a valuable mineral deposit within the meaning of the United States mining laws prior to November 16, 1990, which discovery has been continuously maintained since that date; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Continue to be valid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Operations to confirm discovery. The authorized officer shall authorize those mineral operations that may be necessary for the purpose of gathering information to confirm or otherwise demonstrate the discovery of a valuable mineral deposit consistent with the definition in paragraph (a) of this section or to obtain evidence for a contest hearing regarding the claim's validity, upon receipt of a proposed plan of operations as defined in Sec. 292.63 of this subpart to conduct such operations and of sufficient information from the operator to show an exposure of valuable minerals on a claim that predates the withdrawal of the federal land from the operation of the United States mining laws. The authorized officer shall authorize only those operations that may be necessary to confirm or demonstrate the discovery of a valuable mineral deposit prior to the date of withdrawal of the federal land on which the claim is situated. Pursuant to this paragraph, the authorized officer shall not authorize any operations which would constitute prospecting, exploration, or otherwise uncovering or discovering a valuable mineral deposit.</p><p class="depth2">Locatable Minerals</p>
