In determining whether LCDs or NCDs are valid, the adjudicator must uphold a challenged policy (or a provision or provisions of a challenged policy) if the findings of fact, interpretations of law, and applications of fact to law by the contractor or CMS are reasonable based on the LCD or NCD record and the relevant record developed before the ALJ or the Board.</p><p class="depth2">Supplemental LCD/NCD record is a record that the contractor/CMS provides to the ALJ/Board and any aggrieved party and consists of all materials received and considered during a reconsideration. Materials that are already in the record before the ALJ/Board (for example, new evidence presented in the taking of evidence or hearing) need not be provided but may be incorporated by reference in the supplement to the LCD/NCD record. The contractor/CMS may provide statements, evidence, or other submissions to the ALJ/Board during the proceedings, as provided elsewhere in these regulations, but these submissions are not considered as supplementing the LCD/NCD record.</p><p class="depth2">Treating physician means the physician who is the beneficiary's primary clinician with responsibility for overseeing the beneficiary's care and either approving or providing the service at issue in the challenge.</p>
