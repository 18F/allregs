                                Sec. 107.1180  Required distributions to SBA by Early Stage SBICs.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Distribution requirement. If you are an Early Stage SBIC with outstanding Leverage, you may make Distributions to your investors and to SBA only as permitted under this section. See also Sec. 107.585. For the purposes of this section, ``Distributions'' do not include required payments to SBA of interest and Charges and payments of Leverage principal at maturity, all of which shall be paid in accordance with the terms of the Leverage. You may make a Distribution on any Payment Date. Unless SBA permits otherwise, you must notify SBA in writing of any planned distribution under this section, including computations of the amounts distributable to SBA and your investors, at least 10 business days before the distribution date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> How SBA will apply Distributions. Any amounts you distribute to SBA, or its designated agent or Trustee, under this section will be applied to repayment of principal of outstanding Debentures in order of issue. You may prepay any Debenture in whole, but not in part, on any Payment Date without penalty.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Condition for making a Distribution. You may make a Distribution under this section only if you have paid all interest and Charges on your outstanding Debentures that are due and payable, or will pay such interest and Charges simultaneously with your Distribution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> SBA's share of Distribution. For each proposed Distribution, determine SBA's share of the Distribution as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determine the highest ratio of outstanding Leverage to Leverageable Capital that you have ever attained (your ``Highest Leverage Ratio''). For the purpose of determining your Highest Leverage Ratio, any deferred interest Debentures issued at a discount must be included in the computation at their face value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determine SBA's percentage share of cumulative Distributions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If your Capital Impairment Percentage under Sec. 107.1840 is less than 50 percent as of the Distribution date or your Highest Leverage Ratio equals 0.5 or less, except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, SBA's percentage share of cumulative Distributions equals:
[Highest Leverage Ratio/(Highest Leverage Ratio + 1)] x 100For example, if your Highest Leverage Ratio equals 1, then SBA's share of any distribution you make will be 50 percent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If your Capital Impairment Percentage under Sec. 107.1840 is 50 percent or greater as of the Distribution date and your Highest Leverage Ratio is greater than 0.5, SBA's percentage share of cumulative Distributions equals 100 percent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If you have a condition of Capital Impairment under Sec. 107.1830 and your Highest Leverage Ratio equals 0.5 or less as of the Distribution date, SBA's percentage share of cumulative Distributions equals 100 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Multiply the sum of all your prior Distributions and your current proposed Distribution (including Distributions to SBA, your limited partners and your General Partner) by SBA's percentage share of cumulative Distributions as determined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> From the result in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, subtract the sum of all your prior Distributions to SBA under this Sec. 107.1180.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The amount of your Distribution to SBA will be the least of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The result in paragraph (d)(4) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Your current proposed Distribution; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Your outstanding Leverage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Additional Leverage prepayment. On any Payment Date, subject to the terms of your Leverage, you may make a payment to SBA to be applied to repayment of the principal of one or more outstanding Debentures in order of issue, without making any Distribution to your investors.
