                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the alien expresses fear of persecution or harm upon return  to his or her country of origin or to a country to which the alien may  be deported after a determination of excludability from the United  States pursuant to this subpart, and the alien has not been referred to  the immigration judge by an asylum officer in accordance with Sec.  1208.14(b) of this chapter, the immigration judge shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Advise the alien that he or she may apply for asylum in the  United States or withholding of deportation to that other country; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Make available the appropriate application forms.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of this  chapter. Upon receipt of an application, the Immigration Court may  forward a copy to the Department of State pursuant to Sec. 1208.11 of  this chapter and shall calendar the case for a hearing. The reply, if  any, from the Department of State, unless classified under an applicable  Executive Order, shall be given to both the applicant and to DHS counsel  and shall be included in the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> of  this chapter is not necessary once the immigration judge has determined  that such denial is required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Evidentiary hearings on applications for asylum or withholding  of deportation will be closed to the public unless the applicant  expressly requests   that it be open pursuant to Sec. 1236.3 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Nothing in this section is intended to limit the authority of  the immigration judge properly to control the scope of any evidentiary  hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> During the exclusion hearing, the applicant shall be examined  under oath on his or her application and may present evidence and  witnesses on his or her own behalf. The applicant has the burden of  establishing that he or she is a refugee as defined in section  101(a)(42) of the Act pursuant to the standard set forth in Sec.  1208.13 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Service counsel for the government may call witnesses and  present evidence for the record, including information classified under  the applicable Executive Order, provided the immigration judge or the  Board has determined that such information is relevant to the hearing.  The applicant shall be informed when the immigration judge receives such  classified information. The agency that provides the classified  information to the immigration judge may provide an unclassified summary  of the information for release to the applicant whenever it determines  it can do so consistently with safeguarding both the classified nature  of the information and its source. The summary should be as detailed as  possible, in order that the applicant may have an opportunity to offer  opposing evidence. A decision based in whole or in part on such  classified information shall state that such information is material to  the decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The decision of an immigration judge to grant or deny asylum or  withholding of deportation shall be communicated to the applicant and to  the Service counsel for the government. An adverse decision will state  why asylum or withholding of deportation was denied.  [62 FR 10367, Mar. 6, 1997, as amended at 78 FR 19080, Mar. 29, 2013]</p>
