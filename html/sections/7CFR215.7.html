Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be construed to limit the ability of the State agency to suspend or terminate the agreement in accordance with Sec. 215.15. If a single State agency administers any combination of the Child Nutrition Programs, that State agency shall provide each SFA with a single agreement with respect to the operation of those programs.

Such records shall be retained for a period of three years after the end of the fiscal year to which they pertain, except that, if audit findings have not been resolved, the records shall be retained beyond the three-year period as long as required for the resolution of the issues raised by the audit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Retain the individual applications for free milk submitted by families for a period of three years after the end of the fiscal year to which they pertain, except that, if audit findings have not been resolved, the records shall be retained beyond the three-year period as long as required for the resolution of the issues raised by the audit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> State requirements.
