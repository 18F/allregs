                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Payment due dates. Loan or other payments due to the Agency are  due on the first day of each month unless otherwise established in the  debt instrument or other agreement executed with the Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Payment application order. Loan payments will be applied to the  borrower's account in the following order of priority:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Amortized audit receivables. (i.e., amounts due to the Agency,  over a period of time, as a result of a finding from an audit or other  monitoring activity.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unamortized audit receivables. (i.e., amounts due to the Agency,  in a lump sum payment, as a result of a finding from an audit or other  monitoring activity.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Late fees. (i.e., amounts due to the Agency as a result of late  payments.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Amortized recoverable costs. (i.e., amounts due to the Agency,  over a period of time, as a result of Agency payments made on behalf of  a borrower for housing project related expenses such as taxes or  insurance premiums.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Unamortized recoverable costs. (i.e., amounts due to the Agency,  in a lump sum payment, as a result of Agency payments made on behalf of  a borrower for housing project related expenses such as taxes or  insurance premiums.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Overage. (i.e., amounts due to the Agency as a result of a  tenant's tenant contribution being higher than basic rent.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Interest. (i.e., amounts due to the Agency as a result of  scheduled interest on a loan and as a result of interest   charged on unpaid delinquent principal amounts.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Principal. (i.e., amounts due to the Agency as the loan  principal.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Advance payments. (Any funds remaining after disbursement of a  payment to all other payment priorities will be applied to the  borrower's account as an advance regular payment unless a borrower  specifically designates, in writing, another application.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Late fees. If payments on a borrower's account, under PASS, are  more than $15 delinquent after the close of business on the 10th day  after the payment due date, a late fee will be charged to the borrower's  account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Late fees charged to a borrower's account will equal 6 percent  of the total regular payments due as specified in any promissory notes,  assumption agreements, or reamortization agreements related to the  borrower's account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Late fees are a borrower expense and must not be paid from  housing project funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Agency may waive late fees for circumstances beyond a  borrower's control and when a waiver is determined by the Agency to be  in the best financial interest of the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Interest on unpaid overdue principal. On the first day of the  month following a payment due date, the Agency will charge interest at  the note rate on any unpaid principal payment due according to the  loan's amortization schedule (i.e., interest will be charged on  delinquent principal). The interest charged on the unpaid principal  payment due will be charged to the borrower in addition to the scheduled  interest due on payments according to the loan's amortization schedule.</p>
