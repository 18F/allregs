                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The assignment of load lines is conditioned upon the structural  efficiency and satisfactory stability of the vessel, and upon the  provisions provided on the vessel for her effective protection and that  of the crew. Certain vessels, such as vessels carrying all their cargo  as deck cargo, or vessels where design or service require special  conditions to be applicable, shall have certain stability limitations  imposed on them, as may be necessary. When stability limitations for a  vessel are prescribed, the assigning authority shall furnish the master  the vessel's maximum draft permitted and other conditions, including  reference to Commandant approved operating stability features, which may  be applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No load line assignment shall be made under this part to a  vessel proceeding on a foreign voyage, or where the load line assignment  is related to the flooded stability provisions and the vessel is  proceeding on a domestic voyage, until the applicable light ship  characteristics are established and incorporated into the vessel's  stability data approved by the Commandant and furnished to the master of  the vessel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If load line assignments are made to vessels for coastwise  voyages before the results of the required stability characteristics are  determined and incorporated into the vessel's stability data approved by  the Commandant, then such load line assignments shall be regarded as  conditional and shall be subject to verification or modification for  removal of the conditional status. Any vessel with a conditional load  line assignment shall not be loaded beyond a conservative safe draft.  Where the Commandant deems it unnecessary, the requirement for  furnishing stability information to the masters of coastwise vessels  assigned load lines not related to flooded stability may be omitted and  the assigning authority and others concerned will be so notified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each vessel subject to load line requirements shall carry on  board a valid certificate attesting to compliance with such  requirements. (See Sec. Sec. 42.07-35 and 42.07-40 for additional data  furnished to the vessel.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The master of the vessel for which a load line certificate has  been issued shall be responsible for the maintenance of such certificate  on board such vessel and for compliance with its terms and conditions.  Additionally, the master shall be responsible for having the current  load line survey report on board the vessel. This report shall be made  available to surveyors when carrying out subsequent load line surveys.  [CGFR 68-60, 33 FR 10055, July 12, 1968, as amended by CGFR 68-126, 34  FR 9012, June 5, 1969]</p>
