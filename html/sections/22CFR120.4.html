                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The commodity jurisdiction procedure is used with the U.S.  Government if doubt exists as to whether an article or service is  covered by the U.S. Munitions List. It may also be used for  consideration of a redesignation of an article or service currently  covered by the U.S. Munitions List. The Department must provide notice  to Congress at least 30 days before any item is removed from the U.S.  Munitions List. Upon electronic submission of a Commodity Jurisdiction  (CJ) Determination Form (Form DS-4076), the Directorate of Defense Trade  Controls shall provide a determination of whether a particular article  or service is covered by the U.S. Munitions List. The determination,  consistent with Sec. Sec. 120.2, 120.3, and 120.4, entails consultation  among the Departments of State, Defense, Commerce, and other U.S.  Government agencies and industry in appropriate cases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Registration with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls as  defined in part 122 of this subchapter is not required prior to  submission of a commodity jurisdiction request. If it is determined that  the commodity is a defense article or defense service covered by the  U.S. Munitions List, registration is required for exporters,  manufacturers, and furnishers of such defense articles and defense  services (see part 122 of this subchapter), as well as for brokers who  are engaged in brokering activities related to such articles or  services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requests shall identify the article or service, and include a  history of this product's design, development, and use. Brochures,  specifications, and any other documentation related to the article or  service should be submitted as electronic attachments per the  instructions for Form DS-4076.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A designation that an article or service meets the criteria of a  defense article or defense service, or provides the equivalent  performance capabilities of a defense article on the U.S. Munitions List  set forth in this subchapter, is made on a case-by-case basis by the  Department of State, taking into account:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The form and fit of the article; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The function and performance capability of the article.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A designation that an article or service has a critical military  or intelligence advantage such that it warrants control under this  subchapter is made, on a case-by-case basis, by the Department of State,  taking into account:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The function and performance capability of the article; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The nature of controls imposed by other nations on such items  (including the Wassenaar Arrangement and other multilateral controls).</p><p class="depth4">Note 1 to paragraph (d): The form of a commodity is defined by its  configuration (including the geometrically measured configuration),  material, and material properties that uniquely characterize it. The fit  of a commodity is defined by its ability to physically interface or  connect with or become an integral part of another commodity. The  function of a commodity is the action or actions it is designed to  perform. Performance capability is the measure of a commodity's  effectiveness to perform a designated function in a given environment  (e.g., measured in terms of speed, durability, reliability, pressure,  accuracy, efficiency).</p><p class="depth4">Note 2 to paragraph (d): For software, the form means the design,  logic flow, and algorithms. The fit is defined by its ability to  interface or connect with a defense article. The function means the  action or actions the software performs directly related to a defense  article or as a standalone application.</p><p class="depth4">Performance capability means the measure of the software's  effectiveness to perform a designated function.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls will provide a  preliminary response within 10 working days of receipt of a complete  request for commodity jurisdiction. If after 45 days the Directorate of  Defense Trade Controls has not provided a final commodity jurisdiction  determination, the applicant may request in writing to the Director,  Office of Defense Trade Controls Policy that this determination be given  expedited processing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> State, Defense and Commerce will resolve commodity jurisdiction  disputes in accordance with established procedures. State shall notify  Defense and Commerce of the initiation and conclusion of each case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A person may appeal a commodity jurisdiction determination by  submitting a written request for reconsideration to the Deputy Assistant  Secretary of State for Defense Trade Controls. The Deputy Assistant  Secretary's determination of the appeal will be provided, in writing,  within 30 days of receipt of the appeal. If desired, an appeal of the  Deputy Assistant Secretary's decision can then be made to the Assistant  Secretary for Political-Military Affairs.
