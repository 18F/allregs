                                Sec. 15.715  TV bands database administrator.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The Commission will designate one or more entities to administer the  TV bands database(s). The Commission may, at its discretion, permit the  functions of a TV bands database, such as a data repository,  registration, and query services, to be divided among multiple entities;  however, it will designate specific entities to be a database  administrator responsible for coordination of the overall functioning of  a database and providing services to TVBDs. Each database administrator  designated by the Commission shall:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Maintain a database that contains the information described in  Sec. 15.713.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Establish a process for acquiring and storing in the database  necessary and appropriate information from the Commission's databases  and synchronizing the database with the current Commission databases at  least once a week to include newly licensed facilities or any changes to  licensed facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Establish a process for registering fixed TVBDs and registering  and including in the database facilities entitled to protection but not  contained in a Commission database, including MVPD receive sites.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Establish a process for registering facilities where part 74 low  power auxiliary stations are used on a regular basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em>, (f), and (g) based on their geographic location and  provide accurate lists of available channels to fixed and Mode II  devices requesting lists of available channels   for Mode I devices. Database administrators may allow prospective  operators of TV bands devices to query the database and determine  whether there are vacant channels at a particular location.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Establish protocols and procedures to ensure that all  communications and interactions between the TV bands database and TVBDs  are accurate and secure and that unauthorized parties cannot access or  alter the database or the list of available channels sent to a TVBD  consistent with the provisions of Sec. 15.713(i).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Make its services available to all unlicensed TV band device  users on a non-discriminatory basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Provide service for a five-year term. This term can be renewed  at the Commission's discretion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Respond in a timely manner to verify, correct and/or remove, as  appropriate, data in the event that the Commission or a party brings  claim of inaccuracies in the database to its attention. This requirement  applies only to information that the Commission requires to be stored in  the database.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Transfer its database along with the IP addresses and URLs used  to access the database and list of registered Fixed TVBDs, to another  designated entity in the event it does not continue as the database  administrator at the end of its term. It may charge a reasonable price  for such conveyance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The database must have functionality such that upon request from  the Commission it can indicate that no channels are available when  queried by a specific TVBD or model of TVBDs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> If more than one database is developed, the database  administrators shall cooperate to develop a standardized process for  providing on a daily basis or more often, as appropriate, the data  collected for the facilities listed in Sec. 15.713(b)(2) to all other TV  bands databases to ensure consistency in the records of protected  facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Provide a means to make all information the rules require the  database to contain publicly available, including fixed TVBD  registrations and voluntarily submitted protected entity information.
