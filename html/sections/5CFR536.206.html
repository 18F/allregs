                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When an employee becomes entitled to grade  retention or becomes covered by one or more different pay schedules  (because of a change in the employee's position of record, a change in  the employee's official worksite, or the establishment of a new pay  schedule) during a period of grade retention, the agency must apply the  rules in this section to determine the employee's rate of basic pay.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This section does not apply to an employee whose entitlement to  grade retention is terminated under one of the conditions in Sec.  536.208. (See Sec. 536.208(d).)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Preexisting rate within a range. If an employee is entitled to a  rate of basic pay within the applicable rate range before the action  resulting in application of this section, the employee is entitled to  the rate(s) of basic pay in the applicable pay schedule(s) for the  employee's position of record after the action (including the retained  grade) which correspond to the employee's grade and step (or relative  position in range for a GM employee) immediately before the action. The  employee's payable rate is the corresponding rate in the highest  applicable rate range for the employee's position of record after the  action (including the retained grade). If an employee's rate of basic  pay otherwise would be reduced because of placement under a lower-paying  pay schedule (excluding any reduction that results from a geographic  conversion), the employee would be eligible for pay retention under  subpart C of this part to the same extent as other employees holding the  same position of record whose actual grade is the same as the employee's  retained grade.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Preexisting retained or saved rate. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an employee is  entitled to a retained rate immediately before the action resulting in  application of this section, the agency must determine the employee's  payable rate of basic pay under Sec. Sec. 536.303 and 536.304.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an employee is entitled to a saved rate under 5 CFR 359.705,  the agency must determine the employee's payable rate of basic pay under  that section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Order of processing pay actions. When an action resulting in  application of this section takes effect on the same effective date as  other pay actions that affect an employee's rate of basic pay (e.g.,  within-grade increase), the actions will be processed in the order  prescribed in the rules governing the covered pay system of the  employee's position of record (e.g., 5 CFR   531.206 for GS positions and 5 CFR 532.413 for Federal Wage System  positions).
