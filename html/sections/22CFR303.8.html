                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except for records required by the FOIA to be published in the  Federal Register or to be made available in the public reading room, the  Peace Corps will make its records promptly available, upon request, to  any person   in accordance with this section, unless it is determined that such  records should be withheld and are exempt from mandatory disclosure  under the FOIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requests. Requests for records under this section shall be made  in writing via regular mail, email, facsimile, or online web portal and,  as applicable, the envelope and the letter or other form of request  should be clearly marked ``Freedom of Information Request.'' All  requests shall be addressed to the FOIA Officer. Requests by letter  shall use the address given in Sec. 303.5(a). Requests by email must be  sent to the FOIA electronic mailbox, foia@peacecorps.gov. Regarding  requests submitted via online web portal (accessible on the agency Web  site, www.peacecorps.gov), requesters shall fill in all of the fields as  required. Any request not marked and addressed as specified in this  paragraph will be so marked by Peace Corps personnel as soon as the  request is properly identified. The request will be forwarded  immediately to the FOIA Officer. A request improperly addressed will not  be deemed to have been received for purposes of the time period set out  in paragraph (h) of this section until it has been received by the FOIA  Officer. Upon receipt of an improperly addressed request, the FOIA  Officer shall notify the requester of the date on which the time period  began. Requests by letter shall be stamped ``received'' on the date  received by the FOIA Office. Requests by email shall be ``received'' on  the date the email arrived, if a business day, or on the next business  day. Requests by online web portal will be entered automatically in the  FOIA tracking system. Requests sent via mail or email will be entered  manually in the FOIA tracking system. Requesters may utilize the online  web portal for purpose of checking status of requests (open/closed) for  requests from all sources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>. If the Agency cannot identify  the requested records after a 2 hour search, it may determine that the  records were not adequately described and ask the requester to provide a  more specific request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> To facilitate the location of records by the Peace Corps, a  requester should try to provide the following kinds of information, if  known;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The specific event or action to which the record refers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The unit or program of the Peace Corps which may be responsible  for or may have produced the record;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The date of the record or the date or period to which it refers  or relates;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The type of record, such as an application, a particular form, a  contract, or a report;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Personnel of the Peace Corps who may have prepared or have  knowledge of the record; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Citations to newspapers or publications which have referred to  the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Peace Corps is not required to create a record or to perform  research to satisfy a request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em>. The  Peace Corps shall respond to such request as promptly as possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Format. The Peace Corps will provide records in the form or  format indicated by the requester to the extent such records are readily  reproducible in the requested form or format.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Initial response/delays. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The FOIA Officer, upon request for  any records made in accordance with this section, except in the case of  a request for OIG records, shall assign a tracking number to each  individual request and send an acknowledgement letter or email to each  requester. The acknowledgement letter or email will inform   the requester of the assigned tracking number. The FOIA Officer will  make an initial determination of whether to comply with or deny such  request and dispatch such determination to the requester within 20  business days after receipt of such request. Peace Corps will  acknowledge all FOIA requests within 20 working days, except for unusual  circumstances, in which case the time limit may be extended for up to 10  business days by written notice to the requester setting forth the  reasons for such extension and the date on which a determination is  expected to be dispatched.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the FOIA Officer determines that a request or portion thereof  is for OIG records, the FOIA Officer shall promptly refer the request or  portion thereof to the OIG and send notice of such referral to the  requester. In such case, the OIG FOIA Officer shall make an initial  determination of whether to comply with or deny such request and  dispatch such determination to the requester within 20 business days  after receipt of such request, except for unusual circumstances, in  which case the time limit may be extended for up to 10 business days by  written notice to the requester setting forth the reasons for such  extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be  dispatched. If for any reason, a request for Agency information goes  directly to the OIG rather than through the FOIA Officer, the OIG shall  provide notice to the FOIA Officer of its receipt of the request. The  FOIA Office and the OIG should normally consult with each other whenever  they receive requests for the same or similar records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unusual circumstances. As used in this part, ``unusual  circumstances'' are limited to the following, but only to the extent  reasonably necessary for the proper processing of the particular  request:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The need to search for and collect the requested records from  components or locations that are separate from the office processing the  request;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a  voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in  a single request; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all  practicable speed, with another agency or organization having a  substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or  more components of the Peace Corps having a substantial subject matter  interest therin.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> If a request is particularly broad or complex so that it cannot  be completed within the time periods stated in paragraph (h) of this  section, the Peace Corps may ask the requester to narrow the request or  agree to an additional delay.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> When no determination can be dispatched within the applicable  time limit, the FOIA Officer or the OIG FOIA Officer shall inform the  requester of the reason for the delay, the date on which a determination  may be expected to be dispatched, and the requester's right to treat the  delay as a denial and to appeal to the Associate Director for the Office  of Management or the Inspector General, in accordance with Sec. 303.12.  If no determination has been dispatched by the end of the 20-day period,  or the last extension thereof, the requester may deem the request  denied, and exercise a right of appeal in accordance with Sec. 303.12.  The FOIA Officer or the OIG FOIA Officer may ask the requester to forego  an appeal until a determination is made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> After it has been determined that a request will be granted, the  responsible official will act with due diligence in providing a prompt  response.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Expedited treatment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requests and appeals will be taken out  of order and given expedited treatment whenever the requester  demonstrates a compelling need. A compelling need means:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could  reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or  physical safety of an individual;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged  Peace Corps or Federal government activity and the request is made by a  person primarily engaged in disseminating information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The loss of substantial due process rights; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which  there exist possible questions about the   Peace Corps' or the Federal government's integrity which affect public  confidence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A request for expedited processing may be made at the time of  the initial request for records or at any later time. For a prompt  determination, a request for expedited processing must be properly  addressed and marked and received by the Peace Corps pursuant to  paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a  statement demonstrating a compelling need that is certified by the  requester to be true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge  and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting expedited  processing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Within ten business days of its receipt of a request for  expedited processing, the FOIA Officer or the OIG FOIA Officer shall  decide whether to grant the request and shall notify the requester of  the decision. If a request for expedited treatment is granted, the  request shall be given priority and shall be processed as soon as  practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal  of that decision shall be acted on expeditiously by the Peace Corps.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Appeals shall be made to the Associate Director for the Office  of Management, who shall respond within 10 business days of receipt of  the appeal.
