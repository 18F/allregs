                                Sec. 10.206  Procedures for electronic media coverage of agency
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To facilitate the agency's response to media needs, a person  intending to videotape an FDA public administrative proceeding should,  whenever possible, provide advance notice to the Press Relations Staff  (HFI-20), Office of Public Affairs, Food and Drug Administration, 5600  Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, in writing or by telephone (telephone  301-443-4177), at least 48 hours in advance of the proceeding. The Press  Relations Staff will inform the presiding officer that the proceeding  will be attended by representatives of the electronic media, and  ascertain whether any special provisions in addition to those set forth  in this subpart are required by the presiding officer. If so, the Press  Relations Staff will function as a liaison between the presiding officer  and the person intending to record the proceeding in facilitating any  procedures in addition to those outlined in this subpart. The presiding  officer will not deny access for failure to provide a 48-hour advance  notice. Any advance notice may describe the intended length of recording  if known, the amount and type of equipment to be used, and any special  needs such as interviews.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cameras should be completely set up before a proceeding is  scheduled to begin or during a break in the proceeding and should remain  standing in the area designated for electronic media equipment. Cameras  may be taken down only during breaks or after the hearing is over.  Roving cameras will not be permitted during the proceeding. Any  artificial lighting should be unobtrusive. Microphones, like cameras,  should be in place before the start of a proceeding and may be taken  down as indicated in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When space in the hearing room is limited, the presiding officer  may restrict the number of cameras or the equipment present. Should such  a restriction become necessary, the pool arrangements are the  responsibility of the participating media. The agency encourages the  network pool to make copies of the tape, film, or other product  available at cost to nonpool participants. However, if this is not  possible, the agency may need to use the time of receipt of any advance  notice to determine the representation for each category, e.g., one  network reporter, one independent reporter, etc.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Off the record portions of a proceeding may not be videotaped.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Before or during the proceeding, the presiding officer may  establish other conditions specific to the proceeding for which the  request is being made. These conditions may be more or less restrictive  than those stated in this guideline, except that the presiding officer  shall observe the agency's presumption of openness of its public  proceedings to the electronic media. Only a substantial and clear threat  to the agency's interests in   order, fairness, and timeliness authorizes the presiding officer to  impose additional restrictions. This threat must outweigh the public  interest in electronic media coverage of agency proceedings. Additional  restrictions shall be narrowly drawn to the particular circumstances.  The following factors are listed to assist presiding officers in  determining whether the agency's interest is sufficiently compelling to  call for the unusual step of imposing additional restrictions. Generally  this step is justified when one of the following factors is met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Electronic recording would result in a substantial likelihood of  disruption that clearly cannot be contained by the procedures  established in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Electronic recording would result in a substantial likelihood of  prejudicial impact on the fairness of the proceeding or the substantive  discussion in a proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> There is a substantial likelihood that a witness' ability to  testify may be impaired due to unique personal circumstances such as the  age or psychological state of the witness or the particularly personal  or private nature of the witness' testimony, if the witness' testimony  were electronically recorded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Before the proceeding, the Press Relations Staff will, upon  request, provide written copies of any additional conditions imposed by  the presiding officer (as described in paragraph (e) of this section) to  requesting members of the media. Any appeals should be made in  accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The presiding officer retains authority to restrict or  discontinue videotaping or other recording of a proceeding, or parts of  a proceeding, should such a decision become necessary. The presiding  officer's responsibility to conduct the hearing includes the right and  duty to remove a source of substantial disruption. In exercising his or  her authority, the presiding officer shall observe the presumption that  agency public proceedings are open to the electronic media. The  presiding officer shall exercise his or her discretion to restrict or  discontinue electronic coverage of a public proceeding, or portions of a  public proceeding, only if he or she determines that the agency's  interest in the fair and orderly administrative process is substantially  threatened. A clear and substantial threat to the integrity of agency  proceedings must clearly outweigh the public interest in electronic  media coverage of the proceedings before additional restrictions are  imposed on the electronic media during the course of the proceedings.  The factors noted in paragraph (e) of this section indicate the kind of  substantial threat to the agency interests that may require imposing  additional restrictions during the course of the proceedings. If  additional requirements are established during the hearing, the  presiding officer shall notify immediately the Deputy Commissioner of  Food and Drugs of that fact by telephone and submit a written  explanation of the circumstances that necessitated such an action within  24 hours or sooner if requested by the Deputy Commissioner. In the  absence or unavailability of the Deputy Commissioner, the presiding  officer shall notify the Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> A decision by a presiding officer, made either before the  proceeding or during the course of a proceeding, to establish  requirements in addition to the minimum standards set forth in this  guideline may be appealed by any adversely affected person who intends  to record the proceeding electronically. Appeals may be made in writing  or by phone to the Deputy Commissioner or, in his or her absence, to the  Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs. The filing of an appeal,  whether before or during a proceeding, does not require the presiding  officer to interrupt the proceeding. However, the Deputy Commissioner  or, in his or her absence, the Associate Commissioner for Regulatory  Affairs will resolve an appeal as expeditiously as possible so as to  preserve, to the extent possible, the reporters' opportunity to record  the proceedings.
