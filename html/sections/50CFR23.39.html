As allowed under Article XIV(4) and (5) of the Treaty, you may directly introduce into the United States any Appendix-II wildlife or plant taken in the marine environment that is not under the jurisdiction of any country without a CITES document when all of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The United States is a party to an international treaty, convention, or agreement that affords protection to the species and was in force on July 1, 1975.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The ship that harvested the specimen is registered in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The specimen was taken in accordance with the other international treaty, convention, or agreement, including any quotas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The shipment is accompanied by any official document required under the other international treaty, convention, or agreement or otherwise required by U.S. law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Export of exempt specimens.

See requirements in Sec.  23.36 (e) through (g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Appendix III. Appendix-III species introduced from the sea do not require introduction-from-the-sea certificates. However, the subsequent international trade of an Appendix-III specimen introduced from the sea would be considered an export requiring a CITES document (see Sec.  23.20(f)).</p>
