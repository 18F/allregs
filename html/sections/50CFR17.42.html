Such shipments  may be seized if we determine that the requirements of the Convention  have not been met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The country of origin and any intermediary country(s) must be  effectively implementing the Convention. If we receive persuasive  information from the CITES Secretariat or other reliable sources that a  specific country is not effectively implementing the Convention, we will  prohibit or restrict imports from such country(s) as appropriate for the  conservation of the species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Meat, skulls, scientific specimens, products, and noncommercial  personal or household effects.

Except in rare cases  involving extenuating circumstances that do not adversely affect the  conservation of the species, the Service will issue an information  bulletin (posted on our websites, http://www.fws.gov/le and http:// www.fws.gov/international) announcing additional restrictions on trade  of specimens of threatened crocodilians if any of the following criteria  are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The country is listed in a Notification to the Parties by the  CITES Secretariat as not having designated Management and Scientific  Authorities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The country is identified in any action adopted by the  Conference of the Parties to the Convention, the Standing Committee, or  in a Notification issued by the CITES Secretariat, whereby Parties are  asked not to accept shipments of specimens of any CITES species from the  country in question or of any crocodilian species listed in the CITES  Appendices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> We determine, based on information from the CITES Secretariat  or other reliable sources, that the country is not effectively  implementing the provisions of the Convention.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Reporting requirements for yacare caiman range countries--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Biennial reports. Range countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and  Paraguay) wishing to export specimens of yacare caiman to the United  States for commercial purposes must provide a biennial report containing  the most recent information available on the status of the species. The  first submission of a status report will be required as of December 31,  2001, and every 2 years thereafter on the anniversary of that date. For  each range country, all of the following information must be included in  the report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Recent distribution and population data, and a description of  the methodology used to obtain such estimates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Description of research projects currently being conducted  related to the biology of the species in the wild, particularly  reproductive biology (for example, age or size when animals become  sexually mature, number of clutches per season, number of eggs per  clutch, survival of eggs, survival of hatchlings).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Description of laws and programs regulating harvest, including  approximate acreage of land set aside as natural reserves or national  parks that provide protected habitat for yacare caiman.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Description of current sustainable harvest programs, including  ranching (captive rearing of specimens collected from the wild as eggs  or juveniles) and farming (captive-breeding) programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Current harvest quotas for wild populations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Export data for the last 2 years. Information should be  organized according to the source of specimens such as wild-caught,  captive-reared, or captive-bred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Review and restrictions. The U.S. Scientific Authority will  conduct a review every 2 years, using information in the biennial  reports and other available information, to determine whether range  country management programs are effectively achieving conservation  benefits for the yacare caiman. Based on the best available information,  we may restrict trade from a range country if we determine that the  conservation or management status of threatened yacare caiman  populations has changed, such that continued recovery of the population  in that country may be compromised. Trade restrictions, as addressed in  paragraph (c)(4) of this section, may be implemented based on one or  more of the following factors:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Failure to submit the reports described above, or failure to  respond to requests for additional information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A change in range country laws or regulations that lessens  protection for yacare caiman.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A change in range country management programs that lessens  protection for the species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A documented decline in wild population numbers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> A documented increase in poaching.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> A documented decline in habitat quality or quantity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Other natural or manmade factors affecting the species'  recovery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Blue-tailed mole skink (Eumeces egregius lividus) and sand skink  (Neoseps reynoldsi). </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> No person shall take these species, except in  accordance with applicable State fish and wildlife conservation laws and  regulations for educational purposes, scientific purposes, the  enhancement or survival of the species, zoological exhibition, and other  conservation purposes consistent with the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any violation of applicable State fish and wildlife conservation  laws or regulations with respect to taking of these species is also a  violation of the Endangered Species Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> No person shall possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship,  import, or export, by any means whatever, any such species taken in  violation of applicable State fish and wildlife conservation laws or  regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> It is unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, solicit  another to commit, or cause to be committed, any offense defined in  paragraph (c) (1) through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Taking of these species for purposes other than those described  in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, including taking incidental to  carrying out otherwise lawful activities, is prohibited except when  permitted under Sec. Sec. 17.23 and 17.32.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Definition.

For the purposes of this paragraph (f): Bog turtle  of the southern population means any member of the species Clemmys  muhlenbergii, within Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee  and Virginia, regardless of whether in the wild or captivity, and also  applies to the progeny of any such turtle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Prohibitions. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this  section, the provisions of Sec. 17.31 (a) and (b) of this part applies  to bog turtles of the southern population (see also 50 CFR part 23).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Take. Incidental take, that is, take that results from, but is  not the purpose of, carrying out an otherwise lawful activity, does not  apply to bog turtles of the southern population.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Northern Mexican gartersnake (Thamnophis eques megalops)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Prohibitions. Except as noted in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, all  prohibitions and provisions of Sec. Sec. 17.31 and 17.32 apply to the  northern Mexican gartersnake.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exemptions from prohibitions.
