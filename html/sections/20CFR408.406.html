                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">When you give us evidence, we examine it to see if it is convincing  evidence. This means that unless we have information in our records that  raises a doubt about the evidence, other evidence of the same fact will  not be needed. If the evidence you give us is not convincing by itself,  we may ask you for additional evidence. In evaluating whether the  evidence you give us is convincing, we consider such things as whether:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The information contained in the evidence was given by a person  in a position to know the facts;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> There was any reason to give false information when the evidence  was created;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The information in the evidence was given under oath, or with  witnesses present, or with the knowledge that there was a penalty for  giving false information;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The evidence was created at the time the event took place or  shortly thereafter;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The evidence has been altered or has any erasures on it; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The information contained in the evidence agrees with other  available evidence including our records.</p><p class="depth2">Age</p>
