first 12-month period in which the actual VOC use  exceeds the applicable cutoff.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each owner or operator of an affected facility demonstrating  compliance by the methods described in Sec. 60.743(a)(1), (2), (4),  (b), or (c) shall maintain records and submit quarterly reports to the  Administrator documenting the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> or (ii) of this section, as applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For carbon adsorption systems with a common exhaust stack for  all the individual adsorber vessels, all periods of three consecutive  system rotations through the adsorption cycles of all the individual  adsorber vessels during which the average value of the concentration  level of organic compounds in the common outlet gas stream is more than  20 percent greater than the average value measured during the most  recent performance test that demonstrated compliance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For carbon adsorption systems with individual exhaust stacks  for each adsorber vessel, all 3-day rolling averages for each adsorber  vessel when the concentration level of organic compounds in the  individual

paragraphs (d)(1) through (6) of this  section because no reportable periods have occurred shall submit  semiannual statements clarifying this fact.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation,  demonstrating compliance by the test methods described in Sec.  60.743(a)(3) (liquid-liquid material balance) shall submit the  following:</p><p

preparation equipment, shall  submit the following with the reports required under paragraphs (d) and  (e) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All periods during actual mixing or coating operations when a  required monitoring device (if any) was malfunctioning or not operating;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All periods during actual mixing or coating operations when
