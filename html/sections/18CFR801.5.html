Consideration shall be given to the effect of the plan, or any part of the plan, on the receiving waters of the Chesapeake Bay.

for industrial, agricultural, residential, and recreational development in the basin.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The Commission will act diligently to promote Federal, State, local governmental, and private sector cooperation and coordination in the implementation of the adopted plan. It is expected that recommended development programs will be undertaken by the signatories, local governmental agencies, or private interests. If expeditious action by others is not forthcoming or is not possible the Commission will act in accordance with the Compact to implement programs, projects, and standards to the extent necessary to further the aims of the comprehensive plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The comprehensive plan shall provide for the immediate and long-range use, development, conservation, preservation, and management of the water resources of the basin.
