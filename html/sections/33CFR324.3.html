                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. DA permits are required for the transportation of  dredged material for the purpose of dumping it in ocean waters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Activities of Federal agencies. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The transportation of  dredged material for the purpose of disposal in ocean waters done by or  on behalf of any Federal agency other than the activities of the Corps  of Engineers is subject to the procedures of this regulation. Agreement  for construction or engineering services performed for other agencies by  the Corps of Engineers does not constitute authorization under these  regulations. Division and district engineers will therefore advise  Federal agencies accordingly and cooperate to the fullest extent in the  expeditious processing of their applications. The activities of the  Corps of Engineers that involve the transportation of dredged material  for disposal in ocean waters are regulated by 33 CFR 209.145.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The policy provisions set out in 33 CFR 320.4(j) relating to  state or local authorizations do not apply to work or structures  undertaken by Federal agencies, except where compliance with non-Federal  authorization is required by Federal law or Executive policy. Federal  agencies are responsible for conformance with such laws and policies.  (See EO 12088, October 18, 1978.) Federal agencies are not required to  obtain and provide certification of compliance with effluent limitations  and water quality standards from state or interstate water pollution  control agencies in connection with activities involving the transport  of dredged material for dumping into ocean waters beyond the territorial  sea.</p>
