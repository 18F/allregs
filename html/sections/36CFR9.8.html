The Regional Director shall not  approve a plan of operations requiring the use of water from such source  unless the right to the water has been perfected under applicable State  law, has a priority date prior to the establishment of the unit and  there has been a continued beneficial use of that water right.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If an operator whose operations will require the use of water  from a point of diversion within the boundaries of the unit can show  that he has a perfected State water right junior to the reserved water  right of the United States and can demonstrate that the exercise of that  State water right will not diminish the Federal right, which is that  amount of water necessary for the purposes for which the unit was  established, he will be authorized to use water from that source for  operations, if he has complied with all other provisions of these  regulations.</p>
