                            <p class="depth0">This subpart implements section 19(e)(1) of the Federal Deposit  Insurance Act (FDIA), which prohibits persons who have been convicted of  certain criminal offenses or who have agreed to enter into a pre-trial  diversion or similar program in connection with a prosecution for such  criminal offenses from occupying various positions with a savings and  loan holding company. This part also implements section 19(e)(2) of the  FDIA, which permits the Board to provide exemptions, by regulation or  order, from the application of the prohibition. This subpart provides an  exemption for savings and loan holding company employees whose  activities and responsibilities are limited solely to agriculture,  forestry, retail merchandising, manufacturing, or public utilities  operations, and a temporary exemption for certain persons who held  positions with respect to a savings and loan holding company as of  October 13, 2006. The subpart also describes procedures for applying to  the Board for an exemption.</p>
