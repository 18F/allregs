                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Responsibilities of the U.S. risk committee. (1) The U.S. risk committee established by a foreign banking organization pursuant to Sec.  252.155(a) (or a designated subcommittee of such committee composed of members of the board of directors (or equivalent thereof) of the U.S. intermediate holding company or the foreign banking organization, as appropriate) must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Approve at least annually the acceptable level of liquidity risk that the foreign banking organization may assume in connection with the operating strategies for its combined U.S. operations (liquidity risk tolerance), with concurrence from the foreign banking organization's board of directors or its enterprise-wide risk committee, taking into account the capital structure, risk profile, complexity, activities, size of the foreign banking organization and its combined U.S. operations and the enterprise-wide liquidity risk tolerance of the foreign banking organization; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Receive and review information provided by the senior management of the combined U.S. operations at least semi-annually to determine whether the combined U.S. operations are operating in accordance with the established liquidity risk tolerance and to ensure that the liquidity risk tolerance for the combined U.S. operations is consistent with the enterprise-wide liquidity risk tolerance established for the foreign banking organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Approve the contingency funding plan for the combined U.S. operations described in paragraph (e) of this section at least annually and whenever the foreign banking organization revises its contingency funding plan, and approve any material revisions to the contingency funding plan for the combined U.S. operations prior to the implementation of such revisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Responsibilities of the U.S. chief risk officer--(1) Liquidity risk. The U.S. chief risk officer of a foreign banking organization with combined U.S. assets of $50 billion or more must review the strategies and policies and procedures established by senior management of the U.S. operations for managing the risk that the financial condition or safety and soundness of the foreign banking organization's combined U.S. operations would be adversely affected by its inability or the market's perception of its inability to meet its cash and collateral obligations (liquidity risk).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Liquidity risk tolerance. The U.S. chief risk officer of a foreign banking organization with combined U.S. assets of $50 billion or more must review information provided by the senior management of the U.S. operations to determine whether the combined U.S. operations are operating in accordance with the established liquidity risk tolerance. The U.S. chief risk officer must regularly, and, at least semi-annually, report to the foreign banking organization's U.S. risk committee and enterprise-wide risk committee, or the equivalent thereof (if any) (or a designated subcommittee of such committee composed of members of the relevant board of directors (or equivalent thereof)) on the liquidity risk profile of the foreign banking organization's combined U.S. operations and whether it is operating in accordance with the established liquidity risk tolerance for the U.S. operations, and must establish procedures governing the content of such reports.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Business lines or products. (i) The U.S. chief risk officer of a foreign banking organization with combined U.S. assets of $50 billion or more must approve new products and business lines and evaluate the liquidity costs, benefits, and risks of each new business line and each new product offered, managed or sold through the foreign

banking organization's combined U.S. operations that could have a significant effect on the liquidity risk profile of the U.S. operations of the foreign banking organization. The approval is required before the foreign banking organization implements the business line or offers the product through its combined U.S. operations. In determining whether to approve the new business line or product, the U.S. chief risk officer must consider whether the liquidity risk of the new business line or product (under both current and stressed conditions) is within the foreign banking organization's established liquidity risk tolerance for its combined U.S. operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The U.S. risk committee must review at least annually significant business lines and products offered, managed or sold through the combined U.S. operations to determine whether each business line or product creates or has created any unanticipated liquidity risk, and to determine whether the liquidity risk of each strategy or product is within the foreign banking organization's established liquidity risk tolerance for its combined U.S. operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Cash-flow projections. The U.S. chief risk officer of a foreign banking organization with combined U.S. assets of $50 billion or more must review the cash-flow projections produced under paragraph (d) of this section at least quarterly (or more often, if changes in market conditions or the liquidity position, risk profile, or financial condition of the foreign banking organization or the U.S. operations warrant) to ensure that the liquidity risk of the foreign banking organization's combined U.S. operations is within the established liquidity risk tolerance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Liquidity risk limits. The U.S. chief risk officer of a foreign banking organization with combined U.S. assets of $50 billion or more must establish liquidity risk limits as set forth in paragraph (f) of this section and review the foreign banking organization's compliance with those limits at least quarterly (or more often, if changes in market conditions or the liquidity position, risk profile, or financial condition of the U.S. operations of the foreign banking organization warrant).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Liquidity stress testing. The U.S. chief risk officer of a foreign banking organization with combined U.S. assets of $50 billion or more must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Approve the liquidity stress testing practices, methodologies, and assumptions required in Sec.  252.157(a) at least quarterly, and whenever the foreign banking organization materially revises its liquidity stress testing practices, methodologies or assumptions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Review the liquidity stress testing results produced under Sec.  252.157(a) of this subpart at least quarterly; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Approve the size and composition of the liquidity buffer established under Sec.  252.157(c) of this subpart at least quarterly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Independent review function. (1) A foreign banking organization with combined U.S. assets of $50 billion or more must establish and maintain a review function that is independent of the management functions that execute funding for its combined U.S. operations to evaluate the liquidity risk management for its combined U.S. operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The independent review function must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Regularly, but no less frequently than annually, review and evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of the foreign banking organization's liquidity risk management processes within the combined U.S. operations, including its liquidity stress test processes and assumptions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Assess whether the foreign banking organization's liquidity risk management function of its combined U.S. operations complies with applicable laws, regulations, supervisory guidance, and sound business practices; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Report material liquidity risk management issues to the U.S. risk committee and the enterprise-wide risk committee in writing for corrective action, to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Cash-flow projections. (1) A foreign banking organization with combined U.S. assets of $50 billion or more must produce comprehensive cash-flow projections for its combined U.S. operations that project cash flows arising from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet exposures over, at a minimum, short- and long-term time horizons.

The foreign banking organization must update short-term cash-flow projections daily and must update longer-term cash-flow projections at least monthly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The foreign banking organization must establish a methodology for making cash-flow projections for its combined U.S. operations that results in projections which:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Include cash flows arising from contractual maturities, intercompany transactions, new business, funding renewals, customer options, and other potential events that may impact liquidity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Include reasonable assumptions regarding the future behavior of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet exposures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Identify and quantify discrete and cumulative cash-flow mismatches over these time periods; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Include sufficient detail to reflect the capital structure, risk profile, complexity, currency exposure, activities, and size of the foreign banking organization and its combined U.S. operations, and include analyses by business line, currency, or legal entity as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Contingency funding plan. (1) A foreign banking organization with combined U.S. assets of $50 billion or more must establish and maintain a contingency funding plan for its combined U.S. operations that sets out the foreign banking organization's strategies for addressing liquidity needs during liquidity stress events. The contingency funding plan must be commensurate with the capital structure, risk profile, complexity, activities, size, and the established liquidity risk tolerance for the combined U.S. operations. The foreign banking organization must update the contingency funding plan for its combined U.S. operations at least annually, and when changes to market and idiosyncratic conditions warrant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Components of the contingency funding plan--(i) Quantitative assessment. The contingency funding plan for the combined U.S. operations must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Identify liquidity stress events that could have a significant impact on the liquidity of the foreign banking organization and its combined U.S. operations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Assess the level and nature of the impact on the liquidity of the foreign banking organization and its combined U.S. operations that may occur during identified liquidity stress events;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Identify the circumstances in which the foreign banking organization would implement its action plan described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, which circumstances must include failure to meet any minimum liquidity requirement imposed by the Board on the foreign banking organization's U.S. operations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Assess available funding sources and needs during the identified liquidity stress events;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Identify alternative funding sources that may be used during the identified liquidity stress events; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Incorporate information generated by the liquidity stress testing required under Sec.  252.157(a) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Liquidity event management process. The contingency funding plan for the combined U.S. operations must include an event management process that sets out the foreign banking organization's procedures for managing liquidity during identified liquidity stress events for the combined U.S. operations. The liquidity event management process must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Include an action plan that clearly describes the strategies that the foreign banking organization will use to respond to liquidity shortfalls in its combined U.S. operations for identified liquidity stress events, including the methods that the company or the combined U.S. operations will use to access alternative funding sources;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Identify a liquidity stress event management team that would execute the action plan in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section for the combined U.S. operations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Specify the process, responsibilities, and triggers for invoking the contingency funding plan, describe the decision-making process during the identified liquidity stress events, and describe the process for executing contingency measures identified in the action plan; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Provide a mechanism that ensures effective reporting and communication within the combined U.S. operations of the foreign banking organization and with outside parties, including the Board and other relevant supervisors, counterparties, and other stakeholders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Monitoring. The contingency funding plan for the combined U.S. operations must include procedures for monitoring emerging liquidity stress events. The procedures must identify early warning indicators that are tailored to the capital structure, risk profile, complexity, activities, and size of the foreign banking organization and its combined U.S. operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Testing. A foreign banking organization must periodically test:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The components of the contingency funding plan to assess the plan's reliability during liquidity stress events;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The operational elements of the contingency funding plan, including operational simulations to test communications, coordination, and decision-making by relevant management; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The methods it will use to access alternative funding sources for its combined U.S. operations to determine whether these funding sources will be readily available when needed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Liquidity risk limits--(1) General. A foreign banking organization with combined U.S. assets of $50 billion or more must monitor sources of liquidity risk and establish limits on liquidity risk for the combined U.S. operations, including limits on:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Concentrations in sources of funding by instrument type, single counterparty, counterparty type, secured and unsecured funding, and if applicable, other forms of liquidity risk;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of liabilities that mature within various time horizons; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Off-balance sheet exposures and other exposures that could create funding needs during liquidity stress events.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Size of limits. Each limit established pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section must be consistent with the established liquidity risk tolerance for the combined U.S. operations and reflect the capital structure, risk profile, complexity, activities, and size of the combined U.S. operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Collateral, legal entity, and intraday liquidity risk monitoring. A foreign banking organization with combined U.S. assets of $50 billion or more must establish and maintain procedures for monitoring liquidity risk as set forth in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Collateral. The foreign banking organization must establish and maintain policies and procedures to monitor assets that have been or are available to be pledged as collateral in connection with transactions to which entities in its U.S. operations are counterparties. These policies and procedures must provide that the foreign banking organization:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Calculates all of the collateral positions for its combined U.S. operations on a weekly basis (or more frequently, as directed by the Board), specifying the value of pledged assets relative to the amount of security required under the relevant contracts and the value of unencumbered assets available to be pledged;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Monitors the levels of unencumbered assets available to be pledged by legal entity, jurisdiction, and currency exposure;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Monitors shifts in the foreign banking organization's funding patterns, including shifts between intraday, overnight, and term pledging of collateral; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Tracks operational and timing requirements associated with accessing collateral at its physical location (for example, the custodian or securities settlement system that holds the collateral).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Legal entities, currencies and business lines.
