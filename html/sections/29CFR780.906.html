                            <p class="depth0">Section 13(b)(16), in clause (A), provides an exemption from the  overtime pay provision of the Act for an employee during any workweek in  which all the following conditions are satisfied:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The employee must be engaged ``in the transportation and  preparation for transportation of fruits and vegetables''; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Such transportation must be transportation ``from the farm'';  and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The destination to which the fruits or vegetables are  transported must be ``a place of first processing or first marketing'';  and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The transportation must be from the farm to such destination  ``within the same State''.    Sec. 780.907  ``Fruits or vegetables.''</p><p class="depth2">The exempt operations of preparing for transportation and  transporting must be performed with respect to ``fruits or vegetables.''  The intent of section 13(b)(16) is to exempt such operations on fruits  or vegetables which are ``just-harvested'' and still in their raw and  natural state. As explained at the time of adoption of the amendment on  the floor of the House, the exemption was intended to eliminate the  difference in treatment of farmers and nonfarmers with respect to  exemption of such ``handling or hauling of fruit or vegetables in their  raw or natural state.'' (See 107 Cong. Rec. (daily ed.) p. 4523.)  Transporting and preparing for transportation other farm products which  are not fruits or vegetables are not exempt under section 13(b)(16). For  example, operations on livestock, eggs, tobacco, or poultry are  nonexempt. Sugarcane is not a fruit or vegetable for purposes of this  exemption (Wirtz v. Osceola Farms Co., 372 F. 2d 584).</p>
