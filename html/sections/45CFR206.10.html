Under this requirement, the applicant is informed of the agency's time standard in acting on applications which covers the time from date of application under the State plan to the date that the assistance check, or notification of denial of assistance or change of award is mailed to the applicant or recipient. The State's time standards apply except in unusual circumstances (e.g., where the agency cannot reach a decision because of failure or delay on the part of the applicant or an examining physician, or because of some administrative or other emergency that could not be controlled by the agency), in which instances the case record shows the cause for the delay. The agency's standards of promptness for acting on applications or redetermining eligibility shall not be used as a waiting period before granting aid, or as a basis for denial of an application or for terminating assistance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Adequate notice shall be sent to applicants and recipients to indicate that assistance has been authorized (including the amount of financial assistance) or that it has been denied or terminated.

The State plan may provide for using a standard 30-day month to determine the prorated amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> In cases of proposed action to terminate, discontinue, suspend or reduce assistance, the agency shall give timely and adequate notice. Such notice shall comply with the provisions of Sec. 205.10 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Each decision regarding eligibility or ineligibility will be supported by facts in the applicant's or recipient's case record. Under this requirement each application is disposed of by a finding of eligibility or ineligibility unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The applicant voluntarily withdraws his application, and there is an entry in the case record that a notice has been sent to confirm the applicant's notification to the agency that he does not desire to pursue his application; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> There is an entry in the case record that the application has been disposed of because the applicant died or could not be located.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Where an individual has been determined to be eligible, eligibility will be reconsidered or redetermined:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When required on the basis of information the agency has obtained previously about anticipated changes in the individual's situation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Promptly, after a report is obtained which indicates changes in the individual's circumstances that may affect the amount of assistance to which he is entitled or may make him ineligible; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Periodically, within agency established time standards, but not less frequently than every 12 months in OAA, AB, APTD, and AABD, on eligibility factors subject to change. For recipients of AFDC, all factors of eligibility will be redetermined at least every 6 months except in the case of monthly reporting cases or cases covered by an approved error-prone profiling system as specified in paragraph (a)(9)(iv) of this section. Under the AFDC program, at least one face-to-face redetermination must be conducted in each case once in every 12 months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In accordance with paragraph (a)(9)(iii) of this section, under an alternative redetermination plan based on error-prone profiling, which has been approved by the Secretary, and includes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A description of the statistical methodology used to develop the error-prone profile system upon which the redetermination schedule is based;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The criteria to be used to vary the scope of review and to assign different types of cases; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A detailed outline of the evaluation system, including provisions for necessary changes in the error-prone

output, such as types of cases, types of errors, frequencies of redeterminations and corrective action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Standards and methods for determination of eligibility shall be consistent with the objectives of the programs, and will respect the rights of individuals under the United States Constitution, the Social Security Act, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and all other relevant provisions of Federal and State laws.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> The State agency shall establish and maintain methods by which it shall be kept currently informed about local agencies' adherence to the State plan provisions and to the State agency's procedural requirements for determining eligibility, and it shall take corrective action when necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Applicant is a person who has, directly, or through his authorized representative, or where incompetent or incapacitated, through someone acting responsibly for him, made application for public assistance from the agency administering the program, and whose application has not been terminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Application is the action by which an individual indicates in writing to the agency administering public assistance (on a form prescribed by the State agency) his desire to receive assistance. The relative with whom a child is living or will live ordinarily makes application for the child for AFDC. An application is distinguished from an inquiry, which is simply a request for information about eligibility requirements for public assistance. Such inquiry may be followed by an application. When an individual is required to be included in an existing assistance unit pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(vii), such individual will be considered to be included in the application, as of the date he is required to be included in the assistance unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Date of Application is the date on which the action described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Redetermination is a review of factors affecting AFDC eligibility and payment amount; e.g. continued absence, income (including child and spousal support), etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Assistance Unit is the group of individuals whose income, resources and needs are considered as a unit for purposes of determining eligibility and the amount of payment.
