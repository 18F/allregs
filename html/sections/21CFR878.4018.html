                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. A hydrophilic wound dressing is a sterile or  non-sterile device intended to cover a wound and to absorb exudate. It  consists of nonresorbable materials with hydrophilic properties that are  capable of absorbing exudate (e.g., cotton, cotton derivatives,  alginates, dextran, and rayon). This classification does not include a  hydrophilic wound dressing that contains added drugs such as  antimicrobial agents, added biologics such as growth factors, or is  composed of materials derived from animal sources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class I (general controls). The device is exempt  from the premarket notification procedures in part 807, subpart E of  this chapter subject to the limitations in Sec. 878.9.
