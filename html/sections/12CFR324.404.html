                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Schedule for filing plan--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. An FDIC-supervised  institution shall file a written capital restoration plan with the  appropriate FDIC regional director within 45 days of the date that the  FDIC-supervised institution receives notice or is deemed to have notice  that the FDIC-supervised institution is undercapitalized, significantly  undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized, unless the FDIC  notifies the FDIC-supervised institution in writing that the plan is to  be filed within a different period. An adequately capitalized FDIC- supervised institution that has been required pursuant to  Sec. 324.403(d) to comply with supervisory actions as if the FDIC- supervised institution were undercapitalized is not required to submit a  capital restoration plan solely by virtue of the reclassification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Additional capital restoration plans. Notwithstanding paragraph  (a)(1) of this section, an FDIC-supervised institution that has already  submitted and is operating under a capital restoration plan approved  under section 38 and this subpart H is not required to submit an  additional capital restoration plan based on a revised calculation of  its capital measures or a reclassification of the institution under  Sec. 324.403 unless the FDIC notifies the FDIC-supervised institution  that it must submit a new or revised capital plan. An FDIC-supervised  institution that is notified that it must submit a new or revised  capital restoration plan shall file the plan in writing with the  appropriate FDIC regional director within 45 days of receiving such  notice, unless the FDIC notifies it in writing that the plan must be  filed within a different period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contents of plan. All financial data submitted in connection  with a capital restoration plan shall be prepared in accordance with the  instructions provided on the Call Report, unless the FDIC instructs  otherwise. The capital restoration plan shall include all of the  information required to be filed under section 38(e)(2) of the FDI Act.  An FDIC-supervised institution that is required to submit a capital  restoration plan as a result of its reclassification pursuant to  Sec. 324.403(d) shall include a description of the steps the FDIC- supervised institution will take to correct the unsafe or unsound  condition or practice. No plan shall be accepted unless it includes any  performance guarantee described in section 38(e)(2)(C) of the FDI Act by  each company that controls the FDIC-supervised institution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Review of capital restoration plans. Within 60 days after  receiving a capital restoration plan under this subpart, the FDIC shall  provide written notice to the FDIC-supervised institution of whether the  plan has been approved. The FDIC may extend the time within which notice  regarding approval of a plan shall be provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Disapproval of capital plan. If a capital restoration plan is  not approved by the FDIC, the FDIC-supervised institution shall submit a  revised capital restoration plan within the time specified by the FDIC.  Upon receiving notice that its capital restoration plan has not been  approved, any undercapitalized FDIC-supervised institution (as defined  in Sec. 324.403(b)) shall be subject to all of the provisions of section  38 of the FDI Act and this subpart H applicable to significantly  undercapitalized institutions. These provisions shall be applicable  until such time as a new or revised capital restoration plan submitted  by the FDIC-supervised institution has been approved by the FDIC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Failure to submit capital restoration plan. An FDIC-supervised  institution that is undercapitalized (as defined in Sec. 324.403(b)) and  that fails to submit a written capital restoration plan within the  period provided in this section shall, upon the expiration of that  period, be subject to all of the provisions of section 38 and this  subpart applicable to significantly undercapitalized institutions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Failure to implement capital restoration plan. Any  undercapitalized FDIC-supervised institution that fails in any material  respect to implement a capital restoration plan shall be subject to all  of the provisions of section 38 of the FDI Act and this subpart H  applicable to significantly undercapitalized institutions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Amendment of capital restoration plan. An FDIC-supervised  institution that has filed an approved capital restoration plan may,  after prior written notice to and approval by the FDIC, amend the plan  to reflect a change in circumstance. Until such time as a proposed  amendment has been approved, the FDIC-supervised institution shall  implement the capital restoration plan as approved prior to the proposed  amendment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Performance guarantee by companies that control an FDIC- supervised institution--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Limitation on liability--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Amount  limitation. The aggregate liability under the guarantee provided under  section 38 and this subpart H for all companies that control a specific  FDIC-supervised institution that is required to submit a capital  restoration plan under this subpart H shall be limited to the lesser of:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> An amount equal to 5.0 percent of the FDIC-supervised  institution's total assets at the time the FDIC-supervised institution  was notified or deemed to have notice that the FDIC-supervised  institution was undercapitalized; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The amount necessary to restore the relevant capital measures of  the FDIC-supervised institution to the levels required for the FDIC- supervised institution to be classified as adequately capitalized, as  those capital measures and levels are defined at the time that the FDIC- supervised institution initially fails to comply with a capital  restoration plan under this subpart H.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Limit on duration. The guarantee and limit of liability under  section 38 of the FDI Act and this subpart H shall expire after the FDIC  notifies the FDIC-supervised institution that it has remained adequately  capitalized for each of four consecutive calendar quarters. The  expiration or fulfillment by a company of a guarantee of a capital   restoration plan shall not limit the liability of the company under any  guarantee required or provided in connection with any capital  restoration plan filed by the same FDIC-supervised institution after  expiration of the first guarantee.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Collection on guarantee. Each company that controls a given  FDIC-supervised institution shall be jointly and severally liable for  the guarantee for such FDIC-supervised institution as required under  section 38 and this subpart H, and the FDIC may require and collect  payment of the full amount of that guarantee from any or all of the  companies issuing the guarantee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of the FDI Act, the FDIC-supervised institution  shall, upon submission of the plan, be subject to the provisions of  section 38 and this subpart H that are applicable to FDIC-supervised  institutions that have not submitted an acceptable capital restoration  plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Failure to perform guarantee. Failure by any company that  controls an FDIC-supervised institution to perform fully its guarantee  of any capital plan shall constitute a material failure to implement the  plan for purposes of section 38(f) of the FDI Act. Upon such failure,  the FDIC-supervised institution shall be subject to the provisions of  section 38 and this subpart H that are applicable to FDIC-supervised  institutions that have failed in a material respect to implement a  capital restoration plan.</p>
