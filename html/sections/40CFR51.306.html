                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> For the purposes of addressing reasonably attributable visibility impairment, each plan must include a long-term (10-15 years) strategy for making reasonable progress toward the national goal specified in Sec. 51.300(a). This strategy must cover any existing impairment the Federal Land Manager certifies to the State at least 6 months prior to plan submission, and any integral vista of which the Federal Land Manager notifies the State at least 6 months prior to plan submission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For the purposes of addressing reasonably attributable visibility impairment, each plan must include a long-term (10-15 years) strategy for making reasonable progress toward the national goal specified in Sec. 51.300(a). This strategy must cover any existing impairment the Federal Land Manager certifies to the State at least 6 months prior to plan submission, and any integral vista of which the Federal Land Manager notifies the State at least 6 months prior to plan submission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A long-term strategy must be developed for each mandatory Class I Federal area located within the State and each mandatory Class I Federal area located outside the State which may be affected by sources within the State. This does not preclude the development of a single comprehensive plan for all such areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The plan must set forth with reasonable specificity why the long-term strategy is adequate for making reasonable progress toward the national visibility goal, including remedying existing and preventing future impairment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The State must coordinate its long-term strategy for an area with existing plans and goals, including those provided by the affected Federal Land Managers, that may affect impairment of visibility in any mandatory Class I Federal area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The plan must provide for periodic review and revision, as appropriate, of the long-term strategy for addressing reasonably attributable visibility impairment. The plan must provide for such periodic review and revision not less frequently than every 3 years until the date of submission of the State's first plan addressing regional haze visibility impairment in accordance with Sec. 51.308(b) and (c). On or before this date, the State must revise its plan to provide for review and revision of a coordinated long-term strategy for addressing reasonably attributable and regional haze visibility impairment, and the State must submit the first such coordinated long-term strategy. Future coordinated long-term strategies must be submitted consistent with the schedule for periodic progress reports set forth in Sec. 51.308(g). Until the State revises its plan to meet this requirement, the State must continue to comply with existing requirements for plan review and revision, and with all emission management requirements in the plan to address reasonably attributable impairment. This requirement does not affect any preexisting deadlines for State submittal of a long-term strategy review (or element thereof) between August 30, 1999, and the date required for submission of the State's first regional haze plan. In addition, the plan must provide for review of the long-term strategy as it applies to reasonably attributable impairment, and revision as appropriate, within 3 years of State receipt of any certification of reasonably attributable impairment from a Federal Land Manager. The review process must include consultation with the appropriate Federal Land Managers, and the State must provide a report to the public and the Administrator on progress toward the national goal. This report must include an assessment of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The progress achieved in remedying existing impairment of visibility in any mandatory Class I Federal area;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The ability of the long-term strategy to prevent future impairment of visibility in any mandatory Class I Federal area;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any change in visibility since the last such report, or, in the case of the first report, since plan approval;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Additional measures, including the need for SIP revisions, that may be necessary to assure reasonable progress toward the national visibility goal;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The progress achieved in implementing BART and meeting other schedules set forth in the long-term strategy;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The impact of any exemption granted under Sec. 51.303;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The need for BART to remedy existing visibility impairment of any integral vista listed in the plan since the last such report, or, in the case of the first report, since plan approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The long-term strategy must provide for review of the impacts from any new major stationary source or major modifications on visibility in any mandatory Class I Federal area. This review of major stationary sources or major modifications must be in accordance with Sec. 51.307, Sec. 51.166, Sec. 51.160, and any other binding guidance provided by the Agency insofar as these provisions pertain to protection of visibility in any mandatory Class I Federal areas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The State must consider, at a minimum, the following factors during the development of its long-term strategy:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Emission reductions due to ongoing air pollution control programs,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Additional emission limitations and schedules for compliance,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Measures to mitigate the impacts of construction activities,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Source retirement and replacement schedules,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Smoke management techniques for agricultural and forestry management purposes including such plans as currently exist within the State for these purposes, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Enforceability of emission limitations and control measures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The plan must discuss the reasons why the above and other reasonable measures considered in the development of the long-term strategy were or were not adopted as part of the long-term strategy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The State, in developing the long-term strategy, must take into account the effect of new sources, and the costs of compliance, the time necessary for compliance, the energy and nonair quality environmental impacts of compliance, and the remaining useful life of any affected existing source and equipment therein.
