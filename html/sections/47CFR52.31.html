A licensee may have more than one  CMRS system, but only the systems that satisfy the definition of covered  CMRS are required to provide number portability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any procedure to identify and request switches for development  of number portability must comply with the following criteria:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any wireline carrier that is certified (or has applied for  certification) to provide local exchange service in a state, or any  licensed CMRS provider, must be permitted to make a request for  deployment of number portability in that state;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Carries requesting deployment in the 100 largest MSAs by  November 24, 2003 must submit requests by February 24, 2003.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A covered CMRS provider must make available upon request to  any interested parties a list of its switches for which number  portability has been requested and a list of its switches for which  number portability has not been requested;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> After November 24, 2003, a covered CMRS provider must deploy  number portability in additional switches serving the 100 largest MSAs  upon request within the following time frames:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For remote switches supported by a host switch equipped for  portability (``Equipped Remote Switches''), within 30 days;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For switches that require software but not hardware changes to  provide portability (``Hardware Capable Switches''), within 60 days;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> For switches that require hardware changes to provide  portability (``Capable Switches Requiring Hardware''), within 180 days;  and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> For switches not capable of portability that must be replaced  (``Non-Capable Switches''), within 180 days.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Carriers must be able to request deployment in any wireless  switch that serves any area within the MSA, even if the wireless switch  is outside that MSA, or outside any of the MSAs identified in the  Appendix to this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> By November 24, 2002, all covered CMRS providers must be able to  support roaming nationwide.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> By December 31, 1998, all covered CMRS providers must have the  capability to obtain routing information, either by querying the  appropriate database themselves or by making arrangements with other  carriers that are capable of performing database queries, so that they  can deliver calls from their networks to any party that has retained its  number after switching from one telecommunications carrier to another.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In the event a carrier subject to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this  section is unable to meet the Commission's deadlines for implementing a  long-term number portability method, it may file with the Commission at  least 60 days in advance of the deadline a petition to extend the time  by which implementation in its network will be completed. A carrier  seeking such relief must demonstrate through substantial, credible  evidence the basis for its contention that it is unable to comply with  paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. Such requests must set forth:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The facts that demonstrate why the carrier is unable to meet our  deployment schedule;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A detailed explanation of the activities that the carrier has  undertaken to meet the implementation schedule prior to requesting an  extension of time;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An identification of the particular switches for which the  extension is requested;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The time within which the carrier will complete deployment in  the affected switches; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A proposed schedule with milestones for meeting the deployment  date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Chief, Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, may establish  reporting requirements in order to monitor the progress of covered CMRS  providers implementing number portability, and may direct such carriers  to take any actions necessary to ensure compliance with this deployment  schedule.
