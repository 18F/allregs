                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Persons who may apply. (1) Only one person who is either the next-of-kin or another representative of the decedent shall be permitted to apply for posthumous citizenship on the decedent's behalf. A person who is a next-of-kin who wishes to apply for posthumous citizenship on behalf of the decedent, shall, if there is a surviving next-of-kin in the line of succession above him or her, be required to obtain authorization to make the application from all surviving next-of-kin in the line of succession above him or her. The authorization shall be in the form of an affidavit stating that the affiant authorizes the requester to apply for posthumous citizenship on behalf of the decedent. The affidavit must include the name and address of the affiant, and the relationship of the affiant to the decedent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Only one person who is either the next-of-kin or another representative of the decedent shall be permitted to apply for posthumous citizenship on the decedent's behalf. A person who is a next-of-kin who wishes to apply for posthumous citizenship on behalf of the decedent, shall, if there is a surviving next-of-kin in the line of succession above him or her, be required to obtain authorization to make the application from all surviving next-of-kin in the line of succession above him or her.

The affidavit must include the name and address of the affiant, and the relationship of the affiant to the decedent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When there is a surviving next-of-kin, an application for posthumous citizenship shall only be accepted from a representative provided authorization has been obtained from all surviving next-of-kin. However, this requirement shall not apply to the executor or administrator of the decedent's estate. In the case of a service organization acting as a representative, authorization must also have been obtained from any appointed representative. A veterans service organization must submit evidence of recognition by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Once USCIS has granted posthumous citizenship to a person, no subsequent applications on his or her behalf shall be approved, nor shall any additional original certificates be issued, except in the case of an application for issuance of a replacement certificate for one lost, mutiliated, or destroyed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application. An application for posthumous citizenship must be submitted on the form designated by USCIS in accordance with the form instructions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Application period. An application for posthumous citizenship must be filed no later than two years after the date of the decedent's death.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Denial of application. When the application is denied, the applicant shall be notified of the decision and the reason(s) for denial. There is no appeal from the denial of an application under this part.
