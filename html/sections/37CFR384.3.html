                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Basic royalty rate. For the making of any number of Ephemeral Recordings in the operation of a Business Establishment Service, a Licensee shall pay 12.5% of such Licensee's ``Gross Proceeds'' derived from the use in such service of musical programs that are attributable to copyrighted recordings. ``Gross Proceeds'' as used in this section means all fees and payments, including those made in kind, received from any source before, during or after the License Period that are derived from the use of copyrighted sound recordings during the License Period pursuant to 17 U.S.C. 112(e) for the sole purpose of facilitating a transmission to the public of a performance of a sound recording under the limitation on exclusive rights specified in 17 U.S.C. 114(d)(1)(C)(iv). The attribution of Gross Proceeds to copyrighted recordings may be made on the basis of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For classical programs, the proportion that the playing time of copyrighted classical recordings bears to the total playing time of all classical recordings in the program, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For all other programs, the proportion that the number of copyrighted recordings bears to the total number of all recordings in the program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Minimum fee. Each Licensee shall pay a minimum fee of $10,000 for each calendar year of the License Period in which it makes Ephemeral Recordings for use to facilitate transmissions under the limitation on exclusive rights specified by 17 U.S.C. 114(d)(1)(C)(iv), whether or not it does so for all or any part of the year. These minimum fees shall be nonrefundable, but shall be fully creditable to royalty payments due under paragraph (a) of this section for the same calendar year (but not any subsequent calendar year).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other royalty rates and terms. This part 384 does not apply to persons or entities other than Licensees, or to Licensees to the extent that they make other types of ephemeral recordings beyond those set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. For ephemeral recordings other than those governed by paragraph (a) of this section, persons making such ephemeral recordings must pay royalties, to the extent (if at all) applicable, under 17 U.S.C. 112(e) or as prescribed by other law, regulation or agreement.
