Sec. 1.468A-1  Nuclear decommissioning costs; general rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. Section 468A provides an elective method for taking into account nuclear decommissioning costs for Federal income tax purposes. In general, an eligible taxpayer that elects the application of section 468A pursuant to the rules contained in Sec. 1.468A-7 is allowed a deduction (as determined under Sec. 1.468A-2) for the taxable year in which the taxpayer makes a cash payment to a nuclear decommissioning fund. Taxpayers using an accrual method of accounting that do not elect the application of section 468A are not allowed a deduction for nuclear decommissioning costs prior to the taxable year in which economic performance occurs with respect to such costs (see section 461(h)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. The following terms are defined for purposes of section 468A and Secs. 1.468A-1 through 1.468A-9:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The term eligible taxpayer means any taxpayer that possesses a qualifying interest in a nuclear power plant (including a nuclear power plant that is under construction).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The term qualifying interest means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A direct ownership interest; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A leasehold interest in any portion of a nuclear power plant if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The holder of the leasehold interest is primarily liable under Federal or State law for decommissioning such portion of the nuclear power plant; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> No other person establishes a nuclear decommissioning fund with respect to such portion of the nuclear power plant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The term direct ownership interest includes an interest held as a tenant in

common or joint tenant, but does not include stock in a corporation that owns a nuclear power plant or an interest in a partnership that owns a nuclear power plant. Thus, in the case of a partnership that owns a nuclear power plant, the election under section 468A must be made by the partnership and not by the partners. In the case of an unincorporated organization described in Sec. 1.761-2(a)(3) that elects under section 761(a) to be excluded from the application of subchapter K, each taxpayer that is a co-owner of the nuclear power plant is eligible to make a separate election under section 468A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The terms nuclear decommissioning fund and qualified nuclear decommissioning fund mean a fund that satisfies the requirements of Sec. 1.468A-5. The term nonqualified fund means a fund that does not satisfy those requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The term nuclear power plant means any nuclear power reactor that is used predominantly in the trade or business of the furnishing or sale of electric energy. Each unit (that is, nuclear reactor) located on a multi-unit site is a separate nuclear power plant. The term nuclear power plant also includes the portion of the common facilities of a multi-unit site allocable to a unit on that site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The term nuclear decommissioning costs or decommissioning costs includes all otherwise deductible expenses to be incurred in connection with the entombment, decontamination, dismantlement, removal and disposal of the structures, systems and components of a nuclear power plant, whether that nuclear power plant will continue to produce electric energy or has permanently ceased to produce electric energy. Such term includes all otherwise deductible expenses to be incurred in connection with the preparation for decommissioning, such as engineering and other planning expenses, and all otherwise deductible expenses to be incurred with respect to the plant after the actual decommissioning occurs, such as physical security and radiation monitoring expenses. Such term also includes costs incurred in connection with the construction, operation, and ultimate decommissioning of a facility used solely to store, pending acceptance by the government for permanent storage or disposal, spent nuclear fuel generated by the nuclear power plant or plants located on the same site as the storage facility. Such term does not include otherwise deductible expenses to be incurred in connection with the disposal of spent nuclear fuel under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-425). An expense is otherwise deductible for purposes of this paragraph (b)(6) if it would be deductible under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code without regard to section 280B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The term public utility commission means any State or political subdivision thereof, any agency, instrumentality or judicial body of the United States, or any judicial body, commission or other similar body of the District of Columbia or of any State or any political subdivision thereof that establishes or approves rates for the furnishing or sale of electric energy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The term ratemaking proceeding means any proceeding before a public utility commission in which rates for the furnishing or sale of electric energy are established or approved. Such term includes a generic proceeding that applies to two or more taxpayers that are subject to the jurisdiction of a single public utility commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The term special transfer means any transfer of funds to a qualified nuclear decommissioning fund pursuant to Sec. 1.468A-8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Special rules applicable to certain experimental nuclear facilities. (1) The owner of a qualifying interest in an experimental nuclear facility possesses a qualifying interest in a nuclear power plant for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section if such person is engaged in the trade or business of the furnishing or sale of electric energy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The owner of a qualifying interest in an experimental nuclear facility possesses a qualifying interest in a nuclear power plant for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section if such person is engaged in the trade or business of the furnishing or sale of electric energy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An owner of stock in a corporation that owns an experimental nuclear facility possesses a qualifying interest in a nuclear power plant for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Such stockholder satisfies the conditions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The corporation that directly owns the facility is not engaged in the trade or business of the furnishing or sale of electric energy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (c), an experimental nuclear facility is a nuclear power reactor that is used predominantly for the purpose of conducting experimentation and research.

Sec. 1.468A-2  Treatment of electing taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. An eligible taxpayer that elects the application of section 468A pursuant to the rules contained in Sec. 1.468A-7 (an electing taxpayer) is allowed a deduction for the taxable year in which the taxpayer makes a cash payment (or is deemed to make a cash payment as provided in paragraph (c) of this section) to a nuclear decommissioning fund and for any taxable year in which a deduction is allowed for a special transfer described in Sec. 1.468A-8. The amount of the deduction for any taxable year equals the total amount of cash payments made (or deemed made) by the electing taxpayer to a nuclear decommissioning fund (or nuclear decommissioning funds) during such taxable year under this section, plus any amount allowable as a deduction in that taxable year for a special transfer described in Sec. 1.468A-8. The amount of a special transfer permitted under Sec. 1.468A-8 is not treated as a cash payment for purposes of this paragraph (a), and a taxpayer making a special transfer is allowed a ratable deduction in each taxable year during the remaining useful life of the nuclear power plant for the special transfer. A payment may not be made (or deemed made) to a nuclear decommissioning fund before the first taxable year in which all of the following conditions are satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The construction of the nuclear power plant to which the nuclear decommissioning fund relates has commenced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A ruling amount is applicable to the nuclear decommissioning fund (see Sec. 1.468A-3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Limitation on payments to a nuclear decommissioning fund--(1) In general. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the maximum amount of cash payments made (or deemed made) to a nuclear decommissioning fund under paragraph (a) of this section during any taxable year shall not exceed the ruling amount applicable to the nuclear decommissioning fund for such taxable year (as determined under Sec. 1.468A-3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the maximum amount of cash payments made (or deemed made) to a nuclear decommissioning fund under paragraph (a) of this section during any taxable year shall not exceed the ruling amount applicable to the nuclear decommissioning fund for such taxable year (as determined under Sec. 1.468A-3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Excess contributions not deductible. If the amount of cash payments made (or deemed made) to a nuclear decommissioning fund during any taxable year exceeds the limitation of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the excess is not deductible by the electing taxpayer. In addition, see paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.468A-5 for rules which provide that the Internal Revenue Service may disqualify a nuclear decommissioning fund if the amount of cash payments made (or deemed made) to a nuclear decommissioning fund during any taxable year exceeds the limitation of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special transfer disregarded. The amount of a special transfer permitted under Sec. 1.468A-8 is not treated as a cash payment for purposes of this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Deemed payment rules--(1) In general. The amount of any cash payment made by an electing taxpayer to a nuclear decommissioning fund on or before the 15th day of the third calendar month after the close of any taxable year (the deemed payment deadline date) shall be deemed made during such taxable year if the electing taxpayer irrevocably designates the amount as relating to such taxable year on its timely filed Federal income tax return for such taxable year (see Sec. 1.468A-7(b)(4)(iii) and (iv) for rules relating to such designation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The amount of any cash payment made by an electing taxpayer to a nuclear decommissioning fund on or before the 15th day of the third calendar month after the close of any taxable year (the deemed payment deadline date) shall be deemed made during such taxable year if the electing taxpayer irrevocably designates the amount as relating to such taxable year on its timely filed Federal income tax return for such taxable year (see Sec. 1.468A-7(b)(4)(iii) and (iv) for rules relating to such designation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cash payment by customer. The amount of any cash payment made by a customer of an electing taxpayer to a nuclear decommissioning fund of such electing taxpayer shall be deemed made by the electing taxpayer if the amount is included in the gross income of the electing taxpayer in the manner prescribed by section 88 and Sec. 1.88-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Treatment of distributions--(1) In general. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the amount of any actual or deemed distribution from a nuclear decommissioning fund shall be included in the gross income of the electing taxpayer for the taxable year in which the distribution occurs. The amount of any distribution of property equals the fair market value of the property on the

date of the distribution. See Sec. 1.468A-5(c) and (d) for rules relating to the deemed distribution of the assets of a nuclear decommissioning fund in the case of a disqualification or termination of the fund. A distribution from a nuclear decommissioning fund shall include an expenditure from the fund or the use of the fund's assets--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the amount of any actual or deemed distribution from a nuclear decommissioning fund shall be included in the gross income of the electing taxpayer for the taxable year in which the distribution occurs. The amount of any distribution of property equals the fair market value of the property on the

date of the distribution. See Sec. 1.468A-5(c) and (d) for rules relating to the deemed distribution of the assets of a nuclear decommissioning fund in the case of a disqualification or termination of the fund. A distribution from a nuclear decommissioning fund shall include an expenditure from the fund or the use of the fund's assets--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To satisfy, in whole or in part, the liability of the electing taxpayer for decommissioning costs of the nuclear power plant to which the fund relates; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To pay administrative costs and other incidental expenses of the fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions to inclusion in gross income--(i) Payment of administrative costs and incidental expenses. The amount of any payment by a nuclear decommissioning fund for administrative costs or other incidental expenses of such fund (as defined in Sec. 1.468A-5(a)(3)(ii)) shall not be included in the gross income of the electing taxpayer unless such amount is paid to the electing taxpayer (in which case the amount of the payment is included in the gross income of the electing taxpayer under section 61).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Payment of administrative costs and incidental expenses. The amount of any payment by a nuclear decommissioning fund for administrative costs or other incidental expenses of such fund (as defined in Sec. 1.468A-5(a)(3)(ii)) shall not be included in the gross income of the electing taxpayer unless such amount is paid to the electing taxpayer (in which case the amount of the payment is included in the gross income of the electing taxpayer under section 61).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Withdrawals of excess contributions. The amount of a withdrawal of an excess contribution (as defined in Sec. 1.468A-5(c)(2)(ii)) by an electing taxpayer pursuant to the rules of Sec. 1.468A-5(c)(2) shall not be included in the gross income of the electing taxpayer. See paragraph (b)(2) of this section, which provides that the payment of such amount to the nuclear decommissioning fund is not deductible by the electing taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Actual distributions of amounts included in gross income as deemed distributions. If the amount of a deemed distribution is included in the gross income of the electing taxpayer for the taxable year in which the deemed distribution occurs, no further amount is required to be included in gross income when the amount of the deemed distribution is actually distributed by the nuclear decommissioning fund. The amount of a deemed distribution is actually distributed by a nuclear decommissioning fund as the first actual distributions are made by the nuclear decommissioning fund on or after the date of the deemed distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Deduction when economic performance occurs. An electing taxpayer using an accrual method of accounting is allowed a deduction for nuclear decommissioning costs no earlier than the taxable year in which economic performance occurs with respect to such costs (see section 461(h)(2)). The amount of nuclear decommissioning costs that is deductible under this paragraph (e) is determined without regard to section 280B (see Sec. 1.468A-1(b)(6)). A deduction is allowed under this paragraph (e) whether or not a deduction was allowed with respect to such costs under section 468A(a) and paragraph (a) of this section for an earlier taxable year.

(1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g) of this section or in Sec. 1.468A-8 (relating to deductions for special transfers into a nuclear decommissioning fund), an electing taxpayer is allowed a deduction under section 468A(a) for the taxable year in which the taxpayer makes a cash payment (or is deemed to make a cash payment) to a nuclear decommissioning fund only if the taxpayer has received a schedule of ruling amounts for the nuclear decommissioning fund that includes a ruling amount for such taxable year. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) or (5) of this section, a schedule of ruling amounts for a nuclear decommissioning fund (schedule of ruling amounts) is a ruling (within the meaning of Sec. 601.201(a)(2) of this chapter) specifying the annual payments (ruling amounts) that, over the taxable years remaining in the funding period as of the date the schedule first applies, will result in a projected balance of the nuclear decommissioning fund as of the last day of the funding period equal to (and in no event greater than) the amount of decommissioning costs allocable to the fund. The projected balance of a nuclear decommissioning fund as of the last day of the funding period shall be calculated by taking into account the fair market value of the assets of the fund as of the first day of the first taxable year to which the schedule of ruling amounts

applies and the estimated rate of return to be earned by the assets of the fund after payment of the estimated administrative costs and incidental expenses to be incurred by the fund (as defined in Sec. 1.468A-5(a)(3)(ii)), including all Federal, State and local income taxes to be incurred by the fund (the after-tax rate of return).

If a public utility commission established or approved the currently applicable rates for the furnishing or sale by the taxpayer of electricity from the plant, the taxpayer can generally satisfy this burden of proof by demonstrating that the schedule of ruling amounts is calculated using the assumptions used by the public utility commission in its most recent order. In addition, a taxpayer that owns an interest in a deregulated nuclear plant may submit assumptions used by a public utility commission that formerly had regulatory jurisdiction over the plant as support for the assumptions used in calculating the taxpayer's proposed schedule of ruling amounts, with the understanding that the assumptions used by the public utility commission may be given less weight if they are out of date or were developed in a proceeding for a different taxpayer. The use of other industry standards, such as the assumptions underlying the taxpayer's most recent financial assurance filing with the NRC, are an alternative means of demonstrating that the taxpayer has calculated its proposed schedule of ruling amounts on a reasonable basis. Consistency with financial accounting statements is not sufficient, in the absence of other supporting evidence, to meet the taxpayer's burden of proof under this paragraph (a)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The IRS will approve, at the request of the taxpayer, a formula or method for determining a schedule of ruling amounts (rather than providing a schedule specifying a dollar amount for each taxable year) if the formula or method is consistent with the principles and provisions of this section and is based on reasonable assumptions.

Sec. 1.468A-4  Treatment of nuclear decommissioning fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. A nuclear decommissioning fund is subject to tax on all of its modified gross income (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section). The rate of tax is 20 percent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1995. This tax is in lieu of any other tax that may be imposed under subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) on the income earned by the assets of the nuclear decommissioning fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Modified gross income. For purposes of this section, the term modified gross income means gross income as defined under section 61 computed with the following modifications:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The amount of any payment or special transfer to the nuclear decommissioning fund with respect to which a deduction is allowed under section 468A(a) or section 468A(f) is excluded from gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A deduction is allowed for the amount of administrative costs and other incidental expenses of the nuclear decommissioning fund (including taxes, legal expenses, accounting expenses, actuarial expenses and trustee expenses, but not including decommissioning costs) that are otherwise deductible and that are paid by the nuclear decommissioning fund to any person other than the electing taxpayer. An expense is otherwise deductible for purposes of this paragraph (b)(2) if it would be deductible under chapter 1 of the Code in determining the taxable income of a corporation. For example, because Federal income taxes are not deductible under chapter 1 of the Code in determining the taxable income of a corporation, the tax imposed by section 468A(e)(2) and paragraph (a) of this section is not deductible in determining the modified gross income of a nuclear decommissioning fund. Similarly, because certain expenses allocable to tax-exempt interest income are not deductible under section 265 in determining the taxable income of a corporation, such expenses are not deductible in determining the modified gross income of a nuclear decommissioning fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A deduction is allowed for the amount of an otherwise deductible loss

that is sustained by the nuclear decommissioning fund in connection with the sale, exchange or worthlessness of any investment. A loss is otherwise deductible for purposes of this paragraph (b)(3) if such loss would be deductible by a corporation under section 165(f) or (g) and sections 1211(a) and 1212(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A deduction is allowed for the amount of an otherwise deductible net operating loss of the nuclear decommissioning fund. For purposes of this paragraph (b), the net operating loss of a nuclear decommissioning fund for a taxable year is the amount by which the deductions allowable under paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section exceed the gross income of the nuclear decommissioning fund computed with the modification described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. A net operating loss is otherwise deductible for purposes of this paragraph (b)(4) if such a net operating loss would be deductible by a corporation under section 172(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Special rules--(1) Period for computation of modified gross income. The modified gross income of a nuclear decommissioning fund must be computed on the basis of the taxable year of the electing taxpayer. If an electing taxpayer changes its taxable year, each nuclear decommissioning fund of the electing taxpayer must change to the new taxable year. See section 442 and Sec. 1.442-1 for rules relating to the change to a new taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Period for computation of modified gross income. The modified gross income of a nuclear decommissioning fund must be computed on the basis of the taxable year of the electing taxpayer. If an electing taxpayer changes its taxable year, each nuclear decommissioning fund of the electing taxpayer must change to the new taxable year. See section 442 and Sec. 1.442-1 for rules relating to the change to a new taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Gain or loss upon distribution of property by a fund. A distribution of property by a nuclear decommissioning fund (whether an actual distribution or a deemed distribution) shall be considered a disposition of property by the nuclear decommissioning fund for purposes of section 1001. In determining the amount of gain or loss from such disposition, the amount realized by the nuclear decommissioning fund shall be the fair market value of the property on the date of disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Denial of credits against tax. The tax imposed on the modified gross income of a nuclear decommissioning fund under paragraph (a) of this section is not to be reduced or offset by any credits against tax provided by part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code other than the credit provided by section 31(c) for amounts withheld under section 3406 (back-up withholding).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Other corporate taxes inapplicable. Although the modified gross income of a nuclear decommissioning fund is subject to tax at the rate specified by section 468A(e)(2) and paragraph (a) of this section, a nuclear decommissioning fund is not subject to the other taxes imposed on corporations under subtitle A of the Code. For example, a nuclear decommissioning fund is not subject to the alternative minimum tax imposed by section 55, the accumulated earnings tax imposed by section 531, the personal holding company tax imposed by section 541, and the alternative tax imposed on a corporation under section 1201(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Treatment as corporation for purposes of subtitle F. For purposes of subtitle F of the Code and Secs. 1.468A-1 through 1.468A-9, a nuclear decommissioning fund is to be treated as if it were a corporation and the tax imposed by section 468A(e)(2) and paragraph (a) of this section is to be treated as a tax imposed by section 11. Thus, for example, the following rules apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A nuclear decommissioning fund must file a return with respect to the tax imposed by section 468A(e)(2) and paragraph (a) of this section for each taxable year (or portion thereof) that the fund is in existence even though no amount is included in the gross income of the fund for such taxable year. The return is to be made on Form 1120-ND in accordance with the instructions relating to such form. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(1), a nuclear decommissioning fund is in existence for the period that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Begins on the date that the first deductible payment is actually made to such nuclear decommissioning fund; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Ends on the date of termination (see Sec. 1.468A-5(d)), the date that the entire fund is disqualified (see Sec. 1.468A-5(c)), or the date that the electing taxpayer disposes of its entire qualifying interest in the nuclear power plant to which the nuclear decommissioning fund relates (other than in connection with the transfer of the entire fund to the person acquiring such interest), whichever is applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For each taxable year of the nuclear decommissioning fund, the return described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section must be filed on or before the 15th day of the third month following the close of such taxable year unless the nuclear decommissioning fund is granted an extension of time for filing under section 6081. If such an extension is granted for any taxable year, the return for such taxable year must be filed on or before the extended due date for such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A nuclear decommissioning fund must provide its employer identification number on returns, statements and other documents as required by the forms and instructions relating thereto. The employer identification number is obtained by filing a Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification Number, in accordance with the instructions relating thereto.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A nuclear decommissioning fund must deposit all payments of tax imposed by section 468A(e)(2) and paragraph (a) of this section (including any payments of estimated tax) with an authorized government depositary in accordance with Sec. 1.6302-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A nuclear decommissioning fund is subject to the addition to tax imposed by section 6655 in case of a failure to pay estimated income tax. For purposes of section 6655 and this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The tax with respect to which the amount of the underpayment is computed in the case of a nuclear decommissioning fund is the tax imposed by section 468A(e)(2) and paragraph (a) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The taxable income with respect to which the nuclear decommissioning fund's status as a large corporation is measured is modified gross income (as defined by paragraph (b) of this section).

Sec. 1.468A-5  Nuclear decommissioning fund qualification requirements;prohibitions against self-dealing; disqualification of nuclear decommissioning fund; termination of fund upon substantial completion of decommissioning.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Qualification requirements--(1) In general. (i) A nuclear decommissioning fund must be established and maintained at all times in the United States pursuant to an arrangement that qualifies as a trust under State law. Such trust must be established for the exclusive purpose of providing funds for the decommissioning of one or more nuclear power plants, but a single trust agreement may establish multiple funds for such purpose. Thus, for example--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. (i) A nuclear decommissioning fund must be established and maintained at all times in the United States pursuant to an arrangement that qualifies as a trust under State law.

Thus, for example--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Two or more nuclear decommissioning funds can be established and maintained pursuant to a single trust agreement; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> One or more funds that are to be used for the decommissioning of a nuclear power plant and that do not qualify as nuclear decommissioning funds under this paragraph (a) can be established and maintained pursuant to a trust agreement that governs one or more nuclear decommissioning funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A separate nuclear decommissioning fund is required for each electing taxpayer and for each nuclear power plant with respect to which an electing taxpayer possesses a qualifying interest. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will issue a separate schedule of ruling amounts with respect to each nuclear decommissioning fund, and each nuclear decommissioning fund must file a separate income tax return even if other nuclear decommissioning funds or nonqualified funds are established and maintained pursuant to the trust agreement governing such fund or the assets of other nuclear decommissioning funds or nonqualified funds are pooled with the assets of such fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An electing taxpayer can maintain only one nuclear decommissioning fund for each nuclear power plant with respect to which the taxpayer elects the application of section 468A. If a nuclear power plant is subject to the ratemaking jurisdiction of two or more public utility commissions and any such public utility commission requires a separate fund to be maintained for the benefit of ratepayers whose rates are established or approved by the public utility commission, the separate funds maintained for such plant

(whether or not established and maintained pursuant to a single trust agreement) shall be considered a single nuclear decommissioning fund for purposes of section 468A and Secs. 1.468A-1 through 1.468A-4, this section and Secs. 1.468A-7 through 1.468A-9. Thus, for example, the IRS will issue one schedule of ruling amounts with respect to such nuclear power plant, the nuclear decommissioning fund must file a single income tax return (see Sec. 1.468A-4(d)(1)), and, if the IRS disqualifies the nuclear decommissioning fund, the assets of each separate fund are treated as distributed on the date of disqualification (see paragraph (c)(3) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If assets of a nuclear decommissioning fund are (or will be) invested through an unincorporated organization, within the meaning of Sec. 301.7701-2 of this chapter, the IRS will rule, if requested, whether the organization is an association taxable as a corporation for Federal tax purposes. A request for this ruling may be made by the electing taxpayer as part of its request for a schedule of ruling amounts or as part of a request under Sec. 1.468A-8 for a schedule of deduction amounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Limitation on contributions. Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 1.468A-8 (relating to special transfers under section 468A(f)), a nuclear decommissioning fund is not permitted to accept any contributions in cash or property other than cash payments with respect to which a deduction is allowed under section 468A(a) and Sec. 1.468A-2(a). Thus, for example, except in the case of a special transfer pursuant to Sec. 1.468A-8, securities may not be contributed to a nuclear decommissioning fund even if the taxpayer or a fund established by the taxpayer previously held such securities for the purpose of providing funds for the decommissioning of a nuclear power plant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Limitation on use of fund--(i) In general.

For purposes of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, the term administrative costs and other incidental expenses of a nuclear decommissioning fund means all ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in connection with the operation of the nuclear decommissioning fund. Such term includes the tax imposed by section 468A(e)(2) and Sec. 1.468A-4(a), any State or local tax imposed on the income or the assets of the fund, legal expenses, accounting expenses, actuarial expenses and trustee expenses. Such term does not include decommissioning costs or the payment of insurance premiums on a policy to pay for the nuclear decommissioning costs of a nuclear power plant. Such term also does not include the excise tax imposed on the trustee or other disqualified person under section 4951 or the reimbursement of any expenses incurred in connection with the assertion of such tax unless such expenses are considered reasonable and necessary under section 4951(d)(2)(C) and it is determined that the trustee or other disqualified person is not liable for the excise tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Trust provisions. Each qualified nuclear decommissioning fund trust agreement must provide that assets in the fund must be used as authorized by section 468A and Secs. 1.468A-1 through 1.468A-9 and that the agreement may not be amended so as to violate section 468A or Secs. 1.468A-1 through 1.468A-9.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Prohibitions against self-dealing--(1) In general.

In the case of an excess contribution that is the result of a payment made pursuant to Sec. 1.468A-3(g)(1), a nuclear decommissioning fund will not be disqualified under paragraph (c)(1) of this section if the amount of the excess contribution is withdrawn by the electing taxpayer on or before the later of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The date prescribed by law (including extensions) for filing the return of the nuclear decommissioning fund for the taxable year to which the excess contribution relates; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The date that is 30 days after the date that the taxpayer receives the ruling amount for such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Excess contribution defined. For purposes of this section, an excess contribution is the amount by which cash payments made (or deemed made) to a nuclear decommissioning fund during any taxable year exceed the payment limitation contained in section 468A(b) and Sec. 1.468A-2(b). The amount of a special transfer permitted under Sec. 1.468A-8 is not treated as a cash payment for this purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Taxation of income attributable to an excess contribution. The income of a nuclear decommissioning fund attributable to an excess contribution is required to be included in the gross income of the nuclear decommissioning fund under Sec. 1.468A-4(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Disqualification treated as distribution. If all or any portion of a nuclear decommissioning fund is disqualified under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the portion of the nuclear decommissioning fund that is disqualified is treated as distributed to the electing taxpayer on the date of disqualification.

Contributions made to a disqualified fund after the date of disqualification are not deductible under section 468A(a) and Sec. 1.468A-2(a), or, if the fund is disqualified only in part, are deductible only to the extent provided in the notice of disqualification. In addition, if any assets of the fund that are deemed distributed under paragraph (c)(3) of this section are held by the fund after the date of disqualification (or if additional assets are acquired with nondeductible contributions made to the fund after the date of disqualification), the income earned by such assets after the date of disqualification must be included in the gross income of the electing taxpayer (see section 671) to the extent that such income is otherwise includible under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code).

Sec. 1.468A-6  Disposition of an interest in a nuclear power plant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. This section describes the Federal income tax consequences of a transfer of the assets of a nuclear decommissioning fund (Fund) within the meaning of Sec. 1.468A-1(b)(4) in connection with a sale, exchange, or other disposition by a taxpayer (transferor) of all or a portion of its qualifying interest in a nuclear power plant to another taxpayer (transferee). This section also explains how a schedule of ruling amounts will be determined for the transferor and transferee. For purposes of this section, a nuclear power plant includes a plant that previously qualified as a nuclear power plant and that has permanently ceased to produce electricity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Requirements. This section applies if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Immediately before the disposition, the transferor maintained a Fund with respect to the interest disposed of;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Immediately after the disposition--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The transferee maintains a Fund with respect to the interest acquired;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The interest acquired is a qualifying interest of the transferee in the nuclear power plant;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In connection with the disposition, either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The transferee acquires part or all of the transferor's qualifying interest in the plant and a proportionate amount of the assets of the transferor's Fund (all such assets if the transferee acquires the transferor's entire qualifying interest in the plant) is transferred to a Fund of the transferee; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The transferee acquires the transferor's entire qualifying interest in the plant and the transferor's entire Fund is transferred to the transferee; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The transferee continues to satisfy the requirements of Sec. 1.468A-5(a)(1)(iii), which permits an electing taxpayer to maintain only one Fund for each plant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Tax consequences. A disposition that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section will have the following tax consequences at the time it occurs:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The transferor and its Fund. (i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, neither the transferor nor the transferor's Fund will recognize gain or loss or otherwise take any income or deduction into account by reason of the transfer of a proportionate amount of the assets of the transferor's Fund to the transferee's Fund (or by reason of the transfer of the transferor's entire Fund to the transferee). For purposes of Secs. 1.468A-1 through 1.468A-9, this transfer (or the transfer of the transferor's Fund) will not be considered a distribution of assets by the transferor's Fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, neither the transferor nor the transferor's Fund will recognize gain or loss or otherwise take any income or deduction into account by reason of the transfer of a proportionate amount of the assets of the transferor's Fund to the transferee's Fund (or by reason of the transfer of the transferor's entire Fund to the transferee). For purposes of Secs. 1.468A-1 through 1.468A-9, this transfer (or the transfer of the transferor's Fund) will not be considered a distribution of assets by the transferor's Fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, if the transferor has made a special transfer under Sec. 1.468A-8 prior to the transfer of the Fund or Fund assets, any deduction with respect to that special transfer allowable under section 468A(f)(2) for a taxable year ending after the date of the transfer of the Fund or Fund assets (the unamortized special transfer deduction) is allowed under section 468A(f)(2)(C) for the taxable year that includes the date of the transfer of the Fund or Fund assets. If the taxpayer transfers only a portion of its interest in a nuclear power plant, only the corresponding portion of the unamortized special transfer deduction qualifies for the acceleration under section 468A(f)(2)(C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The transferee and its Fund. Neither the transferee nor the transferee's Fund will recognize gain or loss or otherwise take any income or deduction into account by reason of the transfer of a proportionate amount of the assets of the transferor's Fund to the transferee's Fund (or by reason of the transfer of the transferor's Fund to the transferee). For purposes of Secs. 1.468A-1 through 1.468A-9, this transfer (or the transfer of the transferor's Fund) will not constitute a payment or a contribution of assets by the transferee to its Fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Basis. Transfers of assets of a Fund to which this section applies do not affect basis. Thus, the transferee's Fund will have a basis in the assets received from the transferor's Fund that is the same as the basis of those assets in the transferor's Fund immediately before the disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Determination of proportionate amount. For purposes of this section, a transferor of a qualifying interest in a nuclear power plant is considered to transfer a proportionate amount of the assets of its Fund to a Fund of a transferee of the interest if, on the date of the transfer of the interest, the percentage of the fair market value of the Fund's assets attributable to the assets transferred equals the percentage of the transferor's qualifying interest that is transferred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Calculation of schedule of ruling amounts and schedule of deduction amounts for dispositions described in this section--(1) Transferor. If a transferor disposes of all or a portion of its qualifying interest in a nuclear power plant in a transaction to which this section applies, the transferor's schedule of ruling amounts with respect to the interests disposed of and retained (if any)

If the transferor has elected to make a special transfer under section 468A(f), the amount allowable as a deduction under Sec. 1.468A-8 for the taxable year in which it transfers a portion of its interest in the nuclear plant is equal to the deduction amount for that taxable year from its existing schedule of deduction amounts multiplied by the percentage of its interest that it retains. This deduction is in addition to the deduction described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Taxable years after the year of disposition. A transferor that retains a qualifying interest in a nuclear power plant must file a request for a revised schedule of ruling amounts (and, if applicable, a revised schedule of deduction amounts) with respect to that interest on or before the deemed payment deadline for the first taxable year of the transferor beginning after the disposition. See Secs. 1.468A-3(f)(1)(ii)(B) and 1.468A-8(c)(3). If the transferor does not timely file such a request, the transferor's ruling amount and the transferor's deduction amount under Sec. 1.468A-8 with respect to that interest for the affected year or years will be zero, unless the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) waives the application of this paragraph (e)(1)(iii) upon a showing of good cause for the delay.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transferee. If a transferee acquires all or a portion of a transferor's qualifying interest in a nuclear power plant in a transaction to which this section applies, the transferee's schedule of ruling amounts with respect to the interest acquired will be determined under the following rules:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Taxable year of disposition. If the transferee does not file a request for a schedule of ruling amounts on or before the deemed payment deadline for the taxable year of the transferee in which the disposition occurs (that is, the date that is two and one-half months after the close of that year), the transferee's ruling amount with respect to the interest acquired in the nuclear power plant for that year is equal to the amount contained in the transferor's current schedule of ruling amounts for that plant for the taxable year of the transferor in which the disposition occurred, multiplied by the product of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The portion of the transferor's qualifying interest that is transferred; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable year of the transferor including and following the date of disposition, and the denominator of which is the number of days in that taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Taxable years after the year of disposition. A transferee of a qualifying interest in a nuclear power plant must file a request for a revised schedule of ruling amounts with respect to that interest on or before the deemed payment deadline for the first taxable year of the transferee beginning after the disposition. See Sec. 1.468A-3(f)(1)(ii)(B). If the transferee does not timely file such a request, the transferee's ruling amount with respect to that interest for the affected year or years will be

zero, unless the IRS waives the application of this paragraph (e)(2)(ii) upon a showing of good cause for the delay.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (e):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X Corporation is a calendar year taxpayer engaged in the sale of electric energy generated by a nuclear power plant. The plant is owned entirely by X. On May 27, 2010, X transfers a 60-percent qualifying interest in the plant to Y Corporation, a calendar year taxpayer. Before the transfer, X had received a schedule of ruling amounts containing an annual ruling amount of $10 million for the taxable years 2005 through 2025. For 2010, neither X nor Y files a request for a revised schedule of ruling amounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, X's ruling amount for 2010 is calculated as follows: ($10,000,000 x .40) + ($10,000,000 x .60 x 146/365)=$6,400,000. Under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, Y's ruling amount for 2010 is calculated as follows: $10,000,000 x .60 x 219/365=$3,600,000. Under paragraphs (e)(1)(iii) and (e)(2)(ii) of this section, X and Y must file requests for revised schedules of ruling amounts by March 15, 2012.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Y Corporation, the sole owner of a nuclear power plant, is a calendar year taxpayer. In year 1, Y elects to make a special transfer under section 468A(f)(1) to the nuclear decommissioning fund Y maintains with respect to the plant. The amount of the special transfer is $100x, and the remaining useful life of the plant is 20 years. Y obtains a schedule of deduction amounts under Sec. 1.468A-8T(c) permitting a $5x deduction each year over the 20-year remaining useful life, and deducts $5x of the special transfer amount in year 1, year 2, year 3, and year 4. On the first day of year 5, Y transfers a 25% interest in the plant to an unrelated party. Under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, Y may deduct in Year 5 the unamortized special transfer deduction corresponding to the portion of the plant transferred (25 percent of $80x or $20x). In addition, under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, Y may deduct the portion of the deduction amount for year 5 from the schedule of deduction amounts corresponding to its retained interest in the plant (75 percent of $5x or $3.75x). Pursuant to paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section, Y must file a request for a revised schedule of ruling amounts by March 15 of year 7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Anti-abuse provision. The IRS may treat a disposition as satisfying the requirements of this section if the IRS determines that this treatment is necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of section 468A and Secs. 1.468A-1 through 1.468A-9.

Sec. 1.468A-8  Special transfers to qualified funds pursuant to section468A(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule--(1) In general. Under section 468A(f), a taxpayer maintaining a qualified nuclear decommissioning fund with respect to a nuclear power plant may transfer cash or property into the fund (a special transfer). The special transfer is not subject to the ruling amount limitation in section 468A(b) and is not treated as a cash payment for purposes of that limitation. Thus, a taxpayer may, in the same taxable year, pay the ruling amount and make a special transfer into the fund. A special transfer may be made in cash, property, or both cash and property. The amount of a special transfer (that is, the amount of cash and the fair market value of property transferred) may not exceed the present value of the pre-2005 nonqualifying amount of nuclear decommissioning costs with respect to the nuclear power plant. The taxpayer is entitled to a deduction against income for a special transfer, as described in paragraph (b) of this section. A special transfer may not be made to a nuclear decommissioning fund before the first taxable year in which a deduction amount is applicable to the nuclear decommissioning fund (see paragraph (c) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Under section 468A(f), a taxpayer maintaining a qualified nuclear decommissioning fund with respect to a nuclear power plant may transfer cash or property into the fund (a special transfer). The special transfer is not subject to the ruling amount limitation in section 468A(b) and is not treated as a cash payment for purposes of that limitation. Thus, a taxpayer may, in the same taxable year, pay the ruling amount and make a special transfer into the fund. A special transfer may be made in cash, property, or both cash and property. The amount of a special transfer (that is, the amount of cash and the fair market value of property transferred) may not exceed the present value of the pre-2005 nonqualifying amount of nuclear decommissioning costs with respect to the nuclear power plant. The taxpayer is entitled to a deduction against income for a special transfer, as described in paragraph (b) of this section. A special transfer may not be made to a nuclear decommissioning fund before the first taxable year in which a deduction amount is applicable to the nuclear decommissioning fund (see paragraph (c) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Pre-2005 nonqualifying amount--(i) In general. The present value of the pre-2005 nonqualifying amount of nuclear decommissioning costs with respect to a nuclear power plant is the amount equal to the pre-2005 nonqualifying percentage of the present value of the estimated future decommissioning costs (as defined in Sec. 1.468A-1(b)(6)) with respect to the nuclear power plant as of the first day of the taxable year of the taxpayer in which the special transfer is made or deemed made (or a later date that is on or before the date on which the special transfer is expected to be made if the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the IRS that the determination of present value as of such date is reasonable and consistent with the principles and provisions of this section).

under the law in effect before the enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 2005); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The percentage of decommissioning costs transferred in any previous special transfer (that is, the amount transferred as a percentage of the present value of the estimated future costs of decommissioning as of the first day of the taxable year in which such previous transfer was made).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pre-2005 nonqualifying amount of transferee. If there is a transfer of a nuclear decommissioning fund or part or all of its assets and Sec. 1.468A-6 applies to the transfer, the pre-2005 nonqualifying amount determined with respect to the transferee is equal to the pre-2005 nonqualifying amount (or a proportionate part of the pre-2005 nonqualifying amount) that would have been determined with respect to the transferor but for such transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Transfers in multiple years. A taxpayer making a special transfer is not required to transfer the entire eligible amount in a single year. The requirements of paragraph (c) of this section apply separately to each year in which a special transfer is made. In calculating the amount of any subsequent transfer, the taxpayer must reduce the pre-2005 nonqualifying percentage under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to take into account all previous transfers. For example, if a taxpayer has a pre-2005 nonqualifying percentage of 40 percent, and transfers half of the eligible amount in a special transfer, any subsequent transfer must be calculated on the basis of a pre-2005 nonqualifying percentage of 20 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Deemed payment rules--(i) In general. The amount of any special transfer (whether in cash or property) described in Sec. 1.468A-8 and made by an electing taxpayer to a nuclear decommissioning fund on or before the 15th day of the third calendar month after the close of any taxable year (the deemed payment deadline date) shall be deemed made during such taxable year if the electing taxpayer irrevocably designates the amount as relating to such taxable year on its timely filed Federal income tax return for such taxable year or, in the case of special transfers described in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, on an amended return for such taxable year (see Sec. 1.468A-7(b)(4)(v) and (vi) for rules relating to such designation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

The election described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section may be made and a deduction equal to adjusted basis will be allowed for property contributed in a special transfer prior to December 23, 2010. The election in such a case may be made on an amended return of the fund for the taxable year in which the property is contributed to the fund and the transferor may amend previously filed returns to claim a deduction calculated by reference to the adjusted basis of the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Denial of deduction for previously deducted amounts. If a deduction (other than a deduction under section 468A) has been allowed to the taxpayer (or a predecessor) on account of expected decommissioning costs for a nuclear power plant (a nonconforming deduction) or an amount otherwise includible in income has been excluded from the gross income of the taxpayer (or a predecessor) on account of such expected decommissioning costs (a nonconforming exclusion), the deduction allowed for a special transfer to the nuclear decommissioning fund maintained with respect to the plant is reduced.

Sec. 1.468B-1  Qualified settlement funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. A qualified settlement fund is a fund, account, or trust that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Coordination with other entity classifications. If a fund, account, or trust that is a qualified settlement fund could be classified as a trust within the meaning of Sec. 301.7701-4 of this chapter, it is classified as a qualified settlement fund for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). If a fund, account, or trust, organized as a trust under applicable state law, is a qualified settlement fund, and could be classified as either an association (within the meaning of Sec. 301.7701-2 of this chapter) or a partnership (within the meaning of Sec. 301.7701-3 of this chapter), it is classified as a qualified settlement fund for all purposes of the Code. If a fund, account, or trust, established for contested liabilities pursuant to Sec. 1.461-2(c)(1) is a qualified settlement fund, it is classified as a qualified settlement fund for all purposes of the Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Requirements. A fund, account, or trust satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (c) if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> It is established pursuant to an order of, or is approved by, the United States, any state (including the District of Columbia), territory, possession, or political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality (including a court of law) of any of the foregoing and is subject to the continuing jurisdiction of that governmental authority;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> It is established to resolve or satisfy one or more contested or uncontested claims that have resulted or may result from an event (or related series of events) that has occurred and that has given rise to at least one claim asserting liability--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (hereinafter referred to as CERCLA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Arising out of a tort, breach of contract, or violation of law; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Designated by the Commissioner in a revenue ruling or revenue procedure; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The fund, account, or trust is a trust under applicable state law, or its assets are otherwise segregated from other assets of the transferor (and related persons).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Transferor. A ``transferor'' is a person that transfers (or on behalf of whom an insurer or other person transfers) money or property to a qualified settlement fund to resolve or satisfy claims described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section against that person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Related person. A ``related person'' is any person who is related to the transferor within the meaning of sections 267(b) or 707(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Governmental order or approval requirement--(1) In general. A fund, account, or trust is ``ordered by'' or ``approved by'' a governmental authority described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section when the authority issues its initial or preliminary order to establish, or grants its initial or preliminary approval of, the fund, account, or trust, even if that order or approval may be subject to review or revision. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, the governmental authority's order or approval has no retroactive effect and does not permit a fund, account, or trust to be a qualified settlement fund prior to the date the order is issued or the approval is granted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A fund, account, or trust is ``ordered by'' or ``approved by'' a governmental authority described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section when the authority issues its initial or preliminary order to establish, or grants its initial or preliminary approval of, the fund, account, or trust, even if that order or approval may be subject to review or revision. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, the governmental authority's order or approval has no retroactive effect and does not permit a fund, account, or trust to be a qualified settlement fund prior to the date the order is issued or the approval is granted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Arbitration panels. An arbitration award that orders the establishment of, or approves, a fund, account, or trust is an order or approval of a governmental authority described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The arbitration award is judicially enforceable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The arbitration award is issued pursuant to a bona fide arbitration proceeding in accordance with rules that are approved by a governmental authority described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section (such as self-regulatory organization-administered arbitration proceedings in the securities industry); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The fund, account, or trust is subject to the continuing jurisdiction of the arbitration panel, the court of law that has jurisdiction to enforce the arbitration award, or the governmental authority that approved the rules of the arbitration proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Resolve or satisfy requirement--(1) Liabilities to provide services or property.

A transferor's liability under CERCLA to provide services or property is described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section if following its transfer to a fund, account, or trust the transferor's only remaining liability to the Environmental Protection Agency (if any) is a remote, future obligation to provide services or property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Excluded liabilities. A liability is not described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section if it--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Arises under a workers compensation act or a self-insured health plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Is an obligation to refund the purchase price of, or to repair or replace, products regularly sold in the ordinary course of the transferor's trade or business;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Is an obligation of the transferor to make payments to its general trade creditors or debtholders that relates to a title 11 or similar case (as defined in section 368(a)(3)(A)), or a workout; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Is designated by the Commissioner in a revenue ruling or a revenue procedure (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Segregation requirement--(1) In general. If it is not a trust under applicable state law, a fund, account, or trust satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section if its assets are physically segregated from other assets of the transferor (and related persons). For example, cash held by a transferor in a separate bank account satisfies the segregation requirement of paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If it is not a trust under applicable state law, a fund, account, or trust satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section if its assets are physically segregated from other assets of the transferor (and related persons). For example, cash held by a transferor in a separate bank account satisfies the segregation requirement of paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Classification of fund established to resolve or satisfy allowable and non-allowable claims. If a fund, account, or trust is established to resolve or satisfy claims described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section as well as other types of claims (i.e., non-allowable claims) arising from the same event or related series of events, the fund is a qualified settlement fund. However, under Sec. 1.468B-3(c), economic performance does not occur with respect to transfers to the qualified settlement fund for non-allowable claims.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Classification of fund prior to satisfaction of requirements in paragraph (c) of this section--(1) In general. If a fund, account, or trust is established to resolve or satisfy claims described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the assets of the fund, account, or trust are treated as owned by the transferor of those assets until the fund, account, or trust also meets the requirements of paragraphs (c) (1) and (3) of this section. On the date the fund, account, or trust satisfies all the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, the transferor is treated as transferring the assets to a qualified settlement fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

If a fund, account, or trust meets the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section prior to the time it meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the transferor and administrator (as defined in Sec. 1.468B-2(k)(3)) may jointly elect (a relation-back election) to treat the fund, account, or trust as coming into existence as a qualified settlement fund on the later of the date the fund, account, or trust meets the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section or January 1 of the calendar year in which all the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section are met. If a relation-back election is made, the assets held by the fund, account, or trust on the date the qualified settlement fund is treated as coming into existence are treated as transferred to the qualified settlement fund on that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If a fund, account, or trust meets the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section prior to the time it meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the transferor and administrator (as defined in Sec. 1.468B-2(k)(3)) may jointly elect (a relation-back election) to treat the fund, account, or trust as coming into existence as a qualified settlement fund on the later of the date the fund, account, or trust meets the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section or January 1 of the calendar year in which all the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section are met. If a relation-back election is made, the assets held by the fund, account, or trust on the date the qualified settlement fund is treated as coming into existence are treated as transferred to the qualified settlement fund on that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Relation-back election. A relation-back election is made by attaching a copy of the election statement, signed by each transferor and the administrator, to (and as part of) the timely

filed income tax return (including extensions) of the qualified settlement fund for the taxable year in which the fund is treated as coming into existence. A copy of the election statement must also be attached to (and as part of) the timely filed income tax return (including extensions), or an amended return that is consistent with the requirements of Secs. 1.468B-1 through 1.468B-4, of each transferor for the taxable year of the transferor that includes the date on which the qualified settlement fund is treated as coming into existence. The election statement must contain--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A legend, ``Sec. 1.468B-1 Relation-Back Election'', at the top of the first page;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Each transferor's name, address, and taxpayer identification number;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The qualified settlement fund's name, address, and employer identification number;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The date as of which the qualified settlement fund is treated as coming into existence; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> A schedule describing each asset treated as transferred to the qualified settlement fund on the date the fund is treated as coming into existence.

If a qualified settlement fund has only one transferor (as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section), the transferor may make an election (grantor trust election) to treat the qualified settlement fund as a trust all of which is owned by the transferor under section 671 and the regulations thereunder. A grantor trust election may be made whether or not the qualified settlement fund would be classified, in the absence of paragraph (b) of this section, as a trust all of which is treated as owned by the transferor under section 671 and the regulations thereunder. A grantor trust election may be revoked only for compelling circumstances upon consent of the Commissioner by private letter ruling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If a qualified settlement fund has only one transferor (as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section), the transferor may make an election (grantor trust election) to treat the qualified settlement fund as a trust all of which is owned by the transferor under section 671 and the regulations thereunder. A grantor trust election may be made whether or not the qualified settlement fund would be classified, in the absence of paragraph (b) of this section, as a trust all of which is treated as owned by the transferor under section 671 and the regulations thereunder.

To make a grantor trust election, a transferor must attach an election statement satisfying the requirements of paragraph (k)(2)(ii) of this section to a timely filed (including extensions) Form 1041, ``U.S. Income Tax Return for Estates and Trusts,'' that the administrator files on behalf of the qualified settlement fund for the taxable year in which the qualified settlement fund is established. However, if a Form 1041 is not otherwise required to be filed (for example, because the provisions of Sec. 1.671-4(b) apply), then the transferor makes a grantor trust election by attaching an election statement satisfying the requirements of paragraph (k)(2)(ii) of this section to a timely filed (including extensions) income tax return of the transferor for the taxable year in which the qualified settlement fund is established. See Sec. 1.468B-5(c)(2) for transition rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

The election statement must include the transferor's name, address, taxpayer identification number, and the legend, ``Sec. 1.468B-1(k) Election.'' The election statement and the statement described in Sec. 1.671-4(a) may be combined into a single statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Effect of making the election.

The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In a class action brought in a United States federal district court, the court holds that the defendant, Corporation X, violated certain securities laws and must pay damages in the amount of $150 million. Pursuant to an order of the court, Corporation X transfers $50 million in cash and transfers property with a fair market value of $75 million to a state law trust. The trust will liquidate the property and distribute the cash proceeds to the plaintiffs in the class action. The trust is a qualified settlement fund because it was established pursuant to the order of a federal district court to resolve or satisfy claims against Corporation X for securities law violations that have occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that Corporation X and the class of plaintiffs reach an out-of-court settlement that requires Corporation X to establish and fund a state law trust before the settlement agreement is submitted to the court for approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The trust is not a qualified settlement fund because it neither is established pursuant to an order of, nor has it been approved by, a governmental authority described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. On June 1, 1994, Corporation Y establishes a fund to resolve or satisfy claims against it arising from the violation of certain securities laws. On that date, Corporation Y transfers $10 million to a segregated account. On December 1, 1994, a federal district court approves the fund. Assuming Corporation Y and the administrator of the qualified settlement fund do not make a relation-back election, Corporation Y is treated as the owner of the $10 million, and is taxable on any income earned on that money, from June 1 through November 30, 1994. The fund is a qualified settlement fund beginning on December 1, 1994.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On September 1, 1993, Corporation X, which has a taxable year ending on October 31, enters into a settlement agreement with a plaintiff class for asserted tort liabilities. Under the settlement agreement, Corporation X makes two $50 million payments into a segregated fund, one on September 1, 1993, and one on October 1, 1993, to resolve or satisfy the tort liabilities. A federal district court approves the settlement agreement on November 1, 1993.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The administrator of the fund and Corporation X elect to treat the fund as a qualified settlement fund prior to governmental approval under the relation-back rule of paragraph (j)(2) of this section. The administrator must attach the relation-back election statement to the fund's income tax return for calendar year 1993, and Corporation X must attach the election to its original or amended income tax return for its taxable year ending October 31, 1993.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Pursuant to the relation-back election, the fund begins its existence as a qualified settlement fund on September 1, 1993, and Corporation X is treated as transferring $50 million to the qualified settlement fund on September 1, 1993, and $50 million on October 1, 1993.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> With respect to these transfers, Corporation X must provide the statement described in Sec. 1.468B-3(e) to the administrator of the qualified settlement fund by February 15, 1994, and must attach a copy of this statement to its original or amended income tax return for its taxable year ending October 31, 1993.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Assume the same facts as in Example 4, except that the court approves the settlement on May 1, 1994. The administrator must attach the relation-back election statement to the fund's income tax return for calendar year 1994, and Corporation X must attach the election statement to its original or amended income tax return for its taxable year ending October 31, 1994. Pursuant to this election, the fund begins its existence as a qualified settlement fund on January 1, 1994. In addition, Corporation X is treated as transferring to the qualified settlement fund all amounts held in the fund on January 1, 1994. With respect to the transfer, Corporation X must provide the statement described in Sec. 1.468B-3(e) to the administrator of the qualified settlement fund by February 15, 1995, and must attach a copy of this statement to its income tax return for its taxable year ending October 31, 1994.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Corporation Z establishes a fund that meets all the requirements of section 468B(d)(2) for a designated settlement fund, except that Corporation Z does not make the election under section 468B(d)(2)(F). Although the fund does not qualify as a designated settlement fund, it is a qualified settlement fund because the fund meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Corporation X owns and operates a landfill in State A. State A requires Corporation X to transfer money to a trust annually based on the total tonnage of material placed in the landfill during the year. Under the laws of State A, Corporation X will be required to perform (either itself or through contractors) specified closure activities when the landfill is full, and the trust assets will be used to reimburse Corporation X for those closure costs. The trust is not a

qualified settlement fund because it is established to secure the liability of Corporation X to perform the closure activities.

Sec. 1.468B-2  Taxation of qualified settlement funds and relatedadministrative requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. A qualified settlement fund is a United States person and is subject to tax on its modified gross income for any taxable year at a rate equal to the maximum rate in effect for that taxable year under section 1(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Modified gross income. The ``modified gross income'' of a qualified settlement fund is its gross income, as defined in section 61, computed with the following modifications--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general, amounts transferred to the qualified settlement fund by, or on behalf of, a transferor to resolve or satisfy a liability for which the fund is established are excluded from gross income. However, dividends on stock of a transferor (or a related person), interest on debt of a transferor (or a related person), and payments in compensation for late or delayed transfers, are not excluded from gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A deduction is allowed for administrative costs and other incidental expenses incurred in connection with the operation of the qualified settlement fund that would be deductible under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code in determining the taxable income of a corporation. Administrative costs and other incidental expenses include state and local taxes, legal, accounting, and actuarial fees relating to the operation of the qualified settlement fund, and expenses arising from the notification of claimants and the processing of their claims. Administrative costs and other incidental expenses do not include legal fees incurred by, or on behalf of, claimants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A deduction is allowed for losses sustained by the qualified settlement fund in connection with the sale, exchange, or worthlessness of property held by the fund to the extent the losses would be deductible in determining the taxable income of a corporation under section 165 (f) or (g), and sections 1211(a) and 1212(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A deduction is allowed for the amount of a net operating loss of the qualified settlement fund to the extent the loss would be deductible in determining the taxable income of a corporation under section 172(a).

For purposes of this paragraph (c)(1), a distributive share of a partnership credit is treated as a deduction in an amount equal to the amount of the credit divided by the rate described in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For taxable years ending prior to January 1, 2003, a qualified settlement fund that holds a partnership interest it acquired prior to February 15, 1992, is allowed a deduction for its distributive share of that partnership's items of loss, deduction, or credit described in section 702(a) that would be deductible in determining the taxable income (or in the case of a credit, the income tax liability) of a corporation to the extent of the fund's distributive share of that partnership's items of income and gain described in section 702(a) for the same taxable year.

For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, changes in a qualified settlement fund's distributive share of items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit are disregarded if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> They result from a change in the terms of the partnership agreement on or after December 18, 1992, or a capital contribution to the partnership on or after December 18, 1992, unless the partnership agreement as in effect prior to December 18, 1992, requires the contribution; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A principal purpose of the change in the terms of the partnership agreement or the capital contribution is to circumvent the limitation described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Distributions to transferors and claimants. Amounts that are distributed by a qualified settlement fund to, or on behalf of, a transferor or a claimant are not deductible by the fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Basis of property transferred to a qualified settlement fund. A qualified settlement fund's initial basis in property it receives from a transferor (or from an insurer or other person on behalf of a transferor) is the fair market value of that property on the date of transfer to the fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Distribution of property. A qualified settlement fund must treat a distribution of property as a sale or exchange of that property for purposes of section 1001(a). In computing gain or loss, the amount realized by the qualified settlement fund is the fair market value of the property on the date of distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Other taxes. The tax imposed under paragraph (a) of this section is in lieu of any other taxation of the income of a qualified settlement fund under subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code. Thus, a qualified settlement fund is not subject to the alternative minimum tax of section 55, the accumulated earnings tax of section 531, the personal holding company tax of section 541, or the maximum capital gains rate of section 1(h). A qualified settlement fund is, however, subject to taxes that are not imposed on the income of a taxpayer, such as the tax on transfers of property to foreign entities under section 1491.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Denial of credits against tax. The tax imposed on the modified gross income of a qualified settlement fund under paragraph (a) of this section may not be reduced or offset by any credits against tax provided by part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Taxable year and accounting method.

Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 1.468B-5(b), for purposes of subtitle F of the Internal Revenue Code, a qualified settlement fund is treated as a corporation and any tax imposed under paragraph (a) of this section is treated as a tax imposed by section 11. Subtitle F rules that apply to qualified settlement funds include, but are not limited to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A qualified settlement fund must file an income tax return with respect to the tax imposed under paragraph (a) of this section for each taxable year that the fund is in existence, whether or not the fund has gross income for that taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A qualified settlement fund is in existence for the period that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Begins on the first date on which the fund is treated as a qualified settlement fund under Sec. 1.468B-1; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Ends on the earlier of the date the fund--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> No longer satisfies the requirements of Sec. 1.468B-1; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> No longer has any assets and will not receive any more transfers.

The return must be made by the administrator of the qualified settlement fund. The ``administrator'' (which may include a trustee if the qualified settlement fund is a trust) of a qualified settlement fund is, in order of priority--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The person designated, or approved, by the governmental authority that ordered or approved the fund for purposes of Sec. 1.468B-1(c)(1);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The person designated in the escrow agreement, settlement agreement, or other similar agreement governing the fund;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The escrow agent, custodian, or other person in possession or control of the fund's assets; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The transferor or, if there are multiple transferors, all the transferors, unless an agreement signed by all the transferors designates a single transferor as the administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The administrator of a qualified settlement fund must obtain an employer identification number for the fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A qualified settlement fund must deposit all payments of tax imposed under paragraph (a) of this section (including any payments of estimated tax) with an authorized government depositary in accordance with Sec. 1.6302-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A qualified settlement fund is subject to the addition to tax imposed by section 6655 in the case of an underpayment of estimated tax computed with respect to the tax imposed under paragraph (a) of this section.

The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On June 30, 1993, a United States federal district court approves the settlement of a lawsuit under which Corporation X must transfer $10,833,000 to a qualified settlement fund on August 1, 1993. The $10,833,000 includes $10 million of damages incurred by plaintiffs on October 1, 1992, and $833,000 of interest calculated at 10 percent annually from October 1, 1992, to August 1, 1993. The $833,000 of interest is not a payment to the qualified settlement fund in compensation for a late or delayed transfer to the fund within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this section because the payment of $10,833,000 to the fund is not due until August 1, 1993.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that the settlement agreement also provides for interest to accrue at a rate of 12 percent annually on any amount not transferred to the qualified settlement fund on August 1, 1993, and the only transfer Corporation X makes to the fund is $11,374,650 on January 1, 1994. The additional payment of $541,650 ($11,374,650 paid on January 1, 1994, less $10,833,000 due on August 1, 1993) is a payment to the qualified settlement fund in compensation for a late or delayed transfer to the fund within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

Sec. 1.468B-3  Rules applicable to the transferor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Transfer of property--(1) In general. A transferor must treat a transfer of property to a qualified settlement fund as a sale or exchange of that property for purposes of section 1001(a). In computing the gain or loss, the amount realized by the transferor is the fair market value of the property on the date the transfer is made (or is treated as made under Sec. 1.468B-1(g)) to the qualified settlement fund. Because the issuance of a transferor's debt, obligation to provide services or property in the future, or obligation to make a payment described in Sec. 1.461-4(g), is generally not a transfer of property by the transferor, it generally does not result in gain or loss to the transferor under this paragraph (a)(1).

A transferor must include in gross income any distribution (including a deemed distribution described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section) it receives from a qualified settlement fund.

The following example illustrates the rules of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example. On March 1, 1993, Individual A transfers $1 million to a qualified settlement fund to resolve or satisfy claims against him resulting from certain violations of securities laws. Individual A uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting. Since Individual A does not use the accrual method of accounting, the economic performance rules of paragraph (c) of this section are not applicable. Therefore, whether, when, and to what extent Individual A can deduct the transfer is determined under applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, such as sections 162 and 461.

Sec. 1.468B-4  Taxability of distributions to claimants.</p><p class="depth0">Whether a distribution to a claimant is includible in the claimant's gross income is generally determined by reference to the claim in respect of which the distribution is made and as if the distribution were made directly by the transferor. For example, to the extent a distribution is in satisfaction of damages on account of personal injury or sickness, the distribution may be excludable from gross income under section 104(a)(2). Similarly, to the extent a distribution is in satisfaction of a claim for foregone taxable interest, the distribution is includible in the claimant's gross income under section 61(a)(4).

With respect to a fund, account, or trust established after February 14, 1992, but prior to January 1, 1993, that satisfies the requirements of Sec. 1.468B-1(c), the Internal Revenue Service will not challenge a reasonable, consistently applied method of taxation as described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section for transfers to, income earned by, and distributions made by the fund prior to January 1, 1993. However, pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, sections 1.468B-1 through 1.468B-4 apply to transfers to, income earned by, and distributions made by the qualified settlement fund after 1992.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Use of cash method of accounting. For purposes of paragraphs (b)(i) and (b)(ii) of this section, for taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 1996, the Internal Revenue Service will not challenge the use of the cash receipts and disbursement method of accounting by a fund, account, or trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Unreasonable position. In no event is it a reasonable position to assert, pursuant to Rev. Rul. 71-119 (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter), that there is no current taxation of the income of a fund established after August 16, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Waiver of penalties. For taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 1993, if a fund, account or trust is subject to section 468B(g) and the Internal Revenue Service does not challenge the method of taxation for transfers to, income earned by, and distributions made by, the fund pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section, penalties will not be imposed in connection with the use of such method. For example, the penalties under section 6655 for failure to pay estimated tax, section 6651(a)(1) for failure to file a return, section 6651(a)(2) for failure to pay tax, section 6656 for failure to make deposit of taxes, and section 6662 for accuracy-related underpayments will generally not be imposed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Election to apply qualified settlement fund rules--(i) In general. The person that will be the administrator of a qualified settlement fund may elect to apply Secs. 1.468B-1 through 1.468B-4 to transfers to, income earned by, and distributions made by, the fund in taxable years ending after August 16, 1986. The election is effective beginning on the first day of the earliest open taxable year of the qualified settlement fund. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), a taxable year is considered open if the period for assessment and collection of tax has not expired pursuant to the rules of section 6501. The election

statement must provide the information described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section and must be signed by the person that will be the administrator. Such person must also provide each transferor of the qualified settlement fund with a copy of the election statement on or before March 15, 1993.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

In addition, the qualified settlement fund must file an amended return that is consistent with the requirements of Secs. 1.468B-1 through 1.468B-4 for any taxable year to which the election applies in which the fund took a position inconsistent with those requirements. Any such amended return must be filed no later than March 15, 1993, and must include a copy of the election statement described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Computation of interest and waiver of penalties. For purposes of section 6601 and section 6611, the income tax return for each taxable year of the qualified settlement fund to which the election applies is due on March 15 of the year following the taxable year of the fund. For taxable years of a qualified settlement fund ending prior to January 1, 1993, the income earned by the fund is deemed to have been earned on December 31 of each taxable year for purposes of section 6655. Thus, the addition to tax for failure to pay estimated tax under section 6655 will not be imposed. The penalty for failure to file a return under section 6651(a)(1), the penalty for failure to pay tax under section 6651(a)(2), the penalty for failure to make deposit of taxes under section 6656, and the accuracy-related penalty under section 6662 will not be imposed on a qualified settlement fund if the fund files its tax returns for taxable years ending prior to January 1, 1993, and pays any tax due for those taxable years, on or before March 15, 1993.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Grantor trust elections under Sec. 1.468B-1(k)--(1) In general.

Sec. 1.468B-6  Escrow accounts, trusts, and other funds used duringdeferred exchanges of like-kind property under section 1031(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section provides rules under section 468B(g) relating to the

current taxation of escrow accounts, trusts, and other funds used during deferred exchanges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. The definitions in this paragraph (b) apply for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Deferred exchange, escrow agreement, escrow holder, exchange agreement, qualified escrow account, qualified intermediary, qualified trust, relinquished property, replacement property, taxpayer, trust agreement, and trustee have the same meanings as in Sec. 1.1031(k)-1; deferred exchange also includes any exchange intended to qualify as a deferred exchange, and qualified intermediary also includes any person or entity intended by a taxpayer to be a qualified intermediary within the meaning of Sec. 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exchange funds. Exchange funds means relinquished property, cash, or cash equivalent that secures an obligation of a transferee to transfer replacement property, or proceeds from a transfer of relinquished property, held in a qualified escrow account, qualified trust, or other escrow account, trust, or fund in a deferred exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exchange facilitator. Exchange facilitator means a qualified intermediary, transferee, escrow holder, trustee, or other party that holds exchange funds for a taxpayer in a deferred exchange pursuant to an escrow agreement, trust agreement, or exchange agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Transactional expenses--(i) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, transactional expenses means transactional items within the meaning of Sec. 1.1031(k)-1(g)(7)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, transactional expenses means transactional items within the meaning of Sec. 1.1031(k)-1(g)(7)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for certain fees for exchange facilitator services. The fee for the services of an exchange facilitator is not a transactional expense unless the escrow agreement, trust agreement, or exchange agreement, as applicable, provides that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount of the fee payable to the exchange facilitator is fixed on or before the date of the transfer of the relinquished property by the taxpayer (either by stating the fee as a fixed dollar amount in the agreement or determining the fee by a formula, the result of which is known on or before the transfer of the relinquished property by the taxpayer); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount of the fee is payable by the taxpayer regardless of whether the earnings attributable to the exchange funds are sufficient to pay the fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Taxation of exchange funds--(1) Exchange funds generally treated as loaned to an exchange facilitator. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, exchange funds are treated as loaned from a taxpayer to an exchange facilitator (exchange facilitator loan). If a transaction is treated as an exchange facilitator loan under this paragraph (c)(1), the exchange facilitator must take into account all items of income, deduction, and credit (including capital gains and losses) attributable to the exchange funds. See Sec. 1.7872-16 to determine if an exchange facilitator loan is a below-market loan for purposes of section 7872 and Sec. 1.7872-5(b)(16) to determine if an exchange facilitator loan is exempt from section 7872.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Exchange funds generally treated as loaned to an exchange facilitator. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, exchange funds are treated as loaned from a taxpayer to an exchange facilitator (exchange facilitator loan). If a transaction is treated as an exchange facilitator loan under this paragraph (c)(1), the exchange facilitator must take into account all items of income, deduction, and credit (including capital gains and losses) attributable to the exchange funds. See Sec. 1.7872-16 to determine if an exchange facilitator loan is a below-market loan for purposes of section 7872 and Sec. 1.7872-5(b)(16) to determine if an exchange facilitator loan is exempt from section 7872.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exchange funds not treated as loaned to an exchange facilitator--(i) Scope. This paragraph (c)(2) applies if, in accordance with an escrow agreement, trust agreement, or exchange agreement, as applicable, all the earnings attributable to a taxpayer's exchange funds are paid to the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Scope. This paragraph (c)(2) applies if, in accordance with an escrow agreement, trust agreement, or exchange agreement, as applicable, all the earnings attributable to a taxpayer's exchange funds are paid to the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Earnings attributable to the taxpayer's exchange funds--(A) Separately identified account. If an exchange facilitator holds all of the taxpayer's exchange funds in a separately identified account, the earnings credited to that account are deemed to be all the earnings attributable to the taxpayer's exchange funds for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. In general, a separately identified account is an account established under the taxpayer's name and taxpayer identification number with a depository institution. For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, a sub-account will be treated as a separately identified account if the master account under which the sub-account is created is established with a depository institution, the depository institution identifies the sub-account by the taxpayer's

name and taxpayer identification number, and the depository institution specifically credits earnings to the sub-account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Separately identified account. If an exchange facilitator holds all of the taxpayer's exchange funds in a separately identified account, the earnings credited to that account are deemed to be all the earnings attributable to the taxpayer's exchange funds for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. In general, a separately identified account is an account established under the taxpayer's name and taxpayer identification number with a depository institution. For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, a sub-account will be treated as a separately identified account if the master account under which the sub-account is created is established with a depository institution, the depository institution identifies the sub-account by the taxpayer's

name and taxpayer identification number, and the depository institution specifically credits earnings to the sub-account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Allocation of earnings in commingled accounts. If an exchange facilitator commingles (for investment or otherwise) the taxpayer's exchange funds with other funds or assets, all the earnings attributable to the taxpayer's exchange funds are paid to the taxpayer if all of the earnings attributable to the commingled funds or assets that are allocable on a pro-rata basis (using a reasonable method that takes into account the time that the exchange funds are in the commingled account, actual rate or rates of return, and the respective account balances) to the taxpayer's exchange funds either are paid to the taxpayer or are treated as paid to the taxpayer under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Transactional expenses. Any payment from the taxpayer's exchange funds, or from the earnings attributable to the taxpayer's exchange funds, for a transactional expense of the taxpayer (as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section) is treated as first paid to the taxpayer and then paid by the taxpayer to the recipient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Treatment of the taxpayer. If this paragraph (c)(2) applies, exchange funds are not treated as loaned from a taxpayer to an exchange facilitator. The taxpayer must take into account all items of income, deduction, and credit (including capital gains and losses) attributable to the exchange funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Information reporting requirements. A payor (as defined in Sec. 1.6041-1) must report the income attributable to exchange funds to the extent required by the information reporting provisions of subpart B, Part III, subchapter A, chapter 61, Subtitle F of the Internal Revenue Code, and the regulations under those provisions. See Sec. 1.6041-1(f) for rules relating to the amount to be reported when fees, expenses or commissions owed by a payee to a third party are deducted from a payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following examples in which T is a taxpayer that uses a calendar taxable year and the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting. The examples are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> T enters into a deferred exchange with R. The sales agreement provides that T will transfer property (the relinquished property) to R and R will transfer replacement property to T. R's obligation to transfer replacement property to T is secured by cash equal to the fair market value of the relinquished property, which R will deposit into a qualified escrow account that T establishes with B, a depository institution. T enters into an escrow agreement with B that provides that all the earnings attributable to the exchange funds will be paid to T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On November 1, 2008, T transfers property to R and R deposits $2,100,000 in T's qualified escrow account with B. Between November 1 and December 31, 2008, B credits T's account with $14,000 of interest. During January 2009, B credits T's account with $7000 of interest. On February 1, 2009, R transfers replacement property worth $2,100,000 to T and B pays $2,100,000 from the qualified escrow account to R. Additionally, on February 1, 2009, B pays the $21,000 of interest to T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under paragraph (b) of this section, the $2,100,000 deposited with B constitutes exchange funds and B is an exchange facilitator. Because all the earnings attributable to the exchange funds are paid to T in accordance with the escrow agreement, paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies. The exchange funds are not treated as loaned from T to B. T must take into account in computing T's income tax liability for 2008 the $14,000 of earnings credited to the qualified escrow account in 2008 and for 2009 the $7,000 of earnings credited to the qualified escrow account in 2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the escrow agreement provides that, prior to paying the earnings to T, B may deduct any amounts B has paid to third parties for T's transactional expenses. B pays a third party $350 on behalf of T for a survey of the replacement property. After deducting $350 from the earnings attributable to T's qualified escrow account, B pays T the remainder ($20,650) of the earnings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the cost of the survey is a transactional expense. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the $350 that B pays for the survey is treated as first paid to T and then from T to the third party. Therefore, all the earnings attributable to T's exchange funds are paid or treated as paid to T in accordance with the escrow agreement, and paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies. The exchange funds are not treated as loaned from T to B,

and T must take into account in computing T's income tax liability the $21,000 of earnings credited to the qualified escrow account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the escrow agreement provides that B also may deduct any outstanding fees owed by T for B's services in facilitating the deferred exchange. In accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, the escrow agreement provides for a fixed fee of $1,200 for B's services, which is payable by T regardless of the amount of earnings attributable to the exchange funds. Because the earnings on the exchange funds in this case exceed $1,200, B retains $1,200 as the unpaid portion of its fee and pays T the remainder ($19,800) of the earnings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, B's fee is treated as a transactional expense. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the $1200 that B retains for its fee is treated as first paid to T and then from T to B. Therefore, all the earnings attributable to T's exchange funds are paid or treated as paid to T in accordance with the escrow agreement, and paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies. The exchange funds are not treated as loaned from T to B, and T must take into account in computing T's income tax liability the $21,000 of earnings credited to the qualified escrow account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that, instead of entering into an escrow agreement, T enters into an exchange agreement with QI, a qualified intermediary. The exchange agreement provides that R will pay $2,100,000 to QI, QI will deposit $2,100,000 into an account with a depository institution under T's name and taxpayer identification number (TIN), and all the earnings attributable to the account will be paid to T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On May 1, 2008, T transfers property to QI, QI transfers the property to R, R delivers $2,100,000 to QI, and QI deposits $2,100,000 into a money market account with depository institution B under T's name and TIN. B and QI are members of the same consolidated group of corporations within the meaning of section 1501. Between May 1 and September 1, 2008, the account earns $28,000 of interest at the stated rate established by B. During the period May 1 to September 1, 2008, B invests T's exchange funds and earns $40,000. On September 1, 2008, QI uses $2,100,000 of the funds in the account to purchase replacement property identified by T and transfers the replacement property to T. B pays to T the $28,000 of interest earned on the money market account at the stated rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under paragraph (b) of this section, the $2,100,000 QI receives from R for the relinquished property is exchange funds and QI is an exchange facilitator. B is not an exchange facilitator. T has not entered into an escrow agreement, trust agreement, or exchange agreement with B, and QI, not B, holds the exchange funds on behalf of T. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the $40,000 B earns from investing T's exchange funds are not treated as earnings attributable to T's exchange funds. Because all the earnings attributable to T's exchange funds are paid to T in accordance with the exchange agreement, paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies. The exchange funds are not treated as loaned from T to QI, and T must take into account in computing T's income tax liability for 2008 the $28,000 of interest earned on the money market account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that at the end of each taxable year, B credits a portion of its earnings on deposits to QI. The amount credited is based on the total amount of exchange funds QI has deposited with B during the year. At the end of the 2008 taxable year, B credits $152,500 of B's earnings to QI.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, no part of the $152,500 credited by B to QI is earnings attributable to T's exchange funds. Therefore, all of the earnings attributable to the exchange funds are paid to T in accordance with the exchange agreement, and paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies. The exchange funds are not treated as loaned from T to QI, and T must take into account in computing T's income tax liability for 2008 the $28,000 of interest earned on T's account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that QI and B are unrelated and the money market account in which QI deposits the $2,100,000 received from T is a sub-account within a master account QI maintains with B in QI's name and TIN. The master account includes other sub-accounts, each in the name and TIN of a taxpayer that has entered into an exchange agreement with QI, into which QI deposits each taxpayer's exchange funds. Each month, B transfers to QI's master account an additional amount of interest based upon the average daily balance of all exchange funds within the master account during the month. At the end of the 2008 taxable year, B has credited $152,500 of additional interest to QI.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, no part of the $152,500 credited by B to QI is earnings attributable to T's exchange funds. Therefore, all of the earnings attributable to the exchange funds are paid

to T in accordance with the exchange agreement, and paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies. The exchange funds are not treated as loaned from T to QI, and T must take into account in computing T's income tax liability for 2008 the $28,000 of interest earned on T's account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that at the end of each taxable year, B pays a marketing fee to QI for using B as its depository institution for exchange funds. The amount of the fee is based on the total amount of exchange funds QI has deposited with B during the year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, no part of the marketing fee that B pays to QI is earnings attributable to T's exchange funds. Therefore, all of the earnings attributable to the exchange funds are paid to T in accordance with the exchange agreement, and paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies. The exchange funds are not treated as loaned from T to QI, and T must take into account in computing T's income tax liability for 2008 the $28,000 of interest earned on T's account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that the exchange agreement provides only that QI will pay T a stated rate of interest. QI invests the exchange funds and earns $40,000. The exchange funds earn $28,000 at the stated rate of interest, and QI pays the $28,000 to T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies and the exchange funds are treated as loaned from T to QI. QI must take into account in computing QI's income tax liability all items of income, deduction, and credit (including capital gains and losses) attributable to the exchange funds. Paragraph (c)(2) of this section does not apply because QI does not pay all the earnings attributable to the exchange funds to T. See Secs. 1.7872-5 and 1.7872-16 for rules relating to exchange facilitator loans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that the exchange agreement does not specify how the $2,100,000 QI receives from R must be invested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On May 1, 2008, QI deposits the $2,100,000 with B in a pre-existing interest-bearing account under QI's name and TIN. The account has a total balance of $5,275,000 immediately thereafter. On the last day of each month between May and September, 2008, the account earns interest as follows: $17,583 in May, $17,642 in June, $18,756 in July, and $17,472 in August.

The purchaser must take into account in computing the purchaser's income tax liability all items of income, deduction, and credit (including capital gains and losses) of the pre-closing escrow. In the case of an exchange with a single pre-closing escrow funded by two or more purchasers, each purchaser must take into account in computing the purchaser's income tax liability all items of income, deduction, and credit (including capital gains and losses) earned by the pre-closing escrow with respect to the money or property deposited in the pre-closing escrow by or on behalf of that purchaser.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Reporting obligations of the administrator. For each calendar year (or portion thereof) that a pre-closing escrow is in existence, the administrator must report the income of the pre-closing escrow on Form 1099 to the extent required by the information reporting provisions of subpart B, Part III, subchapter A, chapter 61, Subtitle F of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder.

Because a transferor-claimant is both a transferor and a claimant, generally the terms transferor and claimant also include a transferor-claimant.

For Federal income tax purposes, a disputed ownership fund is treated as the owner of all assets that it holds. A disputed ownership fund is treated as a C corporation for purposes of subtitle F of the Internal Revenue Code, and the administrator of the fund must obtain an employer identification number for the fund, make all required income tax and information returns, and deposit all tax payments.

A disputed ownership fund is treated as a C corporation for purposes of subtitle F of the Internal Revenue Code, and the administrator of the fund must obtain an employer identification number for the fund, make all required income tax and information returns, and deposit all tax payments. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a disputed ownership fund is taxable as--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A C corporation, unless all the assets transferred to the fund by or on behalf of transferors are passive investment assets. For purposes of this section, passive investment assets are assets of the type that generate portfolio income within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-2T(c)(3)(i); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A qualified settlement fund, if all the assets transferred to the fund by or on behalf of transferors are passive investment assets. A disputed ownership fund taxable as a qualified settlement fund under this section is subject to all the provisions contained in Sec. 1.468B-2, except that the rules contained in paragraphs (c)(3), (4), and (c)(5)(i) of this section apply in lieu of the rules in Sec. 1.468B-2(b)(1), (d), (e), (f) and (j).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions. (i) The claimants to a disputed ownership fund may submit a private letter ruling request proposing a method of taxation different than the method provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The claimants to a disputed ownership fund may submit a private letter ruling request proposing a method of taxation different than the method provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The trustee of a liquidating trust established pursuant to a plan confirmed by the court in a case under title 11 of the United States Code may, in the liquidating trust's first taxable year, elect to treat an escrow account, trust, or fund that holds assets of the liquidating trust that are subject to disputed claims as a disputed ownership fund. Pursuant to this election, creditors holding disputed claims are not treated as transferors of the money or property transferred to the disputed ownership fund. A trustee makes the election by attaching a statement to the timely filed Federal income tax return of the disputed ownership fund for the taxable year for which the election becomes effective. The election statement must include a statement that the trustee will treat the escrow account, trust, or fund as a disputed ownership fund and must include a legend, ``Sec. 1.468B-9(c) Election,'' at the top of the page. The election may be revoked only upon consent of the Commissioner by private letter ruling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Property received by the disputed ownership fund--(i) Generally excluded from income. In general, a disputed ownership fund does not include an amount in income on account of a transfer of disputed property to the disputed ownership fund.

Therefore, a disputed ownership fund must include in income all income received or accrued from the disputed property, including items such as--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Generally excluded from income. In general, a disputed ownership fund does not include an amount in income on account of a transfer of disputed property to the disputed ownership fund. However, the accrual or receipt of income from the disputed property in a disputed ownership fund is not a transfer of disputed property to the fund. Therefore, a disputed ownership fund must include in income all income received or accrued from the disputed property, including items such as--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Payments to a disputed ownership fund made in compensation for late or delayed transfers of money or property;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Dividends on stock of a transferor (or a related person) held by the fund; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Interest on debt of a transferor (or a related person) held by the fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Basis and holding period. In general, the initial basis of property transferred by, or on behalf of, a transferor to a disputed ownership fund is the fair market value of the property on the date of transfer to the fund, and the fund's holding period begins on the date of the transfer. However, if the transferor is a transferor-claimant, the fund's initial basis in the property is the same as the basis of the transferor-claimant immediately before the transfer to the fund, and the fund=s holding period for the property is determined under section 1223(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Property distributed by the disputed ownership fund--(i) Computing gain or loss. Except in the case of a distribution or deemed distribution described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, a disputed ownership fund must treat a distribution of disputed property as a sale or exchange of that property for purposes of section 1001(a). In computing gain or loss, the amount realized by the disputed ownership fund is the fair market value of that property on the date of distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Computing gain or loss. Except in the case of a distribution or deemed distribution described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, a disputed ownership fund must treat a distribution of disputed property as a sale or exchange of that property for purposes of section 1001(a). In computing gain or loss, the amount realized by the disputed ownership fund is the fair market value of that property on the date of distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Denial of deduction. A disputed ownership fund is not allowed a deduction for a distribution of disputed property or of the net after-tax income earned by the disputed ownership fund made to or on behalf of a transferor or claimant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Taxable year and accounting method. (i) A disputed ownership fund taxable as a C corporation under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section may compute taxable income under any accounting method allowable under section 446 and is not subject to the limitations contained in section 448. A disputed ownership fund taxable as a C corporation may use any taxable year allowable under section 441.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A disputed ownership fund taxable as a C corporation under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section may compute taxable income under any accounting method allowable under section 446 and is not subject to the limitations contained in section 448.

more than once or from omitting such items. For example, if a transferor that is not a transferor-claimant uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting and transfers an account receivable to a disputed ownership fund that uses an accrual method of accounting, at the time of the transfer of the account receivable to the disputed ownership fund, the transferor must include in its gross income the value of the account receivable because, under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the disputed ownership fund will take a fair market value basis in the receivable and will not include the fair market value in its income when received from the transferor or when paid by the customer. If the account receivable were transferred to the disputed ownership fund by a transferor-claimant using the cash receipts and disbursements method, however, the disputed ownership fund would take a basis in the receivable equal to the transferor's basis, or $0, and would be required to report the income upon collection of the account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Unused carryovers. Upon the termination of a disputed ownership fund, if the fund has an unused net operating loss carryover under section 172, an unused capital loss carryover under section 1212, or an unused tax credit carryover, or if the fund has, for its last taxable year, deductions in excess of gross income, the claimant to which the fund's net assets are distributable will succeed to and take into account the fund's unused net operating loss carryover, unused capital loss carryover, unused tax credit carryover, or excess of deductions over gross income for the last taxable year of the fund. If the fund's net assets are distributable to more than one claimant, the unused net operating loss carryover, unused capital loss carryover, unused tax credit carryover, or excess of deductions over gross income for the last taxable year must be allocated among the claimants in proportion to the value of the assets distributable to each claimant from the fund. Unused carryovers described in this paragraph (c)(6) are not money or other property for purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section and thus are not deemed transferred to a transferor-claimant before being transferred to the claimants described in this paragraph (c)(6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Rules applicable to transferors that are not transferor-claimants. The rules in this paragraph (d) apply to transferors (as defined in paragraph (b)(7) of this section) that are not transferor-claimants (as defined in paragraph (b)(8) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Transfer of property. A transferor must treat a transfer of property to a disputed ownership fund as a sale or other disposition of that property for purposes of section 1001(a). In computing the gain or loss on the disposition, the amount realized by the transferor is the fair market value of the property on the date the transfer is made to the disputed ownership fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Economic performance--(i) In general. For purposes of section 461(h), if a transferor using an accrual method of accounting has a liability for which economic performance would otherwise occur under Sec. 1.461-4(g) when the transferor makes payment to the claimant or claimants, economic performance occurs with respect to the liability when and to the extent that the transferor makes a transfer to a disputed ownership fund to resolve or satisfy that liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of section 461(h), if a transferor using an accrual method of accounting has a liability for which economic performance would otherwise occur under Sec. 1.461-4(g) when the transferor makes payment to the claimant or claimants, economic performance occurs with respect to the liability when and to the extent that the transferor makes a transfer to a disputed ownership fund to resolve or satisfy that liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Obligations of the transferor. Economic performance does not occur when a transferor using an accrual method of accounting issues to a disputed ownership fund its debt (or provides the debt of a related person). Instead, economic performance occurs as the transferor (or related person) makes principal payments on the debt. Economic performance does not occur when the transferor provides to a disputed ownership fund its obligation (or the obligation of a related person) to provide property or services in the future or to make a payment described in Sec. 1.461-4(g)(1)(ii)(A). Instead, economic performance occurs with respect to such an obligation as property or services are provided or payments are made to the disputed ownership fund or a claimant. With regard to interest on a debt issued or provided to a disputed ownership fund, economic performance occurs as determined under Sec. 1.461-4(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Distributions to transferors--(i) In general. Except as provided in section 111(a) and paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this

section, the transferor must include in gross income any distribution to the transferor (including a deemed distribution described in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section) from the disputed ownership fund. If property is distributed, the amount includible in gross income and the basis in that property are generally the fair market value of the property on the date of distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as provided in section 111(a) and paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this

section, the transferor must include in gross income any distribution to the transferor (including a deemed distribution described in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section) from the disputed ownership fund. If property is distributed, the amount includible in gross income and the basis in that property are generally the fair market value of the property on the date of distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exception. A transferor is not required to include in gross income a distribution of money or property that it previously transferred to the disputed ownership fund if the transferor did not take into account, for example, by deduction or capitalization, an amount with respect to the transfer either at the time of the transfer to, or while the money or property was held by, the disputed ownership fund. The transferor's gross income does not include a distribution of money from the disputed ownership fund equal to the net after-tax income earned on money or property transferred to the disputed ownership fund by the transferor while that money or property was held by the fund. Money distributed to a transferor by a disputed ownership fund will be deemed to be distributed first from the money or property transferred to the disputed ownership fund by that transferor, then from the net after-tax income of any money or property transferred to the disputed ownership fund by that transferor, and then from other sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Deemed distributions. If a disputed ownership fund makes a distribution of money or property on behalf of a transferor to a person that is not a claimant, the distribution is deemed made by the fund to the transferor. The transferor, in turn, is deemed to make a payment to the actual recipient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Rules applicable to transferor-claimants. The rules in this paragraph (e) apply to transferor-claimants (as defined in paragraph (b)(8) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Transfer of property. A transfer of property by a transferor-claimant to a disputed ownership fund is not a sale or other disposition of the property for purposes of section 1001(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Economic performance--(i) In general. For purposes of section 461(h), if a transferor-claimant using an accrual method of accounting has a liability for which economic performance would otherwise occur under Sec. 1.461-4(g) when the transferor-claimant makes payment to another claimant, economic performance occurs with respect to the liability when and to the extent that the disputed ownership fund transfers money or property to the other claimant to resolve or satisfy that liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of section 461(h), if a transferor-claimant using an accrual method of accounting has a liability for which economic performance would otherwise occur under Sec. 1.461-4(g) when the transferor-claimant makes payment to another claimant, economic performance occurs with respect to the liability when and to the extent that the disputed ownership fund transfers money or property to the other claimant to resolve or satisfy that liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Obligations of the transferor-claimant. Economic performance does not occur when a disputed ownership fund transfers the debt of a transferor-claimant (or of a person related to the transferor-claimant) to another claimant. Instead, economic performance occurs as principal payments on the debt are made to the other claimant. Economic performance does not occur when a disputed ownership fund transfers to another claimant the obligation of a transferor-claimant (or of a person related to the transferor-claimant) to provide property or services in the future or to make a payment described in Sec. 1.461-4(g)(1)(ii)(A). Instead, economic performance occurs with respect to such an obligation as property or services are provided or payments are made to the other claimant. With regard to interest on a debt issued or provided to a disputed ownership fund, economic performance occurs as determined under Sec. 1.461-4(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Distributions to transferor-claimants--(i) In general. The gross income of a transferor-claimant does not include a distribution to the transferor-claimant (including a deemed distribution described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section) of money or property from a disputed ownership fund that the transferor-claimant previously transferred to the fund, or the net after-tax income earned on that money or property while it was held by the fund. If such property is distributed to the transferor-claimant by the disputed ownership fund, then the transferor-claimant's basis in the property is the same as the disputed ownership fund's basis in the property immediately before the distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The gross income of a transferor-claimant does not include a distribution to the transferor-claimant (including a deemed distribution described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section) of money or property from a disputed ownership fund that the transferor-claimant previously transferred to the fund, or the net after-tax income earned on that money or property while it was held by the fund. If such property is distributed to the transferor-claimant by the disputed ownership fund, then the transferor-claimant's basis in the property is the same as the disputed ownership fund's basis in the property immediately before the distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Deemed distributions. If a disputed ownership fund makes a distribution of money or property to a claimant or

makes a distribution of money or property on behalf of a transferor-claimant to a person that is not a claimant, the distribution is deemed made by the fund to the transferor-claimant. The transferor-claimant, in turn, is deemed to make a payment to the actual recipient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Distributions to claimants other than transferor-claimants. Whether a claimant other than a transferor-claimant must include in gross income a distribution of money or property from a disputed ownership fund generally is determined by reference to the claim in respect of which the distribution is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Statement to the disputed ownership fund and the Internal Revenue Service with respect to transfers of property other than cash--(1) In general. By February 15 of the year following each calendar year in which a transferor (or other person acting on behalf of a transferor) makes a transfer of property other than cash to a disputed ownership fund, the transferor must provide a statement to the administrator of the fund setting forth the information described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section. The transferor must attach a copy of this statement to its return for the taxable year of transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. By February 15 of the year following each calendar year in which a transferor (or other person acting on behalf of a transferor) makes a transfer of property other than cash to a disputed ownership fund, the transferor must provide a statement to the administrator of the fund setting forth the information described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section. The transferor must attach a copy of this statement to its return for the taxable year of transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Combined statements. If a disputed ownership fund has more than one transferor, any two or more transferors may provide a combined statement to the administrator. If a combined statement is used, each transferor must attach a copy of the combined statement to its return and maintain with its books and records a schedule describing each asset that the transferor transferred to the disputed ownership fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Information required on the statement. The statement required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section must include the following information--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A legend, ``Sec. 1.468B-9 Statement,'' at the top of the first page;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The transferor's name, address, and taxpayer identification number;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The disputed ownership fund's name, address, and employer identification number;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A statement declaring whether the transferor is a transferor-claimant;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The date of each transfer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> A description of the property (other than cash) transferred; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The disputed ownership fund's basis in the property and holding period on the date of transfer as determined under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X Corporation petitions the United States Tax Court in 2006 for a redetermination of its tax liability for the 2003 taxable year. In 2006, the Tax Court determines that X Corporation is liable for an income tax deficiency for the 2003 taxable year. X Corporation files an appellate bond in accordance with section 7485(a) and files a notice of appeal with the appropriate United States Court of Appeals. In 2006, the Court of Appeals affirms the decision of the Tax Court and the United States Supreme Court denies X Corporation's petition for a writ of certiorari.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The appellate bond that X Corporation files with the court for the purpose of staying assessment and collection of deficiencies pending appeal is not an escrow account, trust or fund established to hold property subject to conflicting claims of ownership. Although X Corporation was found liable for an income tax deficiency, ownership of the appellate bond is not disputed. Rather, the bond serves as security for a disputed liability. Therefore, the bond is not a disputed ownership fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as Example 1, except that X Corporation deposits United States Treasury bonds with the Tax Court in accordance with section 7845(c)(2) and 31 U.S.C. 9303.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The deposit of United States Treasury bonds with the court for the purpose of staying assessment and collection of deficiencies while X Corporation prosecutes an appeal does not create a disputed ownership fund because ownership of the bonds is not disputed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Prior to A's death, A was the insured under a life insurance policy issued by X, an insurance company. X uses an accrual method of accounting. Both A's current spouse and A's former spouse claim to be the beneficiary under the policy and entitled to the policy proceeds ($1 million). In 2005, X files an interpleader action and deposits $1 million into the registry of the court. On June 1, 2006, a final determination is made that A's current spouse is the beneficiary under the policy and entitled to the money held in the registry of the court. The interest earned on the registry account is $12,000. The money in the registry account is distributed to A's current spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The money held in the registry of the court consisting of the policy proceeds and

the earnings thereon are a disputed ownership fund taxable as if it were a qualified settlement fund. See paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section. The fund's gross income does not include the $1 million transferred to the fund by X, however, the $12,000 interest is included in the fund's gross income in accordance with its method of accounting. See paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the fund is not allowed a deduction for a distribution to A's current spouse of the $1 million or the interest income earned by the fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> X is a transferor that is not a transferor-claimant. See paragraphs (b)(7) and (b)(8) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Whether A's current spouse must include in income the $1 million insurance proceeds and the interest received from the fund is determined under other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. See paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation B and unrelated individual C claim ownership of certain rental property. B uses an accrual method of accounting. The rental property is property used in a trade or business. B claims to have purchased the property from C's father. However, C asserts that the purported sale to B was ineffective and that C acquired ownership of the property through intestate succession upon the death of C's father. For several years, B has maintained and received the rent from the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pending the resolution of the title dispute between B and C, the title to the rental property is transferred to a court-supervised registry account on February 1, 2005. On that date the court appoints R as receiver for the property. R collects the rent earned on the property and hires employees necessary for the maintenance of the property. The rents paid to R cannot be distributed to B or C without the court's approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> On June 1, 2006, the court makes a final determination that the rental property is owned by C. The court orders C to refund to B the purchase price paid by B to C's father plus interest on that amount from February 1, 2005. The court also orders that a distribution be made to C of all funds held in the court registry consisting of the rent collected by R and the income earned thereon. C takes title to the rental property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The rental property and the funds held by the court registry are a disputed ownership fund under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The fund is taxable as if it were a C corporation because the rental property is not a passive investment asset within the meaning of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The fund's gross income does not include the value of the rental property transferred to the fund by B. See paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section. Under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the fund's initial basis in the property is the same as B's adjusted basis immediately before the transfer to the fund and the fund's holding period is determined under section 1223(2). The fund's gross income includes the rents collected by R and any income earned thereon. For the period between February 1, 2005, and June 1, 2006, the fund may be allowed deductions for depreciation and for the costs of maintenance of the property because the fund is treated as owning the property during this period. See sections 162, 167, and 168. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the fund may not deduct the distribution to C of the property, or the rents (or any income earned thereon) collected from the property while the fund holds the property. No gain or loss is recognized by the fund from this distribution or from the fund's transfer of the rental property to C pursuant to the court's determination that C owns the property. See paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (e)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> B is the transferor to the fund. Under paragraphs (b)(8) and (e)(1) of this section, B is a transferor-claimant and does not recognize gain or loss under section 1001(a) on transfer of the property to the disputed ownership fund. The money and property distributed from the fund to C is deemed to be distributed first to B and then transferred from B to C. See paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section. Under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, economic performance occurs when the disputed ownership fund transfers the property and any earnings thereon to C. The income tax consequences of the deemed transfer from B to C as well as the income tax consequences of C's refund to B of the purchase price paid to C's father and interest thereon are determined under other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Effective dates--(1) In general. This section applies to disputed ownership funds established after February 3, 2006.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. This section applies to disputed ownership funds established after February 3, 2006.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transition rule. With respect to a disputed ownership fund established after August 16, 1986, but on or before February 3, 2006, the Internal Revenue Service will not challenge a reasonable, consistently applied method of taxation for income earned by the fund, transfers to the fund, and distributions made by the fund.
