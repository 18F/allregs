                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Comparability of PM 2.5 data. The primary and secondary annual and 24-hour PM 2.5 NAAQS are described in part 50 of this chapter. Monitors that follow the network technical requirements specified in Sec. 58.11 are eligible for comparison to the NAAQS subject to the additional requirements of this section. PM 2.5 measurement data from all eligible monitors are comparable to the 24-hour PM 2.5 NAAQS. PM 2.5 measurement data from all eligible monitors that are representative of area-wide air quality are comparable to the annual PM 2.5 NAAQS. Consistent with appendix D to this part, section 4.7.1, when micro- or middle-scale PM 2.5 monitoring sites collectively identify a larger region of localized high ambient PM 2.5 concentrations, such sites would be considered representative of an area-wide location and, therefore, eligible for comparison to the annual PM 2.5 NAAQS. PM 2.5 measurement data from monitors that are not representative of area-wide air quality but rather of relatively unique micro-scale, or localized hot spot, or unique middle-scale impact sites are not eligible for comparison to the annual PM 2.5 NAAQS. PM 2.5 measurement data from these monitors are eligible for comparison to the 24-hour PM 2.5 NAAQS. For example, if a micro- or middle-scale PM 2.5 monitoring site is adjacent to a unique dominating local PM 2.5 source, then the PM 2.5 measurement data from such a site would only be eligible for comparison to the 24-hour PM 2.5 NAAQS. Approval of sites that are suitable and sites that are not suitable for comparison with the annual PM 2.5 NAAQS is provided for as part of the annual monitoring network plan described in Sec. 58.10.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]
