                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. For purposes of Sec. Sec. 301.6334-2 and 301.6334- 3, the amount of wages, salary, or other income that is exempt from levy  must be determined on the basis of a written and properly verified  statement submitted by the taxpayer to his or her employer for  submission to the district director specifying the facts necessary to  determine the standard deduction and the aggregate amount of the  deductions for personal exemptions allowed the taxpayer under section  151 in the taxable year in which the levy is served. In the absence of  submission of such statement, the amount that is exempt from levy must  be determined as if the taxpayer were a married individual filing a  separate return with only 1 personal exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Content of statement. The statement in paragraph (a) of this  section must be a written statement signed under penalty of perjury, and  dated, containing the following information--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The filing status of the taxpayer as either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Single;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Married filing a joint return;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Married filing a separate return;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Head of household; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Qualifying widow or widower with dependent child;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The name, relationship, and Social Security Number of each  individual whom the taxpayer can claim as a personal exemption on the  taxpayer's income tax return; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any additional standard deductions that the taxpayer can claim  on account of age (65 or older) or blindness on the taxpayer's income  tax return.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Submission of verified statement--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Obligation of employer. An  employer upon whom a notice of levy for wages, salary, or other income  of a taxpayer is served must promptly notify the taxpayer of the fact  that a notice of levy has been served. Unless otherwise indicated on the  face of the notice of levy, the employer must request the taxpayer to  provide the employer with a written statement signed under penalty of  perjury, and dated, containing   the information set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, and this  statement must be submitted by the employer to the district director.  The employer must submit this statement to the district director at the  time the employer first responds to the notice of levy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Submission by taxpayer. The taxpayer must provide the employer  upon whom the notice of levy has been served with a verified statement  complying with paragraph (b) of this section. Unless the taxpayer  provides a verified statement, the amount that is exempt from levy must  be determined as if the taxpayer were a married individual filing a  separate return with only 1 personal exemption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Additional statements. A taxpayer may submit a verified  statement to his or her employer at any time. Except as otherwise  provided in paragraph (d) of this section, such verified statement will  be effective for any payment of wages, salary, or other income made  after the date of submission and will replace any previously submitted  verified statement. The employer must provide the district director with  the statement on the next occasion on which the employer responds to the  notice of levy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effect of verified statement--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A verified statement submitted  by an employee is effective upon receipt by the employer, and the  employer is required to compute the exempt amount on the basis of the  information contained in the verified statement unless notified to the  contrary by the Internal Revenue Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Internal Revenue Service may find that a verified statement  submitted by an employee contains a materially incorrect statement, or  it may determine, after written request to the employee for verification  of information contained in the verified statement, that it lacks  sufficient information to determine whether the verified statement is  correct. If the Internal Revenue Service so finds or determines, and  notifies the employer in writing that the verified statement is  defective, upon receipt of such notice the employer shall consider the  verified statement to be defective for purposes of computing the exempt  amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Internal Revenue Service notifies the employer that the  verified statement is defective, the Internal Revenue Service will,  based upon its finding, advise the employer that the employer is to  compute the exempt amount as if no verified statement had been submitted  by the employee or will describe upon what basis the exempt amount is to  be computed. The Internal Revenue Service will also specify which  Internal Revenue Service office to contact for further information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In addition to any notice furnished to the employer for the  employer's use, the Internal Revenue Service will provide the employer  with a copy for the employee of each notice it furnishes the employer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The employer must promptly furnish the employee with a copy of  any Internal Revenue Service notice with respect to a verified statement  submitted by the employee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Once paragraph (d)(3) of this section applies, the employer must  continue to compute the exempt amount on the basis of the written notice  from the Internal Revenue Service until the Internal Revenue Service by  written notice advises the employer to compute the exempt amount on the  basis of a new verified statement (as described in paragraph (d)(7) of  this section) and revokes its earlier written notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Once paragraph (d)(3) of this section applies, the employee may  submit a new verified statement together with a written explanation of  any circumstances of the employee which have changed since the Internal  Revenue Service's earlier written notice, or any other circumstances or  reasons as justification or support for the claims made by the employee  on the new verified statement. The employee may submit the new verified  statement and written explanation either--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To the Internal Revenue Service office specified in the notice  furnished to the employer under paragraph (d)(3) of this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To the employer, who must forward the new verified statement  and written explanation to the Internal Revenue Service office specified  in the notice earlier furnished to the employer on the next occasion on  which   the employer responds to the notice of levy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effective date. These provisions are effective with respect to  levies made on or after July 1, 1989. However, any reasonable attempt by  a taxpayer to comply with the statutory amendments addressed by these  regulations prior to February 21, 1995 will be considered as meeting the  requirements of these regulations.
