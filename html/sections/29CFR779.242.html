                                Sec. 779.242  Goods that ``have been moved in'' commerce.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">For the purpose of section 3(s), goods will be considered to ``have been moved * * * in commerce'' when they have moved across State lines before they are handled, sold, or otherwise worked on by the employees. It is immaterial in such a case that the goods may have ``come to rest'' within the meaning of the term ``in commerce'' as interpreted in other respects, before they are handled, sold, or otherwise worked on by the employees in the enterprise. Such movement in commerce may take place before they have reached the enterprise, or within the enterprise, such as from a warehouse of the enterprise in one State to a retail store of the same enterprise located in another State. Thus, employees will be considered to be ``handling, selling, or otherwise working on goods that have been moved in * * * commerce'' where they are engaged in the described activities on ``goods'' that have moved across State lines at any time in the course of business, such as from the manufacturer to the distributor, or to the ``enterprise,'' or from one establishment to another within the ``enterprise.'' See the general discussion in part 776 of this chapter.</p>
