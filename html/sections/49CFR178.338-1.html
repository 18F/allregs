For the purpose of this specification, tank means inner vessel

and jacket means either the outer shell or insulation cover.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each tank must be designed, constructed, certified, and stamped in accordance with Section VIII of the ASME Code.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The exterior surface of the tank must be insulated with a material compatible with the lading.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each cargo tank must have an insulation system that will prevent the tank pressure from exceeding the pressure relief valve set pressure within the specified holding time when the tank is loaded with the specific cryogenic liquid at the design conditions of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The specified temperature and pressure of the cryogenic liquid, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The exposure of the filled cargo tank to an average ambient temperature of 85 F.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For a cargo tank used to transport oxygen, the insulation may not sustain combustion in a 99.5 percent oxygen atmosphere at atmospheric pressure when contacted with a continuously heated glowing platinum wire. The cargo tank must be marked in accordance with Sec. 178.338-18(b)(7).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each vacuum-insulated cargo tank must be provided with a connection for a vacuum gauge to indicate the absolute pressure within the insulation space.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The insulation must be completely covered by a metal jacket. The jacket or the insulation must be so constructed and sealed as to prevent moisture from coming into contact with the insulation (see Sec. 173.318(a)(3) of this subchapter).
