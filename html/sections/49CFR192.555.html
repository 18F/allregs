is safe and consistent with the requirements of this part; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Make any repairs, replacements, or alterations in the segment of pipeline that are necessary for safe operation at the increased pressure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> After complying with paragraph (b) of this section, an operator may increase the maximum allowable operating pressure of a segment of pipeline constructed before September 12, 1970, to the highest pressure that is permitted under Sec. 192.619, using as test pressure the highest pressure to which the segment of pipeline was previously subjected (either in a strength test or in actual operation).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> After complying with paragraph (b) of this section, an operator that does not qualify under paragraph (c) of this section may increase the previously established maximum allowable operating pressure if at least one of the following requirements is met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The segment of pipeline is successfully tested in accordance with the requirements of this part for a new line of the same material in the same location.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An increased maximum allowable operating pressure may be established for a segment of pipeline in a Class 1 location if the line has not previously been tested, and if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It is impractical to test it in accordance with the requirements of this part;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The new maximum operating pressure does not exceed 80 percent of that allowed for a new line of the same design in the same location; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The operator determines that the new maximum allowable operating pressure is consistent with the condition of the segment of pipeline and the design requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Where a segment of pipeline is uprated in accordance with paragraph (c) or (d)(2) of this section, the increase in pressure must be made in increments that are equal to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 10 percent of the pressure before the uprating; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 25 percent of the total pressure increase,
