                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> (2) and (3) of the Code. The adjustments required by subsection  (d) of the Act are set forth in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adjustment for depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913--(1)  In general. Subsection (d)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of the Act requires an adjustment to be  made as of the 1956 adjustment date for depreciation sustained before  March 1, 1913, on all retirement-straight line property held on March 1,  1913, by the taxpayer or a predecessor for which cost was or is claimed  as basis and which was either (i) retired before the changeover date by  the taxpayer or a predecessor or (ii) held on the changeover date by the  taxpayer or a predecessor. This adjustment for depreciation sustained  before March 1, 1913, shall be made in accordance with the conditions  and limitations described in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph  and shall be allocated, in the manner prescribed in subparagraph (4) of  this paragraph, among all retirement-straight line property held by the  taxpayer on its 1956 adjustment date. The term ``cost'', when used in  this paragraph with reference to the basis of property, shall be  construed to mean the amount paid for the property or, if that amount  could not be determined, then such other amount as was accepted by the  Commissioner as ``cost'' for basis purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Depreciation sustained on property retired before the changeover  date. Pursuant to subsection (d)(1)(A) of the Act, an adjustment to the  basis of retirement-straight line property held by the taxpayer on its  1956 adjustment date shall be made as of that date for depreciation  sustained before March 1, 1913, on all retirement-straight line property  held on March 1, 1913, by the taxpayer or a predecessor for which cost  was claimed as the basis and which was retired before the changeover  date by the taxpayer or a predecessor, except that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The adjustment shall be made only if a deduction was allowed in  computing net income by reason of the retirement and the deduction so  allowed was computed on the basis of the cost of the property unadjusted  for depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of any such property retired during any taxable  year beginning after December 31, 1929, the adjustment shall not exceed  that portion of the amount attributable to depreciation sustained before  March 1, 1913, which resulted, by reason of the deduction so allowed, in  a reduction of taxes under the Code or under prior income, war-profits  or excess-profits tax laws.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Depreciation sustained on property held on the changeover date.  Pursuant to subsection (d)(1)(B) of the Act, an adjustment to the basis  of retirement-straight line property held by the taxpayer on its 1956  adjustment date shall be made as of that date for depreciation sustained  before March 1, 1913, on all retirement-straight line property held on  March 1, 1913, by the taxpayer or a predecessor for which cost was or is  claimed as basis and which was held on the changeover date by the  taxpayer or a predecessor. This subparagraph shall not apply, however,  to any such property which (i) was disposed of on or after the  changeover date by reason of sale, casualty, or abnormal retirement in  the nature of special obsolescence, and (ii) is property to which  paragraph (c) of this section and subsection (d)(2) of the Act apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Manner of allocating adjustment. Pursuant to subsection (d)(1)  of the Act, the amount of the adjustment required under this paragraph  for depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913, which is attributable  to a particular kind or class of retirement-straight line property held  by the taxpayer on its 1956 adjustment date shall be made with respect  to that kind or class of such property. If the adjustment required under  this paragraph for depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913, is  attributable to retirement-straight property of a particular kind or  class no longer held by the taxpayer on its 1956 adjustment date, then  the part of the adjustment to be allocated to any retirement-straight  line property held by the taxpayer on its 1956 adjustment date shall be  that amount which bears the same ratio to the adjustment as the  unadjusted basis of the property so held bears to the entire unadjusted  basis of all retirement-straight line property held by the taxpayer on  its 1956 adjustment date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Adjustment for part of terms-letter reserve applicable to  property disposed of on or after changeover date and before 1956  adjustment date. Pursuant to subsection (d)(2) of the Act, an adjustment  to the basis of retirement-straight line property held by the taxpayer  on its 1956 adjustment date shall be made as of that date for that part  of the terms-letter reserve which was applicable to any retirement- straight line property disposed of by sale, casualty, or abnormal  retirement in the nature of special obsolescence, but only if the sale  occurred in, or a deduction by reason of such casualty or abnormal  retirement was allowed for Federal income-tax purposes for a period on  or after the changeover date and before the taxpayer's 1956 adjustment  date. This paragraph shall apply even though, in computing the adjusted  basis of the property for purposes of determining gain or loss on the  sale, casualty, or abnormal retirement, the basis of the retirement- straight line property was not reduced by the part of the terms-letter  reserve applicable to the property. If necessary, the adjustment  required by this paragraph shall be allocated, in the manner prescribed  in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, among all retirement-straight line  property held by the taxpayer on its 1956 adjustment date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(3)</em> of the Act, an adjustment to the  basis of retirement-straight line property held by the taxpayer on its  1956 adjustment date shall be made as of that date for the entire amount  of depreciation allowable under the terms-letter for all periods on and  after the changeover date and before the taxpayer's 1956 adjustment  date. This adjustment shall include all such depreciation allowable with  respect to any retirement-straight line   property which was disposed of on or after the changeover date and  before the 1956 adjustment date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Illustration of basis adjustments required for taxable years  beginning on or after the 1956 adjustment date. The application of this  section may be illustrated by the following example, which is based upon  the assumption that multiple asset accounts are used:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Assume that on its changeover date, January 1, 1943,  the taxpayer or its predecessor held retirement-straight line property  with an unadjusted cost basis of $10,000. The terms-letter reserve  established as of January 1, 1943, with respect to such property was  $3,000. Depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913, on retirement- straight line property held on that date by the taxpayer or its  predecessor, for which cost was or is claimed as basis, amounts to $800.  Of this total depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913, $200 is  attributable to retirement-straight line property retired before January  1, 1943, under circumstances requiring the adjustment under paragraph  (b)(2) of this section, and $600 is attributable to retirement-straight  line property held on January 1, 1943, by the taxpayer or its  predecessor. On December 31, 1954, retirement-straight line property  costing $1,500 was permanently retired under circumstances giving rise  to an abnormal retirement in the nature of special obsolescence. The  terms-letter reserve applicable to this retired property was $450, of  which $120 represents depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913. On  December 31, 1954, retirement-straight line property costing $1,000 was  also permanently retired under circumstances giving rise to a normal  retirement. None of the property retired on December 31, 1954, had any  market or salvage value on that date. Depreciation allowable under the  terms-letter on retirement-straight line property for all periods on and  after January 1, 1943, and before January 1, 1956 (the taxpayer's 1956  adjustment date), amounts to $2,155, of which $345 is applicable to the  property retired as an abnormal retirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The reserve for depreciation as of January 1, 1956, contains a
