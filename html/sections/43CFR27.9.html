                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. If there appears to be a failure or refusal of any recipient, contractor, or subcontractor to observe or comply substantially with section 403 of Public Law 93-153, or implementing rules, regulations, and orders, compliance may be effected through the use of conciliation conferences, informal hearings, and procedures to cause termination or suspension of or refusal to grant or to continue the permit, or other Federal authorization to which this part applies, or of the contracts to which this part applies, or by any other means authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States or any assurance or other contractural undertaking, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any applicable proceeding under State or local law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Noncompliance with Sec. 27.4. In the event that a recipient fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under Sec. 27.4, or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section the failure or refusal may, at the option of the Secretary, be grounds for authorizing proceedings to cause refusal of the Federal authorization in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. The Department of the Interior shall not be required to provide the authorization in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue the Federal authorization--(1) General. In those instances where a recipient fails or refuses to observe or comply substantially with section 403 of Public Law 93-153 or implementing rules, regulations, and orders, noncompliance at the option of the Secretary, may be grounds for termination, suspension, refusal to grant or continue the Federal authorization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. In those instances where a recipient fails or refuses to observe or comply substantially with section 403 of Public Law 93-153 or implementing rules, regulations, and orders, noncompliance at the option of the Secretary, may be grounds for termination, suspension, refusal to grant or continue the Federal authorization.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Recommendation to proceed. The Department Compliance Officer may request that the Secretary commence procedures to suspend, terminate, or refuse to grant or continue the Federal authorization or to cause such suspension, termination, or refusal to grant. He shall indicate the specific grounds for alleging noncompliance with section 403 and implementing rules, regulations, and orders, the actions which would create compliance, and the time necessary to achieve compliance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Commencement of proceedings. Before the Secretary authorizes the commencement of an administrative proceeding for termination, suspension, or refusal to grant any Federal authorization to which this part applies, the Secretary or his designee shall give the recipient notice in writing of the alleged ground or grounds for termination or formal suspension, or refusal to grant, with sufficient particularity to enable the recipient to comply with section 403 of Public Law 93-153 and implementing rules, regulations and orders. The recipient shall have sixty (60) days from the date of delivery of the notice within which to comply. If compliance cannot be achieved in sixty (60) days, the recipient shall be entitled to additional time if he demonstrates that compliance is not possible within the sixty (60) day period and that the necessary curative actions were undertaken promptly and have been diligently prosecuted toward completion; Provided further that the aforesaid additional time shall not exceed ninety (90) days from the last day of the said sixty (60) day period, without the prior written consent of the Secretary or his designee which shall specify the last day upon which the curative action must be completed to the satisfaction of the Secretary or his designee.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Opportunity for a hearing. No order suspending, terminating or refusing to grant or continue any Federal authorization to which this part applies shall become effective until there has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for a formal hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply substantially with section 403 of Public Law 93-153 or implementing rules, regulations, and orders and the action has been approved by the Secretary pursuant to Sec. 27.11(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other means authorized by law. No action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) the action has been approved by the Secretary, (2) the recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance, and (3) the expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the recipient or other person. During this period of at least 10 days additional efforts shall be made to persuade the recipient or other person to comply and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate.</p>
