                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of calculating risk-weighted assets under subparts D and E of this part:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Cleared transaction. In order to recognize certain exposures as cleared transactions pursuant to paragraphs (1)(ii), (iii), or (iv) of the definition of ``cleared transaction'' in Sec. 324.2, the exposures must meet the applicable requirements set forth in this paragraph (a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The offsetting transaction must be identified by the CCP as a transaction for the clearing member client.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The collateral supporting the transaction must be held in a manner that prevents the FDIC-supervised institution from facing any loss due to an event of default, including from a liquidation, receivership, insolvency, or similar proceeding of either the clearing member or the clearing member's other clients. Omnibus accounts established under 17 CFR parts 190 and 300 satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The FDIC-supervised institution must conduct sufficient legal review to conclude with a well-founded basis (and maintain sufficient written documentation of that legal review) that in the event of a legal challenge (including one resulting from a default or receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding) the relevant court and administrative authorities would find the arrangements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section to be legal, valid, binding and enforceable under the law of the relevant jurisdictions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The offsetting transaction with a clearing member must be transferable under the transaction documents and applicable laws in the relevant jurisdiction(s) to another clearing member should the clearing member default, become insolvent, or enter receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligible margin loan. In order to recognize an exposure as an eligible margin loan as defined in Sec. 324.2, an FDIC-supervised institution must conduct sufficient legal review to conclude with a well-founded basis (and maintain sufficient written documentation of that legal review) that the agreement underlying the exposure:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Meets the requirements of paragraph (1)(iii) of the definition of eligible margin loan in Sec. 324.2, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is legal, valid, binding, and enforceable under applicable law in the relevant jurisdictions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Qualifying cross-product master netting agreement. In order to recognize an agreement as a qualifying cross-product master netting agreement as defined in Sec. 324.101, an FDIC-supervised institution must obtain a written legal

opinion verifying the validity and enforceability of the agreement under applicable law of the relevant jurisdictions if the counterparty fails to perform upon an event of default, including upon receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Qualifying master netting agreement. In order to recognize an agreement as a qualifying master netting agreement as defined in Sec. 324.2, an FDIC-supervised institution must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conduct sufficient legal review to conclude with a well-founded basis (and maintain sufficient written documentation of that legal review) that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The agreement meets the requirements of paragraph (2) of the definition of qualifying master netting agreement in Sec. 324.2; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the event of a legal challenge (including one resulting from default or from receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding) the relevant court and administrative authorities would find the agreement to be legal, valid, binding, and enforceable under the law of the relevant jurisdictions; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Establish and maintain written procedures to monitor possible changes in relevant law and to ensure that the agreement continues to satisfy the requirements of the definition of qualifying master netting agreement in Sec. 324.2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Repo-style transaction. In order to recognize an exposure as a repo-style transaction as defined in Sec. 324.2, an FDIC-supervised institution must conduct sufficient legal review to conclude with a well-founded basis (and maintain sufficient written documentation of that legal review) that the agreement underlying the exposure:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Meets the requirements of paragraph (3) of the definition of repo-style transaction in Sec. 324.2, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is legal, valid, binding, and enforceable under applicable law in the relevant jurisdictions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Failure of a QCCP to satisfy the rule's requirements. If an FDIC-supervised institution determines that a CCP ceases to be a QCCP due to the failure of the CCP to satisfy one or more of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (2)(i) through (2)(iii) of the definition of a QCCP in Sec. 324.2, the FDIC-supervised institution may continue to treat the CCP as a QCCP for up to three months following the determination. If the CCP fails to remedy the relevant deficiency within three months after the initial determination, or the CCP fails to satisfy the requirements set forth in paragraphs (2)(i) through (2)(iii) of the definition of a QCCP continuously for a three-month period after remedying the relevant deficiency, an FDIC-supervised institution may not treat the CCP as a QCCP for the purposes of this part until after the FDIC-supervised institution has determined that the CCP has satisfied the requirements in paragraphs (2)(i) through (2)(iii) of the definition of a QCCP for three continuous months.
