                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Subject to paragraph (k) of this section governing Accelerated  Docket proceedings, any carrier upon which a copy of a formal complaint  is served shall answer such complaint in the manner prescribed under  this section within twenty days of service of the formal complaint by  the complainant, unless otherwise directed by the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The answer shall advise the complainant and the Commission fully  and completely of the nature of any defense, and shall respond  specifically to all material allegations of the complaint. Every effort  shall be made to narrow the issues in the answer. The defendant shall  state concisely its defense to each claim asserted, admit or deny the  averments on which the complainant relies, and state in detail the basis  for admitting or denying such averment. General denials are prohibited.  Denials based on information and belief are expressly prohibited unless  made in good faith and accompanied by an affidavit explaining the basis  for the defendant's belief and why the defendant could not reasonably  ascertain the facts from the complainant or any other source. If the  defendant is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a  belief as to the truth of an averment, the defendant shall so state and  this has the effect of a denial. When a defendant intends in good faith  to deny only part of an averment, the defendant shall specify so much of  it as is true and shall deny only the remainder. The defendant may deny  the allegations of the complaint as specific denials of either  designated averments or paragraphs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The answer shall contain proposed findings of fact, conclusions  of law, and legal analysis relevant to the claims and arguments set  forth in the answer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Averments in a complaint or supplemental complaint filed  pursuant to Sec. 1.722 are deemed to be admitted when not denied in the  answer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Affirmative defenses to allegations contained in the complaint  shall be specifically captioned as such and presented separately from  any denials made in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The answer shall include an information designation containing:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name, address, and position of each individual believed to  have firsthand knowledge of the facts alleged with particularity in the  answer, along with a description of the facts within any such  individual's knowledge;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of all documents, data compilations and tangible  things in the defendant's possession, custody, or control, that are  relevant to the facts alleged with particularity in the answer. Such  description shall include for each document:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date it was prepared, mailed, transmitted, or otherwise  disseminated;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The author, preparer, or other source;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The recipient(s) or intended recipient(s);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Its physical location; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A description of its relevance to the matters in dispute.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A complete description of the manner in which the defendant  identified all persons with information and designated all documents,  data compilations and tangible things as being relevant to the dispute,  including, but not limited to, identifying the individual(s) that  conducted the information search and the criteria used to identify such  persons, documents, data compilations, tangible things, and information;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The answer shall attach copies of all affidavits, documents,  data compilations and tangible things in the defendant's possession,  custody, or control, upon which the defendant relies or   intends to rely to support the facts alleged and legal arguments made in  the answer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The answer shall contain certification that the defendant has,  in good faith, discussed or attempted to discuss, the possibility of  settlement with the complainant prior to the filing of the formal  complaint. Such certification shall include a brief summary of all steps  taken to resolve the dispute prior to the filing of the formal  complaint. If no such steps were taken, such certificate shall state the  reason(s) why the defendant believed such steps would be fruitless;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Where the complaint is filed pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 271(d)(6)(B),  the defendant shall clearly indicate its willingness to waive the 90-day  resolution deadline contained within 47 U.S.C. 271(d)(6)(B), in  accordance with the requirements of Sec. 1.736.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The defendant may petition the staff, pursuant to Sec. 1.3, for  a waiver of any of the requirements of this section. Such waiver may be  granted for good cause shown.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em>, the term document also shall include data compilations  and tangible things.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any party named as a defendant in an Accelerated Docket formal  complaint shall answer such complaint in the manner prescribed under  this section within ten days of service of the complaint by the  complainant, unless otherwise directed by the Commission. Except as set  forth in this paragraph (k), answers in Accelerated Docket proceedings  shall comply with the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The requirement in Sec. 1.720(c) and paragraph (g) of this  section that factual assertions be supported by affidavit shall not  apply to answers in Accelerated Docket proceedings. Nevertheless,  allegations of material fact, whether based on personal knowledge or  information and belief, that cannot be supported by documentation remain  subject to the provisions of Sec. 1.52.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Answers on the Accelerated Docket are not required to include  proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and legal analysis  relevant to the defenses and arguments set forth in the answer, as  required in paragraph (c) of this section. Nevertheless, answers on the  Accelerated Docket shall fully set out the facts and legal theories on  which the defendant premises its defenses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In light of the requirement for staff-supervised settlement  negotiations required in Sec. 1.730(b), answers on the Accelerated  Docket are not required to include a certification that the defendant  has discussed, or attempted to discuss, the possibility of settlement  with the complainant, as required in paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> As required in Sec. 1.729(i)(1), answers on the Accelerated  Docket shall be accompanied, when served on complainants, by copies of  documents, within the defendant's possession, custody or control, that  are likely to bear significantly on the issues raised in the proceeding.  Unless otherwise directed, these documents shall not be filed with the  Commission. In light of this automatic document production requirement,  answers on the Accelerated Docket are not required to include a  description of all relevant documents in the defendant's possession,  custody or control, as required in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Answers on the Accelerated Docket are not required to provide  the description, required in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, of the  manner in which the defendant identified persons with knowledge of, and  documents relevant to, the dispute.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> In Accelerated Docket proceedings, the defendant, as required in  Sec. 1.729(i)(1), shall serve, contemporaneously with its answer, the  complainant(s) with copies of documents, within the defendant's  possession, custody or control, that are likely to bear significantly on  the issues raised in the complaint and/or the answer.
