The amount of insurance must be at least equal to the lesser of the outstanding principal balance of the designated loan or the maximum limit of coverage available for the particular type of property under the Act. Flood insurance coverage under the Act is limited to the building or mobile home and any personal property that secures a loan and not the land itself.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Table funded loans. A member bank that acquires a loan from a mortgage broker or other entity through table funding shall be considered to be making a loan for the purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Exemptions.

For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> ``A structure that is a part of a residential property'' is a structure used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and not used primarily for agricultural, commercial, industrial, or other business purposes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A structure is ``detached'' from the primary residential structure if it is not joined by any structural connection to that structure; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> ``Serve as a residence'' shall be based upon the good faith determination of the member bank that the structure is intended for use or actually used as a residence, which generally includes sleeping, bathroom, or kitchen facilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Escrow requirement--(1) In general--(i) Applicability. Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) or (e)(3) of this section, a member bank, or a servicer acting on its behalf, shall require the escrow of all premiums and fees for any flood insurance required under paragraph (c) of this section for any designated loan secured by residential improved real estate or a mobile home that is made, increased, extended, or renewed on or after January 1, 2016, payable with the same frequency as payments on the designated loan are required to be made for the duration of the loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exceptions. Paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section does not apply if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The loan is an extension of credit primarily for business, commercial, or agricultural purposes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The loan is in a subordinate position to a senior lien secured by the same residential improved real estate or mobile home for which the borrower has obtained flood insurance coverage that meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Flood insurance coverage for the residential improved real estate or mobile home is provided by a policy that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Is provided by a condominium association, cooperative, homeowners association, or other applicable group; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The premium for which is paid by the condominium association, cooperative, homeowners association, or other applicable group as a common expense;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The loan is a home equity line of credit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The loan is a nonperforming loan, which is a loan that is 90 or more days past due and remains nonperforming until it is permanently modified or until the entire amount past due, including principal, accrued interest, and penalty interest incurred as the result of past due status, is collected or otherwise discharged in full; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The loan has a term of not longer than 12 months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Duration of exception. If a member bank, or a servicer acting on behalf of the bank, determines at any time during the term of a designated loan secured by residential improved real estate or a mobile home that is made, increased, extended, or renewed on or after January 1, 2016, that an exception under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section does not apply, then the bank or its servicer shall require the escrow of all premiums and fees for any flood insurance required under paragraph (c) of this section as soon as reasonably practicable and, if applicable, shall provide any disclosure required under section 10 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (12 U.S.C. 2609) (RESPA).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Escrow account. The member bank, or a servicer acting on its behalf, shall deposit the flood insurance premiums and fees on behalf of the borrower in an escrow account. This escrow account will be subject to escrow requirements adopted pursuant to section 10 of RESPA, which generally limits the amount that may be maintained in escrow accounts for certain types of loans and requires escrow account statements for those accounts, only if the loan is otherwise subject to RESPA. Following receipt of a notice from the Administrator of FEMA or other provider of flood insurance that premiums are due, the member bank, or a servicer acting on its behalf, shall pay the amount owed to the insurance provider from the escrow account by the date when such premiums are due.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notice. For any loan for which a member bank is required to escrow under paragraphs (e)(1) or (e)(3)(ii) of this section or may be required to escrow under paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section during the term of the loan, the member bank, or a servicer acting on its behalf, shall mail or deliver a written notice with the notice provided under paragraph (i) of this section informing the borrower that the member bank is required to escrow all premiums and fees for required flood insurance, using language that is substantially similar to model clauses on the escrow requirement in appendix A to this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Small lender exception--(i) Qualification. Except as may be required under applicable State law, paragraphs (e)(1), (2), and (4) of this section do not apply to a member bank:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> That has total assets of less than $1 billion as of December 31 of either of the two prior calendar years; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> On or before July 6, 2012:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Was not required under Federal or State law to deposit taxes, insurance premiums, fees, or any other charges in an escrow account for the entire term of any loan secured by residential improved real estate or a mobile home; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Did not have a policy of consistently and uniformly requiring the deposit of taxes, insurance premiums, fees, or any other charges in an escrow account for any loans secured by residential improved real estate or a mobile home.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Change in status. If a member bank previously qualified for the exception in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, but no longer qualifies for the exception because it had assets of $1 billion or more for two consecutive calendar year ends, the member bank must escrow premiums and fees for flood insurance pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section for any designated loan made, increased, extended, or renewed on or after July 1 of the first calendar year of changed status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Option to escrow. (i) In general. A member bank, or a servicer acting on

its behalf, shall offer and make available to the borrower the option to escrow all premiums and fees for any flood insurance required under paragraph (c) of this section for any loan secured by residential improved real estate or a mobile home that is outstanding on January 1, 2016, or July 1 of the first calendar year in which the member bank has had a change in status pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The loan or the member bank qualifies for an exception from the escrow requirement under paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) or (e)(3) of this section, respectively;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The borrower is already escrowing all premiums and fees for flood insurance for the loan; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The member bank is required to escrow flood insurance premiums and fees pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Notice. For any loan subject to paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, the member bank, or a servicer acting on its behalf, shall mail or deliver to the borrower no later than June 30, 2016, or September 30 of the first calendar year in which the member bank has had a change in status pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, a notice in writing, or if the borrower agrees, electronically, informing the borrower of the option to escrow all premiums and fees for any required flood insurance and the method(s) by which the borrower may request the escrow, using language similar to the model clause in appendix B to this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Timing. The member bank or servicer must begin escrowing premiums and fees for flood insurance as soon as reasonably practicable after the member bank or servicer receives the borrower's request to escrow.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Required use of standard flood hazard determination form--(1) Use of form. A state member bank shall use the standard flood hazard determination form developed by the Administrator of FEMA when determining whether the building or mobile home offered as collateral security for a loan is or will be located in a special flood hazard area in which flood insurance is available under the Act. The standard flood hazard determination form may be used in a printed, computerized, or electronic manner. A state member bank may obtain the standard flood hazard determination form from FEMA's Web site at www.fema.gov.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Retention of form. A state member bank shall retain a copy of the completed standard flood hazard determination form, in either hard copy or electronic form, for the period of time the state member bank owns the loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Force placement of flood insurance--(1) Notice and purchase of coverage. If a member bank, or a servicer acting on behalf of the bank, determines at any time during the term of a designated loan, that the building or mobile home and any personal property securing the designated loan is not covered by flood insurance or is covered by flood insurance in an amount less than the amount required under paragraph (c) of this section, then the member bank or its servicer shall notify the borrower that the borrower should obtain flood insurance, at the borrower's expense, in an amount at least equal to the amount required under paragraph (c) of this section, for the remaining term of the loan. If the borrower fails to obtain flood insurance within 45 days after notification, then the member bank or its servicer shall purchase insurance on the borrower's behalf. The member bank or its servicer may charge the borrower for the cost of premiums and fees incurred in purchasing the insurance, including premiums or fees incurred for coverage beginning on the date on which flood insurance coverage lapsed or did not provide a sufficient coverage amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Termination of force-placed insurance--(i) Termination and refund. Within 30 days of receipt by a member bank, or a servicer acting on its behalf, of a confirmation of a borrower's existing flood insurance coverage, the member bank or its servicer shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Notify the insurance provider to terminate any insurance purchased by the member bank or its servicer under paragraph (g)(1) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Refund to the borrower all premiums paid by the borrower for any insurance purchased by the member bank or its servicer under paragraph (g)(1) of this section during any period during which the borrower's flood insurance

coverage and the insurance coverage purchased by the member bank or its servicer were each in effect, and any related fees charged to the borrower with respect to the insurance purchased by the member bank or its servicer during such period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Sufficiency of demonstration. For purposes of confirming a borrower's existing flood insurance coverage under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, a member bank or its servicer shall accept from the borrower an insurance policy declarations page that includes the existing flood insurance policy number and the identity of, and contact information for, the insurance company or agent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Determination fees.--(1) General. Notwithstanding any Federal or State law other than the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4001-4129), any member bank, or a servicer acting on behalf of the bank, may charge a reasonable fee for determining whether the building or mobile home securing the loan is located or will be located in a special flood hazard area. A determination fee may also include, but is not limited to, a fee for life-of-loan monitoring.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Borrower fee. The determination fee authorized by paragraph (h)(1) of this section may be charged to the borrower if the determination:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is made in connection with a making, increasing, extending, or renewing of the loan that is initiated by the borrower;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reflects the Administrator of FEMA's revision or updating of flood plain areas or flood-risk zones;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Reflects the Administrator of FEMA's publication of a notice or compendium that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Affects the area in which the building or mobile home securing the loan is located; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> By determination of the Administrator of FEMA, may reasonably require a determination whether the building or mobile home securing the loan is located in a special flood hazard area; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Results in the purchase of flood insurance coverage by the lender or its servicer on behalf of the borrower under paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Purchaser or transferee fee. The determination fee authorized by paragraph (h)(1) of this section may be charged to the purchaser or transferee of a loan in the case of the sale or transfer of the loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Notice of special flood hazards and availability of Federal disaster relief assistance. When a member bank makes, increases, extends, or renews a loan secured by a building or a mobile home located or to be located in a special flood hazard area, the bank shall mail or deliver a written notice to the borrower and to the servicer in all cases whether or not flood insurance is available under the Act for the collateral securing the loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contents of notice. The written notice must include the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A warning, in a form approved by the Administrator of FEMA, that the building or the mobile home is or will be located in a special flood hazard area;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A description of the flood insurance purchase requirements set forth in section 102(b) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4012a(b));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A statement, where applicable, that flood insurance coverage is available from private insurance companies that issue standard flood insurance policies on behalf of the NFIP or directly from the NFIP;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A statement that flood insurance that provides the same level of coverage as a standard flood insurance policy under the NFIP also may be available from a private insurance company that issues policies on behalf of the company;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A statement that the borrower is encouraged to compare the flood insurance coverage, deductibles, exclusions, conditions, and premiums associated with flood insurance policies issued on behalf of the NFIP and policies issued on behalf of private insurance companies and that the borrower should direct inquiries regarding the availability, cost, and comparisons of flood insurance coverage to an insurance agent; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> A statement whether Federal disaster relief assistance may be available in the event of damage to the building

or mobile home caused by flooding in a Federally declared disaster.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Timing of notice. The member bank shall provide the notice required by paragraph (i)(1) of this section to the borrower within a reasonable time before the completion of the transaction, and to the servicer as promptly as practicable after the bank provides notice to the borrower and in any event no later than the time the bank provides other similar notices to the servicer concerning hazard insurance and taxes. Notice to the servicer may be made electronically or may take the form of a copy of the notice to the borrower.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Record of receipt. The member bank shall retain a record of the receipt of the notices by the borrower and the servicer for the period of time the bank owns the loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Alternate method of notice. Instead of providing the notice to the borrower required by paragraph (i)(1) of this section, a member bank may obtain satisfactory written assurance from a seller or lessor that, within a reasonable time before the completion of the sale or lease transaction, the seller or lessor has provided such notice to the purchaser or lessee. The member bank shall retain a record of the written assurance from the seller or lessor for the period of time the bank owns the loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Use of sample form of notice. A member bank will be considered to be in compliance with the requirement for notice to the borrower of this paragraph (i) of this section by providing written notice to the borrower containing the language presented in appendix A of this section within a reasonable time before the completion of the transaction. The notice presented in appendix A of this section satisfies the borrower notice requirements of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Notice of servicer's identity--(1) Notice requirement. When a member bank makes, increases, extends, renews, sells, or transfers a loan secured by a building or mobile home located or to be located in a special flood hazard area, the bank shall notify the Administrator of FEMA (or the Administrator's designee) in writing of the identity of the servicer of the loan. The Administrator of FEMA has designated the insurance provider to receive the member bank's notice of the servicer's identity. This notice may be provided electronically if electronic transmission is satisfactory to the Administrator of FEMA's designee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transfer of servicing rights. The member bank shall notify the Administrator of FEMA (or the Administrator's designee) of any change in the servicer of a loan described in paragraph (j)(1) of this section within 60 days after the effective date of the change. This notice may be provided electronically if electronic transmission is satisfactory to the Administrator of FEMA's designee. Upon any change in the servicing of a loan described in paragraph (j)(1) of this section, the duty to provide notice under this paragraph (j)(2) of this section shall transfer to the transferee servicer.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix A to Sec. 208.25--Sample Form of Notice of Special Flood</p><p class="depth0">Hazards and Availability of Federal Disaster Relief Assistance</p><p class="depth0">Notice of Special Flood Hazards and Availability of Federal Disaster</p><p class="depth0">Relief Assistance</p><p class="depth0">We are giving you this notice to inform you that:</p><p class="depth0">The building or mobile home securing the loan for which you have applied is or will be located in an area with special flood hazards.</p><p class="depth0">The area has been identified by the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as a special flood hazard area using FEMA's Flood Insurance Rate Map or the Flood Hazard Boundary Map for the following community: ------. This area has a one percent (1%) chance of a flood equal to or exceeding the base flood elevation (a 100-year flood) in any given year. During the life of a 30-year mortgage loan, the risk of a 100-year flood in a special flood hazard area is 26 percent (26%).</p><p class="depth0">Federal law allows a lender and borrower jointly to request the Administrator of FEMA to review the determination of whether the property securing the loan is located in a special flood hazard area. If you would like to make such a request, please contact us for further information.</p><p class="depth0">---- The community in which the property securing the loan is located participates in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Federal law will not allow us to make you the loan that you have applied for if you do not purchase flood insurance. The flood insurance must be maintained for the

life of the loan. If you fail to purchase or renew flood insurance on the property, Federal law authorizes and requires us to purchase the flood insurance for you at your expense.</p><p class="depth0">At a minimum, flood insurance purchased must cover the lesser of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> the outstanding principal balance of the loan; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> the maximum amount of coverage allowed for the type of property under the NFIP.</p><p class="depth0">Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP is limited to the building or mobile home and any personal property that secures your loan and not the land itself.</p><p class="depth0">Federal disaster relief assistance (usually in the form of a low-interest loan) may be available for damages incurred in excess of your flood insurance if your community's participation in the NFIP is in accordance with NFIP requirements.</p><p class="depth0">Although you may not be required to maintain flood insurance on all structures, you may still wish to do so, and your mortgage lender may still require you to do so to protect the collateral securing the mortgage. If you choose not to maintain flood insurance on a structure and it floods, you are responsible for all flood losses relating to that structure.</p><p class="depth0">Availability of Private Flood Insurance Coverage</p><p class="depth0">Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP may be purchased through an insurance agent who will obtain the policy either directly through the NFIP or through an insurance company that participates in the NFIP. Flood insurance that provides the same level of coverage as a standard flood insurance policy under the NFIP may be available from private insurers that do not participate in the NFIP. You should compare the flood insurance coverage, deductibles, exclusions, conditions, and premiums associated with flood insurance policies issued on behalf of the NFIP and policies issued on behalf of private insurance companies and contact an insurance agent as to the availability, cost, and comparisons of flood insurance coverage.</p><p class="depth0">[Escrow Requirement for Residential Loans</p><p class="depth0">Federal law may require a lender or its servicer to escrow all premiums and fees for flood insurance that covers any residential building or mobile home securing a loan that is located in an area with special flood hazards. If your lender notifies you that an escrow account is required for your loan, then you must pay your flood insurance premiums and fees to the lender or its servicer with the same frequency as you make loan payments for the duration of your loan. These premiums and fees will be deposited in the escrow account, which will be used to pay the flood insurance provider.]</p><p class="depth0">---- Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP is not available for the property securing the loan because the community in which the property is located does not participate in the NFIP. In addition, if the non-participating community has been identified for at least one year as containing a special flood hazard area, properties located in the community will not be eligible for Federal disaster relief assistance in the event of a Federally declared flood disaster.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix B to Sec. 208.25--Sample Clause for Option to Escrow for</p><p class="depth0">Outstanding Loans</p><p class="depth0">Escrow Option Clause</p><p class="depth0">You have the option to escrow all premiums and fees for the payment on your flood insurance policy that covers any residential building or mobile home that is located in an area with special flood hazards and that secures your loan.
