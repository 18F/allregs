This escrow account will be subject to escrow requirements adopted pursuant to section 10 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (12 U.S.C. 2609) (RESPA), which generally limits the amount that may be maintained in escrow accounts for certain types of loans and requires escrow account statements for those accounts, only if the loan is otherwise subject to RESPA.

If the borrower fails to obtain flood insurance within 45 days after notification, then the member bank or its servicer shall purchase insurance on the borrower's behalf.

Notwithstanding any Federal or State law other than the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4001-4129), any member bank, or a servicer acting on behalf of the bank, may charge a reasonable fee for determining whether the building or mobile home securing the loan is located or will be located in a special flood hazard area. A determination fee may also include, but is not limited to, a fee for life-of-loan monitoring.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Borrower fee. The determination fee authorized by paragraph (h)(1) of this section may be charged to the borrower if the determination:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is made in connection with a making, increasing, extending, or renewing of the loan that is initiated by the borrower;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reflects the Director of FEMA's revision or updating of flood plain areas or flood-risk zones;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Reflects the Director of FEMA's publication of a notice or compendium that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Affects the area in which the building or mobile home securing the loan is located; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> By determination of the Director of FEMA, may reasonably require a determination whether the building or mobile home securing the loan is located in a special flood hazard area;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Results in the purchase of flood insurance coverage by the lender or its servicer on behalf of the borrower under paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Purchaser or transferee fee.

The member bank shall retain a record of the written assurance from the seller or lessor for the period of time the bank owns the loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Use of prescribed form of notice. A member bank will be considered to be in compliance with the requirement for notice to the borrower of this paragraph (i) by providing written notice to the borrower containing the language presented in appendix A of this section within a reasonable time before the completion of the transaction. The notice presented in appendix A of this section satisfies the borrower notice requirements of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Notice of servicer's identity--(1) Notice requirement. When a member bank makes, increases, extends, renews, sells, or transfers a loan secured by a building or mobile home located or to be located in a special flood hazard area, the bank shall notify the Director of FEMA (or the Director's designee) in writing of the identity of the servicer of the loan.

This area has a one percent (1%) chance of a flood equal to or exceeding the base flood elevation (a 100-year flood) in any given year. During the life of a 30-year mortgage loan, the risk of a 100-year flood in a special flood hazard area is 26 percent (26%).</p><p class="depth0">Federal law allows a lender and borrower jointly to request the Director of FEMA to review the determination of whether the property securing the loan is located in a special flood hazard area. If you would like to make such a request, please contact us for further information.</p><p class="depth0">------ The community in which the property securing the loan is located participates in the National Flood Insurance Program

(NFIP). Federal law will not allow us to make you the loan that you have applied for if you do not purchase flood insurance. The flood insurance must be maintained for the life of the loan. If you fail to purchase or renew flood insurance on the property, Federal law authorizes and requires us to purchase the flood insurance for you at your expense.</p><p class="depth0">Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP may be purchased through an insurance agent who will obtain the policy either directly through the NFIP or through an insurance company that participates in the NFIP. Flood insurance also may be available from private insurers that do not participate in the NFIP.</p><p class="depth0">At a minimum, flood insurance purchased must cover the lesser of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> the outstanding principal balance of the loan; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> the maximum amount of coverage allowed for the type of property under the NFIP.</p><p class="depth0">Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP is limited to the overall value of the property securing the loan minus the value of the land on which the property is located.</p><p class="depth0">Federal disaster relief assistance (usually in the form of a low-interest loan) may be available for damages incurred in excess of your flood insurance if your community's participation in the NFIP is in accordance with NFIP requirements.</p><p class="depth0">------Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP is not available for the property securing the loan because the community in which the property is located does not participate in the NFIP. In addition, if the non-participating community has been identified for at least one year as containing a special flood hazard area, properties located in the community will not be eligible for Federal disaster relief assistance in the event of a Federally declared flood disaster.
