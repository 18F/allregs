                                Sec. 211.6  Processing, repackaging, and labeling commodities.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Commercial processing and repackaging. Cooperating sponsors or their designees may arrange for processing commodities into different end products and for packaging or repackaging commodities prior to distribution. Commodities may be bartered, or monetized proceeds or program income may be used, to offset such costs if provided for in the Operational Plan or TA or approved by USAID or the Diplomatic Post. When commercial facilities are used for processing, packaging or repackaging, cooperating sponsors or their designees shall enter into written agreements for such services and copies of the agreements must be provided to USAID or the Diplomatic Post. Except as AID/W otherwise agrees, the executed agreements shall provide as a minimum that the party providing such services shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fully account to the cooperating sponsor for all commodities delivered to the processor's possession and shall maintain adequate records and submit periodic reports pertaining to the performance of the agreement;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be liable for the value of all commodities not accounted for as provided in Sec. 211.9(e);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Return or dispose of the containers in which the commodity is received from the cooperating sponsor according to instructions from the cooperating sponsor; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Plainly label carton, sacks, or other containers containing the end product in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Use of cooperating sponsor facilities. When cooperating sponsors utilize their own facilities to process, package, or repackage commodities into different end products, and when such products are distributed for consumption off the premises of the cooperating sponsor, the cooperating sponsor shall plainly label the containers as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, and banners, posters, or similar media which shall contain information similar to that prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, shall be displayed at the distribution center. Recipients' individual identification cards shall to the maximum extent practicable be imprinted to contain such information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Labeling. If, prior to distribution, the cooperating sponsor arranges for packaging or repackaging donated commodities, the cartons, sacks, or other containers in which the commodities are packed shall be plainly labeled with the A.I.D. emblem, and insofar as practicable, with the following information in the language of the country in which the commodities are to be distributed:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Name of commodity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provided through the friendship of the American people as food for peace; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Not to be sold or exchanged (where applicable).
Emblems or other identification of nongovernmental cooperating sponsors also may be added.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where commodity containers are not used. When the usual practice in a country is not to enclose the end product in a container, wrapper, sack, etc., the cooperating sponsor shall, to the extent practicable, display banners, posters, or other media, and imprint on individual recipient identification cards information similar to that prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.</p>
