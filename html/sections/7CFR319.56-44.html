                                Sec. 319.56-44  Untreated grapefruit, sweet oranges, and tangerines
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Untreated grapefruit (Citrus paradisi), sweet oranges (Citrus  sinensis), and tangerines (Citrus reticulata) may be imported into the  United States from Mexico for extracting juice if they originate from  production sites in Mexico that are approved by APHIS because they meet  the following conditions and any other conditions determined by the  Administrator to be necessary to mitigate the pest risk that such fruits  pose and in accordance with all other applicable provisions of this  subpart:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application of sterile insect technique. Production sites, and a  surrounding 1.5 mile buffer area, must be administered under an APHIS- approved preventative release program using sterile insect technique for  the Mexican fruit fly (Anastrepha ludens).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Fruit fly trapping protocol. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Trapping densities. In areas  where grapefruit, sweet oranges, and tangerines are produced for export  to the United States, APHIS approved traps and lures must be placed in  production sites and a surrounding 1.5 mile buffer areas as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For Mexican fruit fly (Anastrepha ludens) and sapote fruit fly  (A. serpentina): One trap per 50 hectares.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata): One to four  traps per 250 hectares.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fruit fly catches. Upon trapping of a Mexican fruit fly, sapote  fruit fly, or Mediterranean fruit fly in a production site or buffer  area, exports from that production site are prohibited until the  Administrator determines that the phytosanitary measures taken have been  effective to allow the resumption of export from that production site.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Monitoring. The trapping program must be monitored under an  APHIS-approved quality control program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Safeguarding. Fruit must be safeguarded against fruit fly  infestation using methods approved by APHIS from the time of harvest  until processing in the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Phytosanitary certificate. Each consignment must be accompanied  by a phytosanitary certificate issued by Mexico's national plant  protection organization that contains additional declarations stating  that the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section  have been met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Ports. The harvested fruit may enter the United States only  through a port of entry located in one of the Texas counties listed in  Sec. 301.64-3(c) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Route of transit. Harvested fruit must travel on the most direct  route to the processing plant from its point of entry into the United  States as specified in the import permit. Such fruit may not enter or  transit areas other than the Texas counties listed in Sec. 301.64-3(c)  of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Approved destinations. Processing plants within the United  States must be located within an area in Texas that is under an APHIS- approved preventative release program using sterile insect technique for  Mexican fruit fly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Compliance agreements. Processing plants within the United  States must enter into a compliance agreement with APHIS in order to  handle grapefruit, sweet oranges, and tangerines imported from Mexico in  accordance with this section. APHIS will only enter into compliance  agreements with facilities that handle and process grapefruit, sweet  oranges, and tangerines from Mexico in such a way as to eliminate any  risk that exotic fruit   flies could be disseminated into the United States, as determined by  APHIS.
