                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rules. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unless the provisions of paragraphs (b) and  (c) of this section apply, hospitals are paid for hospital inpatient  operating costs and capital-related costs for each discharge based on  the submission of a discharge bill.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Payments for inpatient hospital services furnished by an  excluded psychiatric unit of a hospital (or by an excluded  rehabilitation unit of a hospital for cost reporting periods beginning  before January 1, 2002) are made as described in Sec. Sec. 413.64(a),  (c), (d), and (e) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1,  2005, payments for inpatient hospital services furnished by an inpatient  psychiatric facility that meets the conditions of Sec. 412.404 are made  as described in Sec. 412.432.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1,  2002, payments for inpatient hospital services furnished by a  rehabilitation hospital or a rehabilitation unit that meets the  conditions of Sec. 412.604 are made as described in Sec. 412.632.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1,  2002, payments for inpatient hospital services furnished by a long-term  care hospital that meets the conditions for payment of Sec. Sec.  412.505 through 412.511 are made as described in Sec. 412.521.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Periodic interim payments--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Criteria for receiving periodic  interim payments. Effective with claims received on or after July 1,  1987, a hospital that meets the criteria in Sec. 413.64(h) of this  chapter may request in writing to receive periodic interim payments as  described in this paragraph. A hospital that is receiving periodic  interim payments also receives payment on this basis for inpatient  hospital services   furnished by its excluded psychiatric or rehabilitation unit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Failure of intermediary to make prompt payment. Beginning with  claims received in April 1987, the hospital's fiscal intermediary does  not meet the requirements of section 1816(c)(2) of the Act, which  provides for prompt payment of claims under Medicare Part A, for three  consecutive calendar months. The hospital may continue to receive  periodic interim payments until the intermediary meets the requirements  of section 1816 (c)(2) of the Act for three consecutive calendar months.  For purposes of this paragraph, a hospital that is receiving periodic  interim payments as of June 30, 1987 and meets the requirements of Sec.  413.64(h) of this chapter may continue to receive payment on this basis  until the hospital's intermediary meets the requirements of section  1816(c)(2) of the Act for three consecutive calendar months beginning  with April 1987.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income  patients. The hospital is receiving periodic interim payments as of June  30, 1987 and has a disproportionate share payment adjustment factor of  at least 5.1 percent as determined under Sec. 412.106(c) for purposes  of establishing the average standardized amounts for discharges  occurring on or after October 1, 1986 and before October 1, 1987. The  hospital's request must be made by a date prior to July 1, 1987,  specified by the intermediary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Small rural hospitals. The hospital is receiving periodic  interim payments as of June 30, 1987, makes its request by a date prior  to July 1, 1987, specified by the intermediary, and, on July 1, 1987,  the hospital--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Is located in a rural area as defined in Sec. 412.62(f); and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Has 100 or fewer beds available for use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Frequency of payment. The intermediary estimates a hospital's  prospective payments as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section  and makes biweekly payments equal to \1/26\ of the total estimated  amount of payment for the year. Each payment is made two weeks after the  end of a biweekly period of service, as described in Sec. 413.64(h)(5)  of this chapter. These payments are subject to final settlement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Amount of payment. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The biweekly interim payment amount is  based on the total estimated Medicare discharges for the reporting  period multiplied by the hospital's estimated average prospective  payment amount as described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this paragraph.  These interim payments are reviewed at least twice during the reporting  period and adjusted if necessary. Fewer reviews may be necessary if a  hospital receives interim payments for less than a full reporting  period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of determining periodic interim payments under  this paragraph, a hospital's estimated average prospective payment  amount is computed as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If a hospital has no payment experience under the prospective  payment system for operating costs, the intermediary computes the  hospital's estimated average prospective payment amount for operating  costs by multiplying its payment rates as determined under Sec.  412.70(c), but without adjustment by a DRG weighting factor, by the  hospital's case-mix index, and subtracting from this amount estimated  deductibles and coinsurance.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Effective for cost-reporting periods beginning on or after  October 1, 1991, the intermediary computes a hospital's estimated  average prospective payment amount for capital-related costs by  multiplying its prospective payment rate as determined under Sec.  412.340 or Sec. 412.344(a), as applicable, and under Sec. 412.308 for  cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2001 but without  adjustment by a DRG weighting factor, by the hospital's case-mix index.  The intermediary may take into account estimated additional payments per  discharge under Sec. 412.348. If the hospital is paid under Sec.  412.344(a)(1), the intermediary includes an estimated payment for old  capital costs per discharge.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> If a hospital has payment experience under the prospective  payment system for operating costs, and, for cost reporting periods  beginning on or after October 1, 1991, for inpatient capital-related  costs, the intermediary   computes a hospital's estimated average prospective payment amount for  operating costs and capital-related costs based on that payment  experience, adjusted for projected changes, and subtracts from this  amount estimated deductibles and coinsurance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Termination of periodic interim payments--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Request by the  hospital. A hospital receiving periodic interim payments may convert to  payments on a per discharge basis at any time.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Removal by the intermediary. An intermediary terminates  periodic interim payments if--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A hospital no longer meets the requirements of Sec. 413.64(h);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A hospital is receiving payment under the criterion in paragraph  (b)(1)(i) of this section and the intemediary meets the prompt payment  requirements of section 1816(c)(2) of the Act for three consecutive  calendar months; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A hospital that is receiving payment under the criterion set  forth in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section no longer meets the  criterion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> of this section,  subject to the requirements in Sec. 413.64(h) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special interim payments for certain costs. For capital-related  costs for cost-reporting periods beginning before October 1, 1991 and  the direct costs of medical education, which are not included in  prospective payments but are reimbursed as specified in Sec. Sec.  413.130 and 413.85 of this chapter, respectively, interim payments are  made subject to final cost settlement. Interim payments for capital- related items for cost-reporting periods beginning before October 1,  1991 and the estimated cost of approved medical education programs  (applicable to inpatient costs payable under Medicare Part A and for  kidney acquisition costs in hospitals approved as renal transplantation  centers) are determined by estimating the reimbursable amount for the  year based on the previous year's experience and on substantiated  information for the current year and divided into 26 equal biweekly  payments. Each payment is made two weeks after the end of a biweekly  period of services, as described in Sec. 413.64(h)(5) of this chapter.  The interim payments are reviewed by the intermediary at least twice  during the reporting period and adjusted if necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Special interim payment for unusually long lengths of stay--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  First interim payment. A hospital that is not receiving periodic interim  payments under paragraph (b) of this section may request an interim  payment after a Medicare beneficiary has been in the hospital at least  60 days. Payment for the interim bill is determined as if the bill were  a final discharge bill and includes any outlier payment determined as of  the last day for which services have been billed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Additional interim payments. A hospital may request additional  interim payments at intervals of at least 60 days after the date of the  first interim bill submitted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.  Payment for these additional interim bills, as well as the final bill,  is determined as if the bill were the final bill with appropriate  adjustments made to the payment amount to reflect any previous interim  payment made under the provisions of this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Outlier payment and additional payments for new medical services  and technologies. Payments for outlier cases and additional payments for  new medical services and technologies (described in subpart F of this  part) are not made on an interim basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Accelerated payments--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Upon request, an  accelerated payment may be made to a hospital that is   not receiving periodic interim payments under paragraph (b) of this  section if the hospital is experiencing financial difficulties because  of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> There is a delay by the intermediary in making payment to the  hospital.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Due to an exceptional situation, there is a temporary delay in  the hospital's preparation and submittal of bills to the intermediary  beyond its normal billing cycle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Approval of payment. A hospital's request for an accelerated  payment must be approved by the intermediary and CMS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Amount of payment. The amount of the accelerated payment is  computed as a percentage of the net payment for unbilled or unpaid  covered services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Recovery of payment. Recovery of the accelerated payment is made  by recoupment as hospital bills are processed or by direct payment by  the hospital.
