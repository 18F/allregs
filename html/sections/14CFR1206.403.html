                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In ``unusual circumstances'' as defined in this section, the time limits for an initial determination and for a final determination may be extended, but not to exceed a total of 10 working days in the aggregate in the processing of any specific request for an Agency record. The extension must be taken before the expiration of the 20 working day time limits. The requester will be notified in writing of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The unusual circumstances surrounding the extension of the time limit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The date by which the FOIA office expects to complete the processing of the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unusual circumstances are defined as:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The need to search for and collect the requested records from offices other than the office processing the request;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous number of documents;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The need to coordinate and/or consult with another NASA office or agency having a substantial subject-matter interest in the determination of the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If initial processing time will exceed or is expected to exceed 30 working days, the FOIA office will notify the requester of the delay in processing and:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provide an opportunity to modify or limit the scope of the request to reduce processing time; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide appeal rights, since the FOIA office has exceeded the 30 working day time period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Shall make available its designated FOIA contact and its FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The requester's refusal to reasonably modify the scope of a request or arrange an alternative timeframe for processing a request after being given the opportunity to do so may be considered a factor when determining whether exceptional circumstances exist. A delay that results from a predictable workload of requests does not constitute exceptional circumstances unless the Agency demonstrates reasonable progress in reducing its backlog of pending requests.</p>
