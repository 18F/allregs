                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 7425(b) contains provisions with respect to  the effect on the interest of the United States in property in which the  United States has or claims a lien, or a title derived from the  enforcement of a lien, of a sale made pursuant to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An instrument creating a lien on the property sold,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A confession of judgment on the obligation secured by an  instrument creating a lien on the property sold, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A statutory lien on the property sold.   For purposes of this section, such a sale is referred to as a  ``nonjudicial   sale.'' The term ``nonjudicial sale'' includes, but is not limited to,  the divestment of the taxpayer's interest in property which occurs by  operation of law, by public or private sale, by forfeiture, or by  termination under provisions contained in a contract for a deed or a  conditional sales contract. Under section 7425(b)(1), if a notice of  lien is filed in accordance with section 6323 (f) or (g), or the title  derived from the enforcement of a lien is recorded as provided by local  law, more than 30 days before the date of sale, and the appropriate  district director is not given notice of the sale (in the manner  prescribed in Sec. 301.7425-3), the sale shall be made subject to and  without disturbing the lien or title of the United States. Under section  7425(b)(2)(C), in any case in which notice of the sale is given to the  district director not less than 25 days prior to the date of sale (in  the manner prescribed in section 7425(c)(1)), the sale shall have the  same effect with respect to the discharge or divestment of the lien or  title as may be provided by local law with respect to other junior liens  or other titles derived from the enforcement of junior liens. A  nonjudicial sale pursuant to a lien which is junior to a tax lien does  not divest the tax lien, even though notice of the nonjudicial sale is  given to the appropriate district director. However, under the  provisions of section 6325(b) and Sec. 301.6325-1, a district director  may discharge the property from a tax lien, including a tax lien which  is senior to another lien upon the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em>, in order to compute any period of time  determined with reference to the date of sale, the date of sale shall be  determined in accordance with the following rules:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the case of divestment of junior liens on property resulting  directly from a public sale, the date of sale is deemed to be the date  the public sale is held, regardless of the date under local law on which  junior liens on the property are divested or the title to the property  is transferred,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of divestment of junior liens on property resulting  directly from a private sale, the date of sale is deemed to be the date  title to the property is transferred, regardless of the date junior  liens on the property are divested under local law, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In the case of divestment of junior liens on property not  resulting directly from a public or private sale, the date of sale is  deemed to be the date on which junior liens on the property are divested  under local law.  For provisions relating to the right of redemption of the United States,  see section 7425(d) and Sec. 301.7425-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Under the law of State M, upon entry of judgment, the  judgment creditor obtains a statutory lien upon the real property of the  judgment debtor, and certain procedures are provided by which the  judgment creditor may execute by public sale upon such real property.  These procedures provide, among other things, for notification by  personal service or registered or certified mail to other lien  creditors, if any, and publication of a notice of the sale in a local  newspaper. After the expiration of a prescribed period of time after  such notification and publication, the sheriff of the county where the  real property is located may sell the property at public sale. After  payment of the amount bid at the public sale, the sheriff issues to the  purchaser a deed to the real property, and the interests of junior  lienors in the property are divested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of this section, such an execution sale is a  nonjudicial sale described in section 7425(b) because the sale is made  pursuant to a statutory lien on the property sold. The date of sale, for  purposes of computing a period of time determined with reference to the  date of sale, is the date on which the public sale is held because  junior liens on the real property are divested directly as a result of  the public sale. This result obtains even though the junior liens are  legally divested on a later date when the sheriff issues the deed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Under the law of State N, mortgages on real property  may contain a power of sale which authorizes the mortgagee, upon breach  by the mortgagor of one of the conditions of the mortgage, to have the  mortgaged property sold at public sale. This public sale must be  preceded by notice by advertisement in a local newspaper, and the time,  place, description of the property, and other terms of the sale must be  specified. The purchaser at such a public sale obtains a title to the  real property which is not subject to a right of redemption by the  mortgagor and which divests the interests of the junior lienors in the  property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of this section, a sale pursuant to such a power  of sale is a nonjudicial sale described in section 7425(b) because the  sale is made pursuant to the mortgage instrument which created a lien on  the property sold. The date of the sale, for purposes of computing a  period of time determined with reference to the date of sale, is the  date of the public sale because junior liens on the property are  divested directly as a result of the public sale.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example 2 except that the  purchaser at the public sale obtains a title which is defeasible by the  exercise of a right of redemption in the mortgagor. The purchaser's  title divests the interests of junior lienors in the property as of the  time of public sale. The interests of junior leinors in the property  revive if the mortgagor exercises his right of redemption. The date of  the sale, for purposes of computing a period of time determined with  reference to the date of sale, is the date of the public sale because  junior liens on the property are divested directly as a result of the  public sale although such junior liens may be revived by a subsequent  redemption by the mortgagor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Under the law of State O, upon breach by a mortgagor  of real property of one of the conditions of the mortgage, the mortgagee  may foreclose the mortgage by securing possession of the property by one  of several procedures provided by statute. These procedures are  generally referred to as ``strict foreclosure.'' In order for a  foreclosure to be effective under these procedures, a certificate  attesting the fact of entry must be recorded with the proper registrar  of deeds within 30 days after the mortgagee enters the property. During  the one-year period following the date on which the certificate of entry  is recorded, the mortgagor or a junior lienor may redeem the property by  paying the mortgagee the amount of the mortgage obligation. If, during  such one-year period the property is not redeemed and the mortgagee's  possession is continued, the interests of the mortgagor and the junior  lienors in the property are divested as of the date such one-year period  expires.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of this section, such a foreclosure procedure is a  nonjudicial sale described in section 7425(b) because it results in the  divestment of the mortgagor's interest in the property by operation of  law pursuant to the mortgage which created a lien on the property. In  addition, because there is no public or private sale which directly  results in the divestment of junior liens on the property, the date of  sale, for purposes of computing a period of time determined with  reference to the date of sale, is the date on which the one-year period  following the recording of the certificate of entry expires.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. The law of State P contains a procedure which permits a  county to collect a delinquent tax assessment with respect to real  property by the means of a tax sale of the property. First, a notice of  a public auction with respect to the tax assessment on the real property  is published in a local newspaper. At the public auction, the purchaser,  upon payment of the delinquent taxes and interest, obtains from the  county tax collector a tax certificate with respect to the real  property. Because the obtaining of this tax certificate does not  directly result in the divestment of either the owner's title or junior  liens with respect to the property, the public auction is not a  nonjudicial sale described in section 7425(b). At any time before a tax  deed with respect to the property is issued by the clerk of the county  court, the owner or any holder of a lien or other interest with respect  to the property may obtain the tax certificate by paying the holder of  the tax certificate the amount of the taxes, interest, and costs. After  a date which is two years after the date on which the tax assessment  became delinquent, the holder of the tax certificate may request the  clerk of the county court to have the property advertised for sale.  After advertisement of the sale, the clerk of the county court conducts  a public sale of the real property and the purchaser obtains a tax deed.  The interests of all junior lienors in the property are divested and the  property is not subject to a right of redemption under the law of State  P. For purposes of this section, this public sale is considered to be a  nonjudicial sale described in section 7425(b) because the sale is made  pursuant to a statutory lien on the property sold. The date of the sale,  for purposes of computing a period of time determined with reference to  the date of sale, is the date on which the public sale is held at which  the purchaser obtains a tax deed as this sale directly results in the  divestment of junior liens on the property.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. The law of State Q contains a provision which permits a  county to collect a delinquent tax assessment with respect to real  property by the means of a tax sale of the property. After public notice  is given, a ``tax sale'' of the real property is conducted. Upon payment  of the delinquent taxes and interest, a purchaser obtains a tax  certificate with respect to the real property. If there is no purchaser  at the tax sale, the property is deemed to be bid in by the State.  Because the obtaining of this tax certificate by a purchaser or State Q  does not directly result in the divestment of either the owner's title  or junior liens with respect to the property, the tax sale is not a  nonjudicial sale described in section 7425(b). Following the tax sale,  there is a three-year period during which any person having an interest  in the property may redeem the property by paying the holder of the tax  certificate the   amount of taxes, interest, and costs. Unless, redeemed, the holder of  the tax certificate may obtain an absolute title at the expiration of  the period of redemption provided he serves a notice of the expiration  of the redemption period upon the owner at least 60 days prior to the  date of expiration. Because there is no public or private sale which  directly results in the divestment of junior liens on the property, the  date of sale, for purposes of computing a period of time determined with  reference to the date of sale, is the date on which the holder of the  tax certificate obtains absolute title.
