                            <p class="depth0">The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (called the Act in this subpart B), provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain administrative proceedings (called adversary adjudications) before the Commission. An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over the Commission, unless the Commission's position was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in this subpart describe the parties eligible for awards and the proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, and the procedures and standards that the Commission will use in ruling on those applications.
