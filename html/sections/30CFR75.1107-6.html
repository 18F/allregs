The fire suppression device may be of the  internal injection, inundating, or combination type. Where fire control  is achieved by internal injection, or combination of internal injection  and inundation, hazardous locations shall be enclosed to minimize runoff  and overshoot of the extinguishing agent and the extinguishing agent  shall be directed onto:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cable reel compartments and electrical cables on the equipment  which are subject to flexing or to external damage; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All hydraulic components on the equipment which are exposed  directly to or located in the immediate vicinity of electrical cables  which are subject to flexing or to damage.
