If you do not have a TTY  number, you must state how TTY users can reach your information and  reservation service (e.g., via a voice relay service).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If you are a foreign carrier, you must meet this requirement by  May 13, 2010.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The requirements of paragraph (a) do not apply to you in any  country in which the telecommunications infrastructure does not readily  permit compliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> through (4) of this section. Only Web sites that market air  transportation to the general public in the United States must be  accessible to individuals with disabilities. The following are among the  characteristics of a primary Web site that markets to the general public  in the U.S.: the content can be viewed in English, the site advertises  or sells flights operating to, from, or within the United States, and  the site displays fares in U.S. dollars.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Your primary Web site must conform to all Success Criteria and  all Conformance Requirements from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)  Recommendation 11 December 2008, Web site Content Accessibility  Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 for Level AA as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Web pages associated with obtaining the following core air  travel services and information that are offered on your primary Web  site are conformant by December 12, 2015:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Booking or changing a reservation, including all flight  amenities;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Checking in for a flight;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Accessing a personal travel itinerary;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Accessing the status of a flight;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Accessing a personal frequent flyer account;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Accessing flight schedules; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Accessing carrier contact information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All remaining Web pages on your primary Web site are conformant  by December 12, 2016.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Your primary Web site must be tested in consultation with  individuals with disabilities or members of disability organization(s)  who use or want to use carrier Web sites to research or book air  transportation in order to obtain their feedback on the Web site's  accessibility and usability before the dates specified in paragraph  (c)(1) of this section. Collectively, such individuals must be able to  provide feedback on the usability of the Web site by individuals with  visual, auditory, tactile, and cognitive disabilities. Consultation is  required to ensure that your Web site is usable by individuals with  disabilities by the date specified in paragraph (c)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You are permitted to use a Level AA conforming alternate version  only when conforming a public-facing Web   page to all WCAG 2.0 Level AA success criteria would constitute an undue  burden or fundamentally alter the information or functionality provided  by that page.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You must assist prospective passengers who indicate that they  are unable to use your Web site due to a disability and contact you  through other channels (e.g., by telephone or at the ticket counter) as  follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Disclose Web-based discount fares to the passenger if his or her  itinerary qualifies for the discounted fare.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provide Web-based amenities to the passenger, such as waiving  any fee applicable to making a reservation or purchasing a ticket using  a method other than your Web site (e.g., by telephone), unless the fee  applies to other customers purchasing the same fare online.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> As a carrier covered under paragraph (c) of this section, you  must provide a mechanism on your primary Web site for persons with  disabilities to request disability accommodation services for future  flights, including but not limited to wheelchair assistance, seating  accommodation, escort assistance for a visually impaired passenger, and  stowage of an assistive device no later than December 12, 2015. You may  require individuals who request accommodations using this mechanism to  provide contact information (e.g., name, daytime phone, evening phone,  and email address) for follow-up by your customer service department or  medical desk.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> As a carrier covered under paragraph (c) of this section, you  must provide a disclaimer activated when a user clicks a link on your  primary Web site to an external Web site or to third-party software  informing the user that the Web site or software may not follow the same  accessibility policies no later than December 12, 2016.
