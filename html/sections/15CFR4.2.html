These records may also be accessible at the FOIAonline Web site, http://foiaonline.regulations.gov. Each component of the Department is responsible for determining which of its records are required to be made available, as well as identifying additional records of interest to the public that are appropriate for disclosure, and for making those records available either in its own Electronic Library or in the Department's central Electronic FOIA Library. Components that maintain their own Electronic FOIA Library are designated as such in Appendix A to this part. Each component shall also maintain and make available electronically a current subject-matter index of the records made available electronically. Each component shall ensure that posted records and indices are updated regularly, at least quarterly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the requester does not have access to the Internet and wishes to obtain information regarding publicly available information, he or she may contact the component's FOIA office.

These components and their contact information are listed in Appendix A to this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Department and its components shall maintain and make available electronically for public inspection:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A current index providing information for the public as to any matter that is issued, adopted, or promulgated after July 4, 1997, and that is retained as a record and is required to be made available or published.
