                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Reportable event. A reportable event occurs for a plan when--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There is a distribution to a substantial owner of a contributing  sponsor of the plan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The total of all distributions made to the substantial owner  within the one-year period ending with the date of such distribution  exceeds $10,000;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The distribution is not made by reason of the substantial  owner's death; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Immediately after the distribution, the plan has nonforfeitable  benefits (as provided in Sec. 4022.5) that are not funded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>, the notice shall include--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name, address and telephone number of the substantial owner  receiving the distribution(s); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount, form, and date of each distribution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Waivers--(1) Distribution up to section 415 limit. Notice is  waived if the total of all distributions made to the substantial owner  within the one-year period ending with the date of the distribution does  not exceed the limitation (as of the date the reportable event occurs)  under section 415(b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(A)</em> of the Code (as adjusted in accordance with  section 415(d)) when expressed as an annual benefit in the form of a  straight life annuity to a participant beginning at Social Security  retirement age ($120,000 for calendar year 1996).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Plan funding. Notice is waived if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No variable rate premium. No variable rate premium is required  to be paid for the plan for the event year;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> No unfunded vested benefits. As of the testing date for the  event year, the plan would have no unfunded vested benefits if unfunded  vested benefits were determined in accordance with the assumptions and  methodology in Sec. 4010.4(b)(2) of this chapter; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> 80-percent funded. As of the testing date for the event year,  the fair market value of the plan's assets is at least 80 percent of the  plan's vested benefits amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Distribution up to one percent of assets. Notice is waived if  the sum of the values of all distributions that are made to the  substantial owner within the one-year period ending with the date of the  distribution is one percent or less of the end-of-year current value of  the plan's assets (as required to be reported on the plan's Form 5500)  for either of the two plan years immediately preceding the event year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Form 1 extension. The notice date is extended until 30 days  after the   plan's variable rate premium filing due date for the event year,  provided that a waiver under any of paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through  (c)(2)(iii) of this section would apply if ``the plan year preceding the  event year'' were substituted for ``the event year.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Determination rules--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Valuation of distribution. The value of  a distribution under this section is the sum of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The cash amounts actually received by the substantial owner;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The purchase price of any irrevocable commitment; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The fair market value of any other assets distributed,  determined as of the date of distribution to the substantial owner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Date of substantial owner distribution. The date of distribution  to a substantial owner of a cash distribution is the date it is received  by the substantial owner. The date of distribution to a substantial  owner of an irrevocable commitment is the date on which the obligation  to provide benefits passes from the plan to the insurer. The date of any  other distribution to a substantial owner is the date when the plan  relinquishes control over the assets transferred directly or indirectly  to the substantial owner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Determination date. The determination of whether a participant  is (or has been in the preceding 60 months) a substantial owner is made  on the date when there has been a distribution that would be reportable  under this section if made to a substantial owner.</p>
